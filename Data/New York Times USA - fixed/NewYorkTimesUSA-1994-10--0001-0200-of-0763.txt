HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Hockey's Owners Decide to Postpone Opening of Season

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
On what was scheduled to be the first day of the hockey season and next-to-last day of the baseball season, professional sports will rest today. Baseball is still shut down by a players' strike that today becomes the longest work stoppage in professional sports history, and yesterday the National Hockey League, against the wishes of its players, postponed the start of its season for at least two weeks.
Commissioner Gary Bettman of the N.H.L. announced yesterday that the season, scheduled to begin with 12 games tonight, would be delayed so the league and the players could continue negotiating a collective bargaining agreement. 
 Mr. Bettman said the league still hoped to play a full schedule of games, and targeted Oct. 15 as a new potential starting date. The commissioner denied that the league's action short-circuiting the new season constituted a lockout; he said he was simply postponing the start of the season.
But the head of the players' union, Bob Goodenow, said it was a "lockout, pure and simple." With the players ready to play and the owners not letting them, and the players not getting paid, the action has all the classic characteristics of a lockout.
This is the first time two major professional sports have been shut down at the same time. As if that trauma were not enough for fans in two countries, the National Basketball Association and its players do not have a new collective bargaining agreement, are waging their own dispute in the Federal court system and face a potential work-stopping confrontation when their season begins next month.
With only the National Football League operating, mainly on Sundays, following a labor dispute of its own that lasted six years, this promises to be an empty October for sports fans.
Innocent victims of a sports world consumed by fierce fights over player salaries, the fans won't see the World Series for the first time in 90 years, and they won't see the timely start of the hockey season only three and a half months after the New York Rangers' scintillating Stanley Cup championship climaxed what was probably the most successful season in N.H.L. history.
At a news conference at the New York Hilton, Mr. Bettman said: "I reject the notion that it is a lockout. It is a postponement because we could have our full season starting Oct. 15."
But the 75 games scheduled for tonight through Oct. 14 will not be played as scheduled, and the players will not begin earning their salaries tonight.
Further, players on four Canadian teams, those in the provinces of Ontario and Alberta, received lockout notices from their teams as is required under the provincial labor laws. However, the word "postponement" also appeared in the notices.
"It's an owners' lockout, pure and simple," Mr. Goodenow, the players' union leader, said in Toronto. Mr. Goodenow, however, said the players had agreed to continue negotiations. He said he would consult with union representatives today in Toronto before resuming the bargaining.
Mr. Bettman said the players were free to continue working out, but they said they would not.
"We're saying fine if the season is postponed, surely you can't expect us to come in and skate as if nothing happened," said Toronto's Mike Gartner, who is president of the players' association. "Something has happened. We've been locked out. That's a pretty serious thing to play under."
The action taken by Mr. Bettman and the owners of the league's 26 teams came in response to a union proposal made 24 hours earlier that the season proceed with a no-strike pledge from the players and a no-lockout pledge from the owners, while negotiations for a new labor agreement continued.
Mr. Bettman said the union's proposal was "particularly seductive." But he quickly explained that the league was deferring its decision on the idea because the owners are concerned "about the willingness of the players' association to negotiate."
In other words, the owners suspect that the players, who would be happy to play under the expired agreement, could plod along in the talks, and the two sides could reach the season's end without a new contract.
"Unless the players are prepared to negotiate a settlement," Mr. Bettman said, "simply agreeing to the no-strike pledge and playing for the year will only defer the inevitable and exacerbate the problem."
The commissioner, who in an impressive showing was supported by 28 owners and executives representing 20 teams, said the decision to open the season Oct. 15 would be based on the way talks proceed in the next two weeks. "We hope to be in a better position prior to Oct. 15, either to have a deal or know that there is substantial good-faith negotiations going on so that a deal is possible," Mr. Bettman said.
This is only the second work stoppage in N.H.L. history, but also the second in two-and-a-half years. The players struck for the first 10 days of April in 1992, though the missed games were made up.
The baseball strike, the eighth shutdown in that sport in 23 seasons, reached day No. 50 yesterday, matching the 50-day strike of 1981. Today it becomes the longest shutdown in professional sports history.
Mr. Bettman said yesterday the league planned to reschedule the missed 75 games throughout the remainder of the season and after the schedule is completed. Last season's playoffs ended June 14, and it's not likely that the league would want to stretch the post-season into July.
But Mr. Bettman also acknowledged that if the season doesn't start on Oct. 15, some games may be missed.
Because baseball has forsaken October, the N.H.L. had been expected to capitalize on the elimination of competing post-season games.
"We're very cognizant of a unique opportunity," Mr. Bettman said. "It's not just because baseball is not playing. It has to do with opportunities the sport has before it."
He referred to the increased interest in hockey, attested to by a five-year, $155 million television deal with the Fox network and soaring revenue from licensed merchandise. Mr. Bettman said the league's owners had to make "gut-wrenching decisions" after "these considerations were given a great deal of weight."
The Board of Governors, he said, concluded that "if this sport is to grow at all, it has to be on a solid foundation."
Although the owners talk of the need to create a revenue sharing pool for lower-revenue clubs -- which they say include 9 to 11 of the 26 franchises -- their primary concern is the escalation of player salaries. Mr. Bettman said salaries have tripled over the past four years, and over the past three years, "a collective profit has turned to a substantial collective loss."
To halt the escalation, the owners have proposed a tax system that would force teams to pay as much as a 20 percent tax on their payroll, depending on how far it goes beyond the league's average payroll. Under that system, the Rangers would have had to pay a levy of $3,965,000 on a payroll of $20,172,000 last season. That would have been the second highest levy in the league, behind Detroit's $4 million.
Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, St. Louis and Buffalo would also have been assessed steep taxes, and the union contends that the proposal is intended to force those six teams and perhaps others to reduce their payrolls, thus limiting the salaries their players can receive.
Addressing the owners' stated revenue-sharing concerns, the union has proposed a 5.5 percent tax on the payrolls and gate receipts of the 16 clubs with the highest revenues. That system, the union projects, would produce about $40 million to be shared by the low-revenue teams.
But the owners don't want to share gate receipts, and they say the tax rate would not place enough "drag" on salaries.
Several of the owners who accompanied Mr. Bettman at the news conference spoke of what they saw as the importance of creating a new economic system.

HEADLINE: Saudis and 5 Other Gulf Nations Will Ease Their Boycott of Israel

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to the New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia and its five Persian Gulf partners announced today that they were lifting parts of the 46-year-old Arab boycott of Israel and pledged to urge the rest of the Arab world to drop all trade restrictions involving the Jewish state.
Today's announcement reflects the dramatic changes in Arab attitudes toward Israel since the Palestinians made peace with it a year ago. It also is another concrete signal to the Israelis that making peace has its rewards. 
 In practical terms, the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council will formally end the blacklisting of American and other foreign companies that trade with Israel. Even though a number of Arab countries have increasingly ignored the blacklist in the last year, some Western companies for either legal or psychological reasons have been reluctant to move ahead with investment and trade projects.
The move by the gulf nations does not affect the ban on Arab countries against trading directly with Israel.
However, the six gulf countries are expected to make other smaller but symbolically important gestures soon, senior Administration officials said. These include permitting tourists and business executives to enter their countries using passports that reflect travel to Israel, overflights by foreign airlines landing in Israel, transshipment of postal shipments through and to Israel and calls by foreign flagships that stop in Israeli ports as part of their itineraries.
The decision is a personal achievement for Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who has made the issue of opening up Arab markets to all American companies the centerpiece of Washington's policy toward the gulf nations. He characterized it as an important step toward lifting the Arab boycott in its entirety, which he said was "a key objective for the United States as we work to advance peace in the region."
In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres welcomed the initiative as "an additional move in dismantling the walls of hatred and separation and boycott." Speaking to reporters, Mr. Peres added that those who applied the boycott "hurt themselves."
"The boycott has had a negative effect on the Arab countries as well because today markets are more important than countries and if you put limits to trade you limit your own capacity to trade in a changing world," he said.
The decision also brought quick praise from strong supporters of Israel on Capitol Hill. "For the first time I have some real hope that there are Arab states serious about ending the boycott against Israel," said Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who is co-chairman of the Congressional Task Force to end the Arab boycott.
In their announcement today, the six countries -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates -- said that they would support an initiative in the Arab League to consider ending the boycott entirely. The announcement, read by Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia after a meeting with Mr. Christopher, said that the six gulf countries recognized "the importance of a review of the provisions of the Arab boycott of Israel so as to take into consideration progress achieved and substantive future requirements of the peace process."
At its meeting of foreign ministers in Cairo in August, the Arab League refused to even put the boycott issue on the agenda. Ending the Arab boycott is "linked to assurances of progress on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks" and in "ending Israeli occupation of Arab lands occupied in 1967," said Esmat Abdel Meguid, the Egyptian who currently heads the Arab League.
The United States protested strongly, and in the aftermath went back to the six gulf countries and urged them to use their annual meeting with Mr. Christopher at the United Nations to take a bold step.
Administration officials credit the intense lobbying of Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador to Washington, for bringing about today's decision. "Bandar was the key in unlocking it," one official said.
The Arabs have boycotted Israel since its creation in 1948 as a way to isolate the country and strangle its economy. The Arab League, which now has 21 members, imposed "secondary" and "tertiary" boycotts in 1951 on companies that did business in Israel and on companies that dealt with those on the blacklist.
The boycott has stood as a relic of history since the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement last year. But both Syria and Lebanon want to preserve it as a means to win concessions from Israel in their own peace negotiations.
Acknowledging its irrelevance, a senior Arab gulf official told reporters today, "It is very hard to reconcile Palestinians signing economic agreements with Israel while we are also boycotting American companies or British or Japanese companies." He added, "You can't be more royalist than the king."
A senior Administration official described the decision as an initiative taken by the gulf states "not in coordination with the Syrians."
Today's move also helps insure the success of the Middle East/ North Africa economic summit meeting to be held in Casablanca at the end of October. It will bring together Israeli and Arab officials and foreign business executives in a major initiative to generate private trade and investment in the Middle East.
In the past year, a number of Arab countries have increasingly ignored the lesser boycott of companies that do business with Israel and of companies that do business with companies on the blacklist.
Kuwait, for example, announced its own decision to end the enforcement of those lesser boycotts last year. And in a tacit violation of the boycott, Jordan announced last month that it would sign a $55 million joint project with Motorola to operate the country's first cellular phone system, even though Motorola is a major trading partner of Israel.
Still, the bureaucratic tangles associated even with the lesser boycotts have frustrated American companies. Even though Oman, for example, has quietly taken steps to ignore the blacklist of companies trading with Israel, its bureaucrats have often decided otherwise. In the last year, Manhattan Shirt Company and Johnson & Murphy Shoes, both exporters to Israel, have had to seek the intercession of the State Department to get their products into Oman.
The Commerce Department still gets complaints from American companies against the Egyptians, even though Egypt officially ended its boycott of Israel when the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979.
But today's decision will have an important economic impact on those foreign companies that want to do business with both Israel and the gulf countries. Bechtel, one of the world's largest investors in the Arab world, has traditionally avoided doing business in Israel. But the company is eager to invest in the $1 billion development project for the Jordan Rift Valley, and with today's decision, the risk of doing that has largely evaporated.
It may have less of an immediate economic impact on Israel. Now that Israel has relations with China and India, the world's two biggest emerging markets, the fact that it may soon be able to sell its products to a country like Saudi Arabia is not crucial to its economy. But the partial lifting of the boycott is expected to spur investment in Israel by Japanese companies, which have been reluctant to do so because of the boycott.

HEADLINE: Fed August Rate Rise Based In Part on Market Concerns

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The decision by the Federal Reserve's top interest-rate policy committee on Aug. 16 to raise short-term interest rates by half a percentage point was unanimous and based partly on concerns that a smaller move would disappoint financial markets, according to a summary of the meeting issued today.
 "Consideration was given to a lesser adjustment in reserve conditions," said the summary, which is written in central bank and financial market jargon. "Reserve conditions" and "further monetary tightening" both can be read as interest-rate increases.
 
 "But the members concluded that a smaller step was unlikely to be adequate," the Fed's official report on the Aug. 16 meeting said, "and on perceiving this, financial markets would quickly build in further monetary tightening, the unknown size and timing of which would add to market uncertainty and volatility."
 Bond traders and analysts had said at the time that a smaller increase might make the central bank look soft on inflation and send long-term interest rates higher as investors worried that inflation would erode their returns.
 Marc W. Wanshel, an economist at J. P. Morgan in New York, said this evening that this concern at the Fed was significant because it meant that the Fed might continue its apparent pattern since May of raising interest rates in half-point increments every two months. By contrast, the Fed raised rates by a quarter-point in February, March and April this year.
 "It would seem to suggest that when they move again, they'd go half a point," he said, predicting that the next move could come in October or, at the latest, at the policy committee's next meeting on Nov. 15.
 The panel, officially known as the Federal Open Market Committee, met on Tuesday but adjourned without changing interest rates at all.
 On Aug. 16, the committee raised its target for the Federal funds rate to 4.75 percent from 4.25 percent. Banks pay the Federal funds rate for overnight loans from other banks, and the Federal Reserve indirectly controls this rate by buying and selling Government bonds, thereby adding or subtracting from banks' reserves of lendable cash.
 The Fed had previously raised the Federal funds rate by half a percentage point on May 17 and by a quarter percentage point each on Feb. 4, March 22 and April 18.
 The Federal Reserve board of governors also raised the discount rate, which banks pay for overnight loans from the Fed, to 4 percent from 3.5 percent on Aug. 16. The only other increase in the discount rate this year, also a half-point move, came on May 18.
 The Fed's concern about financial markets' reaction to a possible small increase on Aug. 16 irked Democratic members of Congress who have already been critical of higher interest rates. "I think this just bears out and is confirmation of the view that the Fed is overly concerned about Wall Street's reaction and not concerned enough about what's happening on Main Street," said Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who is the chairman of the Budget Committee.
 Sung W. Sohn, the chief economist at the Norwest Corporation, a bank holding company in Minneapolis, said that the Federal Open Market Committee's unanimity on the final vote probably reflected its members' desire to show a united front.
The committee's members are the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve regional banks. All of the governors and five of the presidents vote at each meeting, with the presidents taking turns in holding the power to vote.
 The decision to raise rates reflected a concern among many members of the committee that the economy was operating at full capacity, today's summary said, so that any further increase in consumer and business spending might result in bidding up the price of a limited supply of goods without actually bringing about any further increases in production. "In their assessment of the outlook for inflation, many members focused on the prospects for further growth in output in the context of diminishing margins of unemployed production resources," the summary said.
 The Fed reduces the spending power of Americans by raising interest rates, which makes everything from credit cards to home mortgages more expensive and leaves people with less disposable cash.
 The committee also concluded that most of the nation's sharp increase in business inventories during the second quarter mainly reflected voluntary decisions by companies to offer more goods for sale. Some private economists had speculated that the rise in inventories resulted from an unwanted accumulation of unsold goods.
 The Fed released its report after the close of trading on financial markets today.

HEADLINE: Late Computer Orders Lower the Dow by 11.44

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks closed mixed yesterday after computer-guided sell orders buffeted the Dow Jones industrial average in the session's final half-hour, causing the Dow to register its second straight decline.
 "With the quarter ending, people unload some of the losers just to get them off their books," Jeffrey Rubin, an analyst at Birinyi Associates Inc. in Greenwich, Conn., said.
 
 The computer orders shaved 17 points off the average, undercutting a rally by the Philip Morris Companies that led the Dow to gain nearly 21 points earlier in the session. The average closed at 3,843.19, down 11.44 points for the day, the same amount it gained for the week. For the third quarter, the Dow rose 218.23 points, or 6 percent.
 Stocks took direction yesterday from developments in trade talks aimed at narrowing Japan's $60 billion trade surplus with the United States, traders said. Preliminary reports that a partial agreement had been reached that would avert sanctions on Japan helped the dollar and bonds rally, bolstering stocks for much of the session. No official announcement on the results of the talks is scheduled until today.
 The speculation of progress in the talks helped offset a Commerce Department report that showed consumer spending increased in August by a larger-than-expected nine-tenths of 1 percent, amid strong demand for autos. The rise could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates again during the next few weeks.
 Among broader market measures, the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.48 point, to 462.71. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 4.95 points, to 764.29. The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index climbed 2.34 points, to 458.81.
 Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered decliners, 1,303 to 850. Big Board trading was active, with about 295.8 million shares changing hands.
 The Anheuser-Busch Companies fell 1 1/8, to 50 7/8. The maker of beer and snack foods was dropped from Goldman, Sachs's recommended-for-purchase list by an analyst, Marc Cohen, on concern about beer sales.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Japan Talks Head To the Wire

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Japanese and American negotiators swapped proposals late into the night in an 11th-hour push to reach agreements on opening Japanese markets after 15 months of acrimonious talks. Both sides said the most likely result would be partial agreements and partial American sanctions on Japan.
 A deal opening Japan's closed insurance market, officials said, is virtually certain, as well as an agreement on opening Japanese Government purchases of telecommunications and medical equipment. The latter became possible when Japanese negotiators arrived late today with new language on how the two sides would measure whether Japan was following through on its promises to open these markets.
 
 As negotiators worked into the night they said there was a slim chance they could strike a deal opening the closed Japanese glass market, but there seemed little hope for an agreement that would induce Japanese companies to purchase more American autos and auto parts.
 The Administration has said it will initiate proceedings to impose economic sanctions on Japan if there is no progress on glass and autos. But it has stressed that any sanctions would have a specific target, would take some time to go into effect and should not undermine the overall economic relationship between the world's two biggest economies.
 The Japanese have almost 100 trade negotiators, experts and aides in Washington for the talks -- almost equal to the entire staff of the United States trade representative's office.
 Financial markets in New York and Tokyo watched nervously as the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, and Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan engaged in their marathon, all-night negotiating session to determine what was possible and what was not. They are not expected to adjourn until noon Saturday, when Mr. Kantor will announce the results and any American sanctions.
 Billions of dollars have been bet in the currency and bond markets on hunches as to where these talks will end up. Any deal, even one that involved limited, focused sanctions on Japan, would probably help to strengthen the dollar, as traders conclude that the Americans will not have to rely solely on a weak dollar and strong yen to bring down Japan's $60 billion trade surplus. If there are no agreements, the dollar may be hammered, and the yen may soar.
 The dollar was up against the yen today in New York, reflecting anticipation that slightly more good news than bad will come out of the talks. Several big money managers are believed to have hedged their dollar bets by going short in the bond market -- meaning that if the talks fail and the bond market goes down, as it did last time, they will not lose as much by betting on the dollar.
 When the Administration initiated the idea of these framework negotiations with Japan in July 1993, it hoped to be able to announce a package deal of market-opening measures. Such a package was to include Japanese purchases of American autos and auto parts, insurance, telecommunications equipment and medical technology.
 After 15 months of frustrating negotiations, the Administration has resigned itself to a different strategy -- one of basically cutting whatever deals it can in these different areas, and initiating sanctions in areas where no satisfaction is forthcoming from Tokyo.
 The main problem has been Japanese refusal to accede to an American demand that any market-opening deals they agree to include specific yardsticks, known as "objective criteria," to measure whether Japan is really living up to the agreement. The Japanese say this amounts to setting import targets.
 The most likely deal in the area of insurance would involve a Japanese agreement to eliminate rules requiring American companies to consult with Japanese competitors before introducing products. There also would be some way to measure the approval rate for foreign companies wanting to sell insurance in the highly regulated Japanese market.
 In the area of Japanese Government procurement, the American side has been asking Tokyo to increase, from what is now a very low level, the amount of American medical equipment and telecommunications equipment it purchases. This is entirely in the hands of the Japanese Government to do. The Japanese have indicated a general willingness to comply and the two sides have basically been arguing over what should be the minimum level of purchases against which they can measure whether Japan is buying more each year.
 The areas that pose the biggest problem, though, are autos and auto parts, which make up two-thirds of Japan's $60 billion trade surplus with the United States. Here, there are three issues. First, the United States wants the Japanese Government to reduce regulations and inspection requirements, which Tokyo has used to limit imports of replacement auto parts. This is a multibillion-dollar market, of which the Americans have only a tiny share. There has been some progress on this issue, but Tokyo has been hesitant to make concessions, since it could mean fewer Japanese jobs.
 The Americans' other automotive demands are greater purchases by Japanese companies of original auto parts for Japanese cars made in Japan and the United States, as well as more access for American car makers to Japan's dealer showrooms.
 These are areas that are basically in the hands of private Japanese auto companies, which in the past have tended to work together to restrict American access to their markets. But these companies have also had complaints about the quality of American parts and the willingness of American manufacturers to make cars with steering wheels on the right side, since the Japanese drive on the left side of the road. The Americans have been seeking the Japanese Government's help in dealing with Japanese auto makers.

HEADLINE: Artist Returns to His Beloved Mural

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
He had been exquisitely reliable about it, turning up like an apparition every 13 or 14 years to inspect and, if necessary, retouch his cherished mural of mirthful children parading across the school walls. But he would be old now, if he were even still alive. Was there a chance he would return again?
In 1939, Herman Simms, a 29-year-old artist kept off the bread lines by the Works Progress Administration, painted a mural in the entranceway of Public School 216 in Gravesend, Brooklyn. It was his first mural, and he did only two more. It took him eight months. He was paid $20 a week. 
 Even after he settled in California, his affection for the mural nudged him to return to see how it was doing. It mattered that it was his first big work, and it mattered that the boy playing the violin was his nephew and the woman in the hat reading a story was his first wife.
The last visit occurred in 1980, the year before Richard Breyer became principal of the elementary school, which is named the Arturo Toscanini School. As years passed, aware of the custom and intensely proud of the mural, the spirited Mr. Breyer wondered if Mr. Simms might return one more time. He began to search for him. He enlisted his youngest daughter, Elizabeth, an art history expert who worked for the Mellon Foundation. Nobody knew where Herman Simms was.
"For all I knew, he was dead," Mr. Breyer said. "He had been like Halley's Comet, but humans don't live as long as comets." He doubted he would return.
On Thursday afternoon, it was the usual mad bustle around the principal's office. "At about 1:30, I hear my assistant principal on the phone," Mr. Breyer said. "He turns to me and says: 'Do you know a Herman Simms? He's asking for you.' I practically leapt at him and said, 'Give me that phone.' I told him I'd been looking for him, and he said, that's O.K., he'd be at the school at 10 the next morning. He wanted to know how the mural looked. I said, 'Like the day you put it up.' "
Herman Simms was decidedly robust for 84, coming through the door yesterday in a light jacket and soft loafers. He was a small man with luminous eyes. Smiling shyly, he peered at his 55-year-old work, "Children in Vocational Activities and Children in Directed and Undirected Play," and gave an approving nod. "I'm amazed," he said. "It still looks good."
"Yes," Mr. Breyer said, "we flog any student who touches it."
Mr. Breyer had to ask him a question: was the rumor true that Hannah Nash, a much-beloved music instructor at the school to whom the mural was dedicated, was in fact the music teacher portrayed in the mural?
"No, she was no one in particular," Mr. Simms said, quickly scotching that, but revealing the likenesses of his nephew and now-deceased first wife, who were actually not a student or teacher at P.S. 216.
Mr. Simms said he hadn't painted in a year, after a crowded life of fashion illustration and portrait painting. Portraits were his meal ticket. He was a fixture at malls near his Newport Beach, Calif., home. For several years, he produced portraits at Disneyland, productively enough that he said he was marked down for inclusion in the "Guinness Book of World Records" when he dashed off more than 9,000 faces in 1975. That fame evaporated after two years, when another strong arm finished 46 more, and eventually the record no longer even made it into the book of oddities.
"This is great for him," beamed Marcella, his wife, as she watched him dutifully slide his hand over the mural. "He's been a little sad on the trip. Things have been getting on his nerves. But look at him there."
One piece of the mural dealt with classroom activities -- music instruction, home economics and wood shop. The companion piece depicted recreation -- baseball, marbles, tug-of-war. When he stopped by in 1980, Mr. Simms found that the shop teacher's hand and the ear of a boy were messed up. He spent four days touching up those blemishes and darkening some faded colors.
This time, he decided that the colors had held up well. "I could always find something," he said. "It seems like some areas are a little lighter than they should be. But I'll leave it alone for now."
He rewound time to sum up his past. As he sharpened his art skills during the Depression, he worked as a bellhop at the New Yorker Hotel, making $2 a day. He quit after two years and used his savings, and then some, to finance a trip to Europe. When he returned, owing $100, he became one of thousands of unemployed artists hired by the W.P.A.
His first assignment was P.S. 216, and he followed that with a mural of chemists at work for a bank in Wilmington, Del., and a scene of canal workers that hangs in a post office in Tipp City, Ohio. He has not been back to retouch either of them, but was going to see if he could find the Wilmington mural this weekend.
After the Depression lifted, he did fashion and portrait work in New York -- he had a stand at the Orange County State Fair -- before moving to Newport Beach, where he still lives.
Mr. Simms shook hands with some admiring teachers and students, basking in the aura of appreciation. Before the painter left, the principal had some parting words. "I expect to see you the next cycle," he said, "when you're about 97 or 98."
"All right," Mr. Simms said, evincing no doubt, and he disappeared out the door.

After an absence of nearly 14 years, he returned yesterday to the school, now the Arturo Toscanini School, and stood next to his work. "I'm amazed," he said, approvingly, "It still looks good."; A plaque dedicates the mural to Hannah Nash. ((Ruby Washington/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: 0.9% Increase In Spending In August

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Americans flocked to auto showrooms in August, and overall spending rose faster than it had in six months. The surge was more than twice the increase in income, the Government reported today.
 The Commerce Department said income rose four-tenths of a percent, a seventh straight increase, while spending jumped nine-tenths of a percent -- the largest gain since 1.3 percent in February.
 
 Consumer spending, the largest force driving economic expansion, was up for the fourth straight month. While the latest rise was more than many analysts expected, they noted that it was in line with recent data suggesting that there was considerable strength in the economy.
 The income and spending figures followed reports on Thursday that pointed to continued expansion.
 The Commerce Department also reported that disposable income -- income after taxes -- rose five-tenths of a percent in August. In July, personal income increased five-tenths of a percent while spending rose three-tenths of a percent, revised upward from a previous estimate of two-tenths.
 The combination of incomes and spending put the savings rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- at 3.8 percent in August down from 4.2 percent in July.
 Wages and salaries, the most closely watched component of income, increased $7.9 billion in August after rising $14.4 billion in July. Government wages and salaries rose $100 million in August, on top of a $900 million gain in July.
 Spending for long-lasting items like cars and appliances rose 4.2 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $601 billion. Spending for nondurable goods like food and fuel rose five-tenths of a percent, to $1.405 trillion, and spending for services was up four-tenths of a percent, to $2.661 trillion.

HEADLINE: Bonds Rise As Trade Pact Is Seen

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday, buoyed by investors' optimism that the trade talks between the United States and Japan could produce an agreement.
 A report, later denied, of an agreement on Japanese Government procurement contracts bolstered the dollar in the world currency markets, making dollar-denominated assets like bonds more attractive.
 
 In addition, the Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodity futures, considered a leading indicator of inflation, fell 0.82 point, to 229.85, easing investor concern about rising prices for basic goods.
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 11/32 , to 9614/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.81 percent, from 7.84 percent on Thursday. Shorter-maturity issues were mixed.
 The bond market responded positively to several economic reports released yesterday. The Commerce Department said personal incomes rose four-tenths of 1 percent in August, compared with an increase of five-tenths of 1 percent in July, while consumer spending jumped nine-tenths of 1 percent. The numbers were in line with the market's expectations.
 The Chicago purchasing managers' index for September, released yesterday, indicated continued growth for that region's economy, but with the price component of the index declining significantly for the month.
 The purchasing managers' report included a healthy rise in the employment component, to 54.5 points, from 50.2. Production fell 9.3 points, to a still strong 65.9, while new orders edged up to 66. The order backlog eased 1.5 points, to 54.4, but vendor delivery time continued a troublesome climb, to 62.9, up 3.1 points from last month. The high vendor delivery time suggests developing bottlenecks that are potentially inflationary, analysts said.
 Even though the overall price index retreated this month, analysts still noted that its reading of 72.1 points was the second highest since the Persian Gulf war.
 There was little of significance in yesterday's numbers, said Herbert L. Davidson, senior vice president of Meyers, Pollock, Robbins Inc. in Tysons Corner, Va. "As a result, people are now hoping that the Fed will wait until November before hiking rates, giving the market a little relief until then," he said.
 Mr. Davidson said that yesterday's trading included substantial short-covering -- purchases by traders who had sold bonds that they had borrowed in expectations of a drop in price and were now buying to cover their positions.

HEADLINE: Shipyard Full of Worry in Quebec

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LAUZON, Quebec

 BODY:
Wooden sailing ships, steel steamships, destroyers, frigates, icebreakers, ferries, freighters and tankers have been launched at the MIL-Davie shipyard here since Allison Davie founded the company in 1829. But now the future is uncertain for the last big shipyard in Quebec.
 A Canadian Navy destroyer, the Huron, is getting an electronic overhaul, one of the yard's last big contracts. When the Huron sails for sea trials at the end of November, employment will plummet to 300 from the current 1,200, already well below the 2,250 workers employed at the end of last year and the 3,200 at the end of 1992. Without new work, shipbuilding here could go the way of buggy whip making.
 
 Like many shipyards in North America, MIL-Davie, which is owned by the Province of Quebec, has been desperately trying to convert from military to civilian operations. It has drawn up plans to fill a niche market of 40,000- to 70,000-ton bulk carriers and tankers. Two American yards, Newport News in Virginia and Avondale in Louisiana, are working on similar concepts.
 But while military orders have dried up, the commercial shipbuilding industry has yet to see any sharp pickup in demand.
 And compounding the competitive pressure is an increase in civilian shipbuilding capacity in South Korea, Russia, other former Soviet republics and Poland.
Guy C. Veronneau, MIL-Davie's president and chief executive, readily acknowledges that he is uneasy about the yard's future -- though if it can just survive the next few years, he said, better times are ahead, as the many old tankers and freighters now in service finally give out.
 In the meantime, his workers feel the pressure in this town just half a dozen miles down the St. Lawrence River from the provincial capital, Quebec.
 Henri Pelletier, a 40-year-old who has worked here for 24 years as a marine mechanic, seemed oblivious to the surrounding hills blazing with autumn colors. Among his co-workers there is "much fear," he said, adding that he and his wife worry about what kind of Christmas their children will enjoy, if new business is not found for the shipyard.
 Enter the newly elected provincial government under the separatist Parti Quebecois.
 Many Quebecers who voted for the Parti Quebecois see MIL-Davie, with its nearly blank order book and looming layoffs, as a symbol of a failed federalism.
 "The federal Government could have done something earlier," said Jean Garon, who represents Lauzon in the Quebec Assembly, to which he was recently re-elected with 83 percent of the vote. "But it gave orders to New Brunswick and Newfoundland, even as two other shipbuilders in Quebec had to shut down."
 The new provincial government, he pledged, "will maintain this shipyard as a going concern." The party's leader and Quebec's new Premier, Jacques Parizeau, said something similar when he campaigned a few weeks ago.
 Yet in this era of rocketing government debt and tight budgets, the question is just how much government can do.
 Mr. Garon wants Ottawa to spend $100 million (United States) on a new ferry from Prince Edward Island to Magdalen Island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The existing ferry is 30 years old.
 In addition, he said, the federal Government should order a prototype for a new fleet of Navy supply vessels known as Smart ships (for strategic multi-role aid replenishment transport), which cost about $150 million each. Such a fleet could swiftly deploy a battalion of peacekeepers to a foreign crisis spot and provide takeoff and landing sites for helicopters, he said.
 And if the federal Government in Ottawa balks, Mr. Garon said Quebec itself should order a ferry and use it to open a new provincial service from the tip of the Gaspe Peninsula to Magdalen.
 Both Gaspe and Magdalen are part of Quebec. Because the existing Prince Edward Island-Magdalen service is inter-provincial, it comes under federal jurisdiction.
 With MIL-Davie's high visibility in Quebec, many analysts expect the Parti Quebecois to stick by its campaign pledge to save the yard. Pierre Fortin, an economist at the University of Quebec at Montreal, said that the spending on a Gaspe-Magdalen ferry could be easily defended as an investment.
 There is still a possibility that the federal Government could order a replacement ferry from Lauzon because of the age of the existing ship. Ottawa faces a difficult choice, however, because another big shipyard, Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd., owned by the Irving family of New Brunswick, would also like to get the business. Saint John now has more navy contracts than Lauzon does.
 Mr. Veronneau, the head of MIL-Davie, insists that the yard is proposing valid projects, not white elephants. The Smart ships and the ferry, he said, would be "useful for the federal Government."
 Even though MIL-Davie is government-owned, Mr. Veronneau said, his mandate is to run it "as a private and profitable company." Indeed, he said, should the shipbuilding industry recover, the government would sell the company to investors. "The Quebec government," he asserted, "has no business in shipbuilding."
For now, projects like the ferry and naval transports are needed to carry MIL-Davie until the expected surge of new commercial orders to replace aging cargo vessels and tankers.
 Nearly half the tankers on the high seas are at least 15 years old, and of tankers exceeding 200,000 tons, 70 percent are in that category. The useful life of a ship is 22 years. In the next 10 years, many analysts say, half the world fleet of tankers may have to be replaced. Freighters have a similar age profile.
 "People are surprised that so many ships have stayed operational for so long," said Stuart Nicoll, deputy editor of Lloyd's Shipping Economist of London, a monthly magazine covering the shipping market. "A phenomenal amount of shipbuilding will be needed. The debate is over when the surge will take place. Some say two to three years, others say four to five."
 Will the Quebec yard be competitive? Yes, insists Mr. Veronneau, a 57-year-old former international marketing vice president for the transport conglomerate Bombardier Inc., which is based in Montreal.
 Ten years ago, he noted, Japan and Germany were paying lower wages. Today Germany's wages are higher than Canada's, and Japan's are about the same. South Korea still has an advantage, but the gap is closing, with South Korea's wages only about 25 percent below Quebec's. At MIL-Davie, average pay is about $13.30 (United States) an hour.
 "There should be a lot of room for a lot of people," he commented in an office looking out on huge dockside cranes that stand mostly idle. "You don't have to be No. 1. There are 300 shipyards in the world, and you only need to be in the first third."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: STORM WARNINGS;
Whitman May Face Rough Weather After Extending Tax-Cut Timetable

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman will probably weather the stormlet that followed her admission on Thursday that she would not be able to deliver her hallmark income-tax cut on time, both Democrats and Republicans conceded today. The far tougher test will be how she handles the state's budget problems that are now beginning to surface because of those same tax-cut pledges.
 When it comes to popularity, the feeling around the State House, and in the offices of academics and political consultants, is that Mrs. Whitman has more going for her among the voters than just her dramatic promise to cut income taxes by 30 percent over three years. Her popularity also rests on an artfully conveyed image as a reformer and an outsider.
 
 "She's managed not to become an incumbent," Steven Salmore, a professor of political science at Rutgers, said. With such a reputation, an admission that reforming New Jersey's tax system proved harder than expected is probably a forgivable sin.
 But the Democrats believe that voters will be less forgiving of the fallout from reductions in state aid to schools and municipalities.
 For the region's Democrats, who have often been on the defensive on the tax issue lately, Mrs. Whitman's shift was also a chance to score some easy points. At a ground-breaking ceremony in Brooklyn today, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo worked the news of Mrs. Whitman's altered tax timetable into his campaign against George E. Pataki, his Republican rival.
 "They thought they had a good thing in Jersey, right?" said the Governor, who has dismissed Mr. Pataki's own tax-cut pledge as unworkable. "Keep reading the papers over there."
 There are some who feel that Mrs. Whitman's concession -- that it may take her four years to complete the second half of a 30 percent income-tax reduction she had frequently and unshakably promised to accomplish in three -- may actually work to her advantage.
 "Ironically, Whitman may come out of this looking less like a strident fiscal conservative and more like a pragmatic public servant," said David Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University in Lawrenceville. "She could easily be seen as someone who tries to help the public with a tax cut when she can, but who is also candid enough to level with folks when the state fiscal situation prevents a tax giveback."
 Republicans, for their part, showed no sign of being worried about the aftermath of the Governor's admission.
 "So she didn't deliver her tax cut on the year and the day and minute? No sweat," said David Murray, a Republican media consultant in Trenton. "Is she going back on her promise? Technically, yes. Does it matter? No."
 Governor Whitman's tax-cut pledge, coupled with a broad promise to attack government waste and restore New Jersey's economic competitiveness, has set a pattern in the campaigns of other Republicans in the region who have also taken up the tax-cut theme.
 At an appearance by Mr. Pataki in Rochester today, Democratic Party workers who have been dogging the Republican's campaign handed out copies of newspaper stories about the Whitman admission.
 But gloating over a tax-cut setback is hardly a commanding campaign theme to take to a public that is rooting for the Governor to succeed. With the passage of a day, New Jersey Democrats refocused their arguments away from the tax-cut schedule and back to their overarching theme: that Mrs. Whitman cannot pay for her tax cuts without driving up property taxes and disrupting public education and state services.
 The tax cut stretch-out is not fatal in itself, the Democrats said. But it is one of many inconsistencies they see in Mrs. Whitman's first term.
 Brendan T. Byrne Jr., chairman of the state Democratic party, said that Mrs. Whitman had also backed down in what seemed like an ironclad pledge not to allow public college tuitions to increase more than 3.6 percent. She has also recently raised the possibility of increasing motor fuel taxes and highway tolls to replenish the state's transportation trust fund.
 Even something as trivial as Governor Whitman's recent use of the state helicopter, which she criticized her predecessor, Jim Florio, for doing in office, formed part of the Democrats' response.
 Mrs. Whitman must close a gap of more than $2 billion in the budget that will begin next July before even factoring in $700 million in state income, which will have been lost to tax cuts that are already on the books by the end of the 1996 budget year.
 The coming fight over apportioning the pain of the necessary cuts will make any arguments over the timing of her tax cut look small, Democrats said today.
 William J. Pascrell Jr., an Assembly Democrat who is also Mayor of Paterson, said: "I look at the commitments she's made, and I think the worst is yet to come. The state of New Jersey under Whitman is going to do to the towns of this state what the Reagan Administration did to the states, and it's going to be World War III."

HEADLINE: Pataki's Rockefeller Lesson: Smile Makes a Better Point

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The candidate saw the placard-bristling protesters waiting in the parking lot and immediately thought back two decades to his boss, Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller, and what came to be known infamously as The Gesture.
"He made a gesture that in retrospect he shouldn't have," said State Senator George E. Pataki, recalling Mr. Rockefeller's single-digit dismissal of a group of hecklers that was caught on camera as his young advance man, Mr. Pataki, memorized a frightening lesson in how not to behave in his Republican campaign for Governor. 
 "I saw the protesters and I was thinking back to Binghamton and that gesture," Mr. Pataki explained later of his instant decision to bound directly from his car and offer a friendly smile and flat open palm of welcome this morning to each of the 18 Democrats waiting to question and denounce his new campaign promise to enact broad, deep income tax cuts.
The so-called truth squad was out in behalf of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and Mr. Pataki was trying some gesture-free adaptation.
"I learned it doesn't have to be that confrontational," he said after completing his barnstorming news conference here in which, indeed, the Democrats stood mutely and politely to the rear with their protest signs while the old Republican advance man had the microphone and campaigned hard, with nothing more graphic than a fist of exhortation to get out the Pataki vote.
"Let people know you're human and you care about them even if they disagree with you," the Senator said afterward, taking care to wave a smiling goodbye to the silent Democratic campaign group, one of many being deputized as he races these days across a chain of snapshot appearances in northern New York.
Mr. Pataki has something of a mixed reputation as a campaigner who can deliver a set speech with a wooden tone and little talent for ad-libbing. His partisans held their breath in Manhattan on Wednesday when the Senator twice lost his place in the speech unveiling his keystone campaign stratagem, the tax-cut promise, before the Citizens Budget Commission. Nervous silence and tittering ensued in the hall as the Senator fell silent, groping to resume.
At the other extreme, aides say his natural strength is in relating simply to people along the campaign way. He obviously likes mixing with them for handshakes and greetings, as here. But he can linger in ways that leave his managers anxious that the candidate not veer controversially from the current tight format of being perceived thus far in opinion polls as a fast moving, relatively mistake-free front-runner.
Then, too, Mr. Pataki, ever his own best advance man, can visibly step up the travel pace when behind schedule as on Thursday in Syracuse. The candidate gave a hurried rendition of his tax-cut promise then shook each hand at departure in a high-speed blur-cum-mantra: "With your help. With your help. With your help . . . ."
The Democratic organization devoted to Mr. Cuomo's re-election bid was up early here in Monroe County this morning, marshaling a dozen union protesters with signs ("The Pataki Plan: Increase LOCAL Taxes"). They distributed freshly faxed handbills of the latest State House news stories from Trenton that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman had begun stepping away from her own tax-cut pledge that is a model for the Pataki plan.
After shaking the protesters' hands and clapping Republican workers on the back, Mr. Pataki briskly summarized his "dramatic and real" tax-cut promise, using no text, playing up the working class tax burden and repeatedly denying that, in reining in state spending and taxes, he would force localities to take up the slack in services and spending. "I was a Mayor and I know it doesn't help one bit if we cut state taxes and shift the burden to the county government and the school districts," he said, rebutting one of Mr. Cuomo's main criticisms.
"We have a cushion in there," he insisted at a similar 20-minute stop today in Buffalo. He contended his proposal for a four-year income tax cut of $5.6 billion was little more than half of the $11 billion he estimated would be available in state revenue growth.
At each stop in a long campaign day, Mr. Pataki was flourishing his new summary applause line: "Mario Cuomo says he can't cut taxes. He's right. He can't, but we can. And we will."
Sandra White, one of the Democrats sent to intercept the Senator here as he used an abandoned corporate headquarters for tele-visual effect, listened carefully after receiving Mr. Pataki's disarming welcome and handshake. "My initial feeling from listening to him is if he could do what he promised, then I'd say it doesn't matter who my candidate is," allowed Ms. White, an economically pressed highway worker and member of laborers Local 435.
She picked up her tiny dog, Kiki, when it started yapping during the candidate's speech. "It's time for the lies to stop just to be elected, you know," she said, echoing the demonstrators' common theme. "But his speech was good."
Others in the protest group insisted that the Pataki tax-cut vow was transparently unworkable with fictitious revenue estimates and Draconian service cuts, and that Governor Cuomo was the only proven tax-cutter in the race.
For all the electronic-media dependency of modern campaigning, a candidate still flits across the upstate hustings like an old-fashioned drummer, in town just long enough to proffer the latest notions from his sample case and deny the competition's charge that he is another peddler of nostrums and placebos.
"I like the give and take," Mr. Pataki said. He smiled and shepherded his entourage off to the next stop through the day's autumnal nip and mellowing foliage, a timeless reminder of gubernatorial campaigning across the state. "This is all very familiar," said the old advance man.

HEADLINE: ON HOCKEY;
Trust Is a Stranger as the Season Comes Apart

BYLINE: By Joe Lapointe 

 BODY:
Trust us, the hockey bosses told the players, the news media, the fans and the whole wide world yesterday afternoon.
 Believe us when we tell you we're losing money, they said, as they sat on the dais at the New York Hilton.
 
 We're not trying to break a union or take your money, they said, as they announced the postponement of the National Hockey League season.
 And who could doubt their sincerity?
 Sitting right there, speaking in two languages, was Marcel Aubut of the Quebec Nordiques. Near him were Neil Smith of the Rangers and Ed Snider of the Philadelphia Flyers.
 Two years ago, Aubut traded one player, Eric Lindros, to the Flyers and the Rangers on the same day. It took two weeks and a roomful of lawyers to settle that one.
 Sitting behind Smith was Mike ("I'm-not-going-anywhere") Keenan, the former Flyers-Blackhawks-Rangers coach, now representing the St. Louis Blues. No knife marks were visible in the back of Smith's stylish suit coat.
 It's been, oh, weeks since these two statesmen exchanged obfuscations and half-truths after Keenan left the Rangers in a bitter power struggle with Smith. It took a commissioner and more lawyers to sort that mess out.
 But what this event really needed was Bruce McNall, part-owner of the Los Angeles Kings. Until last summer, McNall was the chairman of the Board of Governors. But he's much too busy these days. He's negotiating a plea bargain and facing a possible jail term following an investigation of financial fraud.
 This media event was a counterpunch to one held the day before in Toronto by the players association, when the workers called the bluff of Commissioner Gary Bettman. Postponement of the season was necessary, Bettman had said, because he couldn't risk a midseason strike, like the one in baseball.
 O.K., the players countered, why not continue bargaining with a no-strike/no-lockout pledge? This won the players a public-relations coup, so Bettman responded with his slick show of solidarity yesterday, just down the street from Radio City Music Hall, home of the Rockettes.
 Perhaps those dancers could have taught these executives to kick in a chorus line. That footage would make the evening news! No, scratch that. They'd probably put steel toes in their wing-tips and go for each other's shins, with all those cameras and reporters around. It shows hockey's growth to see that even its labor troubles are now big news.
 The glib commissioner smoothly changed gears yesterday, explaining that the player offer was "seductive" and that he would think about it, but that he couldn't risk being in the same position next fall, with no contract, so why not talk, talk, talk for two more weeks to see how sincere the players are?
 It is a transparent effort to buy time and circle the wagons and figure out what to do next. For the first time since this showdown began, after slashing player benefits and strutting his power and backing the players into a corner, Bettman was on the defensive.
 The two-week delay "is like sending Jimmy Carter to Haiti," said Jeff Pash, Bettman's bright, young counsel and co-negotiator.
 Perhaps Carter should intervene in the hockey talks, using the language of diplomacy, because the players don't believe the words of Bettman, who uses Orwellian flourishes to call a "lockout" a "postponement" and a "salary cap" a "luxury tax."
 His attempt to restructure the economic relationship is a wolf in sheep's clothing, a plan to hold wages in check while revenues soar in a period of arena-building, increased television exposure and $1 billion per year in souvenir sales.
 When the players hold another infomercial today in Toronto, they probably won't invite Chris Chelios, the undiplomatic Chicago defenseman who issued vague, menacing comments about Bettman's safety the other day.
 The folks at the league office were aghast at this crude attempt to intimidate, but they shouldn't be. Employees sometimes react emotionally and irresponsibly when someone messes with their medical insurance and threatens to shut down their place of business. This is a profession that rewards some employees for fist-fighting skills. Do they think Chelios is the only one talking this way behind the closed doors of the locker room?
 During formal, polite dialogue, the players keep asking the wealthier owners to show sincerity by taxing their gate receipts and sharing them with their less-fortunate brethren. What fun it would be to let them run their fingers through each other's books. Forget it, say many owners, but Bettman hints they might consider it as part of a larger compromise.
 For this union, this sort of stuff is revolutionary. A few short years ago, there was none of this sophistication, none of this confrontation. The players were led by Alan Eagleson, a union boss who had more in common with management than with labor. His sweetheart contracts were part of the reasons the players dumped him.
 He had so much in common, in fact, that he is under indictment for racketeering. Eagleson couldn't be part of yesterday's show. He's in Canada, battling the American feds, who want him here to face charges. If he shows up in the United States, he might get arrested.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO;
Clinton Shakes the Money Tree

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
President Clinton's stock speech on the campaign trail this autumn, in ballrooms and meeting halls, always includes a long recitation of his achievements. But it omits a striking one: in 20 months, he has personally raised $40 million in Democratic political donations -- nearly half the national party's reported total.
He has done it mostly by taking a leaf from the voluminous fund-raising manual of the Republicans before him, and using the prestige and power of the White House for Democratic financial gain. 
 Like George Bush and Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton has flattered big-money donors with private White House parties and seats at state dinners and momentous events. He has freed Cabinet officers, their aides and White House officials to give private briefings on business and politics to especially generous supporters. As his party has begun to court traditionally Republican business leaders, his Administration has consistently invited big-business donors on trade missions -- just as his predecessors did.
And he has blanketed the Democratic tuxedo-dinner circuit with Administration stars. This year alone, the President, his wife, the Gore family and top White House and Cabinet officials will appear at nearly 300 fund-raising events.
"The time before we were in the White House and now just makes a world of difference," waxed Hugh Westbrook, a Methodist minister from Miami who is finance chairman of the Democratic Party's Senatorial committee. "It's night and day."
It is also, chapter and verse, the sort of thing that Mr. Clinton condemned during his 1992 campaign for the White House. At that time, he wrote that American politics was being held "hostage" to monied interests, and complained that "political action committees, industry lobbies and cliques of $100,000 donors buy access to Congress and the White House."
The turnabout distresses those who expected Mr. Clinton to clean up what they view as a political sewer. "The President's aggression on the fund-raising circuit continues to shock and amaze, given his pledges to change the role of money in politics," said Ellen Miller, who heads the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington group that monitors the flow of money in national politics.
Democratic officials admit things have not changed. But they argue that Mr. Clinton had proposed legislation to control some practices, including a bar on unlimited "soft money" donations to national party treasuries, only to watch it die today in a Senate filibuster.
"He tried his best," Donald Sweitzer, the political director of the Democratic National Committee, said in an interview this week. "In the interim, this is the real world and we're playing by rules as presently set. If we decided not to, we'd simply get creamed."
Indeed, even though Mr. Clinton has sharply closed the gap, the Democrats still get creamed by Republican money men. Through the first 18 months of Mr. Clinton's term in office, the Democratic National Committee and its fund-raising organs in the House and Senate raised $83 million, as against $162 million raised by the Republicans.
Still, the figures are deceptive. In "soft money," the big donations from companies and wealthy individuals that go to party coffers rather than specific candidates, the Democrats outraised the Republicans during that period by 2 to 1. And overall donations to the Democrats were up by one-third, while Republican contributions rose by a mere 3 percent.
While Mr. Clinton could voluntarily temper his party's fund-raising -- Michael S. Dukakis refused corporate and labor money and individual gifts of more than $100,000 during his 1988 Presidential primary race -- ecstatic Democrats seem to have no stomach for it. Mr. Clinton is the best money draw that his party has enjoyed in decades.
Much of what the White House elicits from Democratic donors rolls in at the $1 million-plus chicken dinners at which Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, in particular, are frequent stars. As befits his office, Mr. Clinton speaks only at national party functions or on behalf of statewide candidates; Mr. Gore and other underlings, from Cabinet officers to aides like Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, stump for House members and others. (George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Panetta's aide de camp, has done about a half-dozen, many at Greek-American functions.)
But before the dinners, less visible political operations in the party and the White House work to insure that donors feel that their money has done some good, either for candidates or for themselves.
E. William Crotty, a veteran Democratic fund raiser, lives 900 miles from the White House, in Daytona Beach, Fla. But each week his fax faithfully spits out a schedule of briefings by top Administration officials, in hotel rooms and offices around Washington, held expressly for the benefit of contributors and money men and women like himself.
"Say you're interested in growing oranges and you want to go to hear an assistant agriculture secretary, or Mike Espy's policy on the United States' exporting or importing oranges," Mr. Crotty said in a telephone interview this week. "Whoever's having a briefing, sub-Cabinet people, the White House, there are three or four a day. You can go to one if you want."
And people do; before Mr. Clinton spoke nine days ago at a Senatorial campaign dinner in Washington, for example, donors at the million-dollar event met with Administration officials for briefings on issues. The Business Leadership Forum, a party organization catering to corporate donors, plans to shepherd 100 people to Vienna and Budapest next month for "business breakfast briefings and luncheons" and nighttime entertainment, a solicitation states. (Donors pay $6,000 to offset expenses, the party notes.)
The White House and party officials say that such meetings are strictly on the up-and-up. "What you do is facilitate," said Maria Elena Torano, a Miami businesswoman and party fund raiser whom Mr. Clinton invited to his Little Rock economic summit in December 1992, and later named to a Federal advisory post. "If somebody wants to know what the Administration is doing on this regulation, you don't bring him to the secretary's office; you see if there's a briefing on it that they can go to."
Indeed, much of what donors receive for their money amounts to good feeling. For instance, Mr. Clinton invited California donors to the White House for a reception this summer, said Philip A. Schaefer, a San Francisco pension-fund consultant and fund raiser.
Mr. Schaefer, who is organizing a pension investment conference in South Africa, said he was recently invited to a State Department luncheon and White House reception for that country's new President, Nelson Mandela. "I don't know how I got on that list," he said, adding that in a flock of monied donors, he is "a thin-cat, not a fat-cat."
Not that fat-cats are shunned. A spate of news accounts in such publications as The Wall Street Journal and Business Week have noted that big corporate donors to Democratic soft-money accounts are frequently seated on Commerce Department trade missions to places like China. Further, some big donors, like the grain marketer Archer Daniels Midland Corporation and the Boeing Corporation, have subsequently benefited from Federal decisions that increased production of corn-based ethanol or spurred aircraft sales abroad.
Boeing and U.S. West, the Denver-based communications firm, both gained special audiences with Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, during his visit this week. Both firms were big Republican Party donors until Mr. Clinton's election, but since have given the bulk of their money to Democrats, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
But there is no clear evidence of impropriety in those or other cases, any more than in similar instances during Republican administrations. Other corporations with Republican leanings saw Mr. Yeltsin, too.

HEADLINE: Merging on The Information Superhighway The New Comfort Zone Where Public Meets Private

BYLINE: By Phil Patton; By JULIE V. IOVINE Phil Patton is a contributing editor at Esquire magazine. His latest book is "Made in USA: The Secret Histories of the Things That Made America" (Penguin).

 BODY:
CONVERGENCE: IT'S THE buzzword of the digital age, the mantra of the infobahn, invoked to explain all the alliances and takeovers we see announced daily in the newspapers. These unions recall the shifting ententes of 19th-century European powers: telephone companies linking up with computer companies; software producers allying with television networks; film studios bonding with video game makers. Everywhere, media are converging, and not just at the corporate level: soon computers and televisions will be almost interchangeable devices for pumping information and entertainment into our homes.
Already, the devices around us have begun to converge. From the clock radio to the computer, they have accomplished liaisons far stranger than any corporate union. One result of the process is that there is no longer a simple answer to the question, "What is this machine?" "It's not just a radio, it's an integrated audio system with CD, dual four-headed tape decks, quartz lock tuner and graphic equalizer."
Like upstairs and downstairs, public and private used to be well defined. One acted, dressed, thought and furnished in ways deemed appropriate for one or the other realm. No more. In today's world, the line between public and private, once absolute, is not only shifting but dissolving. In its place is the possibility of a comfort zone where public and private overlap, share the same elements and create a new sense of community.
The convergence of public and private is already under way in politics, the media and business. Its impact on home design affects us dramatically by altering the place we know best. Now, home offices and home theaters -- even kitchens -- are integrating the technology and the styles associated with professional life. On a more literal level, using architectural artifacts -- often salvaged pieces of buildings -- as room decor is more popular than ever. 
 "Multimedia appliances" is the term their makers like to use for the most ambitious of these devices, but "hybrid media" might be a better name. As if responding to the ministrations of some Luther Burbank of electronics, all sorts of recording and playing devices are being crossbred.
As with all hybrids, the quality of the resulting offspring is mixed. Some, like nectarines, are sweet and happy unions, such as the combination of camcorder and four-inch, flat-panel viewing screen available in Sharp's Hi 8 ViewCam ($2,199) or Sony's Snap! Handycam ($899). (All prices are list.) Others, like videophones, seem to be ugly fruit no one quite knows what to do with.
Some combinations seem obvious, but years passed before television sets with built-in videocassette recorders were widely available. And sometimes, the cachet of high technology has delayed convergence. For instance, not long ago, no self-respecting stereophile would have displayed a stack of components from a single manufacturer. The thing was to mix and match the best preamplifier, amplifier, receiver and speakers. But today, even the most technically demanding listeners can find these elements in one unit, such as Bang & Olufsen's BeoSound 2000 ($1,599), which combines them in a single, flat, wall-mountable assembly whose design is worthy of the Museum of Modern Art.
For successful convergence, like successful baking, the proportions and mix of the ingredients must also be right. A new class of products called personal digital assistants now combines computers with communications devices. But in what proportions? A.T.& T. recently stopped selling its EO -- too much computer, not enough telephone (the hand set was extra) -- while Motorola is introducing its $1,500 Envoy, which offers a computer plus modem (it includes wireless connections and easy-to-use software). Meanwhile, Simon ($1,099), the result of a collaboration between BellSouth Cellular Corporation and I.B.M., is described as the first fully integrated cellular phone, wireless fax, pager, calculator and pen-based notepad computer.
Among the more successful hybrid media are those that not only link electronic components, but also help produce another sort of convergence: between public and private. Watching tapes of films in your "home theater" makes private the space we once shared at the local Bijou. Public drama becomes almost sordidly personal: in "The JFK Assassination" CD-ROM ($59.95), Medio Multimedia provides assassination conspiracy buffs with the complete Zapruder film to be computer-analyzed frame by frame. Other CD-ROMs offer "karaoke Shakespeare," such as the I.B.M. Multimedia Publishing Studio's "Macbeth" ($32.95). You can simply watch the play like a film on your screen, or, through a computer microphone, you can soliloquize along with the voices of the repertory cast, or invite friends to play all the parts on the computer stage.
Home theater possibilities are even being boosted by the movie studios, which are seeking a new way to fight the videotape rental industry, now worth an estimated $15 billion (three times Hollywood's annual box-office total). The studios' dream is to deliver movies directly to the home, on demand, via fiber-optic telephone cable, a prospect that remains years away. But while studios continue to dicker with telephone companies and cable television over the details, a glimpse of how this system would work is available today in many hotels, where a "menu" appears on the television screen. On your remote control, you push a number to call up a list of "action films," then another number to pick, say, "Demolition Man." (Unlike pay-per-view, the current cable television system that allows the viewer to telephone and choose from a small selection of movies with predetermined starting times, this plan would permit the consumer to tune in to a wide array of films, any time he or she desires.)
But until such systems pipe films like water or electricity into the home, home theater will depend on videotapes or laserdisks, as well as a formidable array of components: a large-screen television set; audio equipment with sound systems that create room-filling sound, such as Dolby Surround or THX; a high-fidelity VCR or laserdisk player, and a set of at least five speakers, dispersed about the room. Such systems surround the viewer with sound of a quality that surpasses that of the average mall omniplex. Demonstration models almost invariably feature "Top Gun" as their test case, so you can appreciate the surround-sound effect of jet after-burners seeming to emerge from the ficus in the corner.
These systems, however, are intimidating to many buyers. They mix and match a television set from one manufacturer, an audio/video receiver and VCR from another and a set of speakers from a third. Most are still sold through electronics dealers, such as Circuit City or Harvey Sound. But the industry is trying more and more to package the whole system together.
Some audio manufacturers, such as Cambridge SoundWorks, offer home theater packages beginning at around $750. Bose's sleek Lifestyle 12 ($2,200) gives you a receiver, six speakers, a CD player, a radio tuner and remote control -- everything but the television set.
The next convergence may be that of CD-ROM and VCR. A new format called Video CD -- featured, for example, in the Technics model SC-VC10 ($1,199.95) -- plays films on disks that look like the familiar audio CD. The player hooks up to a television set. But since each disk holds only 74 minutes of video, two are required for most movies.
Soon, the great debate over whether the television set or the home computer will be the main on-ramp to the information superhighway system may even become moot. This fall, a critical turning point has been reached with the introduction of the first combinations of television and computer. These are the latest evolution in a process that has seen the computer add a CD player (in the form of CD-ROM), speakers, a fax, a radio and an answering machine. At the forefront of this trend are companies like Compaq, Packard Bell and Apple, which are now offering computers incorporating television, all aimed at the home market.
Packard Bell, for instance, touts its new one-piece Spectria machine ($1,000 to $2,500) as "the first all-in-one multimedia appliance." In addition to computer, CD-ROM, fax modem and speakers, the system includes an answering machine, radio and television. The Spectria is even designed to coexist happily with the Cuisinart in your kitchen or the compact stereo in your den: an optional set of interchangeable colored front panels helps the machine blend with your decor.
Compaq's latest version of its Presario line is another "one-box" home machine, with a stereo, large Bose speakers and built-in television receivers ($1,699). Now you can watch "Wheel of Fortune" in one window on the computer screen while studying your finances in Quicken in another -- and simultaneously talk on the machine's built-in speaker phone. You can even hook a VCR to the Presario and create a computer still picture from your favorite Hepburn-Tracy movie. Apple's Performa 630, when equipped with a card enabling television reception ($1,499 to $1,549 for the Performa; $249 additional for the Apple Video/TV System card), provides the same functions and allows even more elaborate video editing of tapes made on a camcorder.
The melding of media has also made new demands on remote-control units, with their ranks of rubberized buttons. Since many television sets have little computers in them to produce such effects as "picture in picture" (keep up with the Giants in the corner of the screen while watching the Jets), it's no wonder that television remote controls have become more like computer controls.
Sony's egg-shaped controller plus receiver, for example, called Vision Touch (model STR G1ES, $1,700), directs a set of "virtual" buttons on the television screen, like a computer interface, to control a whole audio and video system. Meanwhile, Compaq's new Presario computers feature the "MiniPilot," which puts an image of a television remote control on the screen, controlled by a mouse.
Ultimately, the fate of convergence lies in how people take to these devices. While media moguls like Bill Gates and Gerry Levin debate the electronic landscape of the future, they would do well to remember that natural selection in the world of converging technology lies with the user. It's all about the survival of the designs that fit best in our lives, in our homes and in our hands.
 At the same time, the outside world is defining itself increasingly in terms of the homelike comforts it can provide. For instance, the New York City architects Shelton, Mindel & Associates recently designed the Metedeconk National Golf Club in Jackson, N.J., to recall a weekend getaway. According to Lee Mindel, a principal in the firm, "Using home furnishings in public places looks like someone -- a real person -- cared."
PREVIOUSLY, THE LOOK OF WHERE WE LIVED -- ITS STYLE, materials and aura of comfort -- was easily distinguishable from anything that might be seen outside the house. Theaters had a decor suited to their own particular business, as did restaurants, stores and offices. Today, the language of the home -- couches, ambient lighting, intimate scale -- has been increasingly put to use in both expected and surprising ways, inviting people to feel more at ease in public.
Of course, the idea of the communal living room is not new. Throughout history, societies have always seemed to flourish or atrophy in relation to the quality of their public amenities, including their town squares, neighborhood restaurants and central greens. The ancient watering well was a cafe before there was leisure time. In fact, before the shiny image of the postwar suburbs -- with a car for every garage -- enticed an eager middle class into believing that success meant economic and social independence, gathering in public was as much an American as a European tradition. The interesting development today is that whereas civic organizations and local governments once created public places, such as libraries, town squares and youth centers, it is now the retailers and restaurants that are providing locations for lounging and conversing. It began on a local level with small businesses trying to compete in a tough market. Adding a comfortable armchair to a boutique showed that the shop provided more than just another buying experience.
Barnes & Noble has taken the idea to the national level. There are now over 250 of its superstores, in Manhattan and around the country. Some fill entire city blocks. But their gigantic size is tempered by interiors that suggest living rooms, complete with couches, armchairs and desks. There is often a cafe as well. Indeed, the coffee-bar revolution has fueled the start-up of innumerable coffee shops furnished shabby-chic style with pieces that look as if they came from Grandma's attic. The message: Sink in and stay awhile.
Laura Esquivel, the author of the novel "Like Water for Chocolate," writes, for example, in the bedroom of her Manhattan loft, but seeks the company of the outside world at a neighborhood cafe that has an interior ambiance very similar to her home's. In Atlanta, the upscale Perimeter Mall was recently renovated to include several seating areas with Arts and Crafts-style sofas and armchairs, lamps and coffee tables. In a probable first for any United States mall, customers have been so inspired as to ask where they might buy the same furnishings. ABC Carpet and Home, a home furnishings and antiques store in Manhattan, is even installing a pool table to encourage customers to treat the store as a place to be as much as a place to buy.
"We did a lot of analysis on what people enjoy in a communal environment," says C. Lawrence Whitman, associate director, design, at The Rouse Company in Columbia, Md., and a key player in the Perimeter Mall's redesign. "We found that they react against the sterile and much prefer the familiarity of someplace homelike."
WITHIN THE HOME ITSELF, IMAGINATIVE WAYS TO FUR- nish are as likely to cross over from urban architecture and technology as from historical decorating styles. Elliott Rosenblum, an architect who has given his shop designs for J. Crew and Barneys New York a distinctly homey look, uses pieces of public architecture in his Manhattan apartment. Urban pioneering, a trend that gained momentum in the early 1980's, also redefines expectations of what can be a house by converting defiantly nonresidential properties into homes. Michael Smith, who turned a beauty parlor into a weekend cottage, was so proud of its former identity that he got a permit to preserve the original tile work announcing it as "Edward's Beauty Salon."
The new home office -- a far cry from a desk and computer set up in the guest bedroom -- also signals the general trend toward aligning our professional and private lives. Here, convenience is the key to comfort. In Santa Monica, Calif., the architects Kim Coleman and Mark Cigolle, a husband-and-wife team, designed their house on separate levels: the top for their studio, below for their living space.
In the electronically driven world of the near future, the merging of public and private will only pick up speed. It's reassuring to know that comfort promises to remain an essential factor in the shape of things to come.
When we get off at the ground floor, Angelos finds that all the stadium doors have been locked. He shouts, "I own the damned joint and I can't get out!"
MIKE ILITCH TENDS TO dress in mismatched jackets and slacks from different suits -- steel-blue jacket, gray-green slacks, with white stripes at cross purposes. A pudgy little man, he resembles the comedians Jackie Mason and Harpo Marx, but he has neither the former's cockiness nor the latter's mischievousness. Ilitch, 65, is so timid that it is hard to believe he founded Little Caesars Pizza, which last year did $2.15 billion in sales. He purchased the Detroit Red Wings hockey team in 1982, and the Detroit Tigers baseball team in 1992 for a reported $85 million. His reported net worth is over $300 million. Yet he acts less like a Caesar and more like a low-level employee who is terrified of his boss.
Ilitch smiles when he talks about his beginnings making pizzas. "I was fascinated by flour and water," he says. "You knead it into dough, put it in the oven and it comes out baked. Wow!" But as for being a baseball owner, he says nervously, "I gotta be part of the team, like it or not,"
Ilitch is sitting in his box in Tiger Stadium, looking over the field where his Tigers are playing the Oakland A's. Two of his grandchildren are playing on the floor behind him. His daughter, Lisa Ilitch Murray, and her husband, Glenn, are sitting off to the side. Ilitch is not comfortable with strangers, which is why he surrounds himself with employees and family members whenever he is forced to talk, on the record, about baseball. Lisa, one of his media advisers, is watching her father intently, with great affection -- and worry. After her father turned down an initial request for an interview, Lisa interceded. She asked her father to grant the interview for her, and so he did. Ilitch has trouble refusing his children anything. In fact, his seven children, ages 24 to 36, and his wife, Marian, are partners in all his business enterprises.
Al Sebastian, a staff member, scribbles furiously in a tiny notebook while Ilitch talks, but it is not clear whether he is recording his boss's words for a corporate biography or to insure that his boss will be quoted accurately.
"We need a commissioner who's entertainment-oriented, with sports experience," says Ilitch. "I'm not so sure how important the antitrust exemption is to baseball." He stops, groans. "Aw, I'll get in trouble for that." He looks, pleadingly, toward Lisa. She smiles, nods.
"Owners have been lazy all these years," he says. "They thought they could just talk tradition, open the doors and the stadiums would be filled. Those old stadiums served baseball well in the past. But we need new stadiums that make it exciting for fans prior to the game."
Ilitch wants the kind of entertainment zone that has made Angelos's Baltimore Orioles a financial success. H. Wayne Huizenga, owner of the Florida Marlins, plans to build a new complex that will be home to his baseball team, his football team, the Miami Dolphins, his hockey team, the Florida Panthers, and, quite possibly, the Miami Heat basketball team, which his brother-in-law, Harris W. Hudson, just purchased.
"Wayne's buying everything," says Ilitch. "They gave him 2,500 acres. I'm not in a class with Wayne, but I had the idea first."
In 1987, Ilitch purchased the rundown Fox Theatre in the center of a blighted area in Detroit, along with other nearby buildings, and spent $200 million renovating them. He moved Little Caesars Pizza corporate offices there, added a few restaurants and the Second City Comedy Club. But there were problems with his plans for a new ball park.
Old Tiger Stadium, built in 1902, has been given a coat of white paint, but still looks like a dowager trying to recapture her youth. Yet some people in Detroit think the stadium should be designated a historic landmark. And then there is the question of who would own the stadium and the land under it. Ilitch's opponents think the city should not donate 80 acres just so a local millionaire can make more millions. Ilitch has offered to build a new stadium with $120 million from his own pocket.
"My problem," he says, "is that I'm not politically astute. I have no chits to call in from politicians. I never needed anything from them. I just made my pizzas." He sighs.
"I resent being tabbed as greedy," Ilitch says. "I could handle dumb."
Tiger Stadium is located in a dangerous section of Detroit, which is one reason the Tigers are close to last in attendance in the American League. Also, the team is in last place in the American League East, despite the fact that Ilitch almost doubled the team's payroll this year. He signed Travis Fryman for $25 million over five years, Cecil Fielder for $35 million over five years, and Tim Belcher for $3.4 million for one year. "I got a very poor return on my investment," Ilitch says.
Ilitch could have played baseball professionally. The Tigers offered him a $5,000 bonus when he finished high school, but he demanded $10,000. When the Tigers balked, he joined the Marines for four years during the Korean War. He served his time mostly playing baseball.
After Ilitch left the Marines in the early 1950's, he signed with the Tigers for their original offer. He played four years in the club's minor league system
Ilitch was talented enough, and cocky enough in those days to call the Tigers' owner and insist he be brought up to the majors. Before he made the move, however, Ilitch broke his leg, which ended his career. Without a trade or a college degree, Ilitch took a job making pizzas. He loved it, and in 1959 opened his own pizza restaurant.
Today, he has 4,700 of them throughout the United States and Europe. The success of his chain allowed Ilitch to fulfill a lifelong fantasy, buying the Tigers.
The Tigers were losing money when Ilitch bought them in 1992, but he thought that "with my background I could do better marketing the team." (Better than who? The previous Tigers owner, Thomas Monaghan, who owned Domino's Pizza? You can almost hear Jackie Autry's voice in the background chanting "Dread Owners' Disease.") Ilitch also thought that because he had a baseball background, he'd be more successful than Monaghan.
Ilitch discovered he had little impact on his own baseball people. When he wanted to make an offer for Jimmy Key, a free-agent pitcher, his general manager talked him out of it. Key eventually signed with the Yankees, for whom he has won 17 games this season.
Ilitch agrees with Autry that today's owners are often held captive by their baseball people, who are operating under principles that don't work today. Ticket sales are no longer the game's sole revenue. Many more millions are made through television revenue, marketing -- caps and T-shirts -- and food and entertainment. He says, "You know, the Tigers offices "-- he points overhead -- "are so quiet. They don't want anyone up there but baseball people. When I tell them I want to have a concert or fireworks at the stadium, they say I can't do it. I told them, "I'm gonna lose $10 million this year." (Financial World claims the Tigers lost $5.4 million last year.)
Ilitch's experience with the Tigers has so soured him on the game he has always loved that he admits, if he had to do it over again, he wouldn't. "I should have done more research," he says, "But I got excited."
Ilitch recently appointed a president for Little Caesars so he could spend more time running the Tigers. "Most of the owners didn't run their teams full time," he says. "Players got away from them. These owners would never have let these guys get away from them in their normal business."
When told that a lot of baseball fans and press think that once the owners get the concessions they want, they'll abandon talk about "partnership," Ilitch fidgets. He takes off his tie, sticks his finger in his shirt collar and tugs. "What do you want me to say ?"he asks. "That the Tigers' success really just depends on my ability to run the team properly, which has nothing to do with a salary cap or revenue sharing?" He looks to his daughter, Lisa, for help. Finally, he smiles, a weak smile, and says: "I can't say that! I have partners now!"
As an owner, Ilitch must long for those days when owners ruled their clubs like Genghis Khan. There was no players union, no Senate committees threatening to take away owners' antitrust exemption. One former owner, Calvin Griffith, remembers those days fondly.
"Baseball has its own way of doing things, and the fans don't want it disturbed," Calvin says. By "baseball" Calvin means "the owners."
I'LL BE WEARING A Minnesota Twins hat," he said. And he is. A jowly old man with a big belly, slumped down in a seat at the Helena, Mont., airport.
He grumbles, "Hello," struggles to his feet and waddles out of the airport, past buffalo and moose heads on the wall, to his jeep outside. He drives toward town, past the flat plains with the mountains in the distance.
"The other day I saw snow on the mountains," he says. "Lorda mercy, it was so beautiful I had to stop and stare."
In the 1800's, Helena was a gold-mining town, he says. "There's the ovens where they melted the ore. There's my bank." Money figures a lot in his conversation, and it could be said that Calvin tossed around his nickles as if they were manhole covers. In the 1980's, when he owned the Minnesota Twins, he paid himself $150,000 a year at a time when he was paying half his team considerably more. When his players started demanding salaries in the millions, Calvin told them to go for another team, and they did. The franchise went from a money-maker, which made the playoffs in 1969 and 1970, to losing close to a million dollars in its worst year. He had 13 rookies on that 1982 team, out of 26 players, and their average salary was $65,000, compared with the league average of more than $200,000. Calvin sold the Twins for $32 million in 1984 and retired to his farmhouse in Helena in the summer, and to his condo in Florida in the winter. Bud Selig called him, "the last of his breed," and George Steinbrenner told him, "We'll miss guys like you in baseball." Calvin Griffith, now 82, was the last baseball owner who was raised from childhood to own a team.
Calvin, and that's how everyone still refers to him, despite his years, was named after John Calvin, who preached that a man's earthly success was proof that he was one of God's elect. At 12, his father died, and Calvin went to live with his uncle, Clark Griffith. Clark had been a major league pitcher, and then managed and finally owned his own team, the Washington Senators. He groomed his foster son in baseball from his earliest years, beginning as a batboy.
"Mr. Griffith gave me knowledge," says Calvin. "He told me to be honest. And still he made money 25 years in a row, sometimes never more than $15,000. He gave me every damned thing I ever asked for."
Clark sent Calvin to Staunton Military Academy in Staunton, Va., then on to George Washington University ,where he fashioned a 6-0 record as a pitcher. He harbored fantasies of playing for Clark until his foster father told him there's more "assurance" in the front office, perhaps a kindly way of saying Calvin didn't have big-league talent. At 23, Calvin began his career for $250 a month as the vice president and treasurer of the Chattanooga minor league team. His duties included keeping the books and checking the turnstiles with the ticket receipts for away games. ("He told me to watch the other owners because they cheat," Calvin says.)
Three years later Calvin became the president and field manager of Charlotte's minor league team in North Carolina.
Calvin and his sister, Thelma, inherited the Senators when Clark died in 1955. In 1961, after losing seasons on the field and at the gate, Calvin petitioned the American League president, Joe Cronin, whom Calvin's sister had married, to let him move the team to Minnesota. The other owners turned Calvin down by one vote. Cronin held a second vote when one of the dissenting owners was out of the room. Calvin had just won when that owner returned and said, "I didn't vote." Cronin banged his gavel, and said, "Too late."
"It pays to have a brother-in-law who's the league president," Calvin says.
He pulls into the parking lot of the Hofbrau Restaurant, enters and sits at a table surrounded by people playing poker machines and Keno. The waitress says: "Hi ya, Calvin. What'll it be today?" He orders a ham sandwich and a beer. Then he says, "My days in baseball were the greatest days in my life."
The game is a tough habit for Calvin to break. When there is no strike, he wakes each morning at 10 and reads last night's box scores in the newspaper. Then he watches ESPN. He sometimes golfs or fishes in the afternoon. After a nap and then dinner, he'll drive out to Kindrick Legion Field to watch the Class A Helena Brewers play baseball. When his wife had him build another farmhouse on the outskirts of Helena, so she could have a place to graze her herd of llamas ("They cost up to $15,000 each," Calvin says. "She wants to rent them out as pack animals"), Calvin preferred to live in town, because he was afraid he'd get lost navigating the rutted dirt roads after Brewers games. So he will return to their home, alone, to watch more baseball games on television late into the night.
Calvin knew most of the legends of the game, including Babe Ruth and Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, baseball's autocratic first commissioner. Since Landis, Calvin says, the owners have watered down the commissioners' role. "One year I wouldn't vote for a commissioner," he says. "The owners said it had to be unanimous. But I didn't know the guy. One owner said, 'Hell, Calvin, we can always fire him.' I said, 'If that's the case, I'll vote for him.' I didn't like to vote for commissioners, but I saved one. The owners wanted to fire Happy Chandler" -- the former Governor of Kentucky -- "and they wanted it to be unanimous. When I voted against it, the owners threw their papers all over the room."
The owners of Calvin's generation and before were sometimes unsavory characters who fought like cats and dogs -- usually against each other -- to protect what was, for most of them, their only revenue.
"Horace Stoneham" -- the San Francisco Giants' former president -- "was the toughest owner I ever met," says Calvin, putting one half of his sandwich on my plate. ("Shouldn't waste it," he says.) "At a meeting in Chicago, Stoneham got into a fight with Commissioner Ford Frick. They'd had a couple belts, ya know, and their emotions got hot. It was a helluva fight. I just laughed." Calvin remembers that some owners had shady backgrounds. Fred Saight, of the St. Louis Cardinals, pleaded guilty to tax evasion. And Del Webb of the Yankees "had connections in Las Vegas," Calvin says.
We leave the restaurant and Calvin drives toward Kindrick field for his regular Brewers game. He takes off his Twins hat and puts on a Brewers hat. "You know, I see Florida Marlin hats all the way up here," he says, shaking his head. "In my day nobody bought souvenirs." The only advertising revenue he remembers his foster father getting in Washington came from Chesterfield cigarettes. "They paid Mr. Griffith $100,000," he says, "but we were so lousy that at the end of the season he gave back $35,000. He felt guilty. In my day, you had to make your money on ticket sales. I refused to borrow money to pay big salaries. It drove me out of baseball. You just can't pay more than you take in."
He says that today's owners aren't afraid of a players' strike because they have other income. "In my day, owners couldn't afford a strike," he says. "I felt responsible to the fans. I was accessible. I went to church functions. Today's owners send their emissaries 'cause they're busy with their other businesses. They don't watch the games. I saw every damned game."
It's twilight. Kindrick Legion Field is a dilapidated, wood-frame skeleton, painted a gaudy green, on a dusty plain. Calvin waddles up the ramp, takes his seat, a metal folding chair behind home plate. There is a little plaque in front of it with his name on it. As the Brewers take infield practice, Calvin says he feels baseball is America's game because it is played in sunshine at a leisurely pace.
"What they're paid is unbelievable. It takes away their incentive, their team loyalty." Yet, Calvin admits that players' high salaries today are not their fault. "The owners want the players to regulate the owners because the owners can't stop themselves from paying big salaries."
Two teen-age girls walk out to home plate to sing the national anthem. Calvin stands, takes off his hat and puts his hand across his heart. When they finish, Calvin sits down.
A cannon is fired to start the game. Calvin jumps in his seat. "God awmighty!" The KFC mascot chicken throws out the first ball. Calvin loses himself in the game. He talks about the action on the field ("A squeeze bunt! That's an [expletive ]play") and players he's known ("Did you see Ryne Sandberg retired 'cause he said he'd lost his enthusiasm for the game. I give him credit"). Turning around in his seat, he tries to count the house, an old habit. "Aw, I can't do it anymore."
Between innings, the Brewers have promotions: a bike race around the bases; a horse race around the back of the outfield fence. Calvin is fascinated.
"The only promotions we use to have were ladies' days," he says. "Then this guy sued. He wanted a men's day. Isn't that the damnedest thing?" But his eyes never leave the field, the game. "Look at that," he says. "The third baseman tried to throw the goddamned ball before he caught it." Calvin still knows the game, always has. As an owner he was famous for spotting talent, and for making sharp deals. One summer he saw Kent Hrbek playing in a sandlot game around the Twin Cities. He told his scout, "Give him anything he wants," which amounted to a $35,000 bonus. Hrbek, about to retire after 14 years in the majors ,has starred for the Twins ever since.
"The best deal I ever made was at 3 A.M. in a bar in Palm Beach," Calvin says. "I was on the phone all night with Bill Veeck, owner of the White Sox. I got Earl Battey and $150,000 for Roy Sievers" -- an aging player. "Today's owners and general managers don't make deals like that anymore. They never put on a jockstrap. They were just somebody's friends, or a millionaire who bought a club. They don't want to work to make money. That's why they want revenue sharing, so poor clubs can live off rich clubs. The only way a small-market team can compete is to win and draw fans. They'd rather make money through revenue sharing and merchandise sales."
It is still light at 10 P.M., after the game, as Calvin walks toward his jeep in the dusty parking lot. "Who the hell would want to be the baseball commissioner?" Calvin is saying, "He'd have to deal with all the owners. And the owners don't even want a commissioner. Did ya see where this new American League President, Gene Buddig, said he's delighted with his new job because he has so many new ideas for baseball?" Calvin chuckles as he hoists himself up, with great effort, into his jeep. "I'll bet the owners loved to hear that!"
The next morning after breakfast at Gilleys Casino, Calvin drives me to his in-town farmhouse. It is simple -- hardwood floors, plaster walls -- not the house of a man who sold his baseball team for a reported $32 million. There are no mementos of his baseball career. "Not a damned one," he says, and leaves it at that.
Back in his jeep, Calvin drives out toward the farmhouse where his wife keeps her llamas. He refers to her always as "she," or "her" or "my wife," but never by her name, which is B. J. (Belva Jane). He crosses railroad tracks and heads out into deserted country on a brilliant Big Sky afternoon.
He stops at his farmhouse on the deserted hill so I can pet the llamas. "Blow in their nose," Calvin says. "They like that."
When it's time to drive to the airport, Calvin goes quiet. Finally he says: "I got no regrets. I spoke my piece in baseball. I didn't care what people thought. I was respected more than I was loved. I'll take that." He passes some boys playing softball in a field on this sunny summer's day. Without turning his head, with only a quick shift of his eyes, a reflex, out of a habit he can not break, he notices the boys. "Now that boy," he says, "has a good swing."

A picture credit on Sunday with a sports photograph showing Dwight Clark catching a pass from Joe Montana in a retrospective of historical moments in the National Football League identified the source of the picture incompletely. The photograph, from the book "75 Seasons," was taken by Walter Iooss for Sports Illustrated.
An article in The Times Magazine on Sept. 18 about the major league baseball owners misspelled the surnames of a Baltimore Orioles first baseman, of a former owner of the St. Louis Cardinals and of the American League president. The first baseman is Rafael Palmeiro, not Palmiero. The former owner is Fred Saigh Jr., not Saight. The league president is Gene Budig, not Buddig. The article also misstated the opening year of the Detroit ball park now known as Tiger Stadium. It was 1912, not 1902.

CHRISTINA STEAD
A Biography.
By Hazel Rowley.
Illustrated. 646 pp. New York:
Henry Holt & Company. $37.50. 
A STARK summary of the global wanderings of the Australian writer Christina Stead makes clear that her life was an unusual one.
Born near Sydney in 1902, she left Australia for London in 1928 and was working in a Paris bank by the early 1930's. After a sojourn in America, she reached Spain just in time for civil war to break out in 1936, then soon fled back to New York where, with her American lover, the Marxist economist William Blake, she spent the early 1940's away from the battlefields of Europe.
As soon as World War II ended, the Red Scare of the late 1940's and early 1950's drove Stead, Blake and many of their fellow leftists to cold-war Britain and Europe. There the couple led a hand-to-mouth existence, alleviated only by the reissue of Stead's best-known novel, "The Man Who Loved Children" (originally published in 1940), which produced some much-needed income in the mid-1960's. Following Blake's death in 1968, Stead made a difficult move back to Australia, where she died at the age of 80 in 1983.
What this hectic itinerary fails to suggest is the extraordinary degree to which Stead, in her fiction, inhabited each of her places of residence. As Hazel Rowley says in the prologue to "Christina Stead," her superb new biography, "No major writer of any nationality has been more truly cosmopolitan than Christina Stead." While the fiction of James Joyce or D. H. Lawrence tended to become all the more deeply steeped in their Irishness or Englishness the farther from home they went, Stead used her mimic's ability to immerse herself in whatever place she happened to be.
She invented a strangely Francophone English to evoke the jittery speech of fly-by-night Paris bankers in "House of All Nations" (1938), and later captured the manic staccato of sleazy New York war profiteers in "A Little Tea, a Little Chat" (1948) and the more genial maunderings of Manhattan's artistic types in "The People With the Dogs" (1952). Her final phase found her perfecting her impersonation of the harsh lilt of Tyneside leftists in "Dark Places of the Heart" (1966) and the comically glib palaver of London literary hacks in "Miss Herbert (The Suburban Housewife)" (1976).
Any one of these novels would be enough to establish Stead as a major European or American or British novelist if questions of actual citizenship were set aside. But the startling variety of her books seems to have confused readers' perceptions of her and obscured the scale of her accomplishments. Like the blind men trying to describe the elephant by touch, readers and critics can describe almost as many Christina Steads as there are books in her canon. It all depends on which ones you've read.
Feminists can stake a claim to her on the strength of her autobiographical fiction: "For Love Alone" (1944), about a young Australian woman leaving her home on a search for self-fulfillment in England, and "The Man Who Loved Children" (1940), as searing a portrait of female domestic entrapment as has ever been written. Other Stead fans, turning to "House of All Nations" and "A Little Tea, a Little Chat," can make a case for her as the century's greatest novelist of the workplace and a psychological writer par excellence, with her devastating portraits of ruthless charlatans and misguided idealists.
New Yorkers might want to recognize her as one of their own. She spent her happiest years in the city, and as late as 1982 still identified herself as "a Manhattanite." "A Little Tea, a Little Chat," greeted with hostility upon publication, now reads like the "Bonfire of the Vanities" of its day. "The People With the Dogs," with its top-to-bottom portrait of an amiably eccentric postwar Manhattan, makes you feel the city's very sidewalks beneath your feet. Stead's best short fiction -- the title novella in "The Puzzleheaded Girl" (1967), and "A Harmless Affair" and "My Friend, Lafe Tilly" from the posthumous collection "Ocean of Story" (1985) -- also offers as wry and knowing a take on the town as one could wish.
The challenge for any would-be biographer is to establish the books' importance and relation to one another; to give a sense of the historical backgrounds and personalities from which Stead drew her inspiration; and to portray the woman herself, a task complicated by the fact that Stead burned many of her personal papers late in her life.
Hazel Rowley, who was born in England and educated in Australia and is now a resident scholar at the University of Texas, meets the challenge splendidly on all three counts. Juggling a vast amount of detail, her biography of Christina Stead is a model of clarity. Ms. Rowley's shrewd selectivity and handling of anecdote make the book compellingly readable. She always has a salient line from Stead's correspondence on hand, allowing readers to enjoy, for example, the writer's own pithy descriptions of "The Man Who Loved Children" ("A Strindberg Family Robinson") or New York during its wartime dimout (when the city "looked like the primeval Manhatto swamp").
Ms. Rowley's interpretation of the novels and their creator is, for the most part, thoroughly persuasive. Her tracing of what she calls "Stead's shadow self" from her unhappy childhood through the crucible of her fiction to the final shambles of her later years (in many ways, this writer's life is a writer's nightmare) gives the biography a vigorous and unnerving momentum, reminiscent of Stead's own fiction.
Central to the story, as readers of "The Man Who Loved Children" will guess, is Stead's problematic relationship with her father, David Stead, a naturalist. (Her mother, Ellen, died of appendicitis when Christina was 2 1/2 years old.) "That his eldest daughter was not endowed with good looks," Ms. Rowley says of Stead's handsome, charismatic father, "was a source of chagrin he made no attempt to conceal." In an era when being an "old maid" was a fate to be dreaded, David Stead made it clear to his daughter that marriage, in all likelihood, was not in her future.
The father-daughter conflict was made all the more tense by her father's reluctance to see Stead as anything but an extension of himself. Ironically, in spite of their differences, they shared strong similarities of temperament and intellect, as Stead in her later years liked to point out, seeing herself as a naturalist like her father, though in her own field, identifying personalities by type with the intention of observing rather than judging them. But, if anything, these father-daughter similarities simply meant that David and Christina Stead knew how to hurt each other most effectively.
Rescue came in the form of William Blake (born Blech), a "German Jew of American upbringing," as Stead described him, whom she met during her first week in London. An autodidact blessed with the vitality of a "small Vesuvius" (again, Stead's words), Blake had a life that followed an intriguing arc of its own. His friendships with shady right-wing bankers and fervent Marxists and Stalinists sent the couple fleeing across the Atlantic not once but twice -- the first time from England to the United States to avoid prosecution in connection with a banking scandal (the folding of the Paris-based bank that became the Banque Mercure in Stead's "House of All Nations"); the second time from New York back to London to avoid the inquiries of the F.B.I. and the House Un-American Activities Committee. Their situation with residence permits was complicated by Blake's marriage to an American woman unwilling to give him a divorce. Stead and Blake lived together for 23 years before marrying.
THE involuntary moves were a mixed blessing, giving Stead much of the material she used in her best books, but often disrupting her writing efforts and preventing her from establishing the network of friends and professional connections that might have made writing a more viable livelihood. But chances are she would have had difficulty finding a sizable reading public even if she had enjoyed more stable circumstances. Ms. Rowley cannily illuminates the challenging originality of Stead's handling of the "many-charactered novel," involving an immersion technique that forces the reader, as Stead explained in a 1939 lecture, to "draw his own conclusions from the diverse material, as from life itself." The results could be harrowing as a character's mesmeric voice, in silky or savage repetition, penetrated the reader's mind, taking full possession of it.
This ability to get under the reader's skin seems to have put some critics off. What too few reviewers picked up on was the sinister vein of humor that ran through even the most ghastly scenes, making the books as exhilarating as they were oppressive. It may not have helped that Stead was reminding readers of disgraces they'd rather forget: war profiteering, bankers going for bust, manipulative utopians bamboozling those around them. One critic remarked of the womanizing scoundrel behind the black market dealings in "A Little Tea, a Little Chat": "There are some individuals in whose company one can remain only to a point. Miss Stead takes the reader far beyond that point." Stead reacted to this with dry insistence on the validity of her vision. Of New York City in wartime, she remarked to a friend, "everyone was not rolling bandages."
If Stead's fiction was problematic to her contemporary audience, it was even more so to the friends and enemies from whom she liked to draw her characters. After the books were written, Ms. Rowley reveals, Stead often referred to real people by the fictional names she had given them. And unlike many writers, she liked to insist the books were absolutely true to life, regardless of any liberties she might have taken with her "models." As Ms. Rowley points out, "Stead tried to have things both ways: she wanted the liberty of invention and the authority of nonfiction."
AS scathingly as she treated her characters, Stead also, Ms. Rowley duly notes, endowed them with "brilliant verbal pyrotechnics" that were well beyond the abilities of most of their real-life counterparts. It's an indication of just how preposterous a man David Stead was that many of those who knew him agree that no exaggeration was necessary in transforming him into Sam Pollit, the villain of "The Man Who Loved Children."
Ms. Rowley gently debunks some of the myths the author constructed around herself in her later years. Stead once said she had written "House of All Nations" in six weeks. Ms. Rowley's investigations indicate that it was more like a year, with much research preceding the actual composition -- still an extraordinary accomplishment, given that the book is 800 pages of snappy entertainment about intricate financial transactions.
Ms. Rowley also reveals that Stead's greatest dissatisfaction with her work was her inability to come up with positive characters. She longed to write "an innocent book about something or other," and after "A Little Tea, a Little Chat," she confessed to a friend, "I can't go on criticizing."
Stead wasn't as ferociously independent as her novels might lead one to believe. In her book reviews and essays, she remained under the sway of her husband's leftist rhetoric, deciding that Pasternak's "Dr. Zhivago" was "true old-fashioned, dyed-in-the-wool anti-socialist propaganda," despite her admiration of the writing. Her own novels, with their maverick views on all political causes, were bound by no such dogma. And on occasions when activists' demands on her time came into conflict with her writing efforts, as happened during the Spanish Civil War, she was capable of putting supplicants off with "I feel it is my duty not to do my duty."
Ms. Rowley makes it clear that Stead's dismal experiences with publishers were as much an obstacle to her finding an audience as the challenging content of the books themselves. In the United States, Stead went through three publishers in eight years and, at various points, was urged to write more like John Steinbeck or Margaret Mitchell. Simon & Schuster insisted that she give "The Man Who Loved Children" an American setting, rather than its natural Australian background (a weakness of the book: Stead couldn't quite eliminate the Aussie accent from her Maryland protagonists). William Blake, a historical novelist as well as an economist, was offered still more dispiriting editorial advice about his fiction. What it needed, he was told, was "some really luscious" sex.
As for income from books, even in the early 1940's, when titles by Stead and Blake were being published with some regularity, the couple were drawing conclusions that writing was "another word for slow starvation," a situation that led to Stead's brief stint as a scriptwriter with MGM. Always trying to come up with salable ideas, they made proposals that suggest they were years ahead of their time. In 1942 Stead failed to get a Guggenheim fellowship to collect ethnic folk tales from across the United States, while Blake's book proposal for a "Woman's Encyclopedia" found no takers in the early 1960's.
For Stead, the years of being stranded without income or a publisher took their toll. (Angus Cameron, her last editor before her long publishing silence, was forced to resign from Little, Brown in 1951 because of his leftist connections.) The reissue of "The Man Who Loved Children" in 1965 looked like it might turn things around for a while, but then Blake grew ill, and with his death Stead lost her bearings. Her drinking -- always heavy -- got out of hand, she wasn't able to write fiction or essays (she spent four months working on a review of Quentin Bell's biography of Virginia Woolf before giving it up), and she made increasingly cranky statements that couldn't have endeared her to anyone. "I detest lesbians," she told Ron Geering, her literary executor, in their correspondence about "Dark Places of the Heart," which features a savage portrait of a women's group home in working-class London. She insisted that her benefactor, Patrick White, wasn't a homosexual, despite White's own candor on the matter, and she told one interviewer, "While there is a man left on earth, I'll never be a feminist."
Starved for affection, she turned to male friends, who had difficulty handling her. For the first time, she had become one of the impossible characters she had portrayed so well, blind to the unreasonableness of the demands she made on those around her.
Ms. Rowley doesn't flinch from showing Stead at her worst, but she doesn't lose sympathy with her either. Far from being a reductive portrait of the writer, "Christina Stead" has the fullness of tragedy, with its glorious peaks and dismal abysses. Ms. Rowley's reading of each passage in Stead's life is deftly enhanced with well-chosen excerpts from Stead's fiction and private papers.
With so much to praise, it feels petty to criticize Ms. Rowley on minor points, but there are a few errors and omissions in the book that need pointing out. The John Ford film Stead worked on at MGM is "They Were Expendable," not "We Were Expendable," as Ms. Rowley has it, and a reference late in the book to a "revised" edition of "The Man Who Loved Children" is surely meant to read "reissued." No mention is made of the 1966 hard-cover reissue of "House of All Nations" or the degree to which it boosted Stead's later reputation. The critical reception of Stead's intriguing novella collection, "The Puzzleheaded Girl," is also missing.
Ms. Rowley's emphasis in her last chapter on "heightened feelings of anger" as the engine that powered Stead's writing seems exaggerated. She attributes Stead's failure to write during her final years to an inability to muster sufficient rage at the world, but by all accounts that rage was on the loose and unbridled. It seems more likely that Stead's writing spirit was broken by the death of Blake (Stead's own explanation) coming after almost two decades of hard times. Working drafts of all her publications of the 1960's and 70's -- "Dark Places of the Heart," "The Puzzleheaded Girl," "The Little Hotel," "Miss Herbert (The Suburban Housewife)" -- had been written during the 1950's. The same is true of her posthumous novel, "I'm Dying Laughing" (1987).
Whatever the cause of Stead's writer's block, it is the fiction itself that matters, and Hazel Rowley's most important achievement is in sending readers straight back to it with a greater appreciation of the persistence and strength of mind that was necessary to write it, and with an increased appetite for the difficult truths Stead was determined to portray. In this regard, "Christina Stead" is everything a literary biography should be.

CITY ON A HILL
Testing the American Dream at City College.
By James Traub.
371 pp. Reading, Mass.:
A William Patrick Book/
Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. $25. 
 THE City College of New York, the heart of James Traub's important book "City on a Hill," was one of the country's great colleges. It turned out Nobel winners in science, playwrights and poets, politicians of value, pioneers in medicine, judges and generation after generation of teachers. And for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers with no money, it was the only key to a life of intellectual fulfillment and professional attainment.
The beautiful thing about C.C.N.Y. was that its students believed that it was the most intellectually moral college in the land. Isn't that a fine thing to be able to hold on to through college, and after? Money or pull could not get you in. City students had barely enough money to meet the tuition charged through most of the school's history: none. And their families had the social clout of herrings.
Brain, only brain, got you in. For decades -- although not always -- that meant a high school average in the high 80's. Brain was then put to the real test: surviving the endless examinations, the chronic professorial irritability, the fear of being dropped from class rolls because the teacher did not like your performance or face and, most of all, the terrifying realization that for the first time in your whole brilliant life you were surrounded by young people much smarter than you.
To the City College student, brain was merit and merit was the essence of American morality. Mr. Traub, even though he had to go to Harvard, has perfect pitch about the meaning of the founding of City College, known first as the Free Academy, in 1847:
"What distinguished City from every other college at its level was its transformative mission. City did not reproduce privilege. . . . City was the most meritocratic of institutions; and because the idea that a man should get ahead according to his abilities, rather than the accident of birth or background, was the core principle of America's free-market society, City had a moral status that no elite college could claim. City was . . . a promise that America kept."
Every day, as these students walked from a subway in Harlem up a hill to City, they saw blacks all around them -- but rarely at the top, in the classrooms and laboratories. They did not put much thought into why almost all the poor but smart kids turned out to be white. But in the late 1960's the civil rights movement insisted that City was not a promise kept but a right denied -- the right of minorities of color to a college education even if they had failed to receive, or to achieve, the decent high school education that had always been thought to be the prerequisite for higher education. Otherwise, according to the new doctrine of "open enrollment," minorities would be caught in an educational trap without ever tasting some of the fruit of the Golden Land.
Mr. Traub, the author of "Too Good to Be True: The Outlandish Story of Wedtech," understands the white students and parents for whom City was a promise and a faith, and he also understands black and Hispanic people for whom it was a taunt and a challenge. This is a deeply reported, lucidly written and clearly thought-out book -- a book of merit.
He started his research hoping to find that the drastic experiment of open admissions had worked. After months of attending college classes, examining records, talking endlessly with students, administrators and teachers, Mr. Traub concluded that open enrollment was a failure. That will be a matter of pain to many students, teachers and administrators. But Mr. Traub writes and thinks with such warmth and understanding -- never condescension -- that his book could turn out to be an asset to City and its survival.
In 1969, the college administration bowed to demonstrations and political pressure. Open admissions transformed City. The admission requirement, Mr. Traub explains, was reduced drastically -- to graduation in the top half of the high school class. Given the
quality of education in so many New York City high schools by then, that was simply surrendering to mediocrity, and everybody knew it.
But City also opened itself to students who had achieved far less than mediocrity. For students who had not managed to master basic subjects even at a high school freshman level, or below, but had been handed a certificate and pushed out the high school door, a whole world of remedial classes was invented and set up within the college.
It is an achingly sad story Mr. Traub tells. In three semesters these remedial classes were supposed to transform into City College students people of 18 or older who could barely read. From one of the most respected institutions of higher learning in the country, City quickly became one of the most ridiculed.
The dropout rate at City today, Mr. Traub calculates, is approximately 55 percent. It would be a lot higher if teachers, not students, made the decisions and dropout became throwout. As Mr. Traub shows, students in the remedial classes are often pushed up to regular college-level classes although teachers know they have failed even at the remedial level. This does away with any distinction between achievement and failure, and puts acceptability even below the lowest common academic denominator.
But consider this about the young people in remedial classes, those who manage to climb out of them and even those whom teachers in desperation shove into regular college classes: Mr. Traub reminds us that they have enough willpower and strength of character to go to City after working nights or between classes. Day after day, then, they summon up the gumption to face the inescapable sense of academic inadequacy. They have enough determination to fight for a taste of America's rewards through education, knowing that the world around them, in the college and outside, is convinced that they will never make it.
Many of these gutsy youngsters fail, as Mr. Traub shows, because they have never received the family and social support and the intellectual and civic discipline, or had instilled in them the lust for knowledge, that allow foreign students educated abroad to succeed at City College despite the extra burden of learning in a foreign language.
These youngsters were sucked into a system -- open enrollment -- based not simply on interest in their academic future, but on anger, politics and sentimentality. I think readers will agree with one of Mr. Traub's saddest conclusions: many of these students are the victims of open enrollment, not its beneficiaries.
From the outside, the inevitable attention paid to open enrollment makes the college seem like an educational desert. But another story is intertwined with Mr. Traub's account of the failure of open enrollment, although it is not told quite as fully or vividly, or pulled together as well. Gardens of intellectual endeavor and achievement not only still grow at City College but also are positively luxuriant.
The school continues to attract many first-class students. Some attend because of economics. Although the college was forced in 1976 to abandon the free tuition that was so important a principle, its tuition fees of about $2,450 a year are still relatively low.
Many go to City because of its world-class school of engineering and fine mathematics and science departments. All these subjects have turned out to be as attractive to black and Hispanic students at City as to Jews and non-Hispanic Roman Catholics a generation or two back. Meanwhile, the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York (the administrative totality of all the municipal colleges) is becoming more and more of a resource to the city, a garden in its own right.
What does this mixture of garden and desert mean? One thing certainly: scuttling or starving out the present City College would be an outrage to all young men and women who have the right to believe that neither money nor pull nor family status will stand between them and higher education. City is now 39 percent black, 28 percent Hispanic, 18 percent Asian, 14 percent white and, as the college administration also notes, 0.4 percent American Indian.
But from a reading of Mr. Traub's book it is clear that continuing remedial classes would be continuing the basic falsehood of open enrollment at City. It is not a means to opportunity but a passage leading from one trap to another.
In a recent letter to me unconnected with the Traub book, Yolanda T. Moses, the president of the college, indicated that the remedial system is being de-emphasized. She says, for instance, that only 234 out of 15,000 students -- 1.5 percent -- now take remedial writing classes. By the spring of 1994, remedial courses over all had been cut to 6.6 percent of the total classes.
MR. TRAUB'S book has two weak points. One, strangely, is that he does not make clear why his book is important to people outside New York who have no involvement in City College but are interested in the health of American higher education. The reason is that under one name or another remedial education is affecting a variety of colleges around the country. This is by no means just City's problem.
The other is that he skimps on suggestions for meeting the problem. One way he touches on would be to send unqualified high school students to the municipal community colleges. But as he knows and says, these schools do not have the career or educational value of the senior four-year colleges.
Maybe the solution section is relatively weak because the only real solution, to Mr. Traub's mind and to mine, is the hardest -- to make sure the job of preparation for college is done where it should be: in the high schools. That would be a lot more useful than trying to push up average-grade entrance requirements or continuing the sorrow of remedial work in colleges.
But such reforms need not end City's critical role as a reasonable and attainable goal for minority students. As a matter of fact, the Jews and non-Hispanic Catholic youngsters who once made up most of the student body used to think that they were the minorities -- getting not an academic break but certainly an economic one. And, would you believe it, it develops that the old-time City College students were not always exactly brilliant. In "City College and the Jewish Poor," published in 1981, Sherry Gorelick had the nerve to suggest as much after examining historical data.
In 1881, only one out of every 11 entrants graduated; most dropped out. As of 1902, 30,000 students had been admitted but only 2,730 graduated. And although the entrance requirement was a grade average of 88 in 1939, in 1924 it was just 60. Ms. Gorelick quotes a graduate of the class of 1924 as saying that the policy of open admissions started in 1970 was a "reversion" to a tradition of open admissions in effect from 1847 to 1930, and that higher standards for admission were instituted then because the college did not have enough seats.
But no matter how many seats, this from Mr. Traub rings true about the fate of the college on the hill, and all other colleges:
"The university is the one site in our culture where knowledge is valued for its own sake, or rather for the free and enlarged views of human life that it affords. Should it lose that sense of purpose, a college would be just another social-service institution. Its sense of standards, of high purposes, would be mere pretensions. And nobody would care especially whether it lived or died."
That has not yet happened to the college on the hill. If enough parents, students, teachers and city officials read Mr. Traub's book as coolly and wisely as he has written it, perhaps it never will.

HEADLINE: SUNDAY VIEW;
For Horton Foote The Pictures Speak Volumes

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby 

 BODY:
THERE'S A SUBLIMELY FUNNY moment in the second act of the Signature Theater Company production of Horton Foote's "Talking Pictures," now Off Off Broadway at the Kampo Cultural Center. A subsidiary character named Gladys, who ran off with another man five years earlier, has suddenly returned home expecting to pick up her marriage where it left off. Willis, the abandoned husband, declines the offer as gently as he can. She's wounded, then outraged. "You men are all alike," she screams at Willis. "Philanderers!" Yet before the act is out, she has already latched onto a new marital prospect. Like so many characters in Mr. Foote's work, Gladys possesses remarkable resilience and tenacity. Though she's noisy and not at all dependable, the grace she displays under fire is genuine.
The Signature Theater Company, which has devoted each of the last three seasons to the work of a single American playwright (Romulus Linney, Lee Blessing and Edward Albee), is thus beginning its Horton Foote season in a way to create exceptionally high expectations. As directed by Carol Goodheart, with a large, very fine cast headed by Hallie Foote, "Talking Pictures" may well turn out to be one of the most entertaining plays of the new theater year, which has scarcely even begun. 
 The scale is small and the focus short. The time is 1929 and the setting the fictional town of Harrison, Tex., not far from the Gulf coast. In spite of geography, Harrison is not much different from the parched Kansas locale of "Picnic" by William Inge, one of Mr. Foote's contemporaries. Both plays deal with love, longing and compromise, broken marriages, missed opportunities and the apparent stasis in small-town life. Yet there is a vast difference between the playwrights. Inge's recollections of the American heartland are drenched in a kind of wish-fulfilling, erotic romanticism that now seems dated and sort of foolish. The Foote plays are cut so close to the bone of reality, they're so uncompromising and clear-eyed in their quotidian concerns, that there's nothing much to date them except the times in which they are set.
That's only one of the revelations in this impeccable production of "Talking Pictures," which will be playing at the Kampo Cultural Center through Oct. 23.
Mr. Foote has the curious distinction of being possibly the least well-known major American playwright today. In part this is because his most celebrated work has not been in the theater but in films, following his career in the 1950's and early 1960's as one of the most successful writers in television's so-called golden age of live drama. He won his first Oscar in 1962 for his adaptation of "To Kill a Mockingbird" (for which Gregory Peck won his Oscar as best actor), and his second in 1983 for "Tender Mercies," an original screenplay that included an Oscar-winning role for Robert Duvall. There was also an Oscar for Geraldine Page in "The Trip to Bountiful" (1985), which Mr. Foote adapted from his television play and Broadway play (1953), both of which starred Lillian Gish.
Since "Only the Heart," his first Broadway play was produced in 1944, Mr. Foote has always remained a practicing playwright. Now 78, he has never stopped writing plays, even as the economics of first Broadway and then Off Broadway made the production of his work increasingly risky. There was a period in the 1970's and 1980's when about the only places you could find his plays in New York were Herbert Berg hof's HB Studio Theater on Bank Street and the Ensemble Studio Theater on West 52d Street. Meanwhile, he continued to write for what might be called mainstream Hollywood. In 1992 he adapted John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" for the MGM film directed by Gary Sinise. More important were his independent movies: "1918" (1984), "On Valentine's Day" (1986) and "Convicts" (1991). These are the pristine but low-budget adaptations of three of his cycle of nine plays, collectively titled "An Orphan's Home." They all are set in Harrison and deal with four generations of one family.
"Talking Pictures," written in 1987 but only now being given its first New York production, is typical of Mr. Foote's best work, which discovers an America not unlike the one we see in Edward Hopper's paintings. Mr. Foote's world initially looks serene. His characters, being plain, seem idealized. They reveal their defining, eccentric spirits only with time. They profess fundamental Christian beliefs, yet they are threatened less often by Satan than by the temptation to surrender to despair. They can't go on, they won't go on, they go on -- sometimes raffishly, like Gladys, sometimes in quiet triumph, like Myra Tolliver.
Myra (Ms. Foote) is the focus of "Talking Pictures," though, as in Chekhov, there are really no minor characters in the play. Each of the 11 roles is so vividly realized, first by the author and then the actor, that you get a sense of community, which becomes an important aspect of the play's total effect.
Myra, who is divorced, plays the piano at the Harrison movie theater (which is still holding out against talkies), earning barely enough to support herself and her teen-age son, Pete (Eddie Kaye Thomas). The two share a cramped rented room in the house of the Jackson family, whose finances also are in trouble. Mr. Jackson (Frank Girardeau), a railroad engineer, has just been "bumped," meaning that he's about to be transferred to another town. Though Myra has a suitor, Willis (Seth Jones), a decent, clean-living construction worker, there's a problem: he's still married to Gladys (Susan Wands) and can't afford to divorce her.
IN ADDITION TO MRS. JACKSON (Alice McLane), the play's community includes the Jacksons' teen-age daughters, Katie Bell (Samantha Reynolds) and Vesta (Sarah Paulson); a sweet, gabby, incredibly cheerful Mexican teen-ager named Estaquio (Isaiah G. Cazares), a would-be Baptist preacher, who has come to Harrison to convert the town's Mexican Roman Catholics; Ashenback (Ed Hodson), the gun-toting paramour Gladys wants to dump, and Gerard Anderson (Kenneth Cavett), Myra's ex-husband, whose hard drinking is responsible for the collapse of his second marriage.
At first "Talking Pictures" unfolds so leisurely, in a series of sometimes short scenes separated by blackouts, that it takes awhile to find its rhythm. This is often the case with Mr. Foote's plays, but that unwillingness to italicize emotions, or to underscore the important moments in any obvious way, is also why the play has the impact it does. It creeps up and dazzles you with moments of extraordinary pathos that alternate with those of uproarious comedy, including a suicide that goes wildly wrong. As the play's first-act curtain must be one of the funniest things Mr. Foote has ever written, the end must be one of the most moving.
In his preface to the printed text of "Talking Pictures," in the volume "Four New Plays," Mr. Foote suggests that "the theater is, or should be (my italics), a collaborative medium." He goes on to say that a theater dominated by the actor, the director, the writer or the producer "is finally a lopsided theater." What is most apparent about the Signature Theater Company production is the teamwork. As the writer and the director serve the actors, the members of this remarkable cast serve them, with the entire group serving the play as a living organism.
The method of the production seems summed up by the beautiful performance of Ms. Foote (the playwright's daughter). Her Myra is simultaneously reserved and outgoing, strong and fragile. The actress is gifted with large, luminous eyes made for stage lighting. There's not a moment in which, without actively taking over the scene, her presence is not felt. In her you see how volatile life in Harrison is beneath its placid surface. Myra faces the loss of her son to her former husband, the loss of the new man she has come to love, and redundancy, 1929-style, when the Queen Theater finally changes over to sound.
Though we all have second thoughts about progress when we reach a certain age, "Talking Pictures" doesn't traffic in easy sentiment or nostalgia. The play is strong, if sometimes wonderfully circular in the way its characters reveal themselves. Mr. Foote's seemingly plain, realistic (but highly condensed) dialogue is responsible for this. In a foreword to the Dramatists Play Service edition of "The Traveling Lady" (1954), Stark Young, the critic, playwright and novelist, wrote:
"As for Horton Foote's dialogue, there is everywhere present a kind of elusive and glowing accuracy. And there is never any sense of arch intention or any sign of the playwright's coquetting with quaintness."
His dialogue requires only that you listen, something that this Signature production makes irresistible.

'Mother And Child'
 Matthew Lombardo's "Mother and Child," now at the McGinn/Cazale Theater on Broadway at 76th Street, is a harrowing but really quite bad play about AIDS, faith and mysticism. The time is Christmas Eve. When the lights come up on a room at St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village, a woman (Helen Harrelson), identified only as Mother in the program, has just arrived from Mississippi to celebrate Christmas with her dying son (Anthony M. Brown), identified as Child. Christmas is also his birthday.
It's snowing. The mother's feet are wet and sore. Her son, with tubes connected to his arm and nose, moves about on the bed in restless sleep. She looks at him sorrowfully. "Imagine," she says at the start of a long monologue, "33 -- my Lord!" Mother talks Mississippi redneck dialogue, makes some jokes about the odd-looking people outside the hospital, tells us about a trip she once took to the Grand Canyon, in this way to establish the milieu from which this Mother and Child sprang, as well as their current situation.
When the son wakes up, it develops that his mother has never acknowledged his homosexuality or the existence of his lover, now dead, who, he says, saved him from a life as a male hustler making between $2,000 and $3,000 a week. "Imagine me," the son says to his mother, "a modern-day Mary Magdalene," which confuses the analogies suggested earlier. "Mother and Child," which was directed by the playwright, is about the need for speaking the truth and for being honest with those you love. Guilt is rampant. The son admits having infected his lover with AIDS. The mother confesses she lied about the circumstances surrounding the son's birth. There is also talk about an immaculate conception, apparently in the belief that it was Jesus and not Mary who was so conceived.
The performances are adequate, meaning that they are far better than the material.

'Down by The Ocean'
 The York Theater Company's "Down by the Ocean," written and directed by P. J. Barry ("The Octette Bridge Club") and now playing at St. Peter's Church, is something seldom seen these days: a comedy in three acts. Four middle-aged men, brothers-in-law, convene every six or eight years on the porch of a Rhode Island summer house while their wives are having a reunion, dealing with children and grandchildren down on the beach. The play's catalyst is the pretty, sexually aggressive young woman who lives next door. Over the course of the three acts (set in 1946, 1952 and 1960), she manages to seduce each of the men for better and for worse.
Though Mr. Barry has command over the craft of playwriting, "Down by the Ocean" isn't that much fun to watch. The play is well made, that is, plotted with some ingenuity, but the characters and the jokes are sitcom thin. Sam Groom, Dennis Parlato, Ross Bickell and John Newton play the often battling brothers-in-law with spirit. Melina Kanakaredes appears as the siren who bewitches them, and Pamela Burrell is the only one of the sisters who ever comes back to the house.
If I had a choice, I'd rather have a month in the country.
 
TALKING PICTURES In Horton Foote's Harrison, Tex., small-town life cuts close to the bone of reality.
 
MOTHER AND CHILD The specter of AIDS adds a few twists to a curious Christmas tale.

HEADLINE: Reminiscences On the 15th St.'Y'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article about the Y.W.C.A. at 7 East 15th Street is historically accurate with respect to this gem of Romanesque architecture and its sale by the "Y" in 1917.But the following quotation is hardly adequate: "Since then 7 East 15th Street has been used as office space, and carelessly altered, although the facade has survived miraculously intact." 
 I believe that the purchaser of the building in 1917 was the woman activist-philantropist Carrie Rand. She called it "The People's House" and it became known as the "Rand School of Social Science." It was the citadel of the American Socialist Party movement and contained some significant associations. Besides the S.P. headed by its frequent Presidential candidate, Eugene V. Debs, there was its youth organization the Young Peoples Socialist League (Yipsels), the editorial offices of "The New Leader" and the top two floors were used by the Jewish labor fraternal order, The Workmen's Circle/Arbeter Ring as its weekend high school -- mittlshul.
I attended this school from 1929 through 1932. Kids from dense Jewish neighborhoods -- Lower East Side, Harlem, Williamsburgh -- came to classes via subway on Saturdays and Sundays absorbing lessons conducted in Yiddish on literature, history and political economy.
In the 20's, Attorney General Mitchell Palmer conducted raids at the Rand School, rifling files and hurling desks, etc. to ferret out the antiwar Socialists suspected of being "Bolshevik subversives."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Flushing's Chinatown;
A Chinatown With a Polyglot Accent

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
SAY "meet me in Chinatown" to most New Yorkers and they start moving toward Canal Street. Most Cantonese-speaking Chinese in town would probably head the same way.
But Mandarin-speakers from Taiwan, or the growing number of Koreans and Asian Indians who have moved to Queens, are as likely to go to Flushing, around Roosevelt Avenue and Main Street, as to Mott or Canal Streets. 
 "Flushing has definitely become the city's second Chinatown," said Roger Lo, a real estate broker from Taiwan who works at A. O. Realty, which specializes in Chinatown properties in New York and on the West Coast.
"It may not be so well known here, but in Taiwan they refer to Flushing as Little Taipei," said Kathleen Petrus, the director of sales and marketing for the Sheraton La Guardia East, a two-year-old hotel on 39th Avenue off Roosevelt Avenue.
Indeed, in less than 15 years, Flushing has turned into a bustling Asian enclave that rivals its much older Manhattan counterpart, if not in size, then certainly in ethnic intensity. Signs on its restaurants and stores are in Chinese as well as English. Its banks, its hardware stores, the Sheraton hotel -- all have Chinese-speaking personnel.
The area, less than four square miles and bounded loosely by Northern Boulevard to the north, Sanford Avenue to the south, College Point Boulevard to the west and Union Street to the east, has attracted other Asian groups as well. Koreatown, as the Chinatown residents call it, is thriving on Union Street between Sanford Avenue and Northern Boulevard and Little India has taken hold on Main Street, south of Franklin Street.
The neighborhood is a transportation hub where bus lines converge on a subway terminus, and the steady flow of middle-income transients through the area has not gone unnoticed by retailers. Caldor, Sterns, Payless Shoes and several other American retailers have opened in Flushing Chinatown. And rents have gotten high. Stores at the intersection of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue, the neighborhood's hub, fetch as much as $80 a square foot at those rare times when one is vacant. And lately, rents are inching up on Main Street, on Prince Street and on other nearby streets.
"The same tenants who would take stores on, say, 34th Street are looking to rent in Flushing," said Barry Fields, a retail broker with the Queens-based Greiner-Maltz real estate firm.
Like its Manhattan counterpart, Flushing Chinatown gets plenty of non-Asians coming through. Manhattan Chinatown attracts a great many tourists on weekends and, during the week, a goodly New York lunch and dinner crowd from the nearby courthouses and Wall Street. It also has a sizable jewelry business, albeit one that was hurt by the recession.
FLUSHING Chinatown has a narrower focus and reach, but it attracts hordes of outsiders nonetheless. Within it is the first -- or last, depending on how one looks at it -- stop on the No. 7 train, whose other terminus is Times Square; commuters from all over Queens and Long Islanduse it for their daily trek to Manhattan. The Long Island Rail Road is just a few blocks away and more than a dozen bus lines have stops within Chinatown's boundaries.
Not surprisingly, in the afterwork hours and on weekends the area's many greengrocers and fish stores are thronged with nonresidents -- Asians who live elsewhere, as well as Caucasians -- picking up that night's dinner fare.
"Those Asians who live in Westchester, or on Long Island, or in other parts of suburbia, they still do their socializing and shopping in Flushing," said Paul Ho, senior vice president in charge of Hong Kong & Shanghai Bank's retail branches.
Still, it is the Taiwanese who gave the area its ambiance and its name, and it is Taiwanese immigration that continues to fuel its growth. In the late 70's and early 80's, many Taiwanese college graduates came to the United States seeking advanced degrees. Some returned to Taiwan, many others chose to stay. They married, had children and sought an area where their children could get a sound American schooling while still remaining conversant with their Chinese culture.
Flushing by then had fallen on hard times. Many of the ethnic groups that had passed through the neighborhood -- Italians, Irish and others -- had put down roots elsewhere. Many of the buildings were rundown, the stores boarded up, the streets deserted. But the schools had a reputation for excellence.
"Where many of the original Cantonese settlers chose Manhattan to be near the harbor, the Taiwanese chose Flushing to be near what they thought were good schools," Mr. Lo said.
Most of those original settlers worked outside the area, taking jobs with Manhattan corporations. But as the neighborhood's Chinese population grew, businesses catering to that population sprang up as well.
Restaurants, bakeries, hair salons and doctors' and lawyers' offices soon dotted the landscape. Warehouses that had been abandoned by American companies or foreclosed on by banks were snapped up by wealthy Taiwanese and used to store food, shoes, garments, luggage -- all sorts of items that could be sold in the area.
"Northern Boulevard used to be dotted with service stations, with a Chevrolet dealership, with a Bond store," said Kaye Min, manager of Chemical Bank's Flushing branch. "Now it's all small, Asian-owned businesses. And on Prince Street, on 41st Road, on Union Street, on all of the nearby back streets, it is the small stores that are making this area boom."
Success has not come easily to them, though. When Mark Lii, a Taiwanese who migrated to the United States in 1980, decided to open a tea shop in 1984, he automatically chose Manhattan's Chinatown.
"We felt we could get customers from all over the country, that Canal and Mott Street were the areas to be," he said. Mr. Lii's Ten Ren Tea and Ginseng Company did quite well on Mott Street almost from the start.
It was rougher with the branch he opened in Flushing in 1988. "I thought the Chinese community in Flushing had really developed, but I have to admit my first two years were hard," he said. "But now, enough people know about us, and business is good."
LOCAL condominiums and homes and commercial buildings also have sold well. Although New York housing prices, even in Queens, are high compared with those in most of the rest of the country, they seem eminently reasonable to many Asians, who are accustomed to the huge housing costs in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan or Singapore. Moreover, several bankers noted, wealthy investors from Hong Kong and Taiwan have been attracted by the perceived political stability of the American Government and prefer investing -- if not necessarily living -- here to investing in Asia.
A result is that in the last eight years or so huge pockets of the neighborhood have been revitalized. On 38th Avenue, rental houses and stores have sprung up on the site of old warehouses. Nearly a decade ago a Chinese investor bought the parcel of land that then housed the RKO movie theater on Main Street near Kissena Boulevard and has since built stores and offices on the site. A former parking lot on 41st Road off Main Street now houses a Chinese-owned apartment building. The old World Journal newspaper building is now the site of the 173-room Sheraton La Guardia, which, while managed by Sheraton, is owned by Taiwanese businessmen.
A group of Taiwanese investors recently paid $10 million for property on 39th Avenue and Prince Street, currently the site of an auto repair shop, and will probably build stores and offices there.
"Ten years ago Flushing was going down the tubes," said Charles Yang, a local insurance broker who emigrated to the United States in 1970 but did not move to Flushing until 1986. "The Indians, the Koreans, the Chinese, they saved this area."
ALTHOUGH the recent recession -- coupled with a diversion of some Chinese immigrants to an even younger Chinatown that is rapidly expanding in Brooklyn's Sunset Park district -- has slowed Flushing Chinatown's growth somewhat, it has not had nearly the impact on the area that it has had elsewhere in the city. According to Mr. Lo, rents have dropped somewhat, but not precipitously. Three-bedroom apartments that might have rented for $1,300 five years ago now go for $1,100; store rents that ranged from $80 to $100 a square foot now range from $50 to $80, while office space that used to command $28 to $30 now can be had for $20 to $25.
"Flushing rents remain high because Oriental people keep moving in," Mr. Lo says. "Even in the recession, few stores or restaurants went out of business, and those that did were bought by other local people."
Local bankers have noticed the same stability. "People in our Flushing branches are not opening and closing accounts every six months," said John Aleffi, Chemical Bank's district manager for North Queens.
PART of the reason, Chinese business people say, is the heavy cultural emphasis the Chinese place on savings. Many Chinese businesses lost money during the latest recession. But instead of going out of business, owners often dipped into their savings to keep themselves afloat.
"Many of our local businesses owners did not make money in the last few years, but their savings let them stay in business," said Mr. Lii, who is president of the Flushing Chinese Business Association.
Even Chinese people who have moved out of the area see Flushing Chinatown's dynamism as a business opportunity. In the early 1980's Zenia Yuan, like many young women, came here from Taiwan to study. She got married, and stayed here. She lives in Forest Hills and has made her living in real estate and finance.
"Along about 1985 or so, I noticed more and more stores and buildings renting and selling to Chinese people in Flushing," Ms. Yuan said. So she bought a building on Main Street and rented it to a clothing store. When that store moved out this year, Ms. Yuan did not seek another tenant. Instead, about seven months ago, she opened her own business, the Mayflower Cafe and Bakery, a Western-style coffee and pastry house. She says she is doing just fine.
Mr. Yang said his insurance business had also taken off. "My business grows because the community grows," he said. "As more Chinese buy property or open businesses, they need more insurance, and they need it from a broker who can explain the policies to them in their language."
Flushing's dozen or so local bank branches have thrived for similar reasons. Well-known American banks like Greenpoint Savings or Chemical Bank coexist with Asian ones like China Trust Bank or Great Eastern Bank. Several local residents say Asian banks generally give higher interest for certificates of deposit, while American banks give better loan rates.
Actually, running a bank in Chinatown is a good-news/bad-news situation. The typically cavalier attitude that many Americans take toward debt -- leverage is synonymous with growth opportunity, credit cards are a means to buy something now that you could not otherwise afford -- is anathema in Chinese culture.
"Chinese people do not feel comfortable borrowing, they consider debt a big weight on their shoulders," said Ms. Min of Chemical Bank. Moreover, added Mr. Ho of Shanghai Bank, there are many alternative sources of funds in Chinatown. "Often, Chinese business owners can get money from wealthy individuals coming from abroad, or from relatives," he said. "And they are usually quite willing to pool their money and open, say, a new restaurant as partners."
But while loan business may be sparse, savings deposits are ample. And since Chinese people are unlikely to take chances with money, what loan business there is, is generally lucrative. Asian culture is such that family members, friends, even acquaintances, will often chip in to help someone in financial trouble, rather than let them renege on their debts. And Chinese people are more likely to assume debt to expand a business that has already been successful, making the loan a better risk for both the borrower and the bank.
"Nonperforming loans are almost nonexistent here," said Mr. Aleffi of Chemical Bank. "The credit character of the Asian market is exceptionally strong."
For all these reasons, banks clearly pursue Asian business. Most Flushing branches, whether American- or Asian-owned, have automatic teller machines that offer transactions in Mandarin as well as English.
CITIBANK has a special Asian Banking Center where Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese are spoken. And most of the banks are open on weekends to accommodate local people who may work in Manhattan but prefer to do their banking in a Chinese-speaking bank.
Local institutions that ignore the demand for Chinese-oriented services do so at their peril. Look at the history of the Sheraton, a now thriving hotel that has become not only the place for visiting Asians, but also the place for local events.
When it opened in February 1992 it marketed itself as an airport hotel with proximity to La Guardia, to Shea Stadium, to the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadow-Corona Park and to transportation to Manhattan rather than its location in the heart of a bustling Chinatown. Floundering is a euphemism for how it fared.
So the hotel changed its approach. It subscribed to Chinese cable television stations for its rooms, provided Chinese newspapers and put together tour packages aimed at Asian travelers. And it sent an Asian salesperson to Beijing, to Shanghai, to Taipei, all over Asia, to call on government offices and persuade them to send delegations to New York. "That opened the floodgates," Ms. Petrus said.
Today the hotel's occupancy is about 50 percent Asian. It is finally also gettting spillover LaGuardia traffic too. It reaped a bonanza from the U.S. Open tennis tournament in Flushing Meadow last month. And it has become a popular spot for local weddings and banquets.
"We advertise in Spanish, Chinese and Korean newspapers," Ms. Petrus said. "We've learned that marketing to the ethnic community really works."

HEADLINE: Reveille for New Rochelle's Abandoned Army Fort?

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN 

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE

 BODY:
FOR 27 years, Davids Island, lying unoccupied in Long Island Sound just off this Westchester County city, has enticed developers. Many consider its 78 level acres the best undeveloped real estate left along the New York State coastline.
But since 1987, when the city bought the former military base 18 miles north of Manhattan, potential buyers have found city officials eager for tax revenue but divided by political squabbles. They have also found that the island's fragile environment is fiercely defended by environmentalists and strict state and county regulations. 
 During the Civil War, New Rochelle residents were grateful for the quarter-mile of water separating them from the 3,000 soldiers, mostly Confederate, hospitalized on the island. In later years, they enjoyed the smell of fresh bread wafting over from the Army cooking school and the stirring music of the Fort Slocum band.
Access has been the main impediment to developing the island. Two years ago, the City Council rejected a vision by Xanadu Properties Associates, a group headed by Bruce Stark, a Hawaii-based developer. First proposed 11 years earlier, the $1 billion residential housing plan called for 1,750 condominium units with access to the mainland by a 3,465-foot bridge. The Council, certain that the project, especially the bridge, would never get state and county approvals, turned it down.
Now, with a new pro-development city administration intent on breathing new life into this economically battered "Queen City of the Sound," officials here hope that renewed interest in the island can be a catalyst for reviving the downtown.
In the last two months suitors have been lining up for the right to develop the island. Among them is Donald Trump, the Manhattan developer and casino owner, who sketched an initial proposal before the City Council in July. It called for 2,000 residential units, the number already approved under the city's urban renewal plan for the island.
Last Tuesday Mr. Trump presented a more detailed residential-retail development plan at a City Council meeting. It calls for 2,000 one-, two- and three-bedroom condominiums in three 22-story buildings and 200 one-, two- and three-bedroom condominiums in a 45-story tower. It also includes a 1,000-slip marina, a small retail complex and parking for 3,500 cars. Ferry service would provide transportation to the island and the public would be able to use the marina, the shops and park and beach sites.
In his presentation, Mr. Trump said his proposal was "conceptual" and promised to work with the City Council, residents and skeptical environmentalists to reach agreement on a detailed plan that would meet Federal and state regulations.
Although the Trump organization wants exclusive rights to redevelop the island, Mr. Trump said he would consider a partnership with Westchester County, which would like the island converted to parkland.
Westchester County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke has proposed buying the island for a park facing the county-owned Glen Island Park and connected to it by a ferry. The idea has generated little support among the city's 67,000 residents, except from environmental groups. Many residents are equally skeptical about a proposal by the Davids Island Development Company, a consortium of smaller developers formed to create a family entertainment park with a water park, amphitheater, health club and earth science center and a magnetic monorail to get people to it.
Mayor Timothy C. Idoni said he was pleased by Mr. Trump's readiness to negotiate with a variety of groups and avoid the bitter fights that characterized the last attempt to develop Davids Island. The Council is expected to decide on a developer before the end of October.
Not everyone was as sanguine as the Mayor.
"THE buildings around the perimeter will look like a medieval fortress multiplied by 10," said Robert G. Tritsch, a member of the board of Federated Conservationists of Westchester County, a coalition of environmental groups.
And Jeffery Rogg, a member of the board of the New Rochelle Economic Development Council, said: "We need far more detail. Davids Island must be part of the overall development of the city."
The Davids Island initiative is, in fact, part of Mayor Idoni's plans to increase the tax base in a city that has suffered a 30 percent loss in ratables in the last decade. The downtown's major retail tenants, including Arnold Constable, Bloomingdale's and Macy's, have left, following their customers to more prosperous places farther north.
The vacant storefronts have contributed to a stable crime rate, Mayor Idoni said, because "there have to be people to rob." The loss of ratables, however, has more than doubled the school district tax rate, which went from $97.034 per $1,000 in 1985-86 to the current $201.78.
Last year, shortly after New Rochelle beat out 72 other applicants as the preferred site for a new Unicef headquarters, the United Nations agency decided to stay in New York City. But Unicef's interest, city officials say, gave the city international visibility, increased developer inquiries and gave elected leaders a determination to redevelop their downtown.
"The Unicef deal we offered in New Rochelle made economic sense and expansion sense," said the city's development director, Joseph G. Madonna. "Unicef's interest proved we're not just bumblers up here."
After Unicef's decision, New Rochelle hired Arthur Anderson Consultants to develop a blueprint for downtown redevelopment focused on a four-block area of mostly vacant storefronts. As a result of the report's recommendations, the City Council recently voted funds to widen streets, plant trees and improve signage. They have also hired two people to oversee the downtown redevelopment and guide citywide economic development.
In September the city issued requests for a plan to develop a large-scale mixed-use project on a 4.5-acre city-owned site in the Lawton Street Urban Renewal Area, part of the Unicef site.
The city has been buoyed by the arrival of two new "big-box" retail stores downtown. Three months ago, Price Club, a discount retail chain, opened a 100,000-square-foot outlet on the former Joyce Beverage site. Business has been brisk and city officials expect it to generate $1 million in annual sales tax revenue.
At the other end of the city, another discount retailer, Home Depot, has bought a $1 million option on 12 acres of city-owned land, a former incinerator site. Negotiations have been opened with a third discount retailer, B.J.'s, to occupy an additional 12 acres at that site.
The property, in the midst of an abandoned industrial area lining Weyman Avenue, is just 200 yards from Exit 15 of the New England Thruway. "Our location is superb," Mr. Madonna said. "We're in the middle of an excellent road system and we are strategically situated in southern Westchester."
The City Council is currently considering a proposal by the RoBach Development Company of Ardsley to convert 10 acres of shoreline from its current use as a storage area for the city's garbage trucks to a luxury sports and leisure club with tennis and squash courts, a health club and dock.
FOUR weeks ago, representatives of the Equitable Life Assurance Society visited New Rochelle to discuss using the city-owned Unicef site, slightly more than 4 acres, for its headquarters.
The property is near the proposed $30 million Intermodal Transportation Center downtown, which will combine Amtrak and commuter rail service with local and long-distance bus service. Momentum on the project has picked up since Amtrak agreed earlier this year not to move its station from the downtown area.
Sydney P. Mudd, president of the Joyce Beverage Company until it was sold 10 years ago, has chaired the city's Economic Development Council and its committee to bring Unicef to New Rochelle. A city resident for 53 years, Mr. Mudd has watched the city prosper and decline.
"It's a dream to expect New Rochelle to be what it once was," Mr. Mudd said, "but we'll always be a good place. Now, we are emerging as a city that wants to do well."

HEADLINE: Parochial Schools on the Comeback Trail

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
PATRICIA FINCH scrubbed decades of dirt off the desks at St. John's School in Old Saybrook in preparation for classes. St. John's, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Norwich, was reopened this fall after being closed for 20 years. Mrs. Finch, one of many volunteers to cleaned and painted the school building, remembered sitting at the same desks when she was a pupil at St. John's. The thought that she was helping to refurbish them for her two children, whom she enrolled this year, made the work easier, she said. "Those desks are antiques, mind you," she said. "If it weren't for the Formica tops, my initials might have been there. I might have been scraping my bubblegum from one of those desks."
The reopening of St. John's and St. Bridget Catholic Elementary School in Cheshire, part of the Archdiocese of Hartford, marks a reversal in a decade of Catholic school closings due to rising costs and a shortage of nuns and priests. The Norwich diocese, which includes Windham, Tolland, Middlesex and New London counties and Fishers Island, N.Y., plans to open regional middle schools in the Montville and Putnam areas in the next 18 months and at least three day care centers in the New London, Willimantic and Putnam areas, the superintendent of schools for the diocese, Howard B. Bennett, said. 
 Catholic schools are popular once again with parents who want education for their children that emphasizes discipline and values, Mr. Bennett said. Mrs. Finch and other parents in Old Saybrook, many of whom attended Catholic schools themselves, said they want an environment free of the violence that has invaded urban and suburban public schools. And they welcome the sight of a principal wearing a long, black habit instead of street clothes.
"The more technologically advanced we become, the more people want to go back to the way people used to be," said Mary Anne Knight of Old Saybrook, whose son is in first grade at St. John's. "You can do as much as you can at home, but when children are away the majority of the day, it's very hard to maintain what you want to instill in them." Mrs. Knight's two daughters, who were in public school through the eighth grade, attend a Catholic high school in Middletown. "I'm very concerned about the lack of discipline in public schools," Mrs. Knight said. "The good children end up suffering. They have to sit and listen while others are disciplined."
School officials, facing difficult economic times, kept schools going in the Norwich and Bridgeport dioceses and the Archdiocese of Hartford by either combining them or establishing schools that serve a region instead of a single church community. St. John's is serving nine parishes, including Clinton, Essex, Old Lyme and East Lyme, Mr. Bennett said. Families in those towns and in Old Saybrook who want to send their children to Catholic schools have had to send them to Groton, New London or Middletown.
The Hartford archdiocese, which covers Hartford, New Haven and Litchfield counties, has closed 20 schools in the past 10 years. "We're struggling to keep the inner city schools going," the superintendent of schools for the archdiocese, the Rev. Zigford J. Kriss, said. "We're starting to consolidate, or merge, schools." As people leave the cities to live in the suburbs, Father Kriss said, urban schools are closing their doors and schools like St. Bridget are reopening. The archdiocese, which had not opened a school in 10 years, reopened St. Bridget, formerly a junior high school, for pre-kindergarten through first grade.
The Bridgeport diocese, which includes Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport and some suburban areas, began reorganizing its schools three years ago. Schools formerly owned and operated by church parishes were merged and the diocese was divided into 10 regions, each managed by a board of education and a board of directors, the superintendent of schools, Armand Fabbri, said. In a region with four schools and 10 churches, for example, all 10 parishes share responsibility for the schools. "We made a better financial base for their support," Mr. Fabbri said, "and it's working very well."
The reopening of the schools in Old Saybrook and Cheshire comes after a 10-year decline in Catholic school population throughout the state. Enrollment in the Norwich diocese dropped 22 percent over the last decade to 5,998 from 7,668, according to the diocesan school office. About 6,300 students are expected this year, Mr. Bennett said. The Hartford archdiocese, which had 32,000 students 10 years ago, expects an enrollment of about 24,500 for the 1994-95 school year, Father Kriss said. And the number of students in the Bridgeport diocese this year increased about 3 percent over last year to 11,500 from 11,200, Mr. Fabbri said.
A solid majority of the members of St. John's Church who responded to a survey last June supported reopening the school. But 58 percent of those surveyed said they did not believe St. John's should support the school financially. And members of the parish council, which conducted the survey, expressed concern that since 34 percent opposed the reopening, parish unity might be weakened.
The president of the council, Robert Breault of Deep River, said he realized that change takes place slowly. "I think it's fair to say that in any endeavor, there are always people on all sides of the issue. Change takes some stretching, learning and adapting," Mr. Breault said. "That will be true of this process as well."
Parishioners' children attending St. John's receive $500 toward their tuition from the parishes. Tuition costs $1,650 a year, Mr. Bennett said. Anticipating an increasing interest in Catholic education, the diocese expects to raise $10 million to $15 million over the next five years to support its schools, the bishop of the diocese, Daniel P. Reilly, said.
"We haven't closed a school in the diocese in the last 20 years. We don't close schools here," Bishop Reilly added. "I was convinced something good would happen and the trend would turn around. Schools have always been the backbone of our mission in this country. So we held on."
Mr. Bennett, who was a public school superintendent for 28 years, said he anticipates the resurgence in Catholic schools throughout the United States will continue into the 21st century. "Some of the factors causing this resurgence relate to violence, drugs and crime in general that have infiltrated our public schools in rural, suburban, as well as urban areas throughout the United States," Mr. Bennett said in a speech he gave last February at a meeting of the Federation of Catholic School Parents.
A voucher system, which would allow parents to choose schools for their children, is being considered in 19 states, including Connecticut. "I for one do not think that the voucher system, or 'choice in education,' will come any time soon to this state," Mr. Bennett said. "I am convinced, however, that it will come. This is why the Norwich diocesan schools, 21 elementary and 6 secondary, are preparing for that eventuality."
A spokesman for the state Department of Education, Thomas W. Murphy, defended the public schools. "Violence is really a function of the neighborhoods, suburban or urban. In a violent culture, it can happen anywhere," Mr. Murphy said. "Schools are becoming more violent as a result of the culture. But on a balance, they are among the safest places."
With fewer nuns and priests available to teach, the Norwich diocese plans to raise the salaries of lay teachers, Mr. Bennett said. Starting salaries for lay teachers in Catholic schools range from $15,000 to $18,000 a year, the principal of St. John's, Sister Marie-Alberta, said. By contrast, the starting salary for a public school teacher in Connecticut is about $30,000.
Despite this gap in pay, 100 people applied for eight teaching positions at St. Joseph's, said Sister Marie-Alberta. "There's a different kind of atmosphere here and a different approach to discipline. If they are very religious, the teachers want to be able to talk about that, and they can't do that in public schools," she said.
Parents facing their children's college tuition costs used to think the Catholic elementary and secondary schools were too expensive, Bishop Reilly said. "I can understand that. In the late 1970's, mid-80's and into the 90's, our enrollments were falling because of that," the Bishop said. "But now there's a certain chaotic element that has touched public schools in a dramatic way, neutralizing the teaching of moral values. And parents are saying, 'We want something more for our children.' "
Everyone in the Norwich diocese knows the schools are a priority, Bishop Reilly said, but convincing those who resist the idea of opening schools takes patience. "They'll see those kids and what they bring into the community, and they'll say, 'How did the parish exist without the schools?' " he said.

HEADLINE: Q and A

 BODY:

Neighbor Is No Fan of a Ceiling Fan
 
Q I live in a condominium unit in Westchester County. The owner of the apartment below me installed a ceiling fan in his bedroom, which is below my bedroom. When the fan is turned on I can hear the cyclical sound of what I believe is the fan's motor. The sound is loud and annoying enough to prevent me from getting an adequate amount of sleep. 
 When I have spoken to the unit owner he has been sympathetic and willing to make arrangements to investigate and cure the problem. He said an electrician looked at the fan, but the fan noise still penetrates into my bedroom. I had a good quality wall-to-wall carpet installed, but to no avail. Now the owner does not even return my phone calls anymore. The property manager says the problem should be resolved between the unit owners involved.
I have spoken with the tenant in the unit and he avoids using the fan often or keeps it at the slowest speed, which is still very audible. I have offered to defray any costs necessary to eliminate the fan noise.
The condominium plan states that "no nuisances shall be allowed upon the property nor shall any use or practice be allowed which is a source of annoyance to occupants or which intereferes with the peaceful possession and proper use of the property by its residents." Can noise from a ceiling fan be considered a nuisance? If so, can I prove it? I prefer to avoid litigation. What options do I have? . . . Anthony Rossitto, Harrison, N.Y.
 
A According to Ronald A. Sher, a White Plains lawyer, Mr. Rossitto may possibly seek recourse against the unit owner or the condominium, "if the condition from the fan vibration or excessive noise constitutes an unreasonable interference with quiet enjoyment or otherwise violates the warranty of habitability."
Mr. Sher suggests that the writer first review the condominium's declaration and bylaws to determine if board permission was required for the installation and that Mr. Rossitto ask the board to ascertain if the installation was performed by a licensed electrician in conformance with the building code. He said a qualified engineer or contractor should conduct an inspection of the equipment to recommend ways of alleviating the condition.
"Assuming a proper installation, the settlement of subjective quality-of-life issues, specifically involving excessive-noise complaints, is difficult," he said. "The board may attempt to mediate a resolution or consider a formal referral to impartial arbitration."
Failing that, he said, the writer may consider litigation against the board and the unit owner. "The writer will be required to submit proof from an expert establishing that the fan vibration and noise level constitutes an unreasonable interference with quiet enjoyment or otherwise violates the warranty of habitability," Mr. Sher said.
 
Seeking Exemption From Rent Rises
 
Q I am 66 years old. I lost my job on Sept. 1. I have lived in a rent-stabilized apartment since 1964. If I do not find a new job my only income will be Social Security. Am I eligible for a Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption? . . . Marie Tafaro, Brooklyn.
 
A Possibly, said Lou Ganim, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which oversees rent administration in New York City. In the city, if a tenant or a tenant's spouse is 62 or older and lives in a rent-regulated apartment; if the combined household disposable income is $16,500 a year or less, and if they are paying at least one-third of their disposable income for rent, the person who is 62 or older may apply for the exemption.
If the tenant qualifies, he or she is exempt from future rent-guidelines increases, maximum base rent increases, fuel-cost adjustments and increases based on the owner's economic hardship and major capital improvements.
The program is administered in the city by the Department for the Aging. Applications should be filed with the Department for the Aging, SCRIE Division, 150 William Street, Fourth Floor, New York N.Y. 10038. Telephone: (212) 240-7000.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Saugatuck;
An Immigrant Haven, a Sailor's Delight

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
WITH its toe protruding into Long Island Sound, the Saugatuck neighborhood at the southwestern corner of Westport resembles the boot of Italy, facing east toward its mate across the sea. It lends credence to the commonly held belief that European immigrants settle in areas of America that remind them of home.
"In the mid-1800's Westport farmers, the railroad, and anyone else who needed cheap labor would meet the shiploads of immigrants at the docks in New York, promising them jobs and homes," said Margaret Lebedis, a guide at the Westport Historical Society. 
 "That's how many Italians wound up here. Sometimes it took 20 years to pay off their debt as indentured laborers. It was common practice in those days."
Saugatuck's Italian laborers founded what has become something of an ethnic aberration in wealthy, cosmopolitan, suburban Westport. The enclave is now a working-class neighborhood of one- and two-family houses and businesses clustered around the Saugatuck railroad station, a hub of shops, food markets, restaurants, marinas and service companies that supply the entire peninsula with most of its needs.
Its houses, owned by such families as the Lucianos, DeMatteos, Nisticos and Valiantes, have been passed on from generation to generation and when they are for sale, usually under $200,000, it is by word of mouth or a small ad in The Westport News.
Beginning in the 50's the population of Saugatuck swelled with people from many ethnic and economic backgrounds, and the Italian sons and daughters moved up into the professions and business ownership, fueling a homogenization of Saugatuck that went largely unnoticed except by some oldtimers. "Now you hardly know anybody," complained Lillian Bottone, a lifelong resident. "Everybody used to be so close."
Saugatuck residents are passionate about their neighborhoods, whether they live in the crowded Italian section, in the spacious tree-shaded homes down Saugatuck Avenue, or the water-oriented properties at the foot of the boot.
Saugatuck Island, at the very toe southeast of Canal Road, is inhabited by about 100 families and joined to the mainland along the Saugatuck River side by a 60-foot-long, single-lane bridge reinforced with crude wooden planks, and on the Long Island Sound side by a causeway that occasionally floods under very high tides. But that's part of the charm.
"We moved here seven years ago because it's the most beautiful place we had ever seen," said Lynne Del Monte, an island resident out for a recent morning stroll.
All island householders belong to The Saugatuck Island Owners Association, to which they pay dues of $150 a year for road repairs and snow plowing. The association also maintains a private boat launch and two small beaches, and when the "clamming is open" sign is posted islanders can count on shellfish for dinner.
SAUGATUCK SHORES, northwesterly and just above Saugatuck Island, and the island itself are dense with homes -- everything from rebuilt fishing shacks to waterfront mansions. They sell from the mid-$300,000's to $2 million or more, and increase in value as the supply of waterfront dwindles.
Properties range in size from a rare acre or two down to a quarter-acre and the proverbial postage-stamp size, tucked behind other houses along gravel-covered lanes. So little land is available that new homes are built by buying old ones and razing them.
"Celebrities and privacy-seekers tend to buy in northern Westport," said Marta Flavin, a broker with Riverside-Shavell Realty. "Saugatuck houses are too close together for their taste." But Saugatuck summer rentals to celebrities are common, priced up to $30,000 for two months.
Joseph P. Arcudi, Westport's First Selectman and the son of an immigrant, is concerned about the revaluation of all town property, required by the state every 10 years, and due to be completed and in force by Oct. 1, 1995. "More than 250 people came to a meeting last month to discuss the ramifications," he said. "Most of them were waterfront property owners. Their value has gone up more than any others."
The decline in value of commercial property, which accounts for 20 percent of Westport's $3 billion worth of real estate, will shift an additional tax burden onto householders. Currently, Westport's tax rate is in the lower third statewide and houses are selling well, thus increasing their value and tax liability, said Mr. Arcudi.
"It seems like every other couple that comes into the office has a baby, or the wife is pregnant," said Sarita Solomon, a broker with William Raveis Realty on Riverside Avenue. "Saugatuck is attractive to young people because of the wide range of house styles and prices. It's possible to find a house under $300,000."
A principle reason for choosing Westport is its public schools: three elementary and two middle schools and one high school, which consistently produces S.A.T. scores that exceed state and national averages by 50 to 80 points.
The current baby boom required an addition of six classrooms and a library-media center to the King's Highway Elementary School, which Saugatuck children attend. Another addition will soon be necessary at the Bedford Middle School, but Staples High School will not be affected.
Westport's reputation for academic excellence is enhanced by award-winning programs in music, art, drama and sports, extended kindergarten hours from 8:30 A.M. to 1:15 P.M., the first FM radio station in the Northeast operated by high school students, a regional program for handicapped children, foreign languages from grade 5 on, and a predominance of teachers with master's degrees and doctorates whose average salary is $60,000.
In addition, there are 13 privately operated preschools and day-care centers, where child-care services for infants as young as 6 weeks, from 7:30 A.M. to 6 P.M. five days a week, cost around $200. Detailed information is available through the Pupil Personnel Department at Staples High School.
Westport's only private school is Greens Farms Academy, a day school where tuition for kindergarten to Grade 12 ranges from $10,700 to $13,600.
Recreation for the people of Saugatuck focuses on the water. Those who do not have a private dock can join the Cedar Point Yacht Club, with 150 slips, or Saugatuck Harbor Yacht Club. Cedar Point charges an initiation fee of $1,000 and $1,000 a year dues, with slip fees of $16 to $25 a foot per season. Saugatuck Harbor, with 160 slips at fees of $35 to $45 a foot, charges $1,000 in dues. But E. Don Smith, the club's commodore, would not disclose the initiation fee.
Both clubs are for serious sailors and neither has a restaurant or a bar, but their kitchens are at the disposal of members or caterers.
THE municipal Longshore Country Club on the east shore of the Saugatuck River, has a waiting list for its two marinas, which have a total of 245 slips (with fees of $13 to $20 a foot per season) and 183 moorings, but the golf course and 9 tennis courts are available to residents for $20 a season.
Greens fees are $7 to $13 daily, or $75 for the season. Tennis fees are $2 to $6 for an hour and a half, or $70 for the season and the fees apply to three other municipal locations with a total of 17 courts elsewhere in Westport.
Nearly a dozen restaurants of many ethnicities, but mostly Italian, thrive in Saugatuck. They include DeRosa's, specializing in northern Italian cuisine. A 10-ounce loin veal chop stuffed with fontanella cheese is $14.95. The Mansion Clam House features 1-pound lobsters with corn on the cob and salad for $18.95.
Cultural amenities in Westport proper include the Westport Country Playhouse, founded as a straw-hat theater in the 1930's by the Theater Guild of New York; the Westport Arts Center, where exhibitions, music, dance, lectures and art classes are scheduled all year; and the Nature Center for Environmental Activities.
Resident permits for three Westport beaches cost $20 a season, and admission to the 234-acre Sherwood Island Beach State Park off Exit 18 of I-95 is $5 weekdays, $7 weekends for residents, $8 and $12 for out-of-staters.
Shops on Main Street in downtown Westport include Barney's, The Gap, Coach leather goods, Williams-Sonoma, Joan & David and dozens of one-of-a-kind boutiqes. A new public library is off Route 1 near the Levitt Pavilion, where free summer concerts are held on the riverbank.
A Saugatuck relic of the early 1800's, when farmers sent their onions to New York by boat, the Bridge Street bridge over the Saugatuck River swings sideways to let vessels pass. David Haehl's great-grandfather was one of six men who operated the hand crank before the bridge was motorized. He also built the house that the family still lives in.
Descended from early Dutch, Irish and Scottish stock, Mr. Haehl is a dedicated Saugatucker. "We consider ourselves different from Westporters," said Mr. Haehl. "We've been here longer, and we stay here."

Today the event goes on for four days and has grown so large, with food, entertainment, merchandise for sale, and a huge parade, that it is held in the parking lot of the railroad station and attracts around 110,000 visitors from Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. Saugatuck's old-timers still pin money on the statue in the old way, and linger at the booth that displays pictures of their immigrant forebears.

HEADLINE: Indian Point and the Bottom Line

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: CROTON-ON-HUDSON

 BODY:
THE Indian Point 3 nuclear plant in Buchanan is either a dinosaur, unable to compete economically against younger technologies in a changing environment, or it is a valuable asset that is getting much-needed changes in management and worker training so it can resume saving money for its customers.
The New York Power Authority, the country's largest state-owned utility, which owns the plant and takes the second view, squared off last week against critics of the plant -- proponents of the dinosaur theory -- in a legislative hearing here that is likely to be only the first of a series of debates that will take a 30-year dispute about nuclear power in Westchester into a new phase: economics. 
 The discussions will boil down to a giant, complex game of "what if."
The factors involved are stunning in their variety. There is the cost of competing fuels, especially natural gas; the level of industrial demand for electricity, the success of future campaigns to increase energy efficiency and the life expectancies of other generating stations around the state, nuclear and non-nuclear.
There is also the question of how much money can be safely cut from the plant's budget, and whether some unforeseen event, at Indian Point 2 or 3 or at any of 107 other reactors nationwide -- or several hundred around the world -- will create the need for changes at the plant.
When it produces power at all -- which it has not done in 19 months because of safety problems and will not do before next spring at the earliest -- Indian Point 3's electricity costs more than power from the open market, about 4.4 cents a kilowatt-hour, opposed to about 3 cents for electricity available on an hour-by-hour basis through the power grid.
At the heart of the problem is high operating costs and a statewide surplus of more than 4,000 megawatts. (The peak demand for power in the state is about 26,000 megawatts.) Not counted in that surplus is the cushion of 22 percent that the state's utilities like to have on hand in case of breakdown or maintenance shutdown.
Opponents believe surplus opens up the best opportunity to close Indian Point 3 since the early 1980's, the years immediately after the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, Pa., when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission insisted on better emergency plans, and the reactors at Indian Point, with nearly 300,000 people within 10 miles, had difficulty complying. The hearings in the 1980's on the adequacy of emergency plans for the site in Buchanan were the longest in the history of the commission.
Now, some people want to try again.
"You'd have to have a relatively significant savings to justify the public-health risk, and the data is, it's more expensive," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Greenburgh and chairman of the State Assembly's Environmental Conservation Committee, who held a hearing on the plant's economics in Croton last week.
Here, though, all estimates rely on "what ifs." What, for example, would the surplus look like if every plant were subjected to a hardheaded cost analysis?
S. David Freeman, the president of the Power Authority, testified that for now his agency "could probably purchase power at a price lower than the total embedded capital and operating costs of Indian Point 3. However, if every plant that is high cost in the short-term wholesale market in New York State were shut down, we'd be very short of power."
And in that case, utilities would be forced to run their most expensive plants, the ones that burn the most expensive fuels or burn them the least efficiently, and the result would be higher costs. At that point, experts say, Indian Point 3's power might look cheap again.
Another "what if" is what happens if the plant runs no better in future than it did in the past.
"Today the plant is uneconomic," Mr. Freeman said in an interview. "It's had a bad run the last year and a half; it's dead in the water." But new management and new attitudes will make it run better, he said; besides, most of the work required for reopening the plant has already been done.
If the plant is retired now, he said, it would be on the basis of imperfect information. "I don't know the future, and I don't think anybody else does," he said. "One can have lots of projections for future natural gas prices, and somebody in all of this world is going to be right, but if you look at the past, there haven't been many of them."
On the other hand, Charles Komanoff, an energy analyst, said in testimony that if the plant is kept running, it would also be on the basis of uncertain assumptions.
Mr. Freeman, who was instrumental in canceling several nuclear construction projects when he was the chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, said that he would not hesitate to pull the plug if it did not appear that the plant could run well. Before coming to the Power Authority in March, he was the general manager of the Sacramento, Calif., Municipal Utility District, an agency he joined shortly after voters there decided to shut their nuclear plant, Rancho Seco.
The error there, Mr. Freeman said, was spending hundreds of millions of dollars to fix up the plant and then finding out that it still would not run reliably. But Indian Point 3 deserves another chance, he said, and some cost-saving measures have not been explored, like merging security forces and spare-parts inventories with Indian Point 2, Con Edison's reactor, which is adjacent. Some people want to close Indian Point 2 also, but it runs more reliably so its power is cheaper, and closing it would be more complicated because the state does not own it. Indian Point 1, also operated by Con Edison, ran from 1962 to 1974.
Mr. Freeman did not offer a detailed analysis but said he would confer with Mr. Komanoff to see why their assessments differed. Despite the fact that the two appeared in conflict at the hearing last week, the two are longtime allies, proponents of investing in conservation.
But another state official, Francis J. Murray Jr., the State Energy Commissioner, did present an analysis that favored the plant. He sketched out four possibilities, each with a different combination of retirement dates: nuclear plants 30 to 40 years old and fossil plants 45 to 60 years old. He also threw into the mix varying levels of demand-side management, meaning utility subsidies to customers to invest in motors, lamps, air-conditioners and other equipment that uses less electricity.
Under certain assumptions, he demonstrated, retiring the plant now would mean requiring new generating capacity as early as 2003, which is so close in utility terms that a company that thought it would need a new generator then would be actively planning it now. With a different set of assumptions, no new capacity is needed before 2009.
The electric system currently allows expensive plants to operate, a situation that economists describe as inefficient, because most customers are not free to shop for cheaper supplies elsewhere. The Power Authority's single largest customer, New York City and its various governmental agencies, would like to shop that way and anticipates that in a few years, with changing Federal and state laws, it will be able to, paying Con Edison to deliver the power over its lines.
Already, the threat of a free market in electricity has helped prompt the Power Authority to offer the city a long-term contract, making the authority's pain over the reactor more acute. Thus Kent Miller, the city's director of energy policy, said the city did not care what happened to the reactor, because it expects a contract that will insulate it from the cost increases that come when the plant is shut.
But if the market opens up to allow users to negotiate with producers without the utility as a middleman -- a practice known as retail wheeling -- selling expensive electricity from Indian Point could become even more difficult.
Illustrating the degree to which the problems of energy are interconnected with other problems, Mr. Miller said, New York City would not favor closing the plant if the Power Authority planned to make up the lost production by burning more oil and natural gas at the Polletti generating station in Queens. That would add to the city's air pollution problems, he said.
Looming over the plant is another possibility, that expenses will rise instead of fall. In Albany, the Department of Environmental Conservation is considering requiring power plants on the Hudson to build cooling towers so they can use their cooling water over and over, drawing only small amounts to make up for evaporation rather than running water through the cooling system only once, as they do now. The current system pulls small fish into the plant and kills them.
The cost of a cooling tower has been variously estimated. Mr. Freeman said it might be $200 million, probably too much to justify continuing to operate the plant.

HEADLINE: A Building to Love, but Not to Buy

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
THE most expensive item on display these days at Ralph Lauren's flagship store on Madison Avenue is not the tartan socks ($21), or the mohair skirts ($365) or even the leopard-accented throws ($2,165). It's the building it's all housed in.
Called the Rhinelander mansion after the grande dame who built it 96 years ago, the little architectural gem can be had for a cool $46 million -- cash and carry. 
 The building's owner, an Irish real-estate concern that acquired several trophy properties before falling on hard times, quietly put the mansion on the block more than two years ago and has yet to find a buyer at the asking price.
The green, bound, confidential sales memorandum, shows why the building is hard to unload. Like many one-of-a-kind assets from the Star of India to London Bridge, the bauble may be lovely to own, but don't count on it to pay the bills.
"It's easy to fall in love with this building, but from an economic point of view, I just don't see how it works," said Therese Byrne, publisher of Retail Maxim, a newsletter analyzing retail real estate.
Yet it's also easy to understand why many acquisitive types might at least toy with the idea. The four-story, faux French chateau is one of the city's best-known and beloved structures. Sitting primly on the southeast corner of Madison Avenue and 72d Street, it serves as a gatekeeper to one of the world's toniest shopping streets and is itself the home of one of the country's most chronicled emporiums, officially the highest-grossing store of the Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation.
"Every part of this building exudes personality," coos the American Institute of Architects' Guide to New York City.
But the Rhinelander has often been a building shunned. Even Gertrude Rhinelander Waldo, the wealthy blue blood who commissioned the building in 1895 for $500,000, preferred to stay in her old digs across Madison Avenue when it was completed in 1898.
The Dime Savings Bank foreclosed on the property in 1912, and it changed hands eight more times by 1989, when the current owners arrived on the scene. They paid a then astronomical $43 million -- a record $1,500 a square foot.
Even Mark T. De Riemer, the broker who was hired six months ago to market the property, acknowledged, "with a unique asset like this, you have to cast a pretty wide net to find an investor who's willing to buy the most exquisite real estate property in New York."
The property offers an extremely low return on investment, given current market norms. It relies entirely on one tenant who has considerable leverage when it comes time to renegotiate the rent. And the rent is already high by Madison Avenue standards.
"I would say this isn't a prudent investment," said Edward A. Friedman, president of Newmark Real Estate Services and a specialist in Manhattan's high-rent retail districts. "But I won't say no one would buy it. Look at what was paid for the Empire State building."
Assuming a buyer paid for the Rhinelander all in cash, his annual return would be only 6.2 percent, according to the sales document. "Anyone sitting around with $46 million in cash is going to be looking for a much better return," said C. Bradley Mendelson, senior managing director at the Edward S. Gordon company, a Manhattan brokerage.
The rent is up for renegotiation on Jan. 1, and real estate analysts estimate that annual payments could jump from $2.83 million to $3.33 million, a 17 percent increase at a time when rents along the rest of the avenue have stabilized.
Ralph Lauren, who owns 64.8 percent of Polo Ralph Lauren, has never minded paying up to showcase his designs in a luxurious setting.
A customer laden with packages, leaving the building on Thursday night, said he believes Mr. Lauren was getting his money's worth. "When you enter this building, you step into another world and leave New York behind," said Peter John, a 30-year-old photographer. "I was just in Brooks Brothers' on Madison Avenue, and I didn't feel the same." Another customer appeared thoroughly drawn to the Lauren mystique: Mike Philipps, a 30-year-old stockbroker, said everything he was wearing, down to his boxer shorts, was made by Ralph Lauren.
But the analysts bet that overpaying is a luxury that Mr. Lauren may no longer be able to afford. They expect him either to fight the rent increase or try to renegotiate the lease. His company is already paying a big chunk of its sales -- 8.3 percent to be precise -- to rent the mansion, and sales at the flagship store have been flat to down. With depreciation on the $20 million renovation of the mansion, and other outlays, Polo's occupancy costs approach 20 percent of revenues.
More problematically, the current owners have yet to discuss the rent increase with Polo, which under the lease has to agree to a fair market value for the property before the rent can be recalculated.
The landlord, the Power Corporation P.L.C., has been preoccupied with its own financial problems. It is also possible that it is holding back so as not to agitate its sole tenant before it sells the property.
Real estate experts had a hard time coming up with names of likely buyers. The offering memorandum is clearly pitched to foreign investors, including information that American investors would find redundant, like how many airports service New York City, maps of the Upper East Side and a full-blown description of Mr. Lauren's many achievements, including a list of magazines that have featured him on their covers.
But many of the foreign investors who spent astronomical amounts of money to snap up New York trophy properties in the 1980's are out of commission. Japanese investors are beset by economic woes at home. Arab investors were among those who sold the mansion to Power, turning a 583 percent profit on their original $6.3 million investment in just five years.
And the Chinese and Koreans who are busily scooping up prime Manhattan real estate, are too budget-minded. "When the Japanese bought property, they wanted the equivalent of a Chanel bag," Ms. Byrne said. "The Chinese, they want a good knockoff."
Mr. De Riemer said European investors are the likeliest prospects. Why doesn't Mr. Lauren buy the fabled jewel himself? It appears that he is equally value-oriented when it comes to his own purchases. "It's a wonderful building," said Peter Strom, vice chairman of Polo Ralph Lauren. "We'd love to own it at the right time and at the right price."

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Copper Linings for Wall St. Clouds?

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla 

 BODY:
COPPER, that great catalyst of scintillating conversation at gatherings of metallurgists, is making for interesting talk in stock market circles.
September-delivery copper closed at a four-year high of $1.278 a pound on Monday, the peak of a recent rally that caught the attention of Wall Street's tea-leaf readers. 
 Never at a loss for a market rule of thumb, some Wall Street types dredged up this gem: "Every bull market has a copper roof." Or, if copper rallies, the stock market falls.
Indeed, in the most recent history of copper prices, an all-out rally in copper prices that started in November 1986 took off in advance of the 1987 stock market crash. And the copper rally from December 1989 to August 1990 got going before the 21 percent decline in the Dow Jones industrial average between July and October of 1990.
For the most part, though, copper rallies portend stock market slumps with about the reliability of a coin toss, said Jeff Rubin of Birinyi Associates, a research firm in Greenwich, Conn. "We've also had plenty of rallies that were not coincident with a big market dropoff," he said.
In the 15 copper rallies of 20 percent or more since 1948, the Dow followed with a bear market only eight times, said Mr. Rubin. Not nearly as reliable as the Super Bowl theory, the hemline indicator, or the position of Venus in the darkening Wall Street skies.
The belief that euphoria over copper is bad for stocks derives from peculiarities of the economic cycle, explained Steve Leuthold of the Leuthold Group, a securities research firm in Minneapolis. "Big copper rallies like this one take place when shortages take place in an expansion," he said. A copper rally could be a signal that the economic expansion is getting long in the tooth, Mr. Leuthold explained. And since conventional wisdom has it that the stock market turns down 6 to 12 months before the nation's recovery goes kaput, the copper rally could be bad news.
This go-round, however, investors trying to make sense of copper's rise had better take a broader look at economies internationally, the pros say, because the big demand for copper isn't coming from the United States. "Our economic expansion is 44 months old," said Mr. Leuthold. "But the European one is only about a year old, and the Japanese expansion is even less."
Ditto the importance of growth in India and China, said Jim Williams of Williams Inference Service, a business consultant in Longmeadow, Mass. "You've got exploding middle classes in India and China that need new refrigerators, new TV sets, new cars -- things that use commodities like copper," he said. Add to the worldwide demand for commodities the fact that copper is the speculator's metal of choice, and you wind up with more demand than supply, explained Michael Metz, market strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. "Copper is the commodity with the largest speculative following," he explained.
All that demand has led to what commodities traders call backwardization -- a fancy word that's used when spot prices of a metal today are higher than those of the same metal in the futures market.
Stay with us now, and you can amaze your friends at otherwise dull cocktail parties. Metals prices in a bull market would seem naturally to be higher in the futures market, which reflects price expectations months ahead, than the current spot price. But when there are shortages, the so-called "nearby" spot price can wind up higher than that of the futures -- a "backwards" way for things to be.
It causes refiners and extractors of copper to gear up to produce more copper, explained Mr. Leuthold. "So four or five months from now, there will be more production onstream after producers decide they can make money even on more expensive refining processes," he said. But for now, the actual metal available for delivery is in short supply, making spot prices unusually high.
Copper's popularity may derive from international considerations that have no direct effect on American stocks, said Mr. Williams. But the same international expansions that are goosing copper's price might have their own effects on our domestic financial markets, he added. Mr. Williams's guess is that third-world expansions will be funded largely by borrowing from developed countries, and that, of course, means "the price of money goes up." And everybody knows how well the stock market likes higher rates.
But that doesn't support a theory that directly ties the action in copper to the action in the Dow, say analysts. "Correlation doesn't necessarily imply causation," said Steve Hanke, professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, who said he remembers hearing the "copper rallies lead to Dow declines" theory after the 1987 stock market crash.
"Storks do land on houses in Europe that have newborns in the house, but that doesn't mean they delivered the babies," Mr. Hanke said. More likely the storks like the warm chimneys of families trying to keep the house toasty.
"It is really true," he insisted. "You always find storks on chimneys of houses with newborns." Which may be a tidbit even more useful to investors than that of the copper-leads-to-Dow declines theory.

At the Epic Battle of Virginia, Historians Rout Disney
In this sprawling circus tent that is America, there's certainly room for many things -- a bit of history here, a bit of slicked-up entertainment there. But what bothered some people about Disney's grand idea for a theme park in northern Virginia was that with authentic history so close by -- Civil War battle sites galore -- the glitz could drown out the real stuff. Most Virginians supported the park -- the Governor, after all, had visions of 19,000 jobs and $47 million in annual revenues for the state. But opponents -- including some vocal historians and environmentalists -- made enough noise to get their way, and last week Disney dropped plans to build Disney's America at its chosen site. It vowed to seek another site in Virginia, but given all the regulatory hoops it must jump through, it'll be years after 1998 -- the original target -- before it opens. 

The $600 Million Man
Five years ago, you would have thought Peter Guber laid golden eggs by the case. It's one thing to shell out a few dollars to snag a prize executive, but Sony's staggering cost to get Mr. Guber's services left Hollywood wondering if the decimal points were remotely in the right place. So badly did Sony want him to oversee its newly acquired studios, Columbia and Tri-Star, that it paid roughly $200 million to buy out the production company owned by Mr. Guber and Jon Peters, and perhaps $400 million more to buy out the team's Warner Brothers contract. After that, Mr. Guber's $2.75 million salary seemed like a paltry tip. Granted, the Guber-Peters team did lay golden film eggs -- "Rain Man," "Batman." But at Sony, the flops, like "Last Action Hero," piled up. Last week, having cost Sony over $100 million a year, Mr. Guber resigned -- "to follow my dreams."
 
G.M.'s Balancing Act
General Motors is trying to take the long view, but that instinct can crash head-on into short-term realities. It's selling cars now, so it's got to make cars. But it balks at hiring more workers unless it knows it can keep them busy. What this added up to last week was that workers at one plant, weary of endless overtime, endless assembly-line pressure, went on strike demanding relief. And they didn't mean temporary workers, G.M.'s preferred solution. The strike quickly rippled across the auto-making landscape, disrupting numerous assembly plants.
 
You Think You're Organized?
The gadget factories -- O.K., O.K., "consumer electronics companies" -- keep telling us we need "personal digital assistants." These portable devices, one gathers, allow you to do practically anything but beam yourself to the office -- send e-mail, make plane reservations, check stock quotes. Thus far mankind has muddled through without them -- AT&T stopped making its EO, and Apple's Newton has had slim sales. But here comes the Magic Link PIC 1000, on sale last week at $995, and everyone seems to be involved -- Apple, Sony, Motorola, AT&T, you name it. You can tell it to page you if you get mail from the boss. If that's what you want.
 
USAir, Feeling the Pinch
USAir has problems, and they go a lot deeper than its string of crashes. It's lost $1.8 billion since 1988, and is trying to get its unions to cut back -- so far, with no success. So last week, trying a time-honored solution, it stopped paying some bills. To be precise, it deferred payments on its preferred stock. Representatives of two big investors, Berkshire Hathaway and British Airways, voted with other directors to halt the payments -- "sending a signal," as an analyst put it, that USAir is "sharing the pain." Investors were in no mood for pain, though, and sent USAir stock plunging.
 
ECONOMY
 
A Man, a Plan, a Root Canal (Well, the Political Equivalent)
This, alas, is the way the American system works. People agree something's a mess, a presidential candidate vows to fix it, he gets elected, he makes it his top priority -- and then the politicians and the lobbyists and the armchair experts get hold of it and everything goes kerflooey. And so it was that another bold crusade sputtered to a halt last week as George Mitchell played taps for national health insurance. Who did it? Did President Clinton aim too high? Did Republicans conspire against him? Did special interests dynamite the process? All the above, and more. But there's always next year. "I will never give up the fight," said Teddy Kennedy (assuming he gets reelected).
 
Defining Mutual Fund Risk
Most investors have probably never heard of derivatives -- or if they have, think of them merely as something they wouldn't want to meet in a dark Wall Street alley. The S.E.C. wants to keep it that way. Reasoning, correctly, that investors in mutual funds, especially bond and money market funds, want nothing to do with these high-octane concoctions, the S.E.C. last week recommended that for the first time fund sponsors be forced to tell shareholders just what gambles are being made with their money. The next hurdle: how, exactly, to put a statistical face on something as elusive as risk.
 
If in Doubt, Promise Tax Cuts
Well, it certainly worked for Christine Todd Whitman. George Pataki knows that a lot of voters, even those who profess a deep and abiding concern for the common good, care most deeply about one thing. So last week, after critics said he had no economic plan, he came up with a novel one: cut taxes. To be specific, cut the top income tax rate by 25 percent, and have fewer people paying that rate. The dent in state revenues by 1998: $5.6 billion. And where, specifically, would this come from? Basically, slash the state work force, sell a plane and a couple of helicopters, and pray like crazy for a flourishing economy. To be fair, of course, Governor Cuomo -- who called the Pataki plan a "magic act" -- is playing this game too, with vague promises of $1.5 billion in cuts in income and business taxes. Read their minds: "I want to be Governor."
 
Inflation Bells Are Ringing
Once again, economic news took a roller-coaster ride. On Tuesday, as the markets held their breath, the Federal Reserve panel that handles such matters met but announced no interest-rate increase. But just two days later came a flood of reports suggesting that the economy was charging ahead. Second-quarter growth was put at a strong 4.1 percent rate, while jobless claims fell to the year's lowest level and new-home sales surged. Good news, of course, for job-seekers and builders -- but the inflation alarms started ringing like crazy.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
A Leaky Investment
Back in 1986, it must have seemed a glamorous investment -- and perhaps one with a big payoff, too. But anyone who put money in the Channel Tunnel is probably looking longingly at simpler inventions. Like tugboats. With delay after delay, costs have risen to twice the original budget. And those dividends promised for next year? Try 2004. Then last week, in what investors fervently hoped was the final blow, there were reports -- possibly exaggerated -- that the tunnel was leaking. Sure enough, those battered Eurotunnel shares hit a record low. And passenger service doesn't even start til next month.
 
Brazil, Meet the World
Brazil elects a President tomorrow, and if, as expected, it is Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the nation could finally move toward a far bigger role in the world economy. Brazil, with Latin America's largest economy, is the only big South American country still clinging to barriers to foreign investment, but last week Mr. Cardoso said he'd change all that. "Nafta doesn't frighten us," he said, vowing to break up state monopolies and allow foreign investment in many areas. As Finance Minister, Mr. Cardoso managed to wrestle Brazil's inflation down to a livable level, a strong sign that if he promises something, he'll probably deliver. If, of course, he's elected.
 
Mr. Yeltsin's Neighborhood
Boris Yeltsin knows which side of this country to butter up. What he needs, he keeps saying, is not a handout, but investment and trade. And since trade is greased by proximity, he looks longingly at the Northwest. Not counting Alaska, Seattle is the mainland American city closest to Russia, and Washington is the state with the largest concentration of companies doing business with Russia. In five years, in fact, Russian trade with the Northwest has grown sixfold, to nearly $200 million a year. So it was only natural last week that Mr. Yeltsin would stop off in Seattle to pay his respects.

Why Fund Investors Just Aren't Buying American

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
AS interest rates have risen this year, the great love affair between mutual fund investors and Government bond funds has soured. At the end of August, such funds had seen 23 percent of their assets disappear from their peak in the summer of 1993. And the closely related mortgage-backed funds had done even worse, with assets off 24 percent. 
 Fortunately for the mutual fund industry, much of that money has gone into other kinds of funds -- primarily stock funds. There is now more money in funds that invest solely in foreign stocks than there is in United States Government bond funds. Between them, mortgage-backed and Government bond funds had almost 28 percent of all long-term fund assets just after the 1987 crash, and more than 17 percent as recently as late 1992. But now that market share has fallen below 10 percent for the first time since 1985, when the boom in bond funds was just beginning. FLOYD NORRIS

HEADLINE: Derivatives as the Fall Guy: Excuses, Excuses

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
EVERY day, the list of financial casualties grows longer and more varied -- from blue-chip corporations like the Procter & Gamble Company to local governments like Portage County, Ohio. They lost millions in the markets. Now, they blame their losses on "derivatives," and on the banks and brokers who deal in these arcane-sounding financial products.
In many quarters, derivatives is already a dirty word. As more and more companies have been stung by losses on their bets on derivatives, the nerdy term -- coined by the financial engineers of Wall Street and London a few years ago -- is invariably preceded in newspaper and magazine articles by the adjective "risky." Earlier this year, the General Accounting Office called for Federal regulation of trading in derivatives. Congress is investigating them. Last week, the central bankers for the 10 largest developed nations recommended increased disclosure of the derivatives holdings of banks, brokerage houses and companies. 
 Are derivatives a high-tech, 1990's version of financial snake oil? Is there anything inherently dangerous about them? The answer is a qualified "no," according to central bankers, economists, commercial bankers and the corporations that use derivatives.
For big companies, in particular, these new financial instruments can be efficient tools that lend greater stability to business operations. They help companies with far-flung international operations reduce their risk from swings in currency values and from interest-rate movements abroad. Hedging against those risks became a far more intricate game during the 80's as more and more nations opened up their financial markets.
Liberalization brought more opportunities, but also more volatility. To help companies cope with volatile markets, bankers, aided by computers, came up with new tools to hedge against risk -- and new ways to take risk. The biggest new tool was derivatives, broadly defined as contracts whose value is derived from the value of some underlying asset, like currencies, bonds or stocks.
They can be used as a kind of financial insurance policy, locking in currency or interest rate values for months or years, allowing companies to plan their spending and operating budgets with some assurance. They can also be an easy way to make an investment, with protection against losses for the meek, or 10-to-1 leverage for the speculator.
Derivatives, then, are powerful tools for companies to use in the high-stakes balancing act of international financial management. Just how those tools are used, however, depends on the user.
William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, says there are legitimate questions about these tailor-made contracts and the implications of their enormous growth to $24 trillion or so in notional, or face, value. [Page 6.]
Yet Mr. McDonough, like most other experts, says the most prudent action now is added reporting to give investors, shareholders and executives more information about derivatives, so they have a clearer picture about the risks they are taking. In short, he wants the derivatives market to work more efficiently rather than restrict it.
"The existence of derivatives increases the level of investment and makes possible greater economic growth," he said.
In fact, Mr. McDonough has recently begun to warn of the dangers of what he calls "derivatives angst," a simple-minded backlash that could result in legislation that prohibits companies from using these tools.
Any backlash against the use of derivatives would have a serious impact on large corporations. Two-thirds of the 500 largest American companies use derivatives regularly, according to a study of 1993 annual reports by Swaps Monitor, a newsletter. And the big multinationals clearly want to keep using them.
"I'm very distressed that all of a sudden derivatives have become a dirty word," said Arvind Sodhani, treasurer of the Intel Corporation, who manages the microchip maker's cash reserves of $5 billion. "To earn the highest return you need to use all the arrows in your quiver, and today that includes derivatives."
Of course, derivatives deals can be risky, and some of the companies that have lost money feel misled. After the Gibson Greeting Company lost $25 million on derivatives trades earlier this year, it filed suit against the Bankers Trust Company, the big New York bank and major derivatives dealer. Gibson Greeting claimed it had been lured into excessively speculative deals by "deception, cheating and fraud."
PROCTER & GAMBLE absorbed a $157 million pretax charge against earnings from losses on derivatives transactions. The big consumer products company threatened to sue its bank, also Bankers Trust, but it hasn't.
Bankers Trust denies the charges that it misled the companies, saying they knew the risks they were taking.
These cases, and other disputes, hinge on specific bank-client contracts and communications. The details are confidential. But it is worth noting that when interest rates were falling steadily and when derivatives provided a mechanism for making leveraged bets that rates would fall further, disputes were scarce indeed. It was when rates reversed sharply earlier this year, turning many profitable bets into losses, that companies started to cry foul.
"I don't think it's the dealers' responsibility to say how much risk a corporation should have," said Michael S. Joseph, a partner at Ernst & Young, the accounting firm. "The greed factor is entering into the decisions on the corporate side."
And clearly, these powerful financial tools should only be used by experts who understand them. "Derivatives are truly remarkable things," said Andre Perold, a finance professor at the Harvard Business School. "But they are like a new fighter plane. You don't put an average pilot in an F-15 fighter without special training."
At the same time, Mr. Perold points out that once companies learn how to use this advanced financial weaponry for defensive purposes, it's natural and often profitable for them to take on some extra risk.
"You can't say, 'We never speculate, we only hedge,' " he said. "That's impossible and if it weren't it would probably be too costly. A little bit of speculation is probably good, if you are any good at it."
Moreover, the kind of derivatives losses reported in recent months by companies is not the kind of problem that most worries central bankers and economists. In January 1992, Mr. McDonough's predecessor at the New York Fed, E. Gerald Corrigan, for the first time made this specialized business a public issue by warning a gathering of bankers that derivatives could introduce unforeseen risks into the financial system.
THE danger, central bankers feared, was that because derivatives transactions are usually custom-made contracts between two parties -- typically a bank and a corporate customer -- the failure of one large player in the market could ripple through the entire business. Unlike stocks or bonds, which can move through the markets like a hot potato, these tailored financial products stay on the books of the dealers who sell them until they mature.
Thus the nightmare, regulators warned, was of "payment gridlock" in the derivatives market, where a default by a bank or a big corporate derivatives user would cascade uncontrollably to others they dealt with.
This systemic problem has not materialized. "We need to be vigilant about systemic risk," Mr. McDonough noted. "But the visions of meltdown are overblown."
Instead, the losses recently have been mainly the result of companies simply making bad bets on the direction of interest rates -- a very different, more isolated, less worrisome issue.
"There have been relatively few highly publicized losses," said Walter Shipley, the chairman of Chemical Bank, a large derivatives dealer. "All of the regulators that have looked at it have fundamentally affirmed that most of the market functions responsibly."
The public anxiety about derivatives stems in part from the sense that these transactions seem to be unrelated to normal business. To most people, they look suspiciously like the sort of thing one should get at a bookie rather than at a bank.
Frankly, in some ways they are a bit like gambling, but then again so is insurance. A homeowners policy, after all, essentially pays off 100 to 1 in cash if the house burns down. The most common use of derivatives, similarly, is as a form of financial insurance.
Merck & Company, the nation's largest drug company, uses derivatives to shield the earnings on its export sales from uncertainty on currency swings.
In the early 1980's, Merck learned the hard way that not playing the financial markets aggressively was an extremely risky stance. Half of Merck's sales are abroad and as the dollar rose through the mid-80's, the company's foreign sales converted into fewer and fewer dollars. By 1985, when the dollar peaked, Merck had seen its revenues reduced by $900 million because of currency adjustments.
"THE strength of the dollar hurt our ability to make capital expenditures and fund research and development," recalled Judy Lewent, the company's chief financial officer.
Merck's chairman, P. Ray Vagelos, ordered the company's financial experts to find a way to reduce the currency risk. So Ms. Lewent and her staff devised a strategy using one form of derivatives, currency options, combined with a sophisticated computer-based model known as a Monte Carlo Simulation intended to determine the probability of rate moves helping or hurting profits.
In a small trading room in Merck's New Jersey headquarters, two traders now manage a portfolio of $3.5 billion in currency options.
Again, as with insurance, Merck pays a premium to a bank that sells the option. In return, the company gets the right to exchange a certain amount of, say, German marks for dollars at a set exchange rate on a given day in the future.
But if, when it needs German marks, Merck can get a better rate in conventional currency markets, it just lets the option expire. That way, Merck benefits if the mark goes up, allowing the company to bring home more dollars, but it is protected by the option if the mark falls.
"These hedges eliminate the downside risk and preserve our upside gain," explained A. John Kearney, Merck's assistant treasurer. With this type of derivative, the only thing at risk is the premium paid for the option.
By contrast, the Air Products and Chemicals Corporation got battered earlier this year by using a derivative that locked it into a potentially risky situation. It wound up taking a charge against earnings of $67 million because of losses on interest rate swaps, the most common form of derivative. The Allentown, Pa., producer of industrial gasses entered into a complex series of swap transactions in what was a leveraged bet that rates would not rise. When rates did rise, the company's losses mounted.
Gerry White, the chief financial officer of Air Products, says he became aware of his company's problem only when he ordered what he thought would be a routine audit as a double-check after Procter & Gamble announced its big loss. But the audit uncovered five leveraged transactions that, he says, were not adequately disclosed to top management and not fully understood by the Air Products financial staff who bought the swap contracts.
"There was a misjudgment in assessing the risk of these transactions," Mr. White said.
AFTER the $67 million loss, Air Products replaced its treasurer and assistant treasurer. The company, Mr. White says, has also tightened its policies and procedures for managing derivatives risks.
Yet despite the misstep, Mr. White still believes that the benefits from derivatives, when they are used correctly, far outweigh the risks. He estimates that the company's use of derivatives has helped trim its annual interest payments by 15 to 20 percent over the last five years, or by roughly $100 million. Even with the recent loss, Mr. White said, "We are still ahead of the game, compared to where we would have been if we had done no swaps at all."
The biggest derivatives loss by an American company came last year and it came as no surprise to the loser, Sears, Roebuck & Company. The company took a pretax charge of $237 million in 1993. The Sears loss shows that for a huge borrower there can be a sizable risk, and cost, even for pursuing what it regarded as a conservative strategy.
The Chicago-based retailer was able to raise money cheaply by selling what grew to be $11 billion in commercial paper, a short-term debt instrument with rates that fluctuate with the market.
To protect itself against any sudden increases in interest rates, Sears decided in the 1980's to buy swap contracts that essentially converted the obligations into fixed rates, ranging from 7 percent to 12.5 percent.
In its swap arrangements, typically made with a bank or broker, Sears would make regular payments at a fixed interest rate to the dealer and would receive in return -- the swap -- a payment that would fluctuate with the rate it owed on its commercial paper.
If rates rose, the swap would cover the cost of the higher payments. But what happened was that rates fell sharply, so the swap obligated the company to pay much more every month than it would have if it had kept the floating rate.
The real reckoning for Sears came last year, when its management decided to sell off assets and use the proceeds to pay off billions of dollars worth of debt. When the company took that step, it took a loss both on the swaps and also on bonds, since it had to make prepayment penalties for retiring the bonds before they matured.
Alice M. Peterson, the treasurer of Sears, doesn't blame the swaps for the problem. "We had a $50 billion portfolio of fixed-income obligations before the restructuring," Ms. Peterson said. "It would be stupid to think about managing that kind of debt without considering the use of derivatives."
 
 
 
THE $24 TRILLION PUZZLE
EVEN to the statistically jaded, $24 trillion seems like a big number. It is nearly four times the size of America's gross domestic product, and it is also the size of the derivatives market at the end of last year, according to Swaps Monitor, an industry newsletter.
But the $24 trillion is based on "notional value," which vastly overstates the economic value of derivatives transactions.
To explain, it is helpful to think of derivatives as insurance. In a policy that costs $500 a year to cover a $100,000 house, the $100,000 would be the notional value. But if the insurance company went out of business, it would cost only $500 to get a new policy. Studies show that the replacement cost for most derivatives -- what would be lost if the other side of the contract defaulted -- ranges from 3 to 6 percent of notional value.
Defining what is and what is not a derivative is tricky -- and often depends on what point the commentator is trying to make.
The name derivatives was adopted at the start of the 1990's to describe a fast-growing category of contracts whose value is derived from some underlying asset, like bonds or stocks. Yet derivatives are custom-made contracts and not the securities themselves.
In the last year or so, however, the term derivative has suddenly been applied to financial instruments that are securities, even if esoteric ones, like the mortgage-backed bonds that the government of Portage County, Ohio, lost money on. And securities, unlike derivatives, fit more neatly into existing legal, regulatory and accounting systems.
Still, many in the press and in Congress have used the more expansive definition of derivatives. The broader definition, after all, does embrace more casualties from recent reverses in the financial markets -- and thus perhaps provides more ammunition for those who advocate a regulatory crackdown.
"The term derivative has become too widely used, so that frankly it has almost become meaningless," said Paul B. Spraos, publisher of Swaps Monitor.

Some Call Street Feasts Indigestible

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE 

 BODY:
Spurred by a growing number of problems and public complaints concerning the San Gennaro Festival, which closed last weekend, city officials and West Village leaders are looking into changing the rules governing street fairs.
The decision came after a spot check of vendors at the 11-day-long San Gennaro fair by members of the Mayor's Community Assistance Unit. Not one of the vendors they questioned had a license, and many were selling counterfeit Ray Ban sunglasses and pirated audiotapes. 
 Several nights later, when a fire broke out in a tenement on Mulberry Street, which is the heart of the festival, fire trucks were blocked by oversized festival booths. "Fortunately it was pouring," said Marty Algaze, Manhattan coordinator of the unit.
Because of such incidents and because officials have heard increasing protests from business owners about their loss of business and from residents about noise and litter, the Mayor's unit has set up a task force on street fairs and will conduct a hearing on the subject next month.
"What we have to do is update and tighten regulations on street fairs, limit the number of fairs and increase fees," Mr. Algaze said. Large fairs pay the city 20 percent of the fee they get from vendors, but that doesn't cover police and sanitation overtime.
Last year Community Board 2 had 28 major multi-block street fairs, more than any other board in the city. Board 7 on the Upper West Side was second with 20.
"Street fairs used to serve a genuine social purpose," said Matt McGhee, who owns a gift shop on Christopher Street, "but now they have gotten out of hand and are causing real economic hardship to local businesses." Another businessman, Ronald J. Kopnicki, said street fairs are now dominated by commercial operators. "They change the atmosphere, divert street traffic, block views of and access to local shops and bring in discount shoppers," he said.
Both men belong to a group of 45 West Village business owners that recently appealed to the Mayor and the Borough President to change street fair policies. "We don't want the city to eliminate the fairs, just get them under control," said Mr. McGhee. Specifically, they want the city to enforce existing health and safety regulations and to bar street fairs on Saturdays in the summer and on weekends during the prime business season between Labor Day and Christmas.
Rita Lee, the district manager of Community Board 2, said the fairs help their nonprofit sponsors. "But after almost every event," she said, "we get complaints from residents about noise and litter." A committee of the board will meet this month to draw up a list of proposed new guidelines for street fairs. M.H.

HEADLINE: For Alexander Dolls, More Than Just Pretty Faces

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
FROM the sidewalk it is just another squat, drab building in central Harlem, sandwiched between elevated subway tracks and an outdoor meat market. But inside the Alexander Doll Company, hundreds of workers assemble elegant dolls that are coveted by children and collectors alike.
For decades, Madame Alexander dolls have been a royal family in the collectible doll market. Now, bolstered by a renewed interest in old-fashioned toys, the privately held Alexander is expanding its product lines, seeking out new customers and even selling dolls through a home-shopping network. Most of its manufacturing is done in the bustling Harlem plant, a rarity amid vacant lots and city-owned tenements. 
 Madame Alexander dolls were the creation of Beatrice Alexander Behrman, the daughter of Russian immigrants. Mrs. Behrman, whose father operated New York's first doll "hospital," started making dolls in 1923, and they soon became famous for their molded heads and limbs, lifelike eyes, rooted hair and elaborate costumes.
Mrs. Behrman sold Alexander to several New York investors in 1988, two years before she died at 95. But the dolls have not changed -- with pursed lips, arched eyebrows and puffy pastel dresses, they still look like extras in a Merchant-Ivory film. Ira Smith, the chief executive, credits the dolls' high quality to his 550 employees: seamstresses and artisans who create the intricate details that make the dolls famous.
The company, at 615 West 131st Street, has been a mainstay of the neighborhood's shaky economy since the mid-1950's, when it moved there from East 24th Street to save money on rent. It is the largest private employer in Harlem, providing a third of the light manufacturing jobs there, according to the New York State Urban Development Corporation.
Mr. Smith said most of his employees are immigrants from the Dominican Republic, who learned sewing in factories there. Many have worked at the plant for decades, and 70 percent live within two miles.
"We're very devoted to our work force," said Mr. Smith, a towering, suspender-clad man sitting in a board room strewn with sample dolls. "At the present time, it is the single advantage to this location."
Echoing the concerns of other inner-city executives, Mr. Smith said he was discouraged by Harlem's falling real estate values and high operating costs. And while the lease on the building expires at the end of this year, he said he would probably stay there out of loyalty to -- and dependence on -- his employees. Because most of the employees are unionized, the company is not benefiting from inexpensive labor, he said.
ABOUT 250 employees sew the dolls' costumes, adding embroidery and other details by hand. Others style hair with miniature combs, insert blinking eyes and stitch tiny shoes and hats. The only work not done at the Harlem plant is the molding of plastic and vinyl body parts, which is done at a small plant in the Bronx.
"This company's labor force has a very unique set of skills that are most often found in the inner city and are not easily replaced," said Lee Webb, executive vice president of the Urban Development Corporation, which has encouraged the company to stay in Harlem. "If a business like this were to relocate, it would have to spend a lot of time and money training new employees."
Sean McGowan, a toy analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York, said the attention to detail gave Madame Alexander dolls an old-fashioned aura at a time when most dolls are mass-produced imports. Most Madame Alexander dolls, which cost between $35 and $500, are modeled on famous women (Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Queen Elizabeth) or fictional characters (Alice in Wonderland, Scarlett O'Hara). Others wear the costumes of foreign countries. They often become family heirlooms.
MR. McGOWAN said the rosy-cheeked dolls are especially popular now because baby-boomer parents want their children to have traditional toys.
"Mothers buy their kids Madame Alexander dolls because they remember them from their own childhoods," he said. "Their cachet lies in the fact that they're a classic toy with an upscale reputation."
Adding to the dolls' mystique is their scarcity. They are sold in only about 2,500 high-end department stores, toy shops and boutiques, including Niemen Marcus and F.A.O. Schwarz. The annual line consists of about 100 styles, plus several limited editions aimed at collectors. Most designs are discontinued after a year or two, said Larry Hughes, the president. Alexander, he said, makes more than 500,000 dolls a year -- though he would not say exactly how many. Mr. Smith would not divulge sales figures, but a profile of the company provided by Infotrac, a data bank that serves libraries and businesses, listed 1993 revenues at $41 million.
Another way the company differs from other doll makers: it does minimal advertising. "Madame Alexander doesn't try to make trendy dolls, and you won't find them at Toys 'R' Us," Mr. McGowan said. "They have a certain amount of snob appeal."
Part of that appeal stems from Mrs. Behrman, whose spirit still seems to inhabit the Harlem plant even though she spent the last decade of her life in Florida. Known for her regal bearing and sharp tongue, she was obsessed with quality and picky about designs. She would not make a Shirley Temple doll because she did not approve of child labor. When one interviewer asked her opinion of Cabbage Patch dolls in 1987, she replied: "If you spend a million dollars on advertising, you can sell manure."
If Alexander ever faced a period of uncertainty, it was when Mrs. Behrman sold the company in 1988, shortly after she suffered a serious heart attack. Carolyn Cook, editor and publisher of Doll Reader magazine, said collectors and retailers worried that the new owners might sacrifice quality for quantity.
"People were concerned because Madame was a real celebrity, the force behind her dolls," Ms. Cook said. "But the new owners have preserved her spirit and her standards."
In August, Alexander employees were struggling to finish hundreds of delicate limited-edition dolls and fill Christmas orders. Plastic body parts and fluffy wigs were heaped everywhere, hinting at the company's main problem: it is outgrowing its 120,000-square-foot plant.
While Alexander plans to stay in Harlem, Mr. Smith said there were negatives about doing business there. He said that while there had been few problems with crime, employees would not feel comfortable working a late shift. More ominous, he said, is the reluctance of banks to invest in the neighborhood.
In 1988, an ambitious plan to build a larger, $10.3 million plant on West 155th Street fell through because the company could not get enough financial backing, Mr. Smith said. The Urban Development Corporation gave a $33,500 grant to New York City's Public Development Corporation to help finance an environmental assessment of the site, but the project came to a halt shortly afterward.
"Banks are not willing to invest here, so there are hardly any new businesses coming into the neighborhood," Mr. Smith said. But Donald J. Coggsville, president of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation, said his state-supported agency would work to keep the company in Harlem.
"Six hundred jobs in a community that's underemployed makes a tremendous impact," Mr. Coggsville said. "It would be devastating to lose them." He said the 155th Street site was still available, and he plans to encourage Alexander to reconsider it.
"They have the land, the work force and the willingness of the state and the city to help them get financing," Mr. Coggsville said. "I don't see why they couldn't stay."
As Mr. Smith plans the company's future, he is also trying to make Madame Alexander dolls more popular with noncollectors. Mrs. Behrman originally intended her dolls to end up in little girls' arms, but now at least half the company's customers are collectors. At F.A.O. Schwarz, one of the company's biggest accounts, collectors make up nearly 70 percent of the dolls' sales, said Scott Chambers, a doll buyer there. Schwarz always carries the entire Madame Alexander line, plus several limited editions made exclusively for the store.
"The Madame Alexanders are our biggest volume generator," Mr. Chambers said. "We rarely run out, but they sell very steadily."
Mr. Chambers estimates that F.A.O. Schwarz sells tens of thousands of Madame Alexander dolls annually. The top sellers, he said, are eight-inch-high collector dolls, which average about $55, followed closely by baby dolls that average around $100. This year, the store is banking on a set of limited-edition dolls based on the new movie version of "Little Women," starring Winona Ryder. Alexander is making 1,200 sets of these dolls for Schwarz. Mr. Chambers expects the dolls, which go on sale in November, to sell out before Christmas -- when the film opens.
"We'll call our regular customers before we get a special line and take pre-orders," he said. "We have customers who own thousands of Madame Alexanders."
COLLECTORS take their hobby seriously, placing orders the minute they hear of a new design and combing antique shows for 1947 Scarletts and 1962 Peter Pans. The Madame Alexander Doll Club, founded 30 years ago, has 12,000 members, 40 percent of whom are male. Many members attend an annual convention with doll competitions, raffles and seminars.
Tanya McWhorter, the club president, owns 1,000 Madame Alexander dolls and plans to write a book about Mrs. Behrman, whom she admired as a child and later considered a close friend.
"This extraordinary woman spent her whole life working in that factory and never realized what a huge, loyal following she had," said Mrs. McWhorter, 47, a homemaker in Corpus Christi, Tex., who devotes most of her time to the club. "Some people think they have to own every single Madame Alexander doll that exists."
To expand its customer base, the company has introduced several new styles, some of which are less expensive and delicate than the traditional line. Mr. Smith started a line of costumed teddy bears called the Well-Dressed Bears and hired outside designers to create three new doll lines, the Forever Friends Collection, Let's Play Dolls With Alice Darling and the Hildegard Gunzel Collection. The new dolls range in price from $25 to $800.
In 1992, Alexander bought out its main rival, the Effanbee Doll Company, a New Jersey concern that sells imported vinyl and porcelain dolls for $25 to $225.
As the company develops new products, it is also exploring new channels of distribution. Mr. Smith said that for the first time he was looking at ways to expand sales beyond the United States and Canada. And this year, he agreed to manufacture a line of dolls for QVC, the home-shopping network. The dolls were designed by Candy Spelling, wife of the Hollywood producer Aaron Spelling, and were recently featured on QVC.
"Television is a big trend in the collectors' market," Mr. Smith said, noting that QVC sold $40 million worth of dolls annually. Mr. McGowan, the toy analyst, said television marketing was becoming a more acceptable means of selling high-end products.
"A few years ago I would have guessed it would cheapen their image, but not today," he said of the dolls. "Television marketing has proven to be a low-cost way of selling a product very quickly."
The company has also opened its first store, but only for customers who might appreciate Madame Alexander dolls the most: its employees. Mr. Hughes said dozens of them had bought dolls from the tiny discount shop, which opened inside the plant this summer.
"The response was absolutely incredible," he said. "It's gratifying to know how much respect our employees have for our product, and to give them something in return for all their hard work."

HEADLINE: How to Make a School, From A to Z

SERIES: Whose Choice?: Second of two articles on parents' efforts to find public schools that work.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d 

 BODY:
A MIRACLE of a school opened its doors this fall in Brooklyn, a monument to the perseverance of a group of parents who clung to a simple belief: Their children deserved better middle schools than the ones they seemed destined to attend.
The parents wanted small classes for their children. A safer school environment. More hands-on instruction. More relevance in lessons, and teachers who were not afraid to try new and different methods of instruction. They wanted their children to learn about cultural and racial diversity, not from books, but from traveling around Brooklyn and visiting its institutions, seeing firsthand the richness that is New York. 
 Finding that the city's existing middle schools, often large and impersonal, lacked some or all of these qualities, these parents embarked on a journey of a most extraordinary kind. They simply created their own public school from scratch.
The process took them through six years of fits, starts and deflating stops. The most formidable obstacles were resistance, even resentment, from the city's unforgiving and often unbending school bureaucracy, and especially from other middle schools in the area. There were also neighborhood worries about traffic and other congestion, and, in an era of fiscal distress, constant fears that the parents might not be able to finance their dream.
But in the words of one parent, Janet Brand, they "kept at it, kept at it, kept at it," and in the end, in a remarkable case of educational good timing, their persistence coalesced with a citywide movement toward smaller, innovative schools. Which is how, on Sept. 12, Sara Brown, Jonathan Huegel, Delroy Danvers, Tia Hampton and the 70 or so other sixth and seventh graders walked into the Brooklyn School for Global Studies, 10 classrooms in the basement of another middle school, the Nathan Hale Middle School in Cobble Hill.
"If we aren't advocates for our children, who will be?" explained Ms. Brand, who works in the Board of Education's technical support office and helped organize the school so her 8-year-old son, Jeremy Yuan, can enroll in three years. "As adults, many of our dreams are hammered into the dirt by the bureaucracy. But it's really important for adults to teach our children to pursue their dreams."
Or as Larry Abrams, the new school's director, put it: "This is a classic study of parental involvement. These parents built a Taj Mahal of education."
Along the bumpy path to that Taj Mahal, the Brooklyn school represents the fruits of a growing wave of parental activism in New York and beyond demanding more and better choices in middle schools.
Until recently, the middle grades had been a pedagogical nether world that too often did too little to nurture or guide students at a turbulent and critical juncture in life. Not only, as research shows, did the stepchild status of the middle grades plant the first seeds of a continuing and troubling high school dropout problem, it drove away many middle-class parents who had been willing to try the public elementary schools.
But the middle schools have been receiving new attention in recent years, as the children of baby boomers moved into sixth, seventh and eighth grades and as the notion that smaller is better took hold. In New York, the small-schools movement got a big boost from the former Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, and that support has continued under Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines; already, more than 50 small, new schools -- mostly high schools, but also middle and primary schools -- have blossomed in neighborhoods across the city. And last month, the Annenberg Foundation announced a $50 million gift to New York City public schools, with a chunk for small, experimental schools.
At Janet Brand's dream school on Baltic Street last week, early reviews from any school's harshest critics -- the students -- came pouring in.
"Teachers make school interesting," said Ebonei McCoy, a 12-year-old seventh grader. "I feel safe here."
 
'Not in the Status Quo'
 Heather Lewis remembers the beginning, six years ago. As their elementary-school children moved closer to the middle grades, she and other parents shared their concerns about District 15's five intermediate schools. They worried about the large enrollments, about impersonality, about the threat of violence.
"Parents were looking for a small school, and that was not in the status quo," said Ms. Lewis, a nurse who became an educator because of her zeal for public schools. "We were looking for a school that had more hands-on learning and was integrated. We were looking for a school where our children, their teachers and parents had more power over their learning."
Ms. Lewis had experience in creating schools from nothing; several years before, she had helped plan an alternative elementary school, and she wanted her children to continue their education in a nurturing environment. Now, she was among the first to step forward to organize a parents' committee to create a new middle school.
The school they envisioned would be smaller and safer and stuffed with all that makes a school a rich repository of knowledge. But almost immediately, the plan struck a sour chord in District 15, a multi ethnic swath of Brooklyn that runs from the working-class neighborhoods of Sunset Park and Red Hook to the more prosperous brownstone enclaves of Cobble Hill, Park Slope and Carroll Gardens.
Most of the early resistance came from the other middle schools themselves. Administrators worried that a sixth intermediate school would siphon away teachers, supplies and money from schools already hobbled by an austere budget.
There were other concerns, too: "A lot of the criticism came from administrators who mostly felt this was criticism of their schools and criticism of the way they were doing things," said Ms. Lewis.
All of which was enough to kill the proposal in 1988. But with the desire for a new school still running deep, another parents' group was formed the next year. This effort failed, too, doomed not only by the other middle schools but by indifferent support from the local school board (which would have to bless the project for it to prosper) and by residents who feared that a new school would spawn traffic and garbage.
But with each failure, a foundation was being poured. Though frustrated and disappointed, the parents were getting an education in perseverance and politics.
"One of the lessons we learned is that you really have to be very careful to communicate and involve as many of the constituents as possible," said Judi Aronson, who, with her husband, Howard, worked with the third, and ultimately successful, parents' group. "The second lesson is that you really have to have a vision and you have to stick to it."
By the time that third group was formed, Ms. Aronson said, "the time was right politically for a new school."
 
Covering All the Angles
 The third group began work in 1991. Unlike the previous groups, this collection of parents, teachers and school board members had the advantage of a proposal written by the second group. This would serve as the embryo of the Brooklyn School.
From the outset, they said, they sought to defuse any questions of elitism -- that the school was being created for the children of prosperous white families -- by including black and Hispanic parents and recruiting support from minority parents around the district.
"There was never really that kind of friction," said Cathy Powell, a member of the group who is black and has triplets attending the new school. "There was an effort to reach out to the community."
Over cups of coffee in brownstones and in school auditoriums and over the telephone, the parents met, by Ms. Aronson's estimate, 35 times in three years. They carefully cultivated support among District 15 officials. They sought to ease the worries of skeptical residents. They tried to smooth relations with middle school administrators. Fliers in Spanish and Chinese were sent to immigrant families. Every group with a potential interest in a new and different kind of school was contacted, and many of the responses were remarkably the same.
"Many parents verbalized not being happy about what was waiting for our kids after sixth grade," said Pat Woerner, one of the parents involved in the school's planning. "Some of the best kids in the district were leaving to go to other schools."
One nagging issue, the lack of support from the local school board, corrected itself over the last four years, with the election of several new members who supported educational innovation, including small, alternative schools. Among them was Heather Lewis. The changes on the board, in turn, made it easier for the district Superintendent, William P. Casey, to support the proposal for a new school, particularly when it was expanded to grades 6 through 12.
"When we expanded the school to include upper grades, he was able to tell the middle schools this was not threatening to them," explained Ms. Lewis, who is still on the school board. Indeed, opinion had shifted so far that the deputy superintendent, Loyda Alfalla, actually served on the planning committee, as did Robert Zuckerberg, the district's teachers union representative and a longtime supporter of the idea.
Still, two killer questions remained: How would the new school be financed? Where would it be housed?
For start-up money, the parents applied for a $25,000 grant from the Fund for New York City Public Education, a nonprofit organization that received financial support from the Aaron Diamond Foundation, which has given about $2 million in the last two years for the creation of small schools. They did not make the final cut.
Undaunted, District 15 officials last year submitted the parents' proposal to the State Education Department. The proposal won a $150,000 grant for magnet schools, and another $150,000 came from local district and Board of Education sources. The rest of the costs -- salaries for 10 teachers, classroom space, furniture, textbooks, office machines and supplies -- are borne by District 15 and the high school division.
There was still the matter of finding the school a home. To the dismay of parents, the existing middle schools closed ranks and refused to give up space; residents continued to voice their fears of increased traffic, the loss of parking spaces and garbage.
Things came to a head during a stormy school board meeting in early 1993, where supporters were greatly outnumbered by neighborhood opponents, many of whose children were past school age. When Judi Aronson got up in front of the packed crowd to give a statement, she was booed.
"Then one person got up and said, 'We don't want drug addicts,' " she recalled. "I said, 'You're talking about our children.' I was very upset because they were talking about my daughter."
At one point during the meeting, Ms. Aronson, who describes herself as "a leftover flower child," said under her breath: "This school is not going to happen."
In the end, the opposition only succeeded in delaying the opening a full year, to the fall of 1994. When district officials finally found space in the Nathan Hale basement last spring (over the objections of some Hale teachers) the parents scurried to hire a director and a teaching staff.
That the school opened at all this fall, the parents say, remains a miracle. The director, Larry Abrams, wasn't hired until last April, giving him and a parents' committee just three months to hire 10 teachers from a pool of 120 applicants. Supplies had to be ordered. Because the school had missed the spring enrollment rush, parents had to advertise for students in the newspapers.
"People don't realize that running a small school is sometimes more work than a large school," Mr. Abrams said the other day. He has, for instance, used his personal Mastercard to buy supplies, rather than endure the waits to go though official channels. "These schools," he said, "are not easy."
 
'Much More Peaceful'

But, oh, the rewards. The classes are small -- no more than 23 students -- and sixth and seventh graders are combined in one classroom. While this is partly because there weren't enough students to maintain a full teaching staff for each grade, it is also by design: research has shown that grouping grades together is often beneficial to students, who frequently learn more from one another than from a teacher.
The students glide quietly and smoothly from lesson to lesson in math to science to humanities. Every Wednesday afternoon, they take field trips while teachers take the time to plan lessons together, insuring that math complements science and English relates to the humanities.
This interdisciplinary approach, all the rage these days, puts academic courses together like a puzzle, showing students that everything is interconnected. In Catherine R. Harris's math class, for instance, students learn new vocabulary -- palindrome -- while learning how a palindrome orders a set of numbers so that their sequence is the same backward and forward.
"This school is a huge difference from others I've taught in," said Ms. Harris, who last year taught computers at another middle school in Brooklyn with 900 students. "Having a planning period makes a huge difference." The school itself is quiet, well stocked and clean and has a decidedly un-urban feel about it. "It's so much more peaceful here," she added.
Students themselves have been drawn from across Brooklyn. Though no one was turned away this year, in the future a lottery will be used to insure a racial mix -- as required under the $150,000 state grant -- that reflects the diversity of the district. A majority of the district's students are Hispanic, followed by black, white, Asian and American Indian youngsters.
The students, too, give the school high marks.
"The classes are a lot more challenging," said Sara Brown, an 11-year-old sixth grader. "It's smaller and the teachers have more time for you." She said the school was a better place for her than the middle school she would have attended. "I feel safe here," she explained. "There are fewer fights."
With the school up and running, parents are searching for new roles. Aside from becoming active in the P.T.A., they and Mr. Abrams see themselves becoming a de facto board of trustees, helping with decisions about curriculum and other issues.
Upstairs at Nathan Hale, the new school has created little but resentment. "The school downstairs is wonderful," said Kim Prall, a special education teacher and a teachers' union representative. "We should all be so lucky."
Nathan Hale is precisely what the founding parents hoped their children would escape. As Ms. Prall walked the hallways of the four-floor school, she peered into the doorways of classrooms. "There are 30 to 34 kids in each of these classrooms," she said, citing budget cuts that have resulted in growing class sizes over the last few years. "We fought that school downstairs for years. It's just not fair."
The Brooklyn School's teachers, administrators and District 15 officials are aware of the resentment.
"When, in fact, you have two independent schools sharing the same building, there is always the potential for problems," said Mr. Casey, the superintendent. "What are we supposed to do? Wait until the budget improves to move on these ideas?"
To the relief of parents, Mr. Casey's answer has been no.
The process of opening the new school took so long that some of the children of the organizing parents are now too old to attend the school. The Aronsons' daughter, Danielle, enrolled in another middle school last fall and likes it there.
"I was not going to take her out of the school," said Ms. Aronson. "She has a life there. But I kept working on the school because I really believed that I was working on this not only for my daughter but for the other kids in the district. It's our gift to the neighborhood."

Chart: "In Addition: The New Small High Schools"
 In the fall of 1993, the Board of Education opened 30 small high schools; the aim, in short, was to break through the anonymity of the city's huge high schools and give teen-agers close personal attention. Nineteen more opened this year, and others are planned for coming years.
 Because these schools are so new, performance data are not yet available. However, early statistics indicate that these schools have higher attendance than other high schools, and that their students are passing more courses. These are the small high schools now in operation.

HEADLINE: Burmese Stereotypes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Business Must Shun Burmese Despots" (Viewpoints, Aug. 28) reflects a rhetorical, outdated and culturally biased view of Myanmar. 
 Most North American commentators on human-rights issues in Asia don't consider the irreparable damage that years of colonialism inflicted on the social fabric of nations like Myanmar, formerly Burma. Is it any wonder the powers that be are suspicious of Western-style anything, especially our less than perfect democratic systems?
The confrontational and aggressive approach to promoting social and democratic (r)evolution in Asia is ineffectual. Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's Senior Minister, believes that "the purely Western moral approach" that human-rights groups take "will have little influence on Burma because the Burmese are determined at the price of isolation to go their own way." Emotion-charged words like "despots" and "recalcitrant" do no good toward advancing mutual respect and goodwill or forming the foundation for an open exchange of views.
Furthermore, the United States, incorrectly identified by Edith T. Mirante in her article as Myanmar's second-largest investor, is actually a fading third. According to March 1994 data provided by the Burmese Embassy in Tokyo, the United States, with $107.6 million invested in 10 Burmese projects, is surpassed by Thailand, with $211.1 million in 18 projects, and Singapore, $203.2 million in 16 projects, and is followed closely by Japan, $101.1 million in 5 projects. Myanmar can also rely on the help of its neighbors in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which it is about to join.
The case for corporate "constructive engagement" is very compelling, and its effects on the average person can be very real and very positive. The point of contention here is whether certain groups in the West will realize that they will achieve nothing by making threats based on conclusions drawn from a less than complete understanding of the issues.

HEADLINE: Greedy for More? The 80's Sneak Back

BYLINE: By DAN SHAW 

 BODY:
SURE, it's only 1994, the middle of a decade that was supposed to be the low-key, caring antithesis to the greedy and arrogant 1980's. But the 1980's may be making a comeback already.
Preposterous? Premature? Too simple? Perhaps. But ravenous popular culture, having recently eaten through the 1960's and 70's, is taking its first nibbles of the 1980's. 
 Consider these signs: The trappings of wealth, from decorating with chintz to dressing for mega-success, are being displayed again. Political and entertainment icons of the 80's are achieving popularity in new guises. Fashion advertisements, often a reflection of contemporary values, are again idealizing money and work. On the darker side, casual cocaine use may be returning socially, and even unsafe sex may be on the rise.
The sense that people are doing things they haven't done since, well, the 80's, is still anecdotal. The behavior is not yet entrenched enough to be demonstrable through statistics and figures.
Nonetheless, at a party for Manhattan File, a new contender in the hip monthly magazine field, the styles of choice for many of the young men were ties and jackets, and most women wore high heels, not combat boots, with their little black dresses.
At dinner parties, the conversation often turns to mergers, LBO's and new restaurants.
And at some SoHo bars, people are squeezing into bathrooms built for one, a telltale sign that they're sharing drugs.
"People are doing coke again, but they're not doing it openly," said Patrick McMullan, a photographer who has been covering New York night life since the late 70's. "They're saying, 'Guess what I've got?' People are suddenly coming out of bathrooms very talkative."
On the evening news, Oliver North and Marion S. Barry Jr. are seen greeting cheering crowds. Mr. North, the Iran-Contra figure, is running for Senator in Virginia, while Mr. Barry, the former Mayor of Washington who went to prison on a drug charge, has made a political comeback. On prime time television, Linda Gray and Heather Locklear are vamping again on new nighttime soap operas, somehow meaner and greedier than they were on their respective 80's series, "Dallas" and "Dynasty." On the social circuit, Henry Kravis and Donald Trump have new wives whom they want to show off.
Even some fashion advertising has a retro feel. For the last few seasons, Donna Karan dressed her DKNY models as if they spent most of their time at grungy poetry readings (which were supposed to be to the 90's what charity balls were to the 80's). Now, she's sent them back to work: they are photographed wearing ties, carrying briefcases and scurrying around Wall Street. In perhaps one concession to the 90's, these workers are shown waiting on subway platforms rather than in limousines.
A new Ralph Lauren advertising campaign, "The New Romantics," looks like his old homages to old money, which he seemed to abandon earlier in the decade when he got into the multicultural spirit. The New Romantics wear aristocratic tweeds during the day and wear black tie, sip champagne and lounge on satin sofas at night.
"People are tired of holding back," said Mario Buatta, the Manhattan decorator who, as a leading proponent of the English country look so popular on Park Avenue in the 80's, was nicknamed the Prince of Chintz. "They are worried about being taxed more. They want to spend the money they have while they have it. They feel they deserve things."
Mr. Buatta said he is as busy as he was in the 80's. "The D & D Building is buzzing," he said, referring to the Third Avenue building where there are many fabric and furniture showrooms.
Nicolaus Mills, a professor of American studies at Sarah Lawrence College and the editor of "Culture in an Age of Money: The Legacy of the 1980's in America" (Ivan R. Dee, 1990), senses that desperation is motivating people to work harder.
"There's a revival of 80's selfishness, but it's selfishness that doesn't have confidence in itself," Mr. Mills said. "In the 80's, there was a sense of large-scale prosperity and everyone sharing the wealth. What constitutes the 90's is that things are not going to get better. It's made us more mean-spirited and individualistic. There's a lack of confidence in the system and a cringing spirit of greed."
On television, the new greed and selfishness is depicted on the Fox shows "Models Inc." and "Melrose Place."
"Linda Gray's character is a desperate, conniving soul," said Mr. Mills, who notes that "there's no heart-of-gold character for contrast."
He finds "Melrose Place," about Californians in their 20's living in the same apartment complex, a distressing reflection of contemporary life. "Compare it to 'thirtysomething,' " he said, referring to the 80's show about struggling, whining yuppies. "They were self-involved too, but there was a sense they were building a better life and a community. On 'Melrose,' they live in a collective, but there is such anomie among them."
Even QVC, the home-shopping network, harks back to the 80's. Two weeks ago, Betsy Bloomingdale, the Los Angeles socialite who has been Nancy Reagan's best friend for more than 25 years, appeared on QVC to sell her new cookbook, "Entertaining with Betsy Bloomingdale." Mrs. Reagan called the live broadcast to praise the book.
"Bets," she said, "I'm so glad you wore the Reagan red jacket!" QVC says it sold more than 2,600 copies at $23.25 in 15 minutes.
Chief executives, who were often treated like rock stars in the 80's, are getting the glamour treatment again. The October issue of Vanity Fair canonizes what it calls the country's New Establishment -- multimillionaire media executives like Robert Allen of AT&T, John Malone of Tele-Communications and Raymond W. Smith of Bell Atlantic -- in heroic photographs by Annie Leibovitz. Just like tycoons of previous eras, these "swashbucklers of the Information Age" are seen posing on yachts, helicopters and private jets, unabashedly displaying the perks of immense wealth and power.
The Vanity Fair portfolio reminds Marshall Blonsky, a cultural historian and author of "American Mythologies" (Oxford University Press, 1992), of 80's-style Wall Street worship. "This is arbitrage with a new face," he said. "It signals a return to triumphalism and economic aggression."
Some people think the 80's never ended. "Did the 90's ever happen?" said Sean Driscoll, a co-owner of Glorious Food, a leading society caterer. "Nothing has really changed for us. Behind closed doors there's plenty of beluga."
Michael Korda, the editor in chief of Simon & Schuster, who has been part of the power-lunch scene at the Four Seasons restaurant for nearly 20 years, said the New Yorkers he knows haven't changed. "There isn't less money, greed or desire for fame," he said.
Evan L. Schindler, the publisher of Manhattan File, the new magazine devoted to current trends, is counting on the fact that young, upwardly mobile New Yorkers still want the so-called good things in life. The first issue has full-page advertisements from jewelers like Van Cleef & Arpels, Buglari and Cartier as well as elegant uptown restaurants like Le Cirque and Harry Cipriani.
"We're going against the notion that Generation X or whatever you call it has a slacker mentality," said Mr. Schindler, 33.
Far more ominous is the idea that more people are having unsafe sex. In the current issue of Out magazine, Michelangelo Signorile, 33, the author of "Queer in America" (Random House, 1993), admitted to having unprotected sex on more than one occasion since 1990. He said several friends had "slipped up," too.
"It was awesome to see someone telling the truth," Mike Shriver, executive director of Mobilization Against AIDS, an advocacy group based in San Francisco, said of Mr. Signorile's article. "But I don't think it's fair to generalize just because some gay men are admitting how difficult it is to maintain risk prevention."
Abstinence and self-denial are not the American way, said Mr. Blonsky, the cultural historian. "We want the post-modern euphoria. We want it happy, easy, cool," he continued. "We believe in our image as the promised land. In the promised land, you don't go shlepping around. You are triumphant. You have sex on Saturday night, drink bourbon and howl like a banshee."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Still Critical;
Ills of Health System Outlive Debate on Care

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
REALITY often seemed to be just another subject for debate in the health care struggle, but it has a way of reasserting itself when the shouting is over. As Congress and the White House move on to lobbying reform and trade issues, a variety of experts are quietly noting that the problems that prompted the health care struggle are still, ahem, very much here.
The debate of the past 18 months was often as stylized as a Kabuki play, with as little to do with the real world: Conservatives talked of a country that was, by and large, happily ensconced in a fee-for-service system with full freedom of choice over which doctors people see, and full access to the wonders of modern technology. Liberals countered with a portrait of middle-income Americans teetering on the brink of medical and financial catastrophe. 
 The "no-crisis" minimalists won, of course, to an extent that almost no one would have predicted six months ago; a weary Congress seems eager to move on. But many experts agree with Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care think tank based in California, who argued: "When it comes to health care reform, you can run but you can't hide. The problems that put this on the agenda are going to get worse."
In fact, many experts agree, middle class Americans with insurance will not revert to a halcyon status quo, with generous coverage and an array of Marcus Welbys from whom to choose; they will get their health care in a radically changing marketplace shaped by the need to control costs. The choice never was between change and the status quo, but over who will make the changes, and how, and with what kind of regulation, if any.
If the Federal Government does not restructure the health care system this year, these experts say, it only means that the system will continue to be restructured piecemeal by employers and massive insurance companies and managed care networks. If Congress cannot reach a consensus on how to regulate these changes, and deal with some of the problems of cost and coverage, it only means that the pressure will grow on the states to do so, piecemeal -- which means the chorus may rise once again for uniform Federal laws. In short, the whole noisy, confusing, troubling, expensive health care struggle will almost certainly end up back in Washington.
Not immediately, of course, and not on the scale of 1994, at least for a while; it is universally acknowledged in Washington that the Congress of 1995 -- almost assuredly a more conservative Congress -- will have the appetite only for bite-size reform. And there are some who worry about even that being accomplished; the new Congress is expected to be exceedingly deficit-conscious, and Medicare savings once expected to finance health care reform may, instead, end up being grabbed for the deficit.
But the pressures to act will mount. "The middle class problems and fears that put this on the agenda will only get worse," asserts Mr. Altman, "as more and more find their benefits cut, or their choice of physician constrained, or their employers sticking them with more and more of the bill." Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton, argues that the country is inexorably moving toward a three-tier medical system, as more and more Americans are driven into health maintenance organizations and managed care, by employers trying to control costs.
 
A Three-Tiered System
 Poor people and the uninsured will be treated by public hospitals and clinics, Mr. Reinhardt said; middle class people in H.M.O.'s and other such networks, and only the affluent in full-choice, fee-for-service medicine. Many Americans, of course, prefer health maintenance organizations and similar health plans, but the change is nevertheless sweeping. And it may seem jarring to a population that has recently heard its right to choose their own physician passionately -- and somewhat surreally -- defended by politicians of every stripe.
The message from one side during much of this debate was simple: The evil social engineers want to take away your freedom to get -- and be reimbursed for -- top quality medicine from the doctors of your choice. In fact, that posited an egalitarian ideal that many experts say simply does not exist in American medicine.
Whatever the flaws of the Clinton plan, one critique of it was fundamentally off-base, Mr. Reinhardt argues. "No one understood this, but the average American patient would have had more choice under the Clinton plan than they now will. If you work for a particular company, your choice of H.M.O.'s is whatever that company offers you."
There is already a backlash to managed care among doctors, many of whom feel themselves at the suffrance of cost-conscious health plans, deciding which doctors to carry and which doctors to drop. "I predict that before this decade is out, American physicians will be on their knees, at the state and federal level, begging for protection," Mr. Reinhardt said. Doctors' groups are already lobbying hard in state legislatures and on Capitol Hill for laws to make it harder for insurance companies and H.M.O.'s to exclude doctors from their networks.
But the catalyst for many of these changes -- rising health costs -- is powerful. The rate of increase in medical costs has slowed of late, but there is considerable debate over how long this will last.
Part of it is believed to be due to the threat of health care legislation, and part of it to longer term trends, like the movement toward managed care. Regardless, said Richard Ostuw, chief actuary for Towers Perrin, a benefits consulting firm, "most employers will still be dissatisfied with the rate of increase in health care costs" in the future.
Once the passions of the current struggle die down, many Americans may also wonder whatever happened to the insurance reforms they were promised -- the rules intended to keep insurance companies from denying coverage on grounds like "pre-existing conditions." They may begin to worry again about having "portability" of health care plans when they change jobs.
If the economy goes into a downturn, they may start to worry about joining the ranks of the uninsured, now estimated at 39 million, a number that has risen steadily in recent years. They may become more receptive to the campaign, expected to begin in full force next year, to try, at least, to extend coverage to children.
Some 8 to 10 million of the uninsured are children, many of them with untreated or only sporadically treated conditions like repeated ear infections or asthma, said Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Health Fund and chief of community pediatrics at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. Not providing for these children, he argues, "ends up costing the health care system in very substantial ways, and really impacts on these kids' ability to function."
Down the road, there will be other health-related pressures bubbling up among the middle class: "Over the next five to seven years, all the parents of the baby boom generation will become elderly, and many of them will become very elderly and start needing long-term-care services," said Joshua Wiener, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and an expert on long-term care. "And they'll start turning to their baby boom children for care and help and in some cases financing for these services. How we're going to take care of Mom will become a major political and social issue in the very near term."
 
False Impressions?
 Such realities linger. "As the debate went on and on, there was a kind of lulling, that the problems weren't so bad," said Stuart Altman, a health analyst at Brandeis, who advised the Clintons during the transition. "You in the press went from pumping up the problems to pumping up the problems of the solutions."
Some people, of course, never engaged in the expectations game. Dr. Gwen Wurm, director of community pediatrics at the University of Miami, spent substantial time with the uninsured in August, when she and her staff did free back-to-school physicals in a mobile clinic. They did not seem to think help was on its way from Washington, she said, now or any time soon. "People who are working poor, they're very realistic about what their chances are of getting help from any sector," she said.
But the middle class does not usually struggle in silence.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Are the Savings Real?;
Paying the Price for Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
IT'S election season and tax cut fever is upon the land. Taking a cue from Christine Todd Whitman's successful campaign for governor in New Jersey last year, George Pataki, the Republican gubernatorial candidate in New York, is calling for a 25 percent reduction in income tax rates -- savings, he argues, that are possible without adverse consequences to localities dependent on state aid.
 But when is a tax cut really a tax cut? Experience has shown that, barring an economic boom or a large amount of obvious fat in the budget, cuts at one level of government are often made up for by tax increases at another. The alternative is a reduction in services. If history offers a fair test, suggests Helen Ladd, an economist at Duke University and the Brookings Institution, it is in California and Massachusetts, where the consequences of local property tax rollbacks have been reverberating through government at both state and local levels for more than a decade. And here, argues Ms. Ladd, "the chickens are coming home to roost" in the form of higher state taxes or as deterioration in the quality of popular public services. 
 This year a number of states, notably Michigan, Arizona, New Mexico and New Jersey, have cut taxes. And in most states with elections, candidates are jockeying for the high ground as tax-busters. But Steven Gold, an economist at the Rockefeller Institute at the State University of New York at Albany, notes that, over all, cuts will pare less than $2 billion from these states' revenues, a hardly noticeable sum from budgets that exceed $350 billion. "The lesson so far is no lesson at all," he said. The cuts have been too small to prove much.
 Where big cuts have been enacted, says Michael Brooks, a municipal bond specialist at Sanford Berstein, "you have lots of things happening at once," clouding measurements of cause and effect.
 In New Jersey, Ms. Whitman largely relied on $1.8 billion in one-shot savings -- mostly from the state employee retirement plan -- to finance a 5 percent reduction in income taxes. And last week she conceded that her promised 30 percent reduction may have to be phased in over four years rather than three. Michigan was able to slash state property taxes dedicated to education. But Mr. Gold points out that state and local coffers are benefiting from economic recovery and a boom in auto sales; the "piper will be paid" later on, he predicts, when the growth of sales taxes slows.
 That theme has echoes in the experiences of California and Massachusetts, where local property tax revolts in the late 1970's led to sharp reductions in the capacity of local government to generate revenue.
 David Hensley, an economist at Solomon Brothers, notes that California was "sitting on a large bankroll" when Proposition 13 was passed in 1978. Localities were able to shift the tax burden to Sacramento, meaning that taxpayers ended up "refunding" their property tax savings through income and sales taxes.
 By the same token, notes Ms. Ladd, "the time frame is crucial" in assessing the consequences of a local property tax freeze in Massachusetts. The "Massachsetts miracle" -- the dramatic expansion of the economy in the early 1980's -- that propelled Gov. Michael Dukakis into the national consciousness also enabled the state to use increased tax revenues to cover much of the shortfall experienced by towns and cities.
 
Recession Strikes
 In both states, though, recession ultimately altered the fiscal equation. California was forced to raise the state sales tax in 1991, and then forced to postpone a scheduled rollback in the sales tax in 1993 to protect state aid to localities. William Weld, Massachusett's Governor, refused to raise taxes to cover projected budget deficits, relying instead on cuts in outlays on infrastructure and health services. Ms. Ladd, who has studied Massachusetts local finances in considerable detail, concludes that "municipalities are really hurting." Most, she says, are dipping into rainy day reserves to protect crucial services.
 While there are few "supply side" purists around these days to claim that lower tax rates offer a free lunch by igniting an economic boom, most economists agree that there are offsetting benefits to be had from luring businesses (and thus jobs and a larger tax base) from high-tax states. But as Mr. Gold points out, this is a zero-sum game: Competition among states will eventually nullify the positive impact.
 A more plausible defense of tax-cutting is that it is the only practical way to force states to contain spending. The catch, of course, is that while everyone seems to agree that state and local government is rife with waste, the politics of budget-cutting do not necessarily serve the public interest. "People think waste can be skimmed off the top like cream from old-fashioned milk bottles," says Ms. Ladd. "But government budgets are more like homogenized milk" -- with the fat evenly mixed with the good stuff.

HEADLINE: The World;
What Big Stick? Just Sell.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE past few weeks have provided a revealing study in contrasts between the Clinton foreign economic policy and the Clinton foreign security policy. To put it bluntly, Mr. Clinton's foreign economic policy tends to be everything that the rest of his foreign policy is not: The strategy has been fairly consistent, even if the tactics varied; his goals have been generally well-articulated, the payoff for the American public clear-cut, and the passions of the President obviously engaged.
 When it came to Bosnia, Somalia and even Haiti, the President often seemed unable to make a connection between his goals and the means he was ready to spend to achieve them. But that has not been the case in much of his economic diplomacy.
 
Take Russia, for instance. One of the most difficult tasks for the Administration was to figure out how to use American and international aid to help induce Moscow toward tough free-market reforms, without destabilizing President Boris N. Yeltsin, who would have to sell the package to his people. Dangling the aid was a bit like trying to lure a mouse with a bit of cheese. If you put the cheese too close, the mouse just eats it. If you put the cheese too far away, the mouse can't see it. After some fits and starts, Mr. Clinton, who met with Mr. Yeltsin here last week, got it just about right, and while the main credit for reform must go to the Russians, the American role has been positive.
 While the Administration has groped for an over-arching theme to its foreign policy, it has a pretty clear one in its economic diplomacy. Early on, it named 10 countries as "Big Emerging Markets" -- countries like India, Brazil and Indonesia -- and it has systematically worked with American business executives to make sure they are exploiting the opportunities there. On the broader question of trade, the President, in defiance of the old-time labor mandarins in his own party, has staked out a position in favor of free trade and opening markets and has stuck to it, fighting with all his credibility for the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
 Much to the Administration's frustration, though, Mr. Clinton has gotten almost no credit for these policies from the very constituency that has most benefited from his merchant diplomacy -- the American business community. It is almost as though American business leaders cannot grasp that a Democratic President is pursuing their interests so intently. Whatever the reason, business leaders are not in Mr. Clinton's pocket, even though they seem to be picking it quite regularly. It is almost as though business leaders have not forgiven Mr. Clinton for his original sin -- raising taxes on high-income earners in his first year. But consider this: Mr. Clinton has won passage of Nafta, and if Congress passes GATT this year, he may well deserve to be remembered as one of the biggest tax-cutters in history, since the two agreements lower tariffs -- which are taxes on imports -- by billions of dollars over the next decade.
 That Mr. Clinton has been so much more adept at merchant diplomacy than at military diplomacy is a function of both the man and the moment.
 
Uneasy Lies the Fist
 First the man. It's true: He really doesn't care that much for traditional balance-of-power military diplomacy. That is one reason he leapt at the alternative to invading Haiti that Jimmy Carter negotiated two weeks ago. The Administration's on-again, off-again attitude toward intervening in last week's street battles there seemed emblematic of that ambivalence.
 Indeed, while Mr. Clinton is a "New Democrat" in economic diplomacy, he is still an "Old Democrat" in military diplomacy. Like so many Democrats of his generation, he and his foreign policy advisers are not comfortable wielding military power; the big stick just does not rest easy in their palms. Perhaps it is because the use of force is a zero-sum game: one side's gains are the other side's losses. As one Clinton aide remarked, "he is not a zero-sum kind of guy -- he is a positive-sum guy; he likes situations in which everyone can come out a winner."
 Trade and merchant diplomacy tend to be positive-sum games. More important, the interplay between trade, technology, educational training, economics and jobs really does seem to engage the President intellectually and animate him politically. When talking about foreign security matters, like Haiti, he tends to speak from note cards; when talking about foreign economic policy, like Nafta, no teleprompter is necessary.
 But this historical moment has also been one far more conducive to merchant diplomacy than gunboat diplomacy. After the cold war, more and more countries wanted to be market-oriented; everyone wanted more trade and more investment, and the American economic model was embraced worldwide. The American public, hoping for better jobs and wages, was very much in favor of economic engagement with the world.
 By contrast, America went through a defense wind-down and a psychological withdrawal from military-style engagement abroad. The public equated intervention in Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti with intrigue, uncertainty and waste -- and all these moods percolated upward and were reflected by the President in his own uncertain handling of these issues.
 But lest Mr. Clinton and his economic advisers become too smug, they might want to remember this: The easy part for them is over. When they came into office GATT and Nafta were already teed up and ready to go. The partial agreement reached in this weekend's negotiations with Japan demonstrate that the Administration is still struggling for a long-term way to deal with the imbalance of trade with Tokyo. And it is still unclear whether the Clinton team will be able to fulfill its hopes of extending Nafta to the rest of Latin America or free trade to the Pacific community. Russia and the other emerging markets may be on the right track, but their arrival at the station remains uncertain. Mr. Clinton and his team have certainly exploited the moment they inherited. But even they acknowledge uncertainty about what their own legacy will be.

Who's for More Inflation and Who Isn't

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
EVER since the 1970's, when the nation really got hit with inflation, Americans have been telling themselves that a rising inflation rate is villainous. But now some powerful people are stepping forth and saying that maybe a little more inflation is not so bad. Or maybe the alternative is worse.
They don't put it that way. The ghost of the 70's, when the inflation rate almost tripled in the blink of three years, is still powerful enough so that almost no one dares to offer three cheers for rising inflation. But the ghost is losing its spookiness. There have been too many months in which sharply rising inflation has been expected, feared, spotted down the block -- but never in the house. 
 And now an increasingly vocal constituency is saying that maybe the world has changed. Maybe the annual inflation rate can get as high as 4 percent -- it is 2.8 percent today -- and still not shoot up, as it did in the 70's. They are manufacturers, retailers and some bankers, among others. All are prospering. And they argue that their newfound prosperity might not last without a little tolerance of rising inflation.
Their campaigning is directed today at a single institution, the Federal Reserve, and a single possible act: whether the Federal Reserve should raise interest rates another notch in 1994. In the eyes of the inflationists, that extra notch, the sixth increase this year, could finally discourage borrowing in a nation that requires abundant credit to thrive.
The National Retail Federation, not given to openly lobbying the Federal Reserve, did so last Tuesday, when the Fed met to consider another rate increase. That would "lead to a dampening of consumer confidence and spending" just as Christmas approaches, said Tracy Mullin, the Federation president, in a letter to the central bank.
The Federal Reserve, perhaps taking into account this appeal and others, did not act. And Ms. Mullin did not describe her federation as pro-inflation. Her case is that less borrowing means less economic growth. But in America today, economic growth and inflation are intertwined, so that favoring brisk economic growth means tolerating a rising inflation rate, and conversely fighting inflation means favoring slower economic growth.
A new uncertainty feeds the debate. Economists used to know, more or less accurately, the level of economic growth that might set off spiraling inflation. But changing times may have altered the dynamics. "In these uncertain circumstances, people say what is in their interest," said Herbert Stein, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers in the Nixon Administration. In their interest, a huge and diverse group of anti-inflationists -- a coalition grouped together loosely as The Bond Market -- is campaigning for higher interest rates and less economic growth to keep a lid on the inflation rate.
Although they may not think of themselves as members, millions of Americans who have accumulated trillions of dollars in savings in recent decades belong to the coalition. They have lent out their savings, most often to the Government through the purchase of Treasury bonds, but also by investing in mutual funds or in pension funds that, in turn, buy bonds. Mainly these Americans are wealthy, but anyone with savings can have a stake in the fight against inflation. Their stake is this: Their money should not lose value while it is out on loan. The money should buy as much in the future, when the loans are repaid or retirement comes, as it does today. And that means no erosion from inflation.
Foreigners who lend money in the United States, usually by buying Treasury securities, also belong to the coalition. So does anyone who imports foreign goods and parts, another big contingent. Their concern is not loans, but the likelihood that inflation will drive down the dollar's value, making imports more expensive. And then there are bankers, but their long-standing membership in the anti-inflation coalition is wavering.
Banks lend out deposits as car loans and mortgages, for example. Once, they worried that inflation would erode the value of this money before it was repaid. But now the banks sell the loans to others, at a profit, letting these others worry. Rather than inflation, the banks' concern has increasingly become making as many loans as possible. And that requires brisk economic growth.
Understandably, then, the American Bankers Association is not so quick to join the anti-inflationists. "The thought of inflation is frightening to bankers," said James Chessen, the association's chief economist. "But they don't want to see lending dry up either."
The nation's manufacturers aren't afflicted with such ambivalence. They have begun a full-court press against another rate increase by the Federal Reserve this year. To hear the National Association of Manufacturers tell it, slowing the economy, just when their goods are selling briskly, would be an insult. After all, they say, their efficiency and flexibility are so much greater than in the 80's. They can keep the marketplace stocked well beyond the old boiling point, when rising demand created shortages that drove up prices and with it the inflation rate.
"American manufacturing is at the beginning of a competitive comeback that we don't want to see derailed by an unnecessary economic slowdown," said Jerry Jasinowski, the association's president. "We want more growth, and we are willing to accept some inflation with it." Not incidentally, a little more inflation might help the manufacturers make price increases stick.
Nodding in agreement with the manufacturers and the retailers are just about anyone in the housing and auto industries, where rising interest rates for car loans and mortgages could dissipate the current good times. Labor is also a standard proponent of strong economic growth, but now more than usual. "We are right at the point that employers might hire more permanent, full-time workers" said John Zalusky, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. economist.
And then there are the fence-straddlers, chief among them the Clinton Administration. It boasts of the rising economy and the gains in employment. But concern is also expressed that inflation might get out of hand. And there is no overt lobbying of the Federal Reserve.
The approaching Congressional elections are also producing some fence-straddlers. Neither Democrats nor Republicans are eager to campaign on a platform of less inflation if it means less growth.

HEADLINE: The Tyrant Mao, as Told by His Doctor

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN, Special to The New York Times 

 BODY:
Mao Zedong, China's "Great Helmsman" whose brilliance, the official doctrine insists, led a vast nation to restored greatness, was actually an irritable, manipulative egotist incapable of human feeling who surrounded himself with sycophants and refused even to be treated for a sexually transmitted disease, though he knew he was spreading it to the numerous young women who shared his bed.
Those are among the elements of an extraordinarily intimate portrait of Mao drawn by Li Zhisui, who was his private physician from 1955 until Mao's death in 1976 at the age of 82. 
 Dr. Li, who has lived in the United States since 1988, has written "The Private Life of Chairman Mao," a 663-page memoir of the imperial court of Mao that, in absolute contrast with the official image, portrays it as a place of boundless decadence, licentiousness, selfishness, relentless toadying and cutthroat political intrigue. Excerpts from the book, which will be published soon by Random House, will appear in the coming week's issue of U.S. News and World Report.
"In outer appearance, Mao was very easygoing, easy to contact," Dr. Li said in an interview at his home in suburban Chicago. "But when you stayed longer with him, you found that he was a merciless tyrant who crushed anybody who disobeyed him."
Dr. Li's memoir contains very little in the way of major revelations about the political or diplomatic history of the Maoist epoch. No new light, for example, is shed on the most mysterious event of the period, the abortive coup engineered by Mao's supposed hand-picked successor, Defense Minister Lin Biao, in 1971, or on such matters as Mao's role in the Korean War or the diplomatic opening to the United States.
But Dr. Li's book, even in focusing on the private side of Mao, contains numerous new details about the nature of his rule, including his associations with other major figures. Jiang Qing, Mao's third wife and later the head of the radical faction known as the Gang of Four, is portrayed as a flatterer and a hypochondriac who, by the time Dr. Li arrived on the scene, no longer had conjugal relations with Mao. Other major figures of the time are seen as reliably sycophantic toward Mao. Those very few who were not were purged as a result.
 
Zhou, Like Others, 'Was Really a Slave'
 "Mao was a man who had no friends," Dr. Li said. "He saw everybody as a subject, a slave. The mistake of those who got purged was to see themselves as equal to him. He wanted everybody to be subservient."
"Zhou Enlai was really a slave of Mao," Dr. Li said, speaking of the Chinese Prime Minister, whose reputation in the West was for sophistication and finesse. "He was absolutely obedient. Whenever I saw him with Mao he acted like a servant with his master. A lot of people think that Zhou protected people, that he was such a good man. But actually everything he did he did under Mao's orders. Mao was on the sedan chair and Zhou was one of his bearers."
Dr. Li, who is now 74, comes originally from Beijing but studied medicine during World War II at the West Union University Medical School in Sichuan Province in south-central China. The school was founded by American missionaries, so Dr. Li's training was mostly in English, which he speaks well.
He went to work as a ship's doctor in Australia but, when the Communists took power in China in 1949, he returned home at the behest of his older brother, also a doctor, who had been a Communist since the mid-1930's.
Through his well-connected brother, Dr. Li was assigned to be a physician at a special clinic set up to treat China's new top leaders. In 1955, he was named Mao's personal doctor. He lived with his wife, Lillian Wu, and their two sons in a home in the Zhongnanhai Compound, a closely guarded part of China's imperial-era Forbidden City where Mao and other senior leaders lived and worked.
From then until Mao's long illness and death in 1976 (after which Dr. Li presided over the efforts to preserve his body), he remained very close to Mao, according to his account. He not merely treated Mao's various illnesses, most of them very minor, but also accompanied him on his trips around the country, serving as his tutor in English and visiting him in response to his extremely frequent summonses, which often came in the early hours of the morning.
 
How Real Is Memoir? Photos Offer a Clue

Is Dr. Li's account authentic? Can future historians rely on this memoir? One important piece of evidence that Dr. Li is indeed who he says he is comes from the numerous photographs of himself with Mao taken at various periods throughout Dr. Li's stretch of service to the Chairman. Many of the photographs are included in the book.
In fact, there may never be any rock solid corroboration for many of the details that Dr. Li gives, or for the many anecdotes that he tells. But Chinese living in this country have no doubt that Dr. Li was Mao's doctor, while American specialists on China have been impressed by the consistency between Dr. Li's accounts of events and what was already known.
Dr. Li immigrated to the United States in 1988 to seek medical treatment for his wife, who died later that year. He now lives with one of his two sons and his family in a suburb of Chicago.
"It boils down to the fact that the person who worked with him on the book did a tremendous amount of checking," said Andrew J. Nathan, a specialist on Chinese politics at Columbia University said in an interview. Professor Nathan was referring to Anne F. Thurston, another expert on China, who worked as Dr. Li's editorial assistant.
"In helping to create the book for an American audience, she needed him to explain a lot of the material and he was able to do so in a way that checked out," he said.
Some of the descriptions in the book, minus the numerous details on Mao's very active sex life, have appeared in other memoirs, especially those concerning Mao's imperial way of life, his residence and swimming pool in Zhongnanhai, his chronic insomnia and the very odd hours that he kept, as well as the atmosphere of sycophancy that surrounded him. But nobody before has provided anything like the full, elaborately detailed portrait that Dr. Li presents in his book.
"Here's a picture of the daily life of a man who has absolute power, and the fascinating thing is how absolute power sort of deranges the possessor of it, so that the boundary between fantasy and reality is obliterated because there's nothing to check his will," Professor Nathan said. "He was insulated in his own cocoon while everybody danced to his whims, and that has a lot to do with the tremendous disasters Mao wrought on the country as a whole because he was insulated from reality. His fantasies became reality."
Indeed, in Dr. Li's voluminous description, Mao emerges as a kind of Chinese Caligula, whose bohemian and decadent life contrasted utterly with the images of it so carefully fashioned by Chinese propaganda.
 
In a Land of Denial, Vast Sexual Excess

The most salacious elements of Mao's career, in Dr. Li's portrait, certainly involve Mao's sexual life, which reached openly lascivious proportions in a country where sexual license was rigorously prohibited for almost everybody else.
Along the way, Dr. Li provides some medical details, including the fact that Mao had an undescended testicle and that he suffered from bouts of impotency. Mao was married three times and had several children but, Dr. Li writes, sometime in midlife, and for undetermined reasons, he became infertile.
"So, I've become a eunuch, haven't I," Dr. Li remembers Mao saying after hearing the news.
Mao, Dr. Li says, used women for three purposes, the first and most important having to do with his pleasure. At Zhongnanhai, and wherever Mao traveled, Dr. Li writes, there were dance parties -- this at a time when ballroom dancing in China was deemed bourgeois and actively discouraged. Young women from cultural troupes or from the Communist Party secretariat, women who Dr. Li says were "selected for their looks, their talent and their political reliability," came to the dances and Mao commonly chose one or more of them to be entertained in his room, or in his special train, or in the guesthouses where he stayed when on one of his many "national inspection tours."
The second reason was political. Dr. Li reports that the husband of one of Mao's girlfriends, for example, was a subordinate of Lin Biao, and that she reported back to Mao on Lin's plot against him.
Finally, Dr. Li says, Mao believed in the Daoist lore that sexual activity leads to longevity, or, at least, the Daoist lore "gave him an excuse to pursue sex not only for pleasure but to extend his life."
"By the early 1960's, as his power rose to new heights, he rarely complained about impotence," Dr. Li writes. "At the height of the Cultural Revolution in the 1960's, he and Jiang Qing were sexually estranged, but Mao had no problems with the young women he brought to his bed -- their numbers increasing and their average ages declining as Mao attempted to add years to his life according to the imperial formula."
Once, Dr. Li recalls, Mao sent him one of his sexual partners, a young woman who had come down with trichomonas vaginalis, which is sexually transmitted. Dr. Li treated her and several others who got the disease.
"The young women were proud to be infected," he writes. "The illness, transmitted by Mao, was a badge of honor, testimony to their close relations with the Chairman."
Mao himself showed no symptoms of the disease, though he was clearly a carrier of it, Dr. Li said. When Dr. Li suggested that he take some antibiotic to protect his sexual partners, Mao told Dr. Li: "If it's not hurting me, then it doesn't matter. Why are you getting so excited about it?"
Many of Mao's personal habits, as described by Dr. Li, seemed related to his godlike status. He lived virtually without regard to the clock, often sleeping during the day and, even when not sleeping, staying in his bed, remaining in his bathrobe for weeks at a time. He lived in rooms built near a swimming pool in Zhongnanhai and would often summon his closest advisers to see him well after midnight.
Mao never bathed or even washed his hands or face. Dr. Li says that during the day his bodyguards went into the room and wiped his body, his hands and his face with hot towels. He never brushed his teeth, which Dr. Li says were coated with a green patina. Mao's habit, shared by many peasants in China, was to wash his mouth in the morning with tea and then to eat the tea leaves. When, once, Dr. Li suggested to him that he should use a toothbrush, Mao's reply was, "A tiger never brushes his teeth."
Mao, in Dr. Li's portrait, became utterly convinced by the power of his own fantasies. If, for example, provincial party leaders transplanted rice near railroad tracks to impress Mao when he went by on his special train, he never seemed to want to notice that it was a fake. He appeared to be utterly indifferent to the immense suffering and even the death on a large scale that some of his utopian fantasies produced, whether through vast purges of intellectuals or policies like the Great Leap Forward.
"Mao never said a word about the suffering of people to me," Dr. Li said, "The word regret was not in his dictionary."
How did Dr. Li survive for so long so close to Mao when so many others were purged, or killed?
"He once told me," Dr. Li said, "that you can play with a dragon, but you have to be very careful not to touch a single spot on the dragon's neck where it is very sensitive. If you touch it, you're done for. He told me that he is that sort of dragon."
"I never said anything roughly or straightforwardly," Dr. Li continued. "In other words, if you worked for Mao, you had to disobey your own conscience. You can never say anything as you think it. You have, first of all, to think what Mao will say."
Dr. Li acknowledges that for his first few years with Mao, he was held in his spell, and admired him as China's savior. As the years passed, however, Mao's cruelty and selfishness filled him with loathing.
"If I had known what I was getting myself into in 1949, I would have stayed in Australia," Dr. Li said. "For so many years, I did yes-man work, just to survive."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE DEMOCRATS;
Democrats See Only Negative Numbers

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
With little more than five weeks until Election Day, the Democratic Party seems to be headed for one of its worst midterm drubbings since World War II, which would present President Clinton with enormous legislative problems in the last two years of his term.
It would also alter the shape of the 1996 Presidential campaign. 
 Though most professional politicians remain reluctant to make firm predictions, a month of episodic campaigning since Labor Day has persuaded leaders in both parties that the Republicans have a genuine chance of making the net gain of seven seats that they would need to seize control of the Senate for the first time since 1986.
They have led the Senate for only 10 of the 62 years since the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
"It's bleak, very, very bleak," a leading Democratic campaign consultant in the Midwest said recently, and a senior White House official commented, "We're in the soup up to our neck, and it's hot."
Roger Stone, a Republican consultant, who was understandably much more willing to be quoted by name than his Democratic brethren, said, "It's hard not to be optimistic," adding, "I think we're riding a 1974-style tide, the kind the Democrats rode after Watergate."
So ebullient are some Republicans that they dream of pulling off a startling political hat-trick by taking control of the Senate, the House of Representatives -- which they have not controlled for 40 years -- and the governorships of the nation's half-dozen most populous states.
But many races are dead heats, many more remain in doubt and the lengthy session of Congress means that many incumbents have not yet hit their stride, either on the stump or on television. Some Democratic strategists think they can still cut their party's losses by emphasizing Republican obstruction of President Clinton's proposals and by ridiculing the lack of financing details in Republican proposals put forth in a midterm platform this week.
"So far, they have made us the issue," said Robert Shrum, who is advising a number of Democratic candidates, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. "We need to put the onus back on them -- their behavior, their negativism. In 1946, their slogan was 'Had Enough?' and they're trying the same thing this time. We can't let them get away with that."
But so far, all the momentum has been running one way. Democrats who were expected to win easily are hard-pressed, and supposedly vulnerable Republicans are doing well.
Republicans threaten the Democrats in a dozen Senate seats: open seats in Arizona, Maine, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and Tennessee; and those now held by Senators Dianne Feinstein in California, Mr. Kennedy in Massachusetts, Frank R. Lautenberg in New Jersey, Harris Wofford in Pennsylvania, Jim Sasser in Tennessee, where there are two contests, and Charles S. Robb in Virginia.
It is the rule of American politics, not the exception, that the party holding the White House loses Congressional seats in midterm elections. It has held true in every such election since 1938 in the House and in all but three in the Senate. But the losses have been truly punishing only when the President was deeply unpopular with voters.
For the Democrats, the years of misery have been 1946, which produced a pair of Republican-led houses that Harry S. Truman derided as the "good-for-nothing, do-nothing 80th Congress," and 1966, when rising impatience with the grinding war in Vietnam, with the economy and with Lyndon B. Johnson himself cost the Democrats 47 seats in the House and 7 in the Senate.
There is little doubt that Mr. Clinton constitutes a major problem for the Democrats this year, with his approval rating hovering around 40 percent in the polls, although he has raised several million dollars for their races. Many Republicans, like Guy Millner of Georgia, who is trying to oust Gov. Zell Miller, seek to tie their opponents to the President; Democrats, like Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, who wants to succeed retiring Senator David L. Boren, also a Democrat, tend to stress their independence.
But there are other problems as well, many of them beyond Mr. Clinton's control or only marginally affected by his Presidency:
*A nagging sense of economic discomfort, evident despite the strong business turnaround that has marked Mr. Clinton's Presidency, is costing the Democrats the credit they might normally expect for good times. Real family income has been declining in the United States since 1972, according to Government statistics, and that has engendered pervasive worry about the future.
*The rebellion against incumbency, which has been gathering speed for a decade and helped elect Mr. Clinton in 1992, seems to be cutting more deeply into the Democrats this year because they control the House, the Senate and the Presidency. They are incumbent all over town.
*Many more Democratic senatorial seats are up this year, which gives the Republicans that many more chances to score breakthroughs.
The President has had to scramble hard for most of his legislative victories in the last two years, forming and reforming coalitions. The almost inevitable Republican gains in the House and Senate mean that doing so will be harder starting in January. Anything more than modest health care legislation, for example, seems unlikely, and welfare reform will be an uphill fight.
In the House, in particular, conservatives appear sure to have a stronger voice in 1995. Republican candidates are poised to pick up about a dozen Democratic-held seats in the South, for example. There, though both parties are more conservative than their counterparts elsewhere, the Republicans are clearly the more conservative of the two.
The picture would be more sharply altered if the Republicans took voting control of Congress.
In that event, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a hard-nosed partisan who has led his party's charge against Mr. Clinton, would probably be Speaker of the House; 93-year-old Strom Thurmond of South Carolina would be in line for the chairmanship of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Jesse Helms of North Carolina, perhaps the most tenacious and quarrelsome conservative in the Senate, could demand the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee if he wanted it.
Almost certainly, that would mean gridlock with a vengeance.
Some members of Mr. Clinton's circle argue that it may help him two years from now, by giving him a stone on which to strike his flint. He could challenge the Republicans, newly saddled with authority, to devise a legislative program, which would give him a target for 1996. President Truman used that strategy in 1948.
Other top Democratic strategists think that the loss of either house would cripple the President.
If the Republicans took control of the Senate, Bob Dole of Kansas would be expected to become the majority leader. That might convince him not to run for President; some Republicans consider it doubtful that the party caucus would let him do both things at once if he wanted to.
A Republican Presidential primary contest without a Dole candidacy could produce a wide-open nominating race, though if Gov. Pete Wilson of California is re-elected, as now seems far more likely than it did a year ago, he could quickly emerge as a strong contender.
If the Republicans take eight Senate seats now held by Democrats, which seems quite conceivable, they could afford to lose one of the seats they now hold and still take control. They seem to be in the most trouble in Minnesota, where the Democratic candidate, Ann Wynia, a former state legislator, is running a strong campaign for the seat now held by Senator Dave Durenberger, a retiring Republican.
The Delaware race, where a 73-year-old Republican, William V. Roth Jr., is trying for fifth term, could produce an upset, Democrats think.
Republican House targets are concentrated in the South, but they crop up in all parts of the country. There are a half dozen in Ohio, four in Michigan, another half dozen in Washington State, five in California.
"There are still weeks to go," said Linda Divall, a Republican pollster. "But the close races tend to go to the party with the surge, and that's us, so far. I think we're sure to go from 178 seats now to more than 200, and it could be 210 or even 215."
It takes 218 to control the House.
But it is the battle for the statehouses that most excites the Republicans, who are thinking ahead to the 1996 general election campaign.
Traditionally, big-state governorships are considered good organizational bases, particularly for a party that does not hold the White House. Of the six biggest states, the Republicans are ahead in the polls in California, slightly ahead or dead even in New York, even in Texas (where their candidate is George W. Bush, a son of George Bush), slightly ahead in Florida (another Bush, George W.'s brother, Jeb, is the candidate here), slightly behind in Pennsylvania and well ahead in Illinois.

HEADLINE: Behind a Boom in Blooms: Safety, Drama and TV

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER 

 BODY:
In the beginning, after everyone got kicked out of Eden, some hunters and gatherers stuck a few seeds in the ground, and the first gardeners were born.
Now, about 10,000 years later, the QVC shopping network has discovered gardening. And so have the baby boomers -- 60 million potential consumers of trowels, perennials, shrubs, trees, lily ponds and worm boxes. 
 In 1993, according to the National Gardening Survey, conducted by the Gallup Organization, 68 million American gardeners spent $22 billion on plants and equipment, up $6 billion from 1989.
The people who are spending the most -- an average of $400 a year -- are 30 to 49 years old, college educated, with annual incomes of more than $50,000. Those making $100,000 are spending twice as much.
"What's really hot now is the home as sanctuary," said Bruce Butterfield, who has been tracking trends for the National Gardening Association for 16 years, "and that includes making a space outdoors that renews you. In the 80's, the cocktail chatter was, 'How are your tomatoes?' Now it's, 'My perennial garden looks like hell.' "
Gardening has been America's No. 1 hobby for 15 years. So why now is it hotter than compost?
Television, for one thing. When Martha Stewart talks about hydrangeas on her syndicated television show, they sell out all over the country. The shopping networks are selling plants, cheap, and not just daffodils but peonies, bleeding hearts and butterfly bushes.
The Scripps Howard Broadcasting Company, which owns nine television stations, is setting up a 24-hour cable Home and Garden Television Network in Knoxville, Tenn., and plans to begin its live shows in November. Ken Lowe, the president of the new network, said it hoped to reach 30 million to 40 million homes in five years. Programs will include everything from how to design a rose garden to features on community gardens and the gardens of celebrities.
Newsstands are flooded with garden magazines like Fine Gardening, Organic Gardening, Gardens Illustrated, Horticulture Magazine, Sunset and Southern Living. The Meredith Corporation, which publishes Better Homes & Gardens, now offers its 7.6 million readers an eight-page insert devoted entirely to gardening and puts out seven special issues a year full of ideas for the home landscaper. And next year, it hopes to draw another million new readers to a glossier, more upscale gardening magazine, Home Garden and Landscape, designed for baby boomers.
"It's clear to us from the research we've done that the greatest increase in interest is among people with relatively higher income and more education," said Christopher Little, the president of Meredith's magazine group.
"They're being more thoughtful and conservative and investing their time and energy to making home a sanctuary," he said. (There's that word again.)
Lawns are passe.
"They want a patio with pretty plantings," Mr. Little said. "Or a pretty place under a tree where they can have coffee in the morning."
They do not want to wait 15 years to have a mature perennial garden or trees that give them shade. "They are not trying to re-create Versailles," he said. They want bulbs and annuals, pretty planter pots. Low-maintenance stuff with a quick return of satisfaction.
There is a breathless air about some of these boomer gardeners that comes from discovering Pompeii and Perovskia, an unruly old perennial that is suddenly hot, in one fell swoop.
"I can't believe you put this seed, this dry little thing in the ground, and it turns into this beautiful ---- " Dorothy Kalins, the editor in chief of Garden Design magazine, said, stopping herself short, because she knew she was rhapsodizing.
"There's something spiritual about it," she continued. "It connects you to the old order. And rituals. Yet it's leavened by such common sense and humor. And yet there's a sense of awe about the complexity of it all. The garden has everything. Sex, drama. Life and death."
Of course, Virgil and Pliny were saying the same things 2,000 years ago, but they did not have a glossy $5 magazine stuffed with $6,000 full-page ads from Ralph Lauren, Hathaway, Jaguar, Godiva, Rolex and Stolichnaya to pay for their thoughts on plants.
Garden Design, a well-respected but rather dry magazine published for 13 years by the American Society of Landscape Architects for professionals and gardeners who can talk about Beatrix Farrand and Chamaecyparis without missing a beat, was retooled and showed up in subscribers' mailboxes in April like some phoenix.
The magazine, now published by Meigher Communications, says its circulation has doubled, to 150,000, in six months.
Even the old guard has noticed an upswing in readers as well as blue-chip advertising. Horticulture Magazine, the 90-year-old workhorse for serious gardeners interested in perennials, unusual shrubs and landscape design, has a circulation of 330,000, up 50 percent in four years, it says.
Meanwhile, in the homes of Del Rio, Tex., and Phoenixville, Pa., gardeners are shopping by television.
On Sept. 14, a Wednesday, at 11 A.M. in the small city of West Chester, Pa., QVC cameras were trained on two people sitting on a stage surrounded by flowers. Calls were coming in from all over the country. QVC is plugged into 50 million homes.
QVC's gardening expert is Derek Fell, a photographer who bills himself as the author of 50 garden books (well, 15 of them were calendars, he admits). His co-host is Donna Harfenist, whose role is to testify readily and often how little she knows about gardening. Both are smiling, a bit tensely. They have to talk fast to sell as many plants as possible in one hour, while still communicating the sheer joy of digging in the dirt.
"I love my garden because it just fills my heart," Ms. Harfenist said, "but I'm the gal who throws herself on the dirt and hopes something will come up."
But when she orders with Spring Hill Nurseries, the mail-order company selling the plants on QVC, "I'm perfectly confident," she said. And she feels the same way about Mr. Fell: "Derek," she said, "I could listen to you forever. You even make soil interesting."
The two were discussing the "Sun Starter Bulb and Perennial Garden" for $19.99, one of a handful of step-by-step gardening kits sold by Spring Hill Nurseries of Tipp City, Ohio.
That is 59 bulbs and perennials for 72 square feet of space, plus instructions, all for $19.99. And don't forget the 10 free hybrid lilies that come with any purchase.
"Now, Derek," Ms. Harfenist said, holding up a big daffodil bulb, "which way does the bulb go? Does that little pointy thing go up or down?"
So it goes, as the two race on through the Lifetime Peony Collection ($19.50), the Butterfly and Hummingbird Garden ($39.99) and Mr. Fell's latest book, "550 Home Landscape Ideas," published by Simon & Schuster.
The peony collection (1,700 kits) sold out in 10 minutes. The hummingbird garden (604 kits) in eight and one-half minutes. At the end of the hour, Mr. Fell and Ms. Harfenist had sold $100,000 worth of plants. The three previous shows sold $500,000 worth. And Mr. Fell's book has gone into a third printing, with 60,000 copies now in print. Though the show is still in its test stages, QVC is planning more installments in the spring.
But the queen of selling plants with style is Martha Stewart. When she talked about hydrangeas in her magazine, Martha Stewart Living, and then featured them on her syndicated show, seen in New York on WCBS (Channel 2) on Sunday at 8:30 A.M., nurseries could not keep them in stock.
"Within 10 days of the magazine hitting the East Coast, about every wholesale hydrangea grower sold out for the whole year," said Jerry Bolduan, a California nurseryman who grows 4,000 hydrangea bushes for his cut-flower business.
Gardening on television is, of course, not new. Thalassa Cruso, the doyenne of dirt who was one of the first gardeners to wield a trowel on television, taught Johnny Carson how to compost eggshells in his closet about 20 years ago. And there is "The Victory Garden," which originated on WGBH-TV in Boston in 1975 with James Crockett, the grandfatherly don of vegetables.
The show, which now features a number of solid practitioners, like Roger Swain, a biologist who is the science editor of Horticulture Magazine, draws three million viewers, WGBH says.
Experienced gardeners have been watching the frenzy with a mixture of pleasure and skepticism.
"There's always room for more garden shows," Mr. Swain said, "and I'm happy to have seed companies and nurseries and all those things."
But in his view, gardeners should be encouraged to consume less, not more. "You can almost measure the quality of your gardening by how little you purchase," he said, "because the better it's growing, the less you need of anything."
Perhaps it is a good thing Mr. Swain is on public television.
Ms. Stewart is talking empires. She wants her own channel. After she gets out her own CD-ROM, which is now being designed by two students at Indiana University, and after she goes on line. You can't get much more than a taste of hydrangeas in a six-minute segment on television. So you digest a little more in an eight-page article in her magazine.
And if you want to know more than that, you turn on your computer. "You can ask me a question, and I'll give you options," Ms. Stewart said. "Everything I'm trying to develop now is geared toward the ultimate Internet for Martha."
There is plenty of talk about the information highway at Garden Design, too. But for now, its creators are just reveling in the subject matter and the glorious advertisements, which have always followed the boomers.
And now they are in the garden.
"The super achievers are now buying their ultimate home, or they have the money to buy their own weekend home," said Joe Armstrong, a partner in Meigher Communications and one of those baby boomers who have built their careers on catering to their own generation.
"Twenty years ago, we were going to discos and rock concerts," he said. "Now we've left Madison Square Garden for the real garden."
And when asked how much money is to be made there, he shouts gleefully, "Billions!"

HEADLINE: U.S. GAINS ACCESS TO MORE MARKETS IN JAPANESE DEAL

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
In a significant advance for the United States, Japanese and American negotiators reached agreements today to open Japan's markets in insurance, glass and medical and telecommunications equipment in ways that should increase American exports to the world's second-largest economy.
But the all-night negotiations to meet an American deadline failed to produce a deal to increase Japanese purchases of American cars and car parts, which account for two-thirds of Japan's $60 billion trade surplus with the United States. President Clinton responded by immediately carrying out his threat to initiate limited trade sanctions against Japan for failing to open more of its market for auto parts, even as he expressed satisfaction with those deals that were struck. 
 The sanctions process, though, requires a 12- to 18-month period of investigations and further consultations before punitive tariffs are imposed on Japanese exports to the United States. As a result, the proposed sanctions are not expected to disrupt relations between the two countries or to rattle the financial markets.
Indeed, the value of the American dollar, which has slid steadily against the Japanese yen since the beginning of 1993, is expected to strengthen as a result of the package agreed upon today, which should reduce a lot of the trade tension between Washington and Tokyo.
Opening four lucrative sectors of the relatively closed Japanese marketplace, the deal culminates 15 months of often bitter negotiations between Washington and Tokyo. If the agreements work out as written, they may constitute one of the most important breakthroughs in American-Japanese trade relations since World War II.
The deal with Japan should also make it easier for President Clinton to win Congressional approval for a global trade agreement, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is now before Congress. The agreement would lower tariff barriers around the world.
Many trade analysts and industry representatives said they thought the package was a bargain for the United States in general and for American companies in particular. But they were assuming that the Japanese would carry through on their promises today to help foster progress "in access and sales" in the areas of insurance, glass and Government purchases of medical and telecommunications equipment.
The Clinton Administration can finally point to some tangible results from its get-tough strategy with Japan.
"This is certainly a plus for U.S. trade policy," said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a research group financed in part by American corporations and car companies, which have long advocated a hard-nosed trade policy with Japan.
"The deal establishes two things," said Mr. Prestowitz, a former United States trade negotiator. "One is a recognition on all sides that the Japanese market has certain structural barriers that need special attention. Second, there is an implicit commitment by Japan to deal with those barriers in ways that can be measured."
He added, "It is unfortunate that they did not get anything on autos, but at least Clinton did not back down, which is what so often happened in the past."
The failure, though, to reach an agreement on autos is a big hole in the package. It is true that American officials are increasingly less concerned with the sales of American autos and original auto parts to Japan, because those have been rising in recent years thanks to greater efforts by American manufacturers to sell to the Japanese -- although the sales numbers remain very low.
But American car makers are still largely frozen out of the Japanese market for replacement auto parts. The actions toward sanctions that Mr. Clinton announced today will be directed at opening that sector, which is tightly controlled by Japanese Government regulations.
The fact that the President carried through with his vow to begin the process immediately of imposing trade sanctions on Japan, for its failure to move on replacement car parts, keeps pressure on Tokyo to make concessions in future talks planned on this issue.
Still, the ultimate value of the entire package can only be assessed after several years. Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate subcommittee on international trade, said he was "disappointed that Japan failed to eliminate its pernicious trade barriers in the auto and auto parts sectors."
He added, "I will be watching their implementation carefully" in the other sectors.
This final round of negotiations began at 3 P.M. Friday in the conference room next to the office of the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor. For the next 20 hours Trade Minister Ryutaro Hash imoto and Foreign Minister Yohei Kono were like tag-team wrestlers taking turns shuttling from the conference room to Mr. Kantor's office with proposals, counterproposals and different language.
Mr. Kantor was closeted with his top deputies, Charlene Barshefsky and Ira Wolf.
Finally, just after 11 A.M., a bleary-eyed Mr. Kantor sealed the deal with Mr. Kono and Mr. Hashimoto with a handshake and expressions of good will translated by an exhausted United States Government translator, officials said.
The key breakthrough came with a Japanese agreement to accept indicators that would measure "progress" in their opening of markets, without promises to the Americans of any specific market shares.
Asked if the deals would work, Mr. Kantor said, "They are results-oriented and they can be enforced."
Looking at the fine print of the deals, it is clear that the agreement opening the tightly controlled $320 billion Japanese insurance market is the most sweeping. Penetration by foreign companies of that market is about 3 percent, compared with more than 10 percent in the United States.
 The accord provides for both Governments to track the foreign share of the Japanese market with several quantitative indicators and to try to make the American share increase.
Maurice R. Greenberg, chairman of the American International Group, which is based in New York and is one of the largest insurance companies in the world, said his company had not been allowed to bring its most creative insurance products and methods of distribution to Japan because of restrictive Government regulations, even though the company had been in Japan since 1946 and was by far the largest foreign insurer there.
"I think this deal shows great wisdom on the part of Japan," Mr. Greenberg said. "It will benefit the Japanese consumer in the long run and makes for a more level playing field because it now allows us more freedom to introduce products. The detail of this agreement leaves little room for ambiguity."
In purchases of telecommunications equipment by the Japanese Government and the largely state-owned Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, the agreement calls for extensive changes in the previously secretive and biased rules by which the Japanese Government allots contracts in telecommunications, an area that is now 95 percent controlled by Japanese companies.
But it does not guarantee the United States any specific market shares. The same applied to Japanese Government purchases of medical equipment, where the United States had 23 percent of the market, compared with 40 percent it holds in Europe.
The glass agreement consists of an accord on a set of "principles" that will be made final in the next 30 days. American companies have had less than 1 percent of the $4.5 billion Japanese flat glass market.
"We are very pleased after long and difficult negotiations that U.S. negotiators have achieved agreement on the key principles that will finally open the Japanese glass market to real competition," said Ralph Gerson, president of the Guardian International glass company.
Generally speaking, the Japanese goal had been to avoid anything that constituted hard, market-share targets for American imports. They appear to have succeeded, but at a price of allowing regulatory changes in all of the deals that should make it easier for American companies to gain market share and reduce the traditional advantages of Japanese companies.
The Japanese agreed in each area to some sort of quantitative measures that the two sides will be able to use to track whether the Japanese markets are becoming more open.
"Agreement was reached on objective criteria, which do not include the so-called numerical targets," Foreign Minister Kono told reporters later. He said the agreement would not only benefit bilateral trade relations between the United States and Japan but would apply to all foreign countries trying to break into the Japanese market.
The one sour note was sounded by Andrew H. Card Jr., president of the American Automobile Association, who said, "No agreement with Japan can be meaningful without addressing the auto and auto parts sector."
The potential sanctions initiated by the Administration today come under section 301 of the Trade Act, which calls on the trade representative's office to identify and address priority foreign practices that discriminate against American exporters.
The process begins each March 30, when the Administration lists major trade barriers around the world. It then has until Sept. 30 to see if it can get some satisfaction in addressing these problems. If not, as in the case of Japan, the trade representative narrows the list to the worst offenders. Once the 301 list is released, negotiations begin and sanctions may be imposed within a year to 18 months.

HEADLINE: 7 Industrial Nations Deliver a Rosy Economic Forecast

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MADRID, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Finance Ministers from the seven major industrial powers proclaimed today that the world economy looked firmly set for a period of sustained growth coupled with low inflation and announced a series of measures to support this.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who served as chairman of the meeting, said the industrial nations faced "an excellent economic outlook," with prospects for growth "improving significantly" and trade set to rise "at a faster rate than at any point in the last five years" while inflation remains "subdued." 
 "Clearly, our growth strategy, deficit reduction in the United States, lower interest rates in Europe and encouraging consumer demand in Japan are making a demonstrable difference," Mr. Bentsen said at a news conference after daylong talks with Finance Ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
To help sustain the upswing, the ministers from the so-called Group of Seven nations agreed to a number of new measures that include an allocation of $20 billion worth of extra monetary reserves as well as fresh credits to help former Communist countries and the poorest developing countries take part in the recovery.
They asked the International Monetary Fund to "take a more aggressive role" in surveying their economic policies to identify emerging threats to the recovery and make suggestions for dealing with them.
They also asked the United States Federal Reserve and the Central Banks of the other Group of Seven countries to become more closely involved in efforts to supervise the recovery.
American and European monetary officials said this did not mean that Central Banks were planning to intervene more frequently in financial markets to manage currency values. Rather, they said it signified that central bankers, with their expert knowledge of these markets and their responsibility for interest rate policy, are to be more closely involved in preparing Group of Seven meetings, which are expected to be more frequent in future.
As expected, the Group of Seven ministers reaffirmed their belief that reducing the very high rates of unemployment in many, mainly European, industrial economies, would require more than just sustained economic expansion.
They pledge themselves once more, as they did in Detroit last March and again in Naples in the summer, to make their economies more flexible and open to free market forces by removing regulations that stifle entrepreneurial endeavor.
The only concern they expressed in the final statement read out by Mr. Bentsen was concerning the recent increase in long-term interest rates around the world.
While this might reflect fears of renewed inflation, the ministers said that "to some extent" it reflected a worldwide shortage of capital caused by "an increasing gap" between what people are saving and the growing demand for investment funds in many areas, particularly Asia.

HEADLINE: At Odds in Bosnia

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Through 30 months of the Bosnian war, and the loss of 200,000 lives, NATO and the United Nations have had extraordinary difficulty working together to end the suffering.
But seldom have the two organizations been so obviously at odds or so clearly out of touch with the feelings of most people living in this country as over the past week. 
 Just over a week ago, angered by a day of shooting incidents in which two peacekeepers were wounded, United Nations military commanders here called in a NATO air strike that succeeded in hitting an old, empty Serbian tank. This, it was announced by the United Nations commanders in Sarajevo, was an example of tough peacekeeping.
But the air raid failed to impress the Clinton Administration and clearly left NATO, whose solitary target was selected by United Nations commanders, feeling dissatisfied. On Thursday, at a NATO defense ministers' meeting in Spain, the British Defense Minister, Malcolm Rifkind, announced that "there will be no more pinprick air strikes."
The United States Defense Secretary, William J. Perry, sharply criticized the approach favored by United Nations officials and commanders here.
"When we go in," he said, "I want to go in with compelling force. Force not necessarily just proportionate to the act at stake, but enough to make it clear that there is a heavy price to pay for violating the rules that NATO has established." The attack on the tank "was not robust, not strong enough," he added.
In other words, the Clinton Administration believes that substantial use of NATO air power could change the attitude of the Bosnian Serbs. Instead of constantly engaging in brinkmanship -- leaving tanks in a zone around Sarajevo that is supposed to be free of heavy weapons, or shutting off water and electricity to the city to gain other concessions -- the Serbs would think twice about such provocation and perhaps move closer to accepting an American-backed peace plan, the thinking goes.
This theory -- that Serbs could be bombed into a change of attitude -- has never been tested over the course of the war, so it remains unproven. The Serbs might react in a different way, by killing United Nations soldiers, for example. It is this prospect that worries the United Nations force here, and it seems to have led its British and French commanders in Sarajevo to adopt a different approach from that now officially supported by British and French defense ministers within NATO.
Take the events of the past week. After the NATO air strike, the Serbs got predictably cross. A Serbian liaison officer delivered a note saying that any United Nations aircraft attempting to land at the airfield would be targets for reprisals. The threat closed the airport, leaving a single way into and out of the city, the Mount Igman Road, which is constantly targeted by Serbian guns.
At the same time, most United Nations aid convoys passing through Serbian-held territory in Bosnia were held up by the Serbs. A week later they remain immobilized, though the United Nations secured a pledge from the Serbs today to let them resume next week. Food supplies are running low in the eastern Muslim enclave of Srebrenica, and stocks in Sarajevo that should be growing in preparation for the winter are shrinking instead.
"You can't escalate the situation by using force and then continuing to use it," Lieut. Col. Tim Spicer, a spokesman for the United Nations force, said this week. "You have to use force in a proportionate, precise and relevant way, and then you must negotiate patiently."
In other words, tough peacekeeping must be followed by conciliatory peacekeeping to keep the United Nations mission alive. But this approach begs the question: What exactly did last week's NATO strike achieve? Would it be better to be consistently hard-nosed or consistently accommodating?
By promising tougher and wider action against the Bosnian Serbs today, NATO defense ministers appear to be trying to respond to these questions.
The response is belated. Ever since the Clinton Administration first proposed lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia and using air strikes more than a year ago, it has been obvious that NATO and the United Nations had a problem. The dilemma lies in the irreconcilability of the wide air strikes publicly favored by Mr. Clinton and the presence of thousands of United Nations troops here. To pretend otherwise appears disingenuous at best, but the problem has never been resolved.
And so, while defense ministers have vowed that NATO will be more robust, United Nations officers here have spent the last nine days negotiating with the Serbs over the airport closing and whether they might be allowed to inspect some tank and artillery positions violating the weapons exclusion zone encircling Sarajevo. The Serbs said no, and the inspections have been postponed.
Such incongruities are not lost on the people of Sarajevo, who live in a cage that is no longer littered with carnage but is a cage nonetheless.
They know that United Nations food helps keep them alive. They know that NATO and the United Nations did work together last February to stop the Bosnian Serbs' shelling of the city. But that does not prevent them from glancing up with disdain at the NATO fighters constantly droning overhead.
"I feel increasingly that what NATO and the United Nations conspire to offer me are 15 more years of vegetation," said Dzenan Kapteanovic, an economist serving in the Bosnian Government Army. "I'd trade that for a good fight -- win or lose in a year or two but get it over."
Such sentiment is increasingly widespread, though apparently not shared by the Bosnian Government, which seems to be anticipating a long war of attrition. It reflects a sense of living in a limbo, with neither peace nor all-out war -- a product of the enormous financial and political outlay by NATO and the United Nations since the Bosnian war began in April 1992.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: TAXES;
New Jersey Forum for New York Message

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FORT LEE, N.J., Oct. 1

 BODY:
After months of hopscotching from one end of the state to the other, the New York gubernatorial campaign moved today to perhaps its oddest venue so far: a rain-soaked cliff in New Jersey overlooking the George Washington Bridge.
Three mayors assembled by the campaign of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo attacked a new plan to reduce income taxes put forth by the Republican candidate, George E. Pataki. That the mayors were from New Jersey, not New York, was another sign that the budget-cutting policies of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman would remain a focus of the New York campaign. 
 Mr. Pataki appears to be seeking to capitalize on the popularity of Mrs. Whitman, who has attained national stature for her antitax efforts. But today Mr. Cuomo, in turn, tried to harness criticism of Mrs. Whitman in her own state to diminish her marquee value in the New York campaign.
The mayors said Mrs. Whitman's much-publicized proposal to cut taxes by 30 percent was forcing municipalities to raise property taxes sharply and reduce services for poor people. The 15-percent cut already in place had only served to shift the tax burden from the state to municipalities, the mayors said.
"The grave concern that we have is that the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Mr. Pataki, is attempting to suggest to New Yorkers to follow the same dismal economic plan," said Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge, a Democrat who also serves in the State Senate.
Mr. McGreevey said state aid to his school district was cut by $789,000 this year. Mayor Jack Alter of Fort Lee, a Democrat, said municipal aid to his borough dropped $975,000. And Mayor John F. Zisa of Hackensack, a Republican, said property taxes there rose about 9 percent.
Such complaints brought a warning from Mrs. Whitman that just as state government is tightening its belt, localities must also reduce expenditures to avoid increasing property taxes. Mrs. Whitman's own difficulties with the state budget this week prompted her to announce that her tax cut plan would require four years to carry out, not three.
That development was jumped on by the Cuomo campaign, which said it was evidence that Mr. Pataki's inspiration for his proposals was flawed. But the Pataki campaign stressed today that its plan would not hurt municipalities in New York because Mr. Pataki would work to reduce mandated spending.
"Obviously, this is a partisan attack," Zenia Mucha, a campaign spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, said of the news conference held by the mayors. "Mario Cuomo's unfunded state mandates have caused property taxes to soar. George Pataki will cut mandates and will cut property taxes."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN;
Candidates See Distinct States, Each New York

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
Anyone listening to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and State Senator George E. Pataki, his Republican challenger, talk about New York's economy would think they were describing two different states.
"Happy days are near again," Governor Cuomo declares. "I took you through two recessions. And at the same time laid a foundation for a powerful new economy. More powerful than any you've ever had in the state." 
 In the almost 12 years since he became Governor, Mr. Cuomo says, "We gave you 500,000 new jobs and 50,000 new businesses. And we gave you a whole new high-tech economy."
But Mr. Pataki, surveying the same landscape, sees not the peaks but the valleys. "New York lost almost half a million private sector jobs," he says, "at a time when the other 49 states created more than four million jobs."
Mr. Pataki says the reason that New York has done so poorly, ranking 47th among the states in new jobs since 1982, "is because we tax too much, we spend too much, we regulate too severely.
"And the inevitable result is that we have missed out on the economic turnabout that began nationally in 1991," he said.
From those starkly different diagnoses of New York's economic condition come equally divergent prescriptions to improve the state's health.
Both candidates are proposing to cut state taxes to create a more hospitable environment for business: Mr. Pataki with a 25 percent cut in personal income taxes; Mr. Cuomo with a more modest lowering of income taxes and utility taxes along with property tax relief. Each, however, envisions Albany performing quite different operations: to Governor Cuomo, state government needs to do more; to Mr. Pataki, it must do less.
Biggest Challenge:
Local Tax Burden
But neither candidate has yet to outline a program to confront fully the state's central economic and fiscal problem, experts say. The biggest challenge facing the next governor, they argue, is that much of the tax burden in New York is imposed by cities, towns and counties, whose finances are interwowen with Albany's in a tangle of money and politics.
As a result, simply cutting state taxes alone could backfire by pushing more of the tax burden onto localities, analysts say. Instead, they say, state and local finances need to be fundamentally rearranged so that the stiffest tax levies, which fall hardest on New York City and certain other localities, can be reduced where they are doing the most economic harm. Meanwhile, most analysts agree, public spending should be brought under control to conform with more realistic prospects for long-term growth in the state's economy.
"Taxes in New York are so far out of line with those in the rest of the country that they are a serious drag on economic development," said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of States in Albany, summing up a view held by many analysts across a wide ideological spectrum.
"But while cutting taxes is necessary," Mr. Gold said, "it is not sufficient."
The difficulty arises, he said, because of New York's unusually heavy reliance on local taxes to pay for government services like education, welfare and health care for the poor and disabled.
Although the pattern varies across the state, on average more than half the taxes on New Yorkers are levied locally. Measured as a share of personal income, New York ranks 22d among states in business and individual taxes collected by the state alone, 8.5 percent above the national average. But it ranks first, 78.4 percent above average, in local tax burden.
Mr. Cuomo, defending his record, says the state has tightened its belt more than local governments. "The local taxes are high because the local government made them high," the Governor said in an extensive interview with The New York Times last week. "So if we were to say, 'Don't worry about all that, guys, we'll pick up your burden,' what incentive is there for them to do anything like what we've done?"
Inefficient and overlapping local governments certainly share responsibility for the exceptionally high costs of providing public services in New York, analysts say. Still, Michael Wasylenko, an economist and state tax expert at Syracuse University, said, "Local taxes and spending are completely out of line with other states largely because of policies emanating from Albany."
 
The Mandate Factor: Costly Impositions
 Over the last decade, New York State doubled aid to local schools. Yet Albany still provides a smaller share of school budgets than most other states while continuing to impose costly mandates on local districts. More critically, no other state imposes as heavy a burden on local governments to pay for Medicaid and welfare as New York does.
While Albany has assumed a greater share of nursing home expenses, lifting a total of $7 billion in extra Medicaid bills from cities and counties since 1984, it fell far short of keeping up with the fast-rising expenses of the program. And New York is one of only 14 states that require localities to contribute to Medicaid, the health care program for the poor.
Both candidates say they want to help ease the Medicaid load on local governments.
Yet Mr. Cuomo, who has proposed a complete takeover of local Medicaid expenses, could not persuade the Legislature to assume more than a small extra amount. Meanwhile, Mr. Pataki said he would like to ease the Medicaid burden on localities, but has yet to offer a specific plan.
The local tax burden grew substantially under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, who served 14 years from 1959 to 1973. He built up state government, but found the soaring costs so expensive to finance that Albany quietly began to transfer many obligations to local governments and a myriad of quasi-independent state authorities.
Now, any efforts to reduce state taxes on businesses and individuals run the risk of doing little more than shifting an even greater burden to local taxpayers. And any effort to realign state and local finances, particularly by relieving New York City and other local governments of their share of Medicaid costs, exposes fault lines that have long divided cities and suburbs, Republicans and Democrats, upstate and downstate.
For New York City, the issue is critical. But the entire state is affected.
"The New York metropolitan area is the business center and engine of the state's economy," said Cynthia Green, deputy research director of the Citizens Budget Commission. "If we're truly concerned about economic development, we have to recognize that the heavy local tax burden here is a serious problem for everybody in the state, not just the residents of New York City."
Officials in New York City and elsewhere are worried that Mr. Pataki's plans to lower state income taxes might force local taxes to rise and, in even the best case, would spell the end of any hope for a state pickup of the Medicaid bill.
Mr. Pataki's plans call for cutting the state's top income tax rate from the current 7.875 to 5.9 by 1998. He said that he thought the state work force could be cut by one-third and state agencies could be consolidated without reducing services.
Those cuts in spending would raise only $300 million of the $5.6 billion drop in revenues caused by the tax cuts, but Mr. Pataki said he counts on a vibrantly growing economy to increase state revenues by 6 percent a year -- growth the Cuomo campaign says would be almost impossible to achieve.
 
Cuomo Prescription: High-Tech Future
 To be sure, many of New York's economic difficulties arise from forces apart from the high levels of state and local taxation. Improvements in telecommunications, ocean shipping and air transportation spurred the trend toward the globalization of industry and undermined the traditional roles of older cities like New York, Syracuse, Troy and Buffalo as manufacturing hubs.
Governor Cuomo, telling the State Business Council last month that the state's economic future rests with "high-tech, high-tech, high-tech," said his administration is helping to bring New York into the 21st century. New Yorkers, Mr. Cuomo proudly pointed out, went from 9.5 percent above the national average in per capita income in 1982 to 19 percent above last year.
The Governor cited the creation of 13 Centers for Advanced Technology at state universities and the planned state investment of another $32 billion on top of $50 billion in spending on highways, mass transit and other public works. New York also pours lots of money into an economic development program to recruit and retain business by offering targeted tax breaks, cut-rate energy and low-cost financing.
"New York's economic strategy is based on our producing the highest quality goods and services and selling them to the rest of the world," Governor Cuomo said. "This requires high-tech capacity, sophisticated higher education and skills training, extensive infrastructure development, access to markets and aggressive hospitality to business."
 
The Pataki Plan: Reduce the Burden

To Mr. Pataki, however, the state economy would be sounder if Albany stopped trying so hard to help New York companies find ways around higher taxes and more regulations and simply lowered the costs of doing business for everyone.
"What's reducing New York to the ranks of the also-rans is the presumption that whatever we need, government should provide," he said in a speech last week to the Citizens Budget Commission. "Governor Cuomo keeps protesting that we can't cut taxes unless the economy grows. I say we can't have a growing economy unless we cut taxes."
On the campaign trail, Mr. Pataki often repeats as a mantra: "Mario Cuomo says he can't cut taxes. He's right. He can't, but we can. And we will."
Despite the state's reputation, not all businesses in New York face exceptionally high taxes.
Two recent studies by economists, by Robert Tannenwald of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and by the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick, found that the combined impact of corporate, property and sales taxes on manufacturing outside New York City is actually lower than in other major states, including Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Michigan and North Carolina.
"In comparison with the 10 states included in the study," the Peat Marwick group concluded, "upstate New York has the lowest overall tax burden on investment."
But the studies looked only at manufacturing companies, which benefit from a generous state investment tax credit, and did not include the hidden taxes, like those on utility bills, that affect all businesses.
Moreover, Manhattan is one of the most costly business sites in the country. Vertex Inc., a research company in Berwyn, Pa., found that taxes on a typical $15 million service business in New York City were the fourth highest in the nation, behind Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Seattle.
Regardless of the research, many business executives say high taxes and other costs are continuing to drive them out of the state.
Floyd Maines, president of a $350 million institutional food supplier near Binghamton that employs almost 600 people, says he has been recruited by Pennsylvania state officials to move his business across the nearby border.
"It looks like we could save millions of dollars on taxes, utilities, and workers' compensation just by moving 10 miles," Mr. Maines said. "We're tempted, but I'm waiting to see if the situation is going to turn around here."

HEADLINE: For Taiwan, Asian Games Are Recognition

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Taiwan's team at the Asian Games, which open on Sunday in Hiroshima, is unlikely to return home with many medals, but the country won a prize this week that, in the arcane twists of East Asian diplomacy, made the trip a success. The head of the committee bidding to bring the 2002 Asian Games to Taiwan received his identification card.
That seemingly routine gesture was at the center of a tense diplomatic dispute that over the last several weeks has threatened relations between China and Japan and underscored China's increasingly overbearing attitude toward its neighbors. 
 The problem is that the head of the Taiwan committee, Hsu Li-teh, is also Deputy Prime Minister. Thus for Taiwan, his visit marks a modest success in its unending efforts to maintain political contacts with the outside world despite the fact that Japan, the United States and most other countries have abandoned formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of China. Communist China regards Taiwan as a renegade province, not a separate country.
In China, Mr. Hsu's trip to Hiroshima has been received as more of a loss than if their powerful team returned home without a single medal. China has angrily insisted that Japan's willingness to permit Mr. Hsu's entry violates Japan's vow to recognize just one China.
Taiwan has insisted that the visit is about sports and not politics. But the Chinese have grown increasingly shrill and threatening.
"The Japanese Government does not sufficiently understand what grave consequences its approval of Hsu's visit will bring about," The People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, said.
The Chinese have hinted that they may block Japan's efforts to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in retaliation for the visit. In addition, several Chinese officials hastily called off visits to Japan over the last week.
The Japanese Government has maintained in public that it is not involved, that the issue involves sports and the governing Olympic Council of Asia. But officials have been deeply perplexed about the situation in which Japan has been placed and the prospect that Japan's deeply important and sensitive relations with China might be harmed.
With China on its way to becoming a dominant regional military power, and with its economy booming, Japan has for several years done everything it could to maintain stable relations.
For instance, Japan followed most other countries in freezing certain economic relations with China after the brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square in 1989. But it was the first industrialized country to resume economic aid to China and to exchange high-level government visits.
This time, the Japanese have stood their ground, insisting the visit has nothing to do with diplomacy or politics.
Japanese officials also argue that the visit does not technically violate the letter or even the spirit of the 1972 agreement under which Japan and China first established diplomatic relations. The Chinese threats have thus been perceived as signs of emerging imperiousness by Beijing.
What is particularly discouraging for some Japanese officials is that they thought they defused the issue a week ago. Originally, Taiwan had managed to extract an invitation for their President, Lee Teng-hui, to the Games.
Diplomats here say that the invitation, from the current president of the Olympic Council of Asia, Ahmad al-Fahad of Kuwait, was a mistake that resulted from a lack of appreciation of the diplomatic sensitivities.
The Olympic council eventually withdrew the invitation. No sooner had the Chinese halted their threats of "very serious political trouble" over the affair, than the new issue of Mr. Hsu's visit came up.
China continued its attacks against Taiwan and Japan. In fact, the threats grew more tangible, with some Chinese calling off visits to Japan. The moves have caught the Japanese Foreign Ministry by surprise.
If there has been a silver lining to the cloud over the games it is that the Chinese have withdrawn a threat to start a boycott. The Chinese could well provide the most exciting moments at the Games, with the women among their runners expected to challenge some world records.
But the most enduring lessons may come from the diplomatic field, shedding light on China's and Japan's diplomatic principles.

HEADLINE: Italian Government Assures Jews It Rejects Anti-Semitism

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROME, Oct. 1

 BODY:
The Government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has formally assured American Jews that it has no anti-Semitic bias after a Cabinet minister blamed "New York's Jewish lobby" for Italy's economic problems.
The assurance was given on Friday in a letter to Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, during a visit here that coincided with a series of events highlighting efforts toward reconciliation between Roman Catholics and Jews. 
 "The Italian Government, in its entirety, systematically rejects all forms of anti-Semitic pollution of the civil culture of our country, even if they be merely linguistic," the letter said.
The letter denied that Labor Minister Clemente Mastella had made anti-Semitic remarks in August when he said the presence of the neo-Fascist National Alliance in the coalition Government "worries New York's Jewish lobby" and implied that "Jewish high finance" had contributed to a slide in the Italian lira. Mr. Mastella, a member of a faction allied with Mr. Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, later issued an apology.
Mr. Foxman was to have met Mr. Berlusconi on Friday, but the Prime Minister sent two other Cabinet ministers instead in order to go to Milan on unexplained business.
Mr. Foxman said in an interview that Mr. Berlusconi's rejection of anti-Semitism was "about as clear as we could have hoped."
The National Alliance has five ministers in Mr. Berlusconi's Cabinet, but its leader, Gianfranco Fini, has persistently sought to distance it from its roots in the wartime Fascism of Mussolini.
Mr. Foxman also met Pope John Paul II on Thursday as Israel's first Ambassador to the Vatican, Shmuel Hadas, presented his credentials. The Pope used the encounter with Mr. Hadas to renew a long-standing Vatican proposal that Jerusalem's religious status be internationally guaranteed.
"One hopes that the unique and sacred character of this city will be the object of international guarantees assuring its access to all believers," the Pope said. Israel has rejected such demands in the past, saying Jerusalem's holy sites are open to all believers.
Mr. Foxman said the final step in the formalization of relations between the Vatican and Israel represented "the first day in a new era" that would make it much easier for Jews and Catholics to address divisive issues. These included what he termed the Christianization of Holocaust sites, the question of young Jews baptized as Catholics in World War II and the question of historic blame for the rise of Nazism.
At a news conference after his meeting with the Pope, Mr. Foxman also urged the Vatican to open records from World War II, when an estimated 10,000 Jewish children and infants in Poland and Germany were saved from the Holocaust because local clerics baptized them as Catholics. The Vatican has not formally responded to his appeal.
Mr. Foxman said he had been one of them -- a Catholic nanny persuading a Polish priest to baptize him and alter church records to show that he came from a Catholic family. Mr. Foxman was reunited with his parents after they survived the Nazi death camps.
"We owe those who have a question, those who have a suspicion and are willing to face the answer, the opportunity to go somewhere, to ask the questions, to delve in their past," he said.

HEADLINE: As Legal Aid Lawyers Strike, Supervisors Fill In at Courts

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
In a move that threatened to tie up New York City's court system, Legal Aid Society staff lawyers representing indigent defendants walked off their jobs in a contract dispute early yesterday, but with many courts closed for the weekend the effects of the job action were all but invisible.
The customary weekend parade of people accused of being thieves, prostitutes and aggressive panhandlers and other defendants were represented by 27 Legal Aid Society supervisors who filled in for absent subordinates at criminal court arraignments in all five boroughs, and the bail hearings continued without interruption. 
 But officials of the society, which has 203 supervisors, and the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys, which represents 919 staff lawyers, warned of a major disruption of the city's courts, especially its overburdened criminal parts, if the walkout continues beyond tomorrow.
"The weekend is not going to be a problem and we've got more supervisors coming in on Monday, so that is covered, but Tuesday is the day -- and it will get worse as time goes on," said Pat Bath, a spokeswoman for the society, whose lawyers represent 300,000 defendants a year in criminal, civil, juvenile, family and appellate court proceedings.
If the walkout continues after tomorrow, Ms. Bath said, society lawyers will represent all current clients, but will be able to speak for only a few of the hundreds of new defendants added to the dockets daily. To prevent a breakdown of the system, she said, judges will have to turn to court-appointed lawyers.
The walkout of Legal Aid lawyers was only one in a series of crises facing the criminal justice system in New York City, where the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani confronts a shrinking budget, overcrowded jails and courts and a huge increase in arrests under its policy of getting tough with minor criminals to improve the quality of life in the city.
Last week, the Giuliani administration was forced to reopen a Brooklyn jail it had just closed to save money, and jail guards -- some of whom have worked 17-hour shifts several days a week -- threatened to strike. Amid these problems, efforts to avert a walkout by Legal Aid lawyers also fell apart.
After months of nearly fruitless negotiations over wages, benefits and other issues, the lawyers walked out at 12:01 A.M. yesterday as a two-year contract expired. The union, citing a "no contract, no work" policy, did not call it a strike, but scheduled a strike vote by members for 9 A.M. tomorrow at the Loeb Student Center on the New York University campus in Greenwich Village.
Michael Letwin, president of the union, was asked about chances that the lawyers would vote to strike. "I think they are pretty damn good," he said as he picketed in a drizzle with 40 chanting, placard-toting colleagues outside the Criminal Courts at 100 Centre Street. Earlier, more than 100 lawyers attended a candlelight vigil there.
The society and its lawyers, who broke off talks Friday afternoon and scheduled none for the weekend, appeared to be far apart on wages, benefits, the workload of its staff lawyers and other issues.
The lawyers are paid $31,000 a year to start, average about $45,000 and may make up to $64,000 after 13 years. They have sought a wage increase of 4.5 percent over two years, matching increases recently given to their supervisors; a continuation of health and other benefits, and new support staff to reduce what they call an overwhelming workload.
The society, whose $140 million annual budget comes mostly from the city -- $79 million for criminal court work alone -- with other funds from the state and Federal governments and private philanthropies, told its lawyers in a memo that fiscal troubles made the city "unwilling to make any money available for increases in compensation and benefits for the new contract."
The society, which says its lawyers earn more than comparably experienced assistant prosecutors, has made no wage offer. Instead, it has proposed bonuses of 2 percent in each year of a new contract. The first year's bonus would be paid in cash as the society absorbed any increase in health insurance premiums in that year. No similiar guarantee was made for the second bonus, though the society said it would search for ways to cut premium.
Mr. Letwin called the offer woefully inadequate. "It's so bad that when those health premiums are costed in -- leaving inflation aside -- we are talking about many people getting a compensation cut under management's offer," he said.

HEADLINE: Russia Fights A Rising Tide Of Infection

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Frightened by the staggering increase in infectious diseases across Russia, the nation's chief sanitary officer is warning that without emergency action epidemics here could soon spread out of control.
Rates of cholera, dysentery, diphtheria, tuberculosis and many sexually transmitted diseases have exploded in the past year. The rise is due largely to sharp reductions in funds for public health, a flood of often sick refugees from former Soviet republics, poor hygiene, and severe shortages of antibiotics. "We are doing everything we can to protect the health of this country," said Yevgeny N. Belyayev, head of Russia's State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Surveillance. "But the facts are not encouraging and time is short." 
 Russia is not alone among the countries of the former Soviet Union in facing the surge of infectious illness. In Ukraine, a cholera epidemic has developed so quickly that by today 18 people had died and doctors predicted that the disease would soon spread to nearly every part of the country. The country's chief epidemiologist, Vitaly Movchanok, said that many Ukrainian rivers are so contaminated by industrial waste and other refuse that most water filter systems are inadequate to protect against the cholera virus.
The spread of infectious diseases, from cholera to syphilis, has been viewed with particular alarm by health officials because their prevalence often presents the clearest indication of a health care system unable to cope with its most basic problems. Most of these diseases are easily preventable, relatively cheap to cure, and if treated properly unlikely to cause long-term complications.
But untreated they are deadly -- from the plague that has afflicted India and led Russia to suspend all business or tourist travel there -- to the cholera epidemic that began in the southern Russia this summer and has spread across Crimea and into the center of Ukraine.
Infectious diseases are particularly dangerous because they can spread with exponential speed. In 1992, for example, Russia recorded 3,900 cases of diphtheria. Last year, the figure jumped to 15,210, according to statistics released this week. In the first six months of 1994 alone the number has tripled again, to almost 48,000 cases in the nation. By comparison, in the United States last year with a far larger population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not register a single case of diphtheria.
Similarly, the number of cases of venereal disease among girls aged 12 to 16 tripled in Russia in the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 1993. The absolute figure remains low -- fewer than 2,000 cases have been reported in the nation. But the growth suggests a heightened level of unprotected sexual activity that almost guarantees an eventual surge in the number of AIDS cases here.
In the past, Soviet officials often bragged about the health care system and many people say it has gotten worse since the Soviet Union dissolved. But it is impossible to know how much of the current crisis simply reflects honest, well reported disease statistics -- something that was not possible until a few years ago.
"Russia has been hit with several intractable problems at once," said Murray Feshbach, a Georgetown University demographer. Mr. Feshbach spent the last week in Moscow, conferring with health officials.
"Russia has a severe money problems and it is obvious when you look at the health budget," he said. "They came late to realizing how rapidly these illnesses could spread. Refugees from all parts of the former empire are coming to Russia and bringing with them an incredible collection of diseases. And many Russians remain skeptical that the health care system can do them any good."
Open borders also present a critical problem for Russia. Again, democracy has proven far messier than the old days of Soviet border guards. Earlier this year, when cholera erupted in Dagestan, in southern Russia, officials slapped a quarantine on the region. But anybody with $20 could buy a pass that would let them board the next train to Moscow.
Despite its economic problems, Russia is still relatively prosperous compared with most countries of the former Soviet Union and many other countries in the region. As a result, every train station in Moscow is filled with people from Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Armenia and many other countries.
"These infections often come from beyond our borders," said Mr. Belyayev. "But once they are here it is a problem for all of us."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
MacPhail Hired to Lead Cubs to October

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Andy MacPhail was so impressive presenting a salary-arbitration case for the Chicago Cubs in 1980 that the player's agents, Jim Bronner and Bob Gilhooley, offered him a job at twice his salary, and Richard Moss, who had won landmark cases as a Players Association lawyer, called Lee MacPhail and urged him to encourage his 26-year-old son to go to law school.
All of that happened before the case was decided, but the outcome didn't change anyone's thinking. Bruce Sutter, the relief pitcher against whom young MacPhail argued, won a then arbitration-record $700,000 salary over the Cubs' $300,000. 
 "It was and remains the greatest disappointment in my professional life," MacPhail said. "I thought I had won it, but I was wrong. There's a scar there somewhere that hasn't healed, but maybe playing late into October will make up for that."
Fourteen years later, the Cubs have obviously forgiven their assistant scouting director for his costly loss. They have hired MacPhail as their president and chief executive officer, hoping he can lead them to that late October land, if and when it is sighted again.
As general manager of the Minnesota Twins, MacPhail exhibited a talent for building a team that could not only play late into October but could also win then. The Twins won the World Series in 1987 and 1991, prompting some National Football League geniuses like Al Davis to say they would be happy doing things the way MacPhail did.
Carl Pohlad, the Twins' owner, thought so highly of MacPhail that he offered him $4 million and a piece of the club to stay. But he decided to move because of the "opportunities and my father's advice some time ago -- a change in a person's life every 8 to 10 years is a healthy thing."
Lee MacPhail worked his way up the baseball ladder, too, concluding his long career as first the American League president and then the head of labor relations for the owners. His father, Larry, was also a noted baseball figure, serving as president and general manager of two clubs, Cincinnati and Brooklyn, and then as one-third owner of the Yankees.
Now Andy runs the Cubs for their corporate owners, the Tribune Company.
"For too long, they have slid people over who didn't have a background in the business," MacPhail said. "They weren't satisfied with the results."
As the No. 1 man below the corporate level, MacPhail will be responsible for business matters as well as baseball. But, he said: "There's no sense in denying the obvious. Rather than laterally move over a Tribune executive, they chose to find a baseball man with that background. I'll be interested in and spend a majority of my time, at least in the first year, on the baseball side."
MacPhail will not be his own general manager. He will either retain the incumbent, Larry Himes, or seek someone who is an assistant general manager with another club. Whoever the general manager is, he will most likely have greater latitude to make moves that cost more money than MacPhail had with the low-revenue Twins.
"Having money doesn't insure your being competitive, but it was getting to the point where not having resources dampened the chances of competing," said MacPhail, a believer in greater revenue sharing among clubs.
He also believes in building a firm foundation on the field. "You have to have a good nucleus," he said. "Then you can be more aggressive in the areas of acquisition in terms of higher-profile players. There's no sense building a house on quicksand."
Many people see the Cubs as wallowing in quicksand perennially. But their new boss said, "I don't think there's quite the history of failure that some people perceive this organization as having."
 
General Managers on the Move
 The job of general manager has become as perilous as that of manager. When the strike began, MacPhail, who gained the title in 1986, was one of the five most senior same-team general managers. Two of the other four, Tom Grieve of Texas and Dal Maxvill of St. Louis, were dismissed last month. Pat Gillick of Toronto retires at the end of this month, leaving Sandy Alderson of Oakland as the dean.
Fred Claire of Los Angeles will move up to No. 2 behind Alderson. Roland Hemond of Baltimore, who had been No. 7 in same-team seniority, will soon be relieved of his duties in favor of Frank Robinson. Twenty general managers were hired in the 1990's, and when all of the current or impending vacancies are filled, that number will rise to 24 of 28. Nine will have moved into their jobs this year.
The four who predate 1990 are Alderson, Claire, Lee Thomas of Philadelphia and Woody Woodward of Seattle, who himself has been rumored to be in trouble.
"There's more at stake," MacPhail said, explaining the rapid turnover. "The consequences of a decision that doesn't work out are greater today than they were 10 or 15 years ago. It's a much more volatile environment we work in. There's greater fan interest and media scrutiny. We're grateful for it because that demonstrates interest, but that has heightened expectation of performance in front offices."
 
The Hiring Line
 Unlike some owners, especially George Steinbrenner, Marge Schott doesn't stand in the way of her employees who want to pursue other jobs. She has given Davey Johnson, her manager, permission to try for the same job in Baltimore, where he is the favorite among more than half a dozen candidates, and now she apparently has told Jim Bowden, her general manager, he can seek the St. Louis job.
The Cardinals have interviewed Walt Jocketty (Colorado) and Wayne Krivsky (Texas) and are scheduled to interview Doug Melvin (Baltimore) tomorrow. All are assistant general managers. Melvin and Jocketty also have been interviewed for the Texas job, as have Chuck LaMar (Atlanta) and Bill Wood, former Houston general manager. Frank Wren (Florida) is on the Rangers' interview list as well, and another possible candidate is Kevin Malone, Montreal's director of player personnel.
On the manager hiring line, it appears that Tony La Russa will stay in Oakland for one more season, remaining until the Haas family sells the team.
 
Unfounded Whispers
 Owner-inspired rumors popped up last week after Donald Fehr, the players union leader, completed a series of seven regional meetings at which he spoke with nearly half of the striking players.
The meetings, owners or other management people said they heard, were tumultuous. Fehr was having trouble with the players, who were supposedly unhappy with their missed paychecks and the lack of an agreement. The meeting in New York on Sept. 23 was particularly rough on Fehr, people said.
None of it is true, say people who attended the meetings. One person said nothing like that happened at the session he attended; total fabrication, he added. A person who attended the New York meeting said the players there were extremely supportive of Fehr.
That was the meeting at which Dave Winfield gave such an inspiring talk in support of the union that when he was finished, Eddie Murray said, "Thank you, Reverend Winfield."
 
One Striker Can Play
 When is a striking player not on strike? Apparently when he plays in the instructional league.
Jeff Conine received permission from the Players Association to play for the Florida Marlins' instructional team so he can learn how to play third base. It doesn't seem far removed from having a striking construction worker help his employer build a house for himself.
Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, doesn't agree. "The Players Association has taken the position that there's no reason to stop players from playing in the instructional league," Orza said. "It's not a profit-making venture for the clubs. There's no reason to retard the potential growth of a player. The player gets some allowances but not a substantial salary for playing. It seems like a fair and equitable thing to do to allow players to play. We've authorized others."
 
No Dole for Players
 A New York state senator was repulsed last week by the thought that members of the Mets and the Yankees could collect unemployment benefits (a possibility that the state labor commissioner subsequently ruled out).
"New York must be the land of milk and honey," Joseph Holland, a Republican from New City, said. "It is the only place where you can make millions of dollars playing a game, ask for more money and get unemployment benefits while you strike."
It should be noted that the players struck not because they asked for more money and didn't get it but because the owners wanted them to accept a cap on their salaries, which, in the players' view, meant they would make less.

HEADLINE: Journal;
Judge Ito's All-Star Vaudeville

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH; Bob Herbert is on vacation.

 BODY:
The verdict is already in on week one of the alleged trial of the century: It was a bomb.
 Jury selection, untelevised and unremarkable, yielded no news, and desperate tabloid investigations into the private life and new hairdo of the prosecutor, Marcia Clark, failed to find a pulse. So the media circus (that is, reporters reporting on reporters) became the story, a video hall of mirrors leading nowhere.
 
 But this does not mean week one was without meaning.
 What it made clear is that the O. J. Simpson phenomenon is no longer principally driven by news in any case -- or by the question of the defendant's guilt, or by the big issues like spousal abuse and race and jury psychology that are supposed to elevate our pornographic obsession with the trial to a socially acceptable form of civic virtue.
 O. J. is instead a self-perpetuating cultural industry, with tentacles reaching into every branch of show biz, spinning off new products (CNN's CD-ROM) and celebrities (the porn star who once dated Al Cowlings) by the hour to feed its insatiable maw. In week one, even the industry's founding father, the defendant himself, dropped his somber pose to resume his show-biz career. He authorized the sale of a $15 fitness video he finished two weeks before the murders and, in a capital offense against musical taste, took to singing "Memory" in the courtroom.
 At this rate, the O. J. industry may soon be more integral to our gross national product than Detroit. As the rising talk-show host Kato Kaelin makes clear, it's already a more expedient route to fame than the star machinery of Hollywood. So many people and businesses have so much invested in O. J. that no mere news drought in a courtroom in L.A. can derail it now.
 In week one, some of the culture's few remaining holdouts got into the act. David Letterman, who had previously chosen to abdicate all O. J. humor to the self-immolating Jay Leno, finally entered the fray. Mr. Letterman was secure in the knowledge that Robert Shapiro jokes could be sprinkled into his monologue without invoking the laugh-extinguishing specter of the murder victims, who increasingly recede into the long-term memory of a country that generally lives in the short term.
 It was also last week that three of TV's upscale sitcoms -- "Murphy Brown," "Love and War" and "Seinfeld" -- broke their silence by offering satirical replays of the Bronco chase. Tikkun, the Jewish journal, has now joined The New York Times, The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books in contemplating the philosophical implications of O. J. We've also reached the point when even Dick Thornburgh, the dry-as-dust former Bush Administration Attorney General, cannot resist the urge to serve as an expert O. J. panelist on Larry King. Surely Ira Magaziner cannot be far behind.
 Can anyone resist the O. J. industry's promise of instant fame and riches? Certainly not Judge Lance Ito, who is for the time being king of the O. J. industry and don't you ever forget it.
 Mr. Ito's odd behavior in week one suggests a man who is not unmindful of the fact that his service in this trial is more likely to render him ready for prime time than for the Supreme Court. Warming quickly to his role as media jester, the judge ad-libbed a one-liner when the number of the first juror turned out to be that of O. J.'s old football jersey. Later he advised potential jurors to distract themselves from O. J. news by watching "The Simpsons" -- "the TV show, I mean," he quipped -- and listening to Howard Stern.
 More revealing still was the judge's resolution of his loud early threat to pull the television plug in his courtroom. Infuriated by KNBC's "exclusive" about imaginary DNA tests on O. J.'s bloody socks, Mr. Ito had vowed to hold a hearing last week to contemplate "terminating the media coverage in this case."
 But by week's end, his constitutionally dubious media blackout and even his promised hearing had been completely forgotten. No wonder. As long as the judge is on television -- but only as long as he's on television -- he has the ability to make and break stars, upstage the election campaign and destroy the productivity of the American work force. Administering justice seems the least of his duties in a trial that simply must not be allowed to get in the way of the show.

HEADLINE: Haiti Action Shows Unwise Use of U.S. Power

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Anthony Lewis asserts in "Question of Power" (column, Sept. 23) that many Americans "have essentially turned isolationist, opposing any use of U.S. force abroad." Mr. Lewis appears to be confused about the difference between using power and using force.
 
 Americans surely do not oppose the use of America's power anywhere, but American willingness to use our overwhelming military superiority to crush the resistance of far weaker (but sovereign countries) is not synonymous with diplomatic means to achieve worthy purposes.
 Great nations have many persuasive power options, and the measure of national greatness is how well these options are employed. Military bullying, by a Government that has refused to dismantle its historically unparalleled war machine when the cold-war hysteria that spawned it has ended, is not an exercise of a great nation's power; it is simply the unleashing of raw, brute force. Is there any real difference between a Raoul Cedras who uses military force to subjugate his own country and a Bill Clinton who uses military force to subjugate another country?
 Those who would argue that America's purposes are benign while the Haitian dictator's purposes are evil have short memories or are too young to remember when Hitler was claiming the moral high ground in occupying weak European countries. Our answer then, of equal validity today, was that the end does not justify the means.
 The United States is a great nation. It was great long before it was powerful, by virtue of a Constitution that protected, and still protects, the American people from governmental domination. Military supremacy doesn't increase America's greatness, but instead offers our Government the opportunity to dominate foreign peoples in ways denied it domestically by our Constitution.
 The United States is not God's political representative on the globe, and should stop pretending to this. The American people, not in isolationist spirit but wiser than their political representatives, are reflecting their instinct that American military action (and threats to take such action) must rest upon danger to legitimate national security interests of our country.
 The American people were unconvinced any such justification existed. The mass media have insulted their intelligence by arguing that President Clinton was derelict for failure to make this case. There was no case, and the people knew it.
 Mr. Lewis gives the real game away when he reports Gen. Colin Powell's telephone conversation to President Clinton about the terms negotiated with General Cedras: "Who cares about the fuzziness? In five days, Mr. President, we will be in charge." Does this reflect American greatness or the eagerness of an advance man fronting for the American military establishment to impel the President to act for the sake of budget-enhancing military activity?

HEADLINE: Oldest Law Firm Is Courtly, Loyal and Defunct

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
Until the very end, when the doors officially closed on Friday, New York's oldest law firm had a 19th-century whiff about it.
Yes, most of the paintings of hunting horses and tall ships, the photographs of partners in mutton chops and Civil war uniforms, were kept to one conference room in the blandly modern midtown offices of Lord, Day & Lord, Barrett Smith. 
 But the old values of being true, quiet professionals still held. Lord, Day's lawyers served the same clients for generations. The aggressive pursuit of new business and old bills was considered unseemly. Gentility counted for a lot -- colleagues uniformly described one another as "nice."
It was a lovely way to run a law firm. It turned out to be a terrible way to run a business.
Lord, Day, with about 125 lawyers, is the third midsize New York firm to dissolve this year, along with Shea & Gould and Bower & Gardner. In the last four years, more than a dozen firms, ranging from 30 to 250 lawyers, have folded, merged or been acquired to become the New York branches of giant firms with home offices in other cities. Legal recruiters predict that the shakeout will continue, as firms plot their transitions from the wild, flush 1980's to the sober, post-recession 90's.
Law firms have undergone profound changes in the last 15 years. Partnerships are no longer lifetime appointments; clients now regularly switch allegiances. Midsize firms like Lord, Day became particularly vulnerable to dissolution, caught between full-service firms and specialized "boutique" practices.
Like many firms, Lord, Day refused for so long to adapt to the new legal market that when it did -- merging with another firm, taking on a costly lease -- it was too late.
But Lord, Day's passing is about more than financial stratagems. It is also, members of the legal community say, confirmation that a somewhat romanticized way of law-firm life is over, that the profession has become a business.
"The coin of the realm ceased being loyalty, predictability and continuity," said Gordon J. Davis, a senior partner at Lord, Day, "and became money, money and money."
In 1818, Daniel Lord, a solo New York practitioner, hung out his shingle and by 1848, he was joined by his son, Daniel De Forest Lord, and son-in-law, Henry Day. The firm remained a kind of family store: successive generations of Lords became partners, including the current distant relation, Henry De Forest Baldwin. Lord, Day was known as a carriage trade and admiralty house -- argot for wealthy private clients and shipping companies. In 1925 it moved to 25 Broadway, which housed offices for the Cunard shipping lines, a Lord, Day client since just after the Civil War.
"The firm's ethos was: you're a professional man with your primary duty to your clients," said R. Palmer Baker Jr., a retired managing partner. Bills were sent annually. If they went unpaid, a reminder was sent the next year.
By the 1950's, the firm was virtually a synonym for stuffy, solicitous white-shoe practice. "Clients like to look at law firms and see themselves," said James C. Goodale, a former Lord, Day associate now at Debevoise & Plimpton. Slowly, the firm expanded to include corporate work for clients like the American Stock Exchange.
Another longtime client was The New York Times. In 1971 The Times obtained a classified Government study of the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers. The firm advised the newspaper not to publish the documents. When The Times decided to challenge the Government's attempt to stop publication, Lord, Day withdrew from the case. Thereafter, the firm's work for The Times was confined to corporate matters.
By 1979, The American Lawyer, a magazine that was then the profession's brash new trouble-shooter, sounded a warning note by including Lord, Day in a cover story called "5 on the Way Down." As a general-interest firm, Lord, Day was losing clout and clients, it said. Many clients were turning to in-house counsel or specialists, while others were simply disappearing in corporate takeovers. As the 1980's loomed, Lord, Day was not in position at the starting gate.
 
Rainmaker Decade: Loyalty Not Needed
 The 1980's rocked law firm practice, as they did in many other fields. Mergers and acquisitions work exploded, as did bankruptcy work. Lawyers grew envious of money made not only by their clients, but by their colleagues; The American Lawyer was publishing annual revenue lists that the entire legal community gnawed over.
Many law firms were still paying their partners according to seniority -- longevity counted more than the business that one brought in. At firms like Lord, Day, younger rainmakers -- people who attracted lucrative business -- felt their efforts propped up the veterans, who were expected to spend their golden years burnishing a firm's reputation by taking on community leadership roles.
Although most firms, including Lord, Day, eventually moved to a quasi-merit system of remunerating partners, restlessness infected the legal community. Partnerships were no longer forever.
And neither were clients. No longer could it be assumed that a client belonged to the firm. In the new era of costly litigation, clients shopped for better prices and the best lawyers; they bonded with individuals rather than their firms.
And those sought-after lawyers knew it. The 1980's saw the rise of the rainmaker barons, who presided over fiefs of junior lawyers, with specialties in areas like intellectual property and antitrust law. When the barons felt underpaid, they entertained a notion unthinkable just a few years earlier: they could leave the firm.
Free-agentry hit the legal profession. As long as clients followed, another firm would happily fling open its doors to errant rainmakers.
In 1986, Lord, Day lost a chieftain, Gordon B. Spivack, a former Yale Law School professor who oversaw the firm's multimillion-dollar antitrust practice. Mr. Spivack took 17 lawyers to Coudert Brothers, plus clients like the Coca-Cola Company.
 
'Power Lawyers' And Their Drones
 Robert W. Hillman, a law professor at the University of California at Davis who writes about lawyer mobility, warns students about the new world order: "This is very bad news for people who are just good lawyers," he said. "We tell them that the future is about power lawyers with teams of drones."
Lord, Day was never able to rebuild its antitrust work. Half the firm's real-estate practice left, as did Richard G. Cohen, its tax chief. In addition to the loss in business, the firm lost prestige: top-flight law school graduates became increasingly difficult to recruit.
But though firm loyalty was eroding badly, "the other side of the coin was a democratization of the practice," said Mr. Davis, one of a handful of blacks to become a partner at a New York law firm when he joined Lord, Day in 1983. The clublike crust of many firms was being breached. "You no longer got clients just because your father handled them," said Mr. Davis. Jews and women also joined Lord, Day's ranks.
The firm still had an illustrious roster that included Chemical Bank, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, Lincoln Center and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And it continued to be viewed as a kindly place: first and second-year associates worked directly with clients and partners, and even had lives outside the office.
By the late 1980's, senior partners were waking up with a start. They realized that if the firm did not expand rapidly, it would die. With scarcely 100 lawyers, it could not assign 30 or 40 bodies necessary for the complex mergers and acquisitions that were bringing windfalls to larger firms.
Its neighbor across the street at 26 Broadway, Barrett Smith Simon & Armstrong, founded in 1946, was having similar problems. It had lost much of its corporate department to Chadbourne & Parke. What remained were its muscular litigation group and airline clients like USAir.
In 1988, the new firms together became Lord, Day & Lord, Barrett Smith. On the day of the merger, Mr. Baker, Lord, Day's managing partner and leading dignitary, retired after 40 years.
"It had been the perfect place to be a lawyer," Mr. Baker said.
The merger made sense on paper; in reality, it was the arranged marriage from hell.
Lord, Day old-liners compare Barrett Smith lawyers to a high-school fraternity, hanging miniature basketball hoops in offices and venting emotion at top volume. Barrett Smith lawyers nicknamed some of their new colleagues "the young lords," and found them unbearably buttoned-up.
"You could live with someone you hate as long as you're both making money," said Michael F. Armstrong, a star Barrett Smith litigator whose clients included Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and Michael R. Milken's brother, Lowell.
In anticipation that the new firm would grow to 250 lawyers, the newly reconstituted Lord, Day signed a 15-year lease for eight floors at 1675 Broadway. In 1990, the firm moved uptown, just about the time the real-estate market rushed south. The annual rent came to about $6 million.
Even though business was drying up, Lord, Day could not bring itself to market its services aggressively. And, still believing that a general-interest lawyer could handle all the client's needs, the firm continued to take on one-time only projects with costly learning curves. "We had too many green cows with purple spots as opposed to cookie-cutter transactions," said Michael A. Chapnick, a senior partner.
Lord, Day's biggest, money-drenched cases were winding down while other clients were declaring bankruptcy. Corporations no longer stuck by their old firms; now they were awarding legal work piecemeal, often to firms willing to charge a fixed fee rather than hourly rates. Lord, Day, said some partners, began discounting bills to encourage collection. Squabbling increased in almost direct proportion to the drop in income.
 
Personnel Losses And Empty Offices
 The firm was struggling to manage itself. To just about no one's satisfaction, Mr. Chapnick from the Lord, Day group, and William C. Clarke from the Barrett Smith group became co-chairmen.
More defections ensued. The hardest blow came when Mr. Armstrong, who had brought in as much as $6.7 million in 1989 but whose billings slid to half that in 1993, left with his litigators in October 1993. He opened a New York branch of Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, a firm based in Pittburgh. His departure lost more than business and prestige for Lord, Day; 22 very expensive offices stood empty.
The firm renegotiated the lease and desperately sought a new merger; talks were held with a series of firms. But no firm wanted all of Lord, Day.
On Aug. 31, Lord, Day's partners voted to dissolve the firm. The New York Law Journal reported that although 1992 profits were $18 million, profits for the year ending Friday were expected to be $14 million; privately, Lord, Day lawyers say they think the final figure will be considerably lower.
Mr. Chapnick said that in the rebounding economy, a majority of Lord, Day's lawyers and its support staff had secured new positions. He and 54 Lord, Day lawyers will join the New York office of Morgan, Lewis, an international firm based in Philadelphia with some 775 lawyers and a vigorous public relations staff.
But even those with jobs Monday morning feel that with Lord, Day's closing, something irreplaceable has been lost. "We came here just because it hadn't woken up to the new world," said an associate who insisted on anonymity. "What I liked about the firm were the very reasons it couldn't last."

HEADLINE: Profile;
New York's Answer to Ross Perot

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

DATELINE: ROCHESTER

 BODY:
B. Thomas Golisano is running for Governor of New York, something no one would care a whit about were he not threatening to spend $8 million to $10 million of his own fortune in the last-minute campaign.
The only thing about this that isn't far-fetched is the money. Mr. Golisano owns nearly $150 million in the stock of his ever higher-flying company. 
 Perhaps accordingly, Governor Mario M. Cuomo gave the businessman a big smile when the two bumped into each other on the campaign trail last weekend. "Have you ever done this before?" he asked.
Hardly. Mr. Golisano claims his sudden bid for high office amounts to one last desperate gamble to avoid moving his company, Paychex Inc., to a state that seems to take less pleasure taxing, regulating and, in general, harassing its corporate citizens. Each month, he says he has to again persuade senior management not to move the corporate headquarters from Rochester.
"I have two choices as a resident of New York State -- I can leave or I can stay here and fight," he said of the political establishment he is convinced is destroying the local economy. "I'm willing to stand up to the plate, and I have the resources to do it."
Actually, he's more than willing. His obsession is collecting mountains of clippings on the bloated, inefficient lumberings of New York State government. His conclusion is decidedly that of the hard-nosed businessman: the state needs a new boss. And B. Thomas Golisano, the candidate, is ready.
"You're dealing with a profoundly angry man," said Gordon S. Black, a pollster who has worked closely with Mr. Golisano.
The candidate comes well armed with statistics to make his points, some of which are fairly radical. He criticizes the Republican George E. Pataki's tax-cut proposal, for aiming only to halt the growth in state spending, not cut it. If elected, Mr. Golisano would not rest until the state's average spending per citizen of $4,400 is much closer to the national average of $2,900. And he would consider replacing Medicaid with cheaper private insurance.
The candidate's social views are no tamer. He talks long and passionately about ending teen-age pregnancy, and thinks it is time to talk of decriminalizing drug use.
Ultimately, there are two ways to look at this rumpled Don Quixote, who two weeks ago announced his candidacy after the withdrawal of the previous candidate of the Independence Fusion Party, a self-described centrist party principally dedicated to throwing the rascals out.
One is to see him as a rags-to-riches scrambler who succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. Now, at 52, he is as alarmed as millions of others by economic and social deterioration, and has thrown himself into a Ross Perot-like crusade.
THE other possibility is that Mr. Golisano has climbed just about every peak that exists in the less-than-glitzy payroll processing business, is bored with charity work, is licking the wounds of his second divorce, and can afford to say, "Well, why not?"
Time, specifically the next five weeks, will tell. Mr. Golisano last week had a tailor take in a carful of his suits, began making commercials, staged a rally with a 50's band and began to carry on pretty much like the politicians he so detests. "Do you want a different facial expression?" he politely asked a newspaper photographer.
Smiles or frowns, this has all the markings of an impossible quest. The nation has just two independent governors, Lowell Weicker of Connecticut and Walter Hickel of Alaska, and both were well known before they ran.
HUMPHREY TAYLOR, a pollster with Louis Harris & Associates, said securing even 10 percent of the vote -- less than Mr. Perot snared -- would be impressive. " Does Mr. Golisano create the kind of excitement Ross Perot did? the pollster asked. "If he doesn't, he may just be an asterisk on election day."
A meaner question is whether Mr. Golisano will be as free-spending as he claims. Robert King, the executive of the Republican Party in Monroe County, where Rochester is located, pointed out that Mr. Golisano might have to sell stock to raise the sums he is discussing. "Most people of his kind of personal wealth don't retain it in cash," Mr. King said.
The overarching irony is that the state of the state that so riles Mr. Golisano came about under Governor Cuomo, who is now in a tight two-man race with Mr. Pataki. Because many pundits feel Mr. Golisano will siphon more votes away from Mr. Pataki than from Mr. Cuomo, it was the Republicans who fought to keep Mr. Golisano out of the race. "He will simply work to help re-elect Mario Cuomo," sighed Mr. King.
Beyond such partisan concerns lies a seeming contradiction. Mr. Golisano built his business on helping small-business people keep up with the flood of filings they have to make. These days, Paychex files some 6 million W-2 forms a year, and Mr. Golisano can tell you without missing a beat that New York businesses make 42 government filings per employee per year. He has even benefited from the flap known as Nannygate, now that more households are putting their help on the books.
"I would be less than honest with you if I didn't say that everything the Federal and state governments do to make things more complicated is positive for Paychex," he said, raising the question whether he could in good conscience work for tax simplification if he ever did make it to Albany.
One claim he can make quite credibly is that he would stick up for the little guy. His 23-year-old company is based on the simple idea that businesses with fewer than 100 employees can be just as worthy a market as large companies. He took that business public in 1983 at the equivalent of $2.17 a share, and can sell those shares today for $37.75 apiece.
All this has vastly enriched shareholders, particularly Mr. Golisano, who still owns 13.5 percent of a company now valued at about $1.1 billion. He owns a 3,000-square-foot house in the Rochester suburb of Victor, a house in the Finger Lakes region of New York and a condominium in Florida. Seemingly, his only major ostentations are a 1966 Corvette and a 1960 Mercedes convertible. He works 8 to 5, having learned the hard way that work is not everything.
"The sad part is that kids grow up before you realize it," said the father of two children with his first wife, and the stepfather of his second wife's two children. He is now in the midst of a divorce so amicable, he says, that no lawyers are involved. His wife could not be reached, but Mr. Golisano's first divorce had always impressed many for its lack of acrimony. His ex-wife, Gloria Austin, accepted a franchise in lieu of alimony, and was eventually well-off enough to own her own horse farm in upstate New York.
Mr. Golisano, who grew up in Rochester, has always handled people well while protecting his bottom line. His father, a heating contractor and salesman, ended up as a delivery man for Paychex, but at 81, he had slowed down. Firing him was the hardest thing the son ever had to do. "Dad, you just can't come in here anymore," he remembers saying.
L. Keith Mullins, an analyst at Smith Barney, said this strong sense of purpose is one of Mr. Golisano's most pronounced characteristics. He remembers an analysts' session when the executive was called to the phone. After learning that his mother had died, Mr. Golisano finished his speech. "Tom's no nonsense," Mr. Mullins said. "What you see is what you get."
IN some ways, what you have in Mr. Golisano is quintessential Horatio Alger. Disappointed he couldn't make it as a professional baseball player, Mr. Golisano went to work after high school for a local bank putting bills in packages of 50. But "something wasn't right with this picture," he realized.
He took a two-year business course, made the dean's list and landed another bank job, this one for $97 a week. He soon began working for Electronic Accounting Systems Inc., which was in the business of preparing payrolls for large companies.
It was there he spied his future. Research in a public library led him to discover that 98 percent of all businesses employ less than 100 workers. So he suggested going after smaller companies, but his bosses would have none of it.
Paychex was born. He borrowed money from family and friends and stretched his credit cards to the limit. And he set off to capture the pizza parlors and other small businesses of Rochester.
While the company has prospered, it still faces some challenges. One is that his 600 salesmen have to sign up 11 new clients a month to maintain the heady growth rate. Another is that more small businesses can do their own payroll processing on sophisticated software packages and personal computers.
Customers are unusually loyal, however, partly a result of Mr. Golisano's unusual guarantee. Paychex will pay for any governmental fines or charges, whether or not it was at fault.
Once his business was on track, Mr. Golisano began making time for local charities and started the B. Thomas Golisano Foundation in the late 1980's. It addresses the needs of physically and mentally handicapped children, a concern prompted by Mr. Golisano's second child, Steven, who is mentally retarded.
He also coached inner city youths how to run their own businesses, and became strongly involved in an effort to decrease teen-age pregnancies. He cites one Rochester kindergarten class where 25 percent of the class come from single-parent families.
"We have day-care centers in our high schools," he said. "I absolutely find that disgusting."
At the same time he was becoming angrier about prevailing economic and social winds, Mr. Golisano became convinced that the political process was fundamentally corrupt. So in 1992, he paid $35,000 to have Mr. Black, a national pollster based in Rochester, to see if other Americans felt the same way. He concluded they do. "I'm running to win," B. Thomas Golisano said.
The market seems to think otherwise. Instead of plunging on fears that the company's chief executive might be getting restless and could leave, Paychex's stock has risen nearly 4 points since the day he announced. Investors seem to think he isn't going anywhere, and they're pretty happy about it. 2

DEBT OF HONOR
By Tom Clancy.
766 pp. New York:
G. P. Putnam's Sons. $25.95. 
SOMEWHERE, if memory serves, Mark Twain said of one of Henry James's books, "Once you put it down, you can't pick it up." "Debt of Honor," the eighth novel in Tom Clancy's oeuvre, is, at 766 pages, a herniating experience. Things don't really start to happen until about halfway through this book, by which time most authors, including even some turgid Russian novelists, are finished with theirs. But Tom Clancy must be understood in a broader context, not as a mere writer of gizmo-thrillers, destroyer of forests, but as an economic phenomenon. What are his editors -- assuming they even exist; his books feel as if they go by modem from Mr. Clancy's computer directly to the printers -- supposed to do? Tell him to cut? "You tell him it's too long." "No, you tell him."
Someone, on the other hand -- friend, relative, spiritual adviser, I don't know -- really ought to have taken him aside and said, "Uh, Tom, isn't this book kind of racist?" I bow to no one in my disapproval of certain Japanese trade practices, and I worked for a man who once conspicuously barfed into the lap of the Japanese Prime Minister, but this book is as subtle as a World War II anti-Japanese poster showing a mustachioed Tojo bayoneting Caucasian babies. If you thought Michael Crichton was a bit paranoid, "Rising Sun"-wise, well then, to quote Mr. Clancy's favorite President and original literary booster, Ronald Reagan, "You ain't seen nothing yet." His Japanese aren't one-dimensional, they're half-dimensional. They spend most of their time grunting in bathhouses. And yet, to echo "Dr. Strangelove" 's Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, "the strange thing is, they make such bloody good cameras."
The plot: Japan craftily sabotages the United States financial markets, occupies the Mariana Islands, sinks two American submarines, killing 250 sailors, and threatens us with nuclear weapons. Why, you ask, don't we just throw up on their laps and give them a countdown to a few toasty reruns of Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Because, fools that we are, we have got rid of all our nukes in a mad disarmament pact with the Russkies. (Plausible? Never mind.)
For a while it looks like sayonara for Western civ, until Jack Ryan, now White House national security adviser, masterminds such a brilliant response to the crisis that he ends up Vice President. To make way, the current V.P. must resign because of charges of -- sexual harassment. I won't be ruining it for you by saying that Ryan's ascendancy does not stop there; the President and the entire Congress must be eliminated in an inadvertently comic deus ex machina piloted by a sullen Japanese airman who miraculously does not grunt "Banzai!" as he plows his Boeing 747 into the Capitol. Former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman has recently had the arguable taste to remark, apropos this episode in "Debt of Honor," that this particular fantasy has long been his own. I don't like Congress either, but Abraham Lincoln, Lehman's fellow Republican and mine, did go to some pains to keep the Capitol's construction going during the Civil War as a symbol of the Union's continuity. Oh, well.
To be sure, the war enacted here is not the fruit of national Japanese will, but rather a manipulation of events by a zaibatsu businessman whose mother, father and siblings had jumped off a cliff in Saipan back in 1944 rather than be captured by evil American marines, and by a corrupt, America-hating politician. But that hardly lets Mr. Clancy off the hook, for the nasty characteristics ascribed to Yamata (the former) and Goto (the latter) are straightforwardly racial. To heat our blood further, Goto keeps a lovely American blonde as his geisha and does unspeakable naughties to her. When she threatens to become a political hot tomato, Yamata has the poor thing killed. It all plays into the crudest kind of cultural paranoia, namely, that what these beastly yellow inscrutables are really after is -- our women. (A similar crime, recall, was at the heart of Mr. Crichton's novel "Rising Sun." Well, archetypes do do the job.) Her name, for these purposes, is perfect: Kimberly Norton. "Yamata had seen breasts before, even large Caucasian breasts." To judge from the number of mentions of them, it is fair to conclude that Caucasian breasts are at the very heart of Goto-san's Weltanschauung. Farther down that same page, he expresses his carnal delight to Yamata "coarsely" (naturally) in -- shall we say -- cavorting with American girls. Jack Ryan is therefore striking a blow for more than the American way of life: he is knight-defender of nothing less than American bimbohood.
IT must be said that the hapless Kimberly Norton is a glaring exception among Clancy women: so much so that you wonder if he's been reading Susan Faludi under the covers at night. With this book, Mr. Clancy stakes his claim to being the most politically correct popular author in America, which is somewhat remarkable in such an outspoken, if not fire-breathing, right winger as himself. Practically everyone is either black, Hispanic, a woman or, at a minimum, ethnic. The Vice President is hauled off on charges of sexual harassment; the Japanese Prime Minister is a rapist; the deputy director of operations at the C.I.A. is a woman; there is Comdr. Roberta Peach (Peach? honestly) of the Navy; Ryan's wife receives a Lasker Award for her breakthroughs in ophthalmic surgery; one of the C.I.A. assassins is informed, practically in the middle of dispatching slanty-eyed despoilers of American women, that his own daughter has made dean's list and will probably get into medical school; secretaries, we are told again and again, are the real heroes, etc., etc.
All this would be more convincing were it not for the superseding macho that permeates each page like dried sweat. Ryan's Secret Service code name is, I kid you not, "Swordsman." And there's something a bit gamey about this description of the C.I.A.'s deputy director of operations: "Mary Pat entered the room, looking about normal for an American female on a Sunday morning." His feminism, if it can be called that, is pretty smarmy, like a big guy getting a woman in a choke hold and giving her a knuckly noogie on the top of her head by way of showing her she's "O.K." (Preferable, I admit, to the entertainments offered by the officers and gentlemen of the Tailhook Association.) And there is this hilarious description of Ryan's saintly
wife saving someone's sight with laser surgery: "She lined up the crosshairs as carefully as a man taking down a Rocky Mountain sheep from half a mile, and thumbed the control." You've got to admire a man who can find the sheep-hunting metaphor in retinal surgery.
Tom Clancy is the James Fenimore Cooper of his day, which is to say, the most successful bad writer of his generation. This is no mean feat, for there are many, many more rich bad writers today than there were in Cooper's time. If Twain were alive now, he would surely be writing an essay entitled, "The Literary Crimes of Clancy." He would have loved "Debt of Honor," the culmination, thus far, of Mr. Clancy's almost endearing Hardy Boys-"Jane's Fighting Ships" prose style:
"The Indians were indeed getting frisky."
"More surprisingly, people made way for him, especially women, and children positively shrank from his presence as though Godzilla had returned to crush their city."
" 'I will not become Prime Minister of my country,' Hiroshi Goto announced in a manner worthy of a stage actor, 'in order to become executor of its economic ruin.' "
"The captain, Commander Tamaki Ugaki, was known as a stickler for readiness, and though he drilled his men hard, his was a happy ship because she was always a smart ship."
" 'This is better than the Concorde!' Cathy gushed at the Air Force corporal who served dinner."
"Damn, how much crazier would this world get?"
"But what kind of evil synergy was this?"
"Night at sea is supposed to be a beautiful thing, but it was not so this time."
"But I'm not a symbol, Jack wanted to tell him. I'm a man, with doubts."
"The dawn came up like thunder in this part of the world, or so the poem went."
" 'I knew Goto was a fool, but I didn't think him a madman.' "
" 'Gentlemen: this will work. It's just so damned outrageous, but maybe that works in our favor.' "
" 'Bloody clever,' the head of the Bank of England observed to his German counterpart. 'Jawohl,' was the whispered reply."
And finally, this: "The man knew how to think on his feet, and though often a guy at the bottom of the food chain, he tended to see the big picture very clearly from down there."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Good News for Commodity Sellers

BYLINE: By Ken Brown 

 BODY:
WITH the world's industrial engines shifting into the higher gear of economic recovery, demand for commodities is up and so are the prospects for improving performance in mineral-rich countries, not least those in Africa.
The rise in prices of everything from aluminum to zinc has coincided with economic reform programs taking hold in the countries of what were once the world's least desirable areas of investment. 
 "There is a good reason to emphasize emerging markets that have a resource base right now -- metals, agricultural commodities, oil," said William G. McBride, the international editor of Lipper Funds Service. The risk, he said, lessens in these countries when world commodity prices start rising.
The logic is simple. Europe and Japan are slowly following the United States out of recession and many newly industrialized countries like South Korea are continuing their strong growth. This creates more demand for base metals like copper, which is hovering near $1.278 a pound on the spot futures market of the New York Commodity Exchange, a four-year high. For a country like Zambia, whose economic fortunes are as tied to copper as Saudi Arabia's are to oil, the news is good indeed. While rising gold prices are pressing $400 an ounce, the new enthusiasm is for baser metals.
"It's a commodity bet if you invest in Africa, because 75 percent of Africa's exports are commodities, and if you took out South Africa, the figure would be much higher," said Peter W. Worthington, an economist with J.P. Morgan in London.
But investors are hardly leaving out South Africa, whose economy was built on gold, the most enduring of all commodities. The end of apartheid in a country with a market that is bigger than Spain's could not have come at a better time.
"As commodity prices have been moving higher, you've seen an outstanding performance not just in commodity stocks but also industrial stocks," said Mark Breeden, the portfolio manager for the Southern Africa Fund, a closed end fund managed by Alliance Capital Management.
"A more subtle issue is that commodity prices directly affect stocks, but because they're such important components of the economy they also fuel growth in other non-commodities sector businesses," said Andrew H. Cummins, a portfolio manager at Emerging Markets Investors Corporation.
To take advantage of what they see as the beginning of a sustained period of improving commodity prices, G.T. Global and Van Eck Funds are starting commodity-based funds that will invest in mining and commodity-related companies around the world. John van Eck believes commodity stocks will outperform industrial companies in the next stage of the business cycle.
But portfolio managers say a little finesse will be needed to find the bargains. Mr. Worthington said instead of investing in mining stocks in South Africa, which rise when metal prices go up, an investor might look at the government debt of neighboring countries like Zambia or Zimbabwe, where the big mining companies are state owned. "If you think that the government is going to derive revenues from that angle," he said, "you might want to consider investing in local government bonds."
The experts are as quick to offer warnings as to make recommendations. "The most volatile countries are often the ones that are most heavily weighted to commodities," said Joyce Chang, director of emerging markets research at Salomon Brothers.
Since commodities are paid for in hard currency, they can be built-in hedges against currency fluctuations. But this can also make them more expensive. South Africa's Trans-Natal Coal is well-known as a hedge for the rand currency, said Marianne L. Hay, the portfolio manager for the Morgan Stanley Africa Investment Fund. As the rand has fallen, Trans-Natal and other exporters for dollars have performed well.
Economists warn that the current rise in commodity prices is linked to higher demand caused in part by fast-growing newly industrialized countries, which have upended north-south trade routes that go back to colonial times. Once, the colonized sent raw materials to the colonizers and received finished goods in return. Now raw materials often move south-south from, say, Zambia to Pakistan.
These countries are sharing expertise. "You're going to see South African companies using their management expertise to go into countries close by," said Ms. Hay, whose closed-end fund started in February. "We are seeing a very positive situation in the southern part of Africa." She is particularly interested in opportunities in Botswana, Zambia, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
As more developing countries, especially those in Africa, embrace free-market economies, optimism grows for the prospects of economic growth, which makes investing there more attractive.
"For the first time in living memory, African countries are pursuing the kind of economic policies that we believe will lead to economic growth," Mr. Breeden said. "And an upturn in the commodity cycle will be a great benefit to all of them."

THIS is one tough book. David Frum, a former writer for The Wall Street Journal's famously fierce editorial page, is furious. He is not angry with, as might be expected, left-wing liberals and Whitewater conspirators, but with right-wing conservatives -- politicians and penseurs alike.
"Dead Right" is a look at what went wrong during the last 14 years of conservative politics as the message of economic conservatism was abandoned in favor of social conservatism. Simply put, Mr. Frum argues that the Republican right shifted away from its anti-big-government position because it was reluctant to keep pushing for a reduction in the growth of government and, as a consequence, to risk losing elections.
Unlike most conservatives, who feel that things were hunky-dory until the Bush Administration, Mr. Frum argues that things started going bad during the Reagan years. He attributes the problem to the failure of what he calls the Reagan gambit -- the promise that taxes could be cut, defense could be rebuilt and the budget balanced, all simultaneously. The gambit could have worked, he says, but the Administration allowed spending to zoom out of sight because it was unwilling to check the rise in social welfare spending. He is especially harsh on the Reagan Administration's decision to bump up Social Security payroll taxes -- a choice that eventually nullified Ronald Reagan's own income tax cuts. (As for the Bush Administration, Mr. Frum heaps scorn on its self-advertised legislative achievements, like the Clean Air Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act -- laws that will require, for compliance, enormous amounts of money.)
Mr. Frum offers suitably tart observations on many of the players on the right. In describing Jack Kemp, for instance, he says he found the man more of an "adept Jack Kemp imitator" than a real person. And he offers a bunch of great "gotchas," such as the difficulty faced by the right's intellectual -- and secular -- swami, Irving Kristol, when a guest at a conservative powwow asked him whether "intellectuals who lack religious faith can effectively advocate it for others."
But zingers aside, the book presents a powerful argument that the abandonment of economic conservatism is a big mistake: that is, one cannot change values without changing the economic structure to which those values are a response. "If the old American culture and the old American character were rational responses to the riskiness of life, you cannot alleviate that riskiness and expect the old culture and the old character to persist," he writes.
Consider that catchall category, family values. According to Mr. Frum, the old American attitude toward family -- caring for an aging parent, helping a cousin through a spate of unemployment, minding your sister's kids -- was based on the mutual glue of economic interests. That glue, he argues, loses its adhesive properties when government provides social welfare programs like Social Security, unemployment insurance and day care. Affection is now the only thing holding families together, and, Mr. Frum says, "affection is one of the most impermanent and weakest of human ties." Thus it is silly for conservatives to run around calling for programs to "support" the family when it is those very programs that undermine the economic self-interest that could reinforce family ties.
MR. FRUM is essentially correct in saying that when government policies reward failure and punish success they create perverse incentives. But when he launches into an analysis of the relationship between economic structures and social values, he does less well. For every instance of the sort Mr. Frum describes, in which economic changes have social consequences, one can point to another case in which changing social attitudes caused economic shifts, or to cases in which the two types of changes are almost inseparable -- as with the Protestant ethic and the rise of capitalism.
Moreover, Mr. Frum says the problem lies in the unpopularity of economic conservatism, but it isn't clear that economic conservatism is unpopular. True, polls show that voters want to have their cake and eat it too -- both to have less government and to keep the government programs that benefit them directly. But it is also true that the polls indicate most people don't expect middle-class programs like Social Security and Medicare to offer them the same level of benefits that obtain currently. This realistic mood allows considerable wiggle room for politicians who are fighting big government.
As for what should be done, Mr. Frum encourages the right to return to its message of minimalism -- less government spending, even at the risk of less electoral success. Although he is severe in his judgments and stern in his admonishments, perhaps he'll excuse me for calling his anger a form of tough love.

HEADLINE: Southold Weighs Curb On 'Light Pollution'

BYLINE: By ELLEN MITCHELL 

 BODY:
LIGHT pollution is not beneficial to the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the town and must be minimized," says a proposed law in the Town of Southold.
Even as citizens across Long Island demand more and brighter lighting along streets, in parking lots and down dark alleys, Southold is moving in the other direction. 
 "Keeping the sky from being lit at night is something we should try to achieve," said Supervisor Thomas H. Wickham.
Residents are lining up for and against plans to douse execessive lights and glare, as well as limit signs and make neon a glimmer of the past in many sections of Southold.
The debate is over how to safeguard idyllic areas in a rural town with working farms that date back generations, quaint yet bustling marinas and acres of lush vinyeards without stifling the economic health. "Basically, we want to see our little piece of old New England two hours from New York City preserved," said Councilwoman Ruth D. Oliva. head of the committee considering the proposals.
"If Southold Town becomes just another Brookhaven or Commack or Rocky Point we're in deep trouble," Mr. Wickham said.
In response to critics who say a crisis does not exist, Mr. Wickham said: "One has to only drive on the South Fork on a summer's day to understand the urgency. It's a disaster traffic-wise. We need to address that here and avoid it beforehand."
Fred Jens owns Jens Flower Shop and Greenhouse amid farms and fields on Sound Avenue. "I thought they wanted to preserve the quality of life here," Mr. Jens said. "I feel this reverses it. If I turn off my sign lights when I close, those tourists who travel best at night will miss my store. The more they see at night the better their ideas for shopping the next day."
Some shopkeepers are situated in designated business hamlets and would not be as seriously affected, but still voiced criticism.
"It's just government's becoming bigger and more intrusive," said Kenyon Tuthill, owner of Kenyon's Book Nook in Southold Village. "I'm a lifelong resident of the North Fork. We have to have business in the community to pay the bills and employ people. It seems there's a small cadre of people who would like to roll business back into the Stone Age here."
Mr. Jens and Mr. Tuthill agreed that there should be a few guidelines to help maintain the pastoral charm. "But they've gotten kind of heavy handed," said Mr. Tuthill. He added that 95 percent of the businesses would use good taste in signs and lighting if left to their own devices.
"If you were looking for a place to open a new business you'd probably run from Southold," said Mr. Tuthill.
The campaign to darken the lights and diminish the signs gathered steam a few years ago, when a previous administration invited eight planners from the United States and the United Kingdom to spend five days in Southold. The group left behind a book of recommendations.
The town formed the Town Task Force panel to evaluate the book and glean ideas, among them the proposals for lights and signs.
"But we don't drive horses and buggies here anymore," Mr. Jens said. "And I'm quite sure they don't in England, where that group came from, either."
The head of the Mattituck Chamber of Commerce, Audrey Watson, said she wanted to be on the town's own panel but was not included. No business people were appointed.
Mr. Wickham has recently gathered information form business owners, a move that Ms. Watson criticized as "pacification."
"I don't think Southold will ever be an industrial powerhouse," Mr. Wickham said. "I don't think we will ever attract big business in any significant sense. One of the most important assets this town has is its attractive, open quality; it generates tourism."
Mr. Wickham said he saw the economic future of the town based on the ability to attract tourists, its marine environment, its rural qualities, its arts potential and many "home occupations."
"They would love computer-based home businesses to come to Southold," Ms. Watson said. "How impractical. We don't even have computer-support services or sales out here."
Differences aside, Mrs. Oliva said, business people are becoming "more comfortable" with the proposed changes. "We've been working with this for months," she said. "There's been some grumbling, but not the opposition we first had."

HEADLINE: Isolated Immigrants Aim of D.W.I. Drive

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
FOR some in Long Island's growing Hispanic population, living isolated in a culture very different from their own can make alcohol seem an escape. And the authorities say that has shown up on the road, with accidents and arrests for drunken driving.
Although there are many programs intended to stop drunken driving, such programs often miss those who speak Spanish and have come from a different culture, leaving a growing need for special programs to help Hispanic residents deal with alcohol abuse. 
 To increase awareness about alcohol abuse and driving , a bilingual program, Si Toma, No Maneje, or If You Drink, Don't Drive, began last month on the Island. It is run by Project Long Island, part of the Century Council, a group trying to fight drunken driving and under-age drinking.
The program, which is in Spanish, developed by the California Office of Traffic Safety in 1989 has been expanded throughout California by the Century Council, of Los Angeles, in collaboration with state agencies and the Roman Catholic Church. About 800 companies in the alcoholic-beverage industry support the council.
A member of the Si Toma, No Maneje Advisory Council in Los Angeles, Estella Romero, said that in California, high numbers of arrests among Hispanic residents for driving under the influence of alcohol had "raised the red flag to the need for such a program."
Ms. Romero, who is with the advisory council in Los Angeles, said, "Where you have large concentrations of Hispanics, the percentages may vary slightly but the issue is there. There are language and cultural barriers that contribute to a serious problem. The vast majority of Spanish-speaking immigrants are here from countries where strict laws for driving under the influence don't exist.
"They simply don't know that they can lose their license, or will have to pay a fine or serve jail time. The only way to curb this problem is by raising their level of awareness."
She added that since the Si Toma, No Maneje program started in California five years ago, arrests among Hispanic people for driving under the influence of alcohol had dropped by 8 percent. "This didn't happen by accident," Ms. Romero said. "In other states, Hispanic leaders have seen that it works and they've contacted the Century Council to set up programs in their local areas."
In California, statistics for drunken driving arrests are kept by ethnicity, she said, unlike New York, where statistics are broken down by sex but not by ethnic backgrounds, and estimates can be made only by looking at the surnames of those arrested.
Arrests for driving while intoxicated, or D.W.I., are rising steadily on Long Island. Last year Nassau led the state with 5,657; through the end of August 1994, the pace is 7 percent ahead of last year, according to Roger Bogsted, the Nassau County Stop D.W.I. coordinator, who work in the County Executive's office.
The Suffolk Police District, covering the five western towns, had 3,971 arrests last year and 2,532 this year, to July 31. Officials are projecting 4,300 by the end of the year.
The eastern towns in Suffolk have separate police districts, each of which keeps its own records for D.W.I. arrests.
The State Department of Motor Vehicles records countywide statistics for convictions of driving while intoxicated (a blood alcohol level of 0.10 or more) and driving while ability impaired (a blood alcohol level of 0.05 to 0.10). In 1992, the most recent year for which statistics have been compiled, Nassau had 4,684 convictions and Suffolk, including all towns, had 5,493.
The statistics are not broken down by ethnic backgrounds, but in response to a reporter's request the coordinator's office issued an estimate by looking at the surnames of those arrested. Mr. Bogsted, estimated that Hispanic people account for 10 percent of drunken-driving arrests in Nassau. They making up 6 percent of the county's population, or 75,000, according to the census though some people say the number is far higher, totaling 250,000 in both counties.
In Suffolk, the Census said Hispanic people were 6.6 percent of the population, or 90,000. Project Long Island estimated that Hispanic people account for at least 13 percent of the drunken-driving arrests. But Sgt. Robert Reecks, the central D.W.I. processing supervisor for the five western towns in Suffolk County, estimated that Hispanic drivers account for 25 percent of D.W.I. arrests.
Project Long Island, which started in December, has sponsored programs on alcohol abuse, including Key to Life. In that effort 600 taverns and restaurants have volunteered to provide free nonalcoholic beverages to designated drivers.
Another program, Home Free, worked with 19 taxicab companies and gave 2,000 free rides in the Christmas holiday season.
Si Toma, No Maneje has formed groups in Omaha, Neb.; Eugene, Ore.; Champaign-Urbana, Ill.; Amarillo, Tex.; Portland, Me., and, most recently, on Long Island.
On Long Island the council has distributed posters, buttons and cash-register stickers to 500 sellers of alcoholic beverages in Brentwood and Hempstead. The materials are intended to help prevent under-age purchases and be reminders about drunken driving, said the executive director of Project Long Island, Paul Aniboli.
"Although Long Island doesn't have the same disproportionate number of Hispanic D.W.I. arrests as the other designated Century cities," Mr. Aniboli said, "there is a high rate of drunken driving among Hispanics, who are the fastest-growing segment of the Island's population. We can't ignore a population that represents a quarter of a million people in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. We must communicate our message in their language."
In the last decade the number of Hispanic people on the Island has grown by 60 percent, according to the 1990 Census. But some demographers say the number is closer to 250,000, because many are illegal aliens.
For a great many of these Hispanic residents, a major problem is culture shock, said Ray Lopez, the First Deputy Commissioner of Planning and Economic Development for the Town of Hempstead and former director of the Coordinating Agency for Spanish Americans in Hempstead.
"Many Hispanics on Long Island came alone to this country and left their families in Central America," Mr. Lopez said. "They thought America was the land of opportunity, but found that it wasn't the dream they thought it would be, and they're lonely. Many are not well educated and can't find jobs. So they get into the bottle because they think this will be the solution. They're not drinking to have fun, but to get drunk and escape.
"For those lucky enough to find jobs, a car is necessary. But they don't drive very well or know how to read and write. So a friend will give them three or four driving lessons, and then they might buy an illegal driver's license off the street. If they need a license, they'll get it however they can.
"The worst part is that many don't have insurance, and they're naive about the law. They don't know that if they drive after they've been drinking they'll no longer get just a ticket, that now they'll go to jail."
The founder of the Hispanic Brotherhood of Rockville Centre, Margarita Grasing, said the loneliness of many Central Americans on the Island was heightened by the language barrier.
"For many Hispanics, the life style here is inducive to abuse of alcohol," said Ms. Grasing, whose organization provides bilingual and bicultural services to the elderly, after-school tutoring for students and adult classes in English as a second language. "There is a definite substance-abuse problem in our community, and the only way to reach out to the people is in their own language, in their own places, where they buy their beer and alcohol."
Mr. Lopez said such efforts had to go beyond written materials and include workshops, because so many Hispanic people cannot read or write and do not understand the law.
Roger Bogsted, the Stop D.W.I. coordinator in the Nassau County Executive's office, said that even though drunken-driving arrests of Hispanic people in the county were not so high as elsewhere, education was critical.
"We're dealing with a different kind of cultural background," he said. "If people can relate in their own language, we can spread the word and deal with the problem preventively before it becomes a tragedy."

STALIN AND THE BOMB
The Soviet Union and Atomic Energy, 1939-1956.
By David Holloway.
Illustrated. 464 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $30. 
FOR decades now, a debate has been raging over who was more to blame for the cold war, Stalin's Russia or the United States. Since the Vietnam War especially, revisionist historians have argued that the United States monopoly of the atomic bomb -- and the unspoken threat to use it -- played a larger role than Americans have realized in the breakdown of the World War II alliance and the onset of the long, untidy quasi peace.
Into this debate, and on the eve of the 50th anniversary of Hiroshima and the Allied victory in World War II, has been dropped a new book, the long-awaited "Stalin and the Bomb," by David Holloway, a professor of political science and co-director of the Center for International Security and Arms Control at Stanford University. It is a superb history, recounting the Soviet nuclear weapons program until three years after Stalin's death, with an eye to the part played by the atomic bomb in the outbreak of the cold war.
Using speeches and interviews given by Stalin, V. M. Molotov, Maxim Litvinov and G. M. Malenkov, and documents that have become available in Russia over the past seven years, Mr. Holloway presents a hardheaded view of the way the early postwar universe looked to the men inside the Kremlin. He asks questions about missed opportunities that have bedeviled scholars in the West, weighs the evidence scrupulously and comes up with answers that will bring little comfort to many liberals -- and none at all to revisionist historians. And in a ground-breaking chapter about the hydrogen bomb, he uses interviews with Andrei Sakharov, Yuli Khariton and other former Soviet physicists to give a clearer picture of the way the Soviet H-bomb was built than anything we have yet been given about the construction of the hydrogen bomb in our own country.
Mostly, however, this is the story of Stalin's race to end the American atomic monopoly. Abetted by his chief of secret police, Lavrenti Beria, who doubled as head of the bomb project, Stalin made liberal use of espionage from abroad, and thereby hangs an extraordinary tale. Just as Mr. Holloway's book comes during a debate among Western historians, so, too, it appears at the height of a controversy in Moscow -- a controversy fueled by "Special Tasks," a book by Pavel Sudoplatov, the former security forces general -- over who deserves credit for the Soviet atomic bomb, Russia's scientists or its spies. Mr. Holloway surveys the work of Igor Kurchatov, the scientific director of the Soviet project, and his team of physicists, mathematicians and radiochemists, and concludes that whereas the Russians tested a version of the American plutonium bomb in 1949 with the help of espionage data from the West, without it they would have tested an atomic bomb of their own design about 1951.
The saving of those two years was no straightforward matter. Alerted by Soviet intelligence to the possibility that Hitler might be building an atomic bomb and that Britain and the United States might be doing the same, Stalin decided in 1942 to launch a small-scale atomic project. First he consulted his scientists, but he did not let them see espionage data from Britain that shed crucial light on whether a bomb could be built at all. Not until March 1943, after Russia's victory at Stalingrad, did Stalin allow Kurchatov to see the data. For several days Kurchatov pored over them in the office of Foreign Minister Molotov. "How are the materials?" Molotov finally asked. "Wonderful," Kurchatov answered, according to Mr. Holloway. "Just what we are lacking." He was then permitted to see the fruits of Soviet espionage, but not to show them to anyone.
Primed by secret reports from Klaus Fuchs and David Greenglass, spies who were working on the Manhattan Project -- but not, according to Mr. Holloway and contrary to Mr. Sudoplatov, from J. Robert Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi or other leaders of the Project -- Kurchatov had to suggest new research leads to his colleagues without so much as a hint that those leads had been stolen from abroad. (Later he was allowed, on occasion, to show foreign intelligence materials to other Soviet scientists, but only with special permission.) Kurchatov, not surprisingly, acquired a reputation for extraordinary intuition, and he managed to maintain his colleagues' trust despite the deception that had been forced upon him. But he was unhappy about the low priority accorded to his operation and the disparity in quality between the Soviet effort and that of the United States.
Stalin's paranoia cost the bomb project dearly. He had reliable espionage material from abroad and, at home, magnificent, utterly loyal nuclear physicists who had done breakthrough work even before the war -- and he did not trust either. He and Beria knew nothing about science. How could they be sure Kurchatov was not deceiving them? And the same was true of the intelligence reports. Perhaps the enemy was trying to draw them into expenditures that had no future. "If this is disinformation," Beria threatened a high-level agent who was giving him secret data, "I'll put you all in the cellar."
This misplaced suspicion had other costs as well. In 1941 Stalin had ignored warnings from his own intelligence, and from the intelligence services of Britain and France, that Hitler was about to attack Russia. Similarly, in 1945, he failed utterly to anticipate the role that nuclear weapons would soon play, despite warnings from Fuchs that the United States would test an atomic bomb in early July and would use it in Japan, if the test succeeded. After the bomb was dropped, Stalin was furious. The place Russia had earned as a world power by its victory in the war had been snatched away. "Hiroshima has shaken the whole world," he is said to have told Kurchatov. "The balance has been destroyed."
At this point one of those "what-if" questions arises. Was there, as the great Danish physicist Niels Bohr concluded in 1944 and as historians have wondered since, a chance to short-circuit the cold war by openly informing our Soviet ally about the bomb well before the end of World War II? Mr. Holloway thinks not. He cites abundant evidence that Stalin had decided on a tough postwar course long before Hiroshima or the atomic bomb entered his calculations. Even if Bohr's advice had been followed and if President Harry S. Truman and his Secretary of State, James F. Byrnes, had eschewed all thought of using the existence of the bomb as a diplomatic weapon, Stalin still would have wanted a bomb of his own. The only thing he disliked about the new weapon was that Truman, "that noisy shopkeeper," had it and he did not.
Stalin now gave the bomb project the priority he had denied it before. "If a child doesn't cry," he told Kurchatov in late summer 1945, urging haste, "the mother doesn't know what he needs. Ask for whatever you like. You won't be refused." Early in 1946 he summoned Kurchatov again. This time he rejected advice he had received from the famous Russian physicist Pyotr Kapitsa that the Soviet Union ought to follow its own, cheaper path to the bomb rather than copy the American design. Stalin said that "it was not worth engaging in small-scale work," Kurchatov wrote in his notes, "but necessary to conduct the work broadly, with Russian scope. . . . It was not necessary to seek cheaper paths."
Capable as the Soviet scientists were (and this also went for the aircraft and missile designers who were hard at work copying the American B-29 bomber and the German V-2 rocket), their ideas did not receive full support from Stalin until they had been validated in the West. And so Kurchatov and his top associate Khariton had to set aside their own design for a uranium bomb and embark on an all-out effort to reproduce the plutonium weapon the Americans had tested successfully at Alamogordo, N.M. The irony is that while all this was going on, Stalin was simultaneously engaged in an attempt to root out foreign influences in Soviet life, beginning with the arts and spreading to biology. In 1948 a campaign led by the fraudulent geneticist Trofim Lysenko destroyed Soviet biological research for decades to come. The next year, in March 1949, a conference was to take place in Moscow that would censure Soviet physicists for "kowtowing and groveling before the West." At the last minute the conference was called off and, in the Russia of those days, only one man could have done that.
According to a story related by Mr. Holloway, Beria had asked Kurchatov shortly before the conference whether it was true that quantum mechanics and relativity theory were idealist and antimaterialist. Kurchatov reportedly replied that if relativity theory and quantum mechanics had to be rejected by Russian science, the atomic bomb would have to be rejected, too. According to another story in the book, Stalin phrased his decision to cancel this way: "Leave them [the physicists] in peace. We can always shoot them later." He could afford a charlatan like Lysenko in biology, but physics was another matter. Stalin relied on his physicists for the bomb -- and for Soviet status as a superpower. When his first atomic bomb was tested in August 1949, five months after the aborted conference, those scientists who would have been shot in the event of failure received the highest awards: Hero of Socialist Labor and so on, down the line.
In spite of Beria's management by terror, his "issuing threats and exuding an air of menace" on visits to atomic plants, the scientists worked selflessly and with enthusiasm. Some viewed it as "a splendid task in physics," while others were anxious to prove the value of Soviet science; still others worked because they were appalled by American use of the bomb in Japan, were aware that cracks had appeared in the wartime alliance and, in what the author calls "in some psychological sense a continuation of the war with Germany," considered atomic weapons necessary for their country's defense. For these reasons there was, two scientists wrote afterward, "in the first, most romantic years of our work . . . a wonderful atmosphere of good will and support." Not only that, but the physics community managed to maintain much of its old autonomy and mutual loyalty even within the harsh system of administrative command. The Soviet atomic bomb was the result of miraculous synergistic fusion between scientists and engineers on the one hand, and the police state, with its awesome ability to mobilize resources, on the other.
Well before the atomic bomb test of 1949, Sakharov and others were secretly at work on the next megaweapon, the hydrogen bomb. Once again they worked with enthusiasm because, as Sakharov wrote, "we . . . believed that our work was absolutely necessary as a means of achieving a balance in the world." Their American counterparts, too, had been working on hydrogen-bomb designs and, after Russia acquired the atomic bomb, President Truman ordered them to build the hydrogen bomb as rapidly as they could. Truman, however, had his dissenters. In the fall of 1949 the Atomic Energy Commission's General Advisory Committee recommended against an all-out thermonuclear program for reasons that have been misunderstood to this day. One was that after seven years of research, American scientists still thought there was only slightly better than a 50-50 chance that the bomb could be built. Another was that the hydrogen weapon, as then conceived, could be made infinitely large and carry unlimited destructive power. The hydrogen bomb had nothing to do with wiping out military objectives or even whole cities. It could wipe out the human race.
At this point in his story, Mr. Holloway asks another of the "what-if" questions that have troubled Westerners. Suppose Truman had announced in 1949 that the United States would refrain from an all-out effort to build the hydrogen bomb. Could Stalin have been enticed, as Oppenheimer and others hoped, into agreement not to develop his own bomb? Once again Mr. Holloway responds with a hardheaded no, agreeing with Sakharov that Stalin would have regarded such an offer as the product of either deception or foolishness -- and a misstep to be exploited.
Stalin's death in 1953 did not at once alter the Soviet scientists' enthusiasm. The physicist Lev Landau, who said, "That's it. He's gone. I'm no longer afraid of him, and I won't work on [nuclear weapons] any more," was very much the exception. In the summer of 1953 they carried out test "Joe-4" (named after Stalin by the Americans) of a modified hydrogen weapon based on Sakharov's "layer cake" design, and in 1955 they tested a so-called "true" hydrogen bomb, based, as the 1952 and 1954 American devices were, on the concept of radiation implosion, and they did all of this without espionage help.
The enhanced confidence brought by their independent attainment of the hydrogen bomb gave some of the scientists, notably Sakharov, leeway for reflection. So, too, did the easing of repression of thought under Stalin's successors, and spreading knowledge of the extent of Stalin's crimes. And there was the sheer power of the hydrogen bomb itself. Kurchatov was badly shaken when he saw the damage. "One more test like those of 1953 and 1955," he said to Sakharov, "and I'm going to retire." He told another colleague, "That was such a terrible, monstrous sight! That weapon must not be allowed ever to be used!"
Kurchatov evidently briefed the new Soviet leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev, who later said: "When I was appointed First Secretary of the Central Committee and learned all the facts about nuclear power I couldn't sleep for several days. Then I became convinced that we could never possibly use these weapons, and when I realized that I was able to sleep again." At the 20th Communist Party Congress in 1956, Khrushchev broke with Stalin's theory that war was inevitable and announced a new theory of his own. "Either peaceful coexistence or the most destructive war in history," he declared. "There is no third way." In the Soviet Union as in the United States, the physicists' awe at their handiwork spread to the political leaders. When that happened, Mr. Holloway informs us, nuclear weapons, which had hastened breakdown of the wartime alliance and heightened tension in the early years, began to serve as a restraint.
"Stalin and the Bomb" is a prodigious book. Mr. Holloway has plowed through the new sources available in Russia, turning up fresh insights into the cold war and, even more, into the conditions of intellectual life in Stalin's Russia. This study is a work on the largest scale, one that advances our understanding and is likely to remain definitive for years to come.
 
 
 
RUSSIA'S MANHATTAN PROJECT
 An atomic industry had to be established before the bomb could be built. This was a formidable task for a country that had suffered so much in the war. But Stalin wanted the bomb as soon as possible, and was prepared to disregard the cost. The building of the atomic bomb was the kind of task for which the Stalinist command economy was ideally suited. It resembled the huge construction projects of the 1930's -- the steel city at Magnitogorsk, or Dneprostroi, the great dam on the Dnieper. It was a heroic undertaking for which the resources of the country could be mobilized, including the best scientists and industrial managers, as well as the slave laborers of the Gulag. The project was a curious combination of the best and the worst of Soviet society -- of enthusiastic scientists and engineers produced by the expansion of education under Soviet rule, and of prisoners who lived in the inhuman conditions of the labor camps.
No good figures are available for the cost of the project, or for the number of people involved. Some indication of the project's size, however, is given by a 1950 Central Intelligence Agency report, which estimated that between 330,000 and 460,000 people were employed in it. Most of these -- 255,000 to 361,000 -- worked in mining in the Soviet Union (80,000 to 120,000) and in Eastern Europe (175,000 to 241,000). . . . The C.I.A. estimated that about 10,000 technically qualified people -- engineers, geologists, research scientists and laboratory technicians -- worked in the project. Although these figures are estimates, they appear plausible, and certainly of the right order of magnitude. Many of these people, and in particular the miners and construction workers, were prisoners. From "Stalin and the Bomb."
 
 
 
IDEOLOGY MATTERED, BUT THE BOMB MATTERED MORE
 It was during the early 1970's that David Holloway first considered writing about the birth of the Soviet bomb program. "I'd been interested in the history of the Manhattan Project," he recalled in a telephone interview from his office in Palo Alto, Calif., where he is a political science professor at Stanford University. "It was a remarkable group of people building a bomb of great destructive power that raised all kinds of questions." He thought it would be worthwhile to investigate the Soviet program in the same way historians had examined the Manhattan Project.
Mr. Holloway, 51, whose first book, "The Soviet Union and the Arms Race," was published in 1983, began working in earnest on "Stalin and the Bomb" four or five years ago, during the collapse of Communism. His research benefited from archival material that began to emerge and from the growing willingness of the participants to speak openly. "There were all kinds of legends which turned out not to be true," he said.
Mr. Holloway was surprised at how late in the game Stalin became serious about the bomb. "The evidence is pretty strong," he observed, that while Stalin had started the bomb program during the war, it was only "after Hiroshima that it became a crash project." And, Mr. Holloway continued, he was struck by the fact that some of the K.G.B. people thought the American bomb project was "just disinformation, a kind of trap, the way that some people later portrayed Star Wars to be a kind of trap to lure them into spending money on something that wouldn't work."
Mr. Holloway is skeptical of several of the theories swirling around this period of history, like the view that the West might have prevented an arms race by sharing its bomb technology with Stalin: "A belief in the benefits of cooperation was really not something he displayed very much."
Stalin was even deeply suspicious of the loyalty of the scientists working on the bomb, yet he recognized the need to support their efforts. "On the one hand, the West was the model because it was more advanced, and its technology had to be copied," Mr. Holloway said. "On the other hand, the West was the enemy, and Western science and ideas were hostile and had to be kept out of the country. I think it was a contradiction he never managed to escape from. But essentially it was that contradiction that saved physics in the Soviet Union."
By the end, the author "was very taken with this whole community of scientists," which "somehow preserved some degree of intellectual freedom and autonomy even while locked up behind barbed wire in secret cities."
Mr. Holloway was able to spend time with some of the key figures in the Soviet project, including Andrei Sakharov and the physicist Yuli Khariton. He said he even traveled with Mr. Khariton "in his private railroad carriage, which he had been given after the first Soviet atomic bomb test. A whole car. I sat there on a summer evening talking, and I was kind of pinching myself, thinking 'this can't be true.' " SCOTT VEALE

HEADLINE: Indicting the Elite

BYLINE: By Laura Kalman; Laura Kalman, a professor of history at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is the author of "Legal Realism at Yale, 1927-1960," "Abe Fortas: A Biography" and the forthcoming book "The Strange Career of Legal Liberalism."

CONFRONTING AUTHORITY
Reflections of an Ardent Protester.
By Derrick Bell.
195 pp. Boston:
Beacon Press. $20. 
ALEXANDER BICKEL, perhaps the outstanding constitutional law professor of the postwar generation, never received an offer to teach at his alma mater, Harvard Law School. According to one story, probably apocryphal, the fact that he only served as treasurer of The Harvard Law Review may have constituted a strike against him. Yet Bickel, who likened his tenure at Yale to exile, passionately defended hiring the "smartest" law professors -- a group he identified by their academic standing, positions on law reviews and judicial clerkships. To him, as to others, such meritocratic criteria were quintessentially democratic. His mentor, Felix Frankfurter, said that "the great thing" about Harvard Law School was that "family fortune, skin, creed -- nothing particularly mattered, except scholarship and character objectively ascertained."
Derrick Bell's absorbing memoir, "Confronting Authority," which describes his years as a member of the Harvard Law School faculty, challenges Frankfurter's assumptions. On one level, Mr. Bell has written a book about the promise and perils of protest, which exhorts readers to commit acts of conscience. On another and more significant level, he has produced a harsh indictment of legal education. Unlike Frankfurter, who assumed that color and economic standing had no impact on educational opportunity, Mr. Bell demonstrates that race, class and sex often determine educational opportunity. Having done so, he questions whether the meritocratic standards by which law schools hire are silly or sound.
To outsiders, law school hiring standards may seem ridiculous. Graduation from an elite law school is just the beginning. One's chance to become a law professor depends on performance during the first year as a law student, when class standing generally determines membership on law review, which in turn determines judicial clerkship after graduation. Though Mr. Bell does not mention it, even Erwin Griswold conceded at the end of his tenure as dean of Harvard Law School in 1968 that the process of faculty selection constituted a "vicious circle." Professors who had done brilliantly in law school, served as president or editor in chief of the law review and clerked for Supreme Court Justices preferred to hire those with the same qualifications, he said. "Our faculties tend to reproduce themselves; and in the process may by the continual inbreeding that is involved be producing even narrower students than they were themselves."
Enter Mr. Bell, determined to break the cycle and make the case that law school grades bear "little correlation to effective teaching or significant scholarship." A productive and provocative scholar, in the late 1970's he helped invent a new field of legal scholarship, critical race theory, whose practitioners, often through storytelling, examine the interrelationship of law and race. But a career as an academic almost eluded him. Though he had served on the law review of the University of Pittsburgh Law School and become a noted civil rights lawyer after graduation, Mr. Bell originally had no success in his attempts to become a law professor. During the push for affirmative action in 1969, however, Harvard Law School decided to hire its first African-American as "a mentor and model for the black students." Mr. Bell was offered the job. After trying "to make it clear that I did not wish to be a token black and expected that the school would actively seek and hire other minority lawyers for the faculty," he accepted. Tenure and a chaired professorship followed, but at the time only two other scholars of color, both black men, were hired.
DISILLUSIONED, Mr. Bell accepted the deanship at the University of Oregon in 1980. There he learned to his dismay that "elitist hiring criteria are not unique to nationally recognized schools like Harvard." His new colleagues also considered high grades from prestigious law schools all-important. When they refused to hire an Asian-American woman with a law degree from the University of Texas Law School, he returned to Harvard.
In Cambridge, Mr. Bell renewed his efforts to diversify the faculty. By this time, as another law professor recalled later, Harvard was carrying "its intellectual glass slipper across the nation looking for a 'qualified' woman of color to join the faculty." Likely candidates were invited to visit for a year to see whether the shoe fit, a system derided by one professor as "rotating diversity."
Deciding he could not serve as a role model for women of color, Mr. Bell announced in 1990 that he would take an unpaid leave of absence from Harvard until at least one such person was hired on a permanent basis. In doing so, he says, he hoped to pressure his colleagues to hire Regina Austin, a black critical race theorist, who was tenured at the University of Pennsylvania and visiting that year at Harvard. By Mr. Bell's report, the appointments committee concluded that she had "unimpressive credentials" and produced "unscholarly work." Nor, the following year, would his colleagues hire Anita Allen, a tenured black woman at Georgetown, who had received her law degree from Harvard and possessed a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Michigan.
Relying on a rule that limited faculty leaves to two consecutive years, Harvard now told Mr. Bell to return to teaching or lose his tenure. When he refused to come back, he was fired. "My protest cost me a tenured position on what many consider the nation's most prestigious law faculty," he writes.
AS Mr. Bell recognizes, readers may feel he portrays events "in sharply defined terms of right and wrong." Likewise, he acknowledges that even those who agree with his goals may disagree with his tactics. His protest backfired: Harvard Law School still has not hired a woman of color.
There are other problems. A touch of self-indulgence mars this memoir. Some may feel that Mr. Bell too often takes his marbles and goes home when he is dissatisfied, instead of remaining to fight within the system another day. Moreover, sometimes Mr. Bell complains that law students do not have enough of a voice in hiring faculty, but at others he laments that student evaluations of visitors' teaching, especially in the cases of professors of color, count too much. He cannot have it both ways. And Mr. Bell ignores the changing context of legal education. When he points to the indisputable fact that many who do not meet Harvard's "cherished criteria" have published more -- and more interesting work -- than many who possess the traditional credentials, he neglects the fact that until recently, tenure in the law schools had little to do with quantity of publications. Finally, he acknowledges that he alienated Ms. Austin when he determined to take his protest leave without consulting her, a decision that will strike many as selfish and hopelessly paternalistic.
Still, I found Mr. Bell's conclusion convincing: "Especially today, when the greedy self-interest of many practicing attorneys has plunged the profession to new depths of ill repute, training lawyers to assume a role of supposedly public trust calls upon us to emphasize skills and experiences the law school ignores in its hiring process."

HEADLINE: What Would F.D.R. and Einstein Do in Smoke-Free New York?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Sept. 26 front-page report that Philip Morris will consider leaving New York City if the City Council bans smoking from nearly all public places was framed in terms of health versus business. You left little doubt that you were in this instance pro-health and against business. 
 As someone who has written a book, "No Butts About It," on how to stop smoking, I remain ambivalent about the many attempts to ban smoking. The usual argument, mentioned by City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, a former smoker, is that residual smoke can kill nonsmokers.
I take a backseat to no one in having a low opinion of smoking as a way of passing time, even though two to three packs kept me company for 40 years. Why? Well, I read a report the other day that the Japanese have a longer per capita life span than we do. I defy anyone to find a nationality that smokes half as much as the Japanese. And, of course, there is all that soy sauce! Ah, and then there are the French with their Gitanes, which curl one's toes as the smoke is inhaled.
This is all encouragement to go slow in banning smoking. Think about it: would Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani want to ban Albert Einstein, Edward R. Murrow, Leonard Bernstein, Franklin Roosevelt and E. B. White, to name a few, from smoke-free Gracie Mansion? The average life span of those personalities was rather respectable, by the way. There is much more to this than meets the eye.

HEADLINE: NO REST ON TRADE: WASHINGTON'S VIEW;
Kantor Vows Pressure On Japan Will Continue

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
America's top trade negotiator said today that he planned to initiate talks with Tokyo in the coming months about opening its restricted markets in computers, wood, paper and financial services, now that the two nations have agreed that Japan will open its markets in glass, insurance, medical equipment and telecommunications.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said in an interview that he understood the Japanese Government would need some time to digest the agreements announced on Saturday, which came after 15 difficult months of negotiations. 
 Mr. Kantor said the United States wanted to give Tokyo a few months to put those agreements into effect and to sell them at home to the business community and the Government bureaucracy. Nonetheless, he said, the Administration planned to keep up the pressure to open other relatively closed sectors.
"I am talking about opening up Japan's highly regulated financial markets and financial services industry," Mr. Kantor said. "We also have to continue to work to open Japan's markets for computers, wood products and paper. We will follow the same negotiating pattern as these last agreements."
But Mr. Kantor emphasized: "We understand that the Japanese Government may have to react rhetorically to what has happened here over the weekend, and they are not going to want to sit down in the next two weeks and start a new round of negotiations. They have their own domestic politics and we understand that, but in the next three or four months we intend to begin a dialogue on these other problem areas."
Indeed, an editorial in the mass circulation Japanese daily Mainichi Shimbun said today, "A U.S.-Japan breakdown has been avoided, but the seeds of friction are not lacking."
Nevertheless, Mr. Kantor said he believed that in the aftermath of the Japanese Government's agreement over the weekend to open its markets in insurance, telecommunications, glass and medical equipment to more imports, "you might see the Japanese doing a lot more in other areas on their own -- especially if they see these openings lowering prices for their consumers, raising living standards and lessening the level of tension between Japan and other countries."
Because the two sides failed to reach an agreement Saturday to open further Japan's huge market in automobiles and auto parts, President Clinton decided to intitiate sanctions proceedings against Tokyo. The United States will start an investigation into Japan's market for replacement car parts under section 301 of the Trade Act. The inquiry could lead to punitive tariffs on selected Japanese automotive exports to the United States in 12 to 18 months if future negotations prove fruitless.
But there was some indication from Tokyo today that Japan may be ready to move in the car sector before sanctions become necessary.
"In fact, Japan's automotive imports are increasing," the Chief Cabinet Secretary, Kozo Igarashi, said on a television talk show. "We cannot ignore the question of safety, but we can do a lot in the area of deregulation, so I think we will definitely be able to obtain American understanding."
Mr. Kantor said he thought there was another secondary benefit of Saturday's trade agreements with Japan: the psychological signal they send to American business.
"American business has been so discouraged about getting into Japan that they won't even try to break into some of the markets over there," Mr. Kantor said. "I think these agreements will give business leaders more confidence that we will stand behind them and work with them and that the Japanese Government will even work with them."
Mr. Kantor contended that the combination of the agreements reached on Saturday and the President's decision to initiate sanctions proceedings should create a political atmosphere that would make it much easier for Congress to approve the global trade agreement now awaiting a vote.
That accord, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, lowers import tariffs in 123 countries by an average of 30 percent. While solid majorities in the Senate and House appear to favor the agreement, vocal minorities have been fighting a rear-guard action to scuttle it. The critics contend that it will permit too many low-wage manufacturing jobs to move abroad.
"We made this framework agreement with Japan work, finally, because the President hung in there," Mr. Kantor said. "But also, in the one area where we could not reach agreement -- autos -- we put a shot across their bow.
"Sure, there will be some around who criticize us, but they will respect us. I think all of this is good for GATT, because it sends a signal to the Congress and the American people that while we pursue this agenda of expanding trade around the world, we are going to stand up for American interests and not be pushed around."
He said there was no way to maintain a political consensus in the United States for free trade with Mexico and Canada, or for lower tariff barriers around the world, if the public perceives that other big economies are not playing by the rules -- or if the public believes the President can be outmaneuvered in negotiations.
"We have suffered for decades because the American people have not been convinced that Washington will stand up for their interests, especially in trade," Mr. Kantor said. "And, fairly or unfairly, Japan has become the test case for that view."
He added, "It is critical that we develop the trust of the American people that what we are doing in pushing for freer trade and more open markets is in their economic interests."

HEADLINE: City of Angels Makes Peace in Water Wars

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LEE VINING, Calif., Oct. 1

 BODY:
Clusters of pale, delicate limestone spires, stranded in the sagebrush that surrounds a shrinking, million-year-old lake, help tell the story of decades of water wars in which California's thirsty south has sucked dry some of the lakes and rivers of the north.
These brittle fingers, aquatic stalagmites as tall as a man or taller, have been left exposed as the briny lake in which they grew, Mono Lake, has contracted to half its volume and dropped about 45 feet. Since 1941, the waters of four creeks that fed the lake have been diverted, through tunnels and aqueducts, to Los Angeles, 340 miles to the south. 
 Last Wednesday, in a hard-fought accord that is part of a fundamental shift in the state's water politics, Los Angeles agreed to stop depleting the lake until its level rises 16 feet, and to help restore its ecological balance. Over the next 20 years or so, the lake is expected to swell to a target of 6,391 feet above sea level, high enough for most of the spires, called tufa, to return to the waters that spawned them.
Ending 16 years of litigation during which it lost one battle after another, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said it would no longer fight a 1989 court decision that had already halted the diversion with a temporary injunction. And the State Water Resources Control Board accepted an agreement worked out between the city and the environmentalists who were its longtime adversaries.
"We will live with it," said Mitchell Kodama, assistant engineer in charge of the city department's aqueduct division.
The environmentalists who had fought the department over the lake's waters now competed for superlatives to describe the moment. "We have changed the world," said Dan Taylor, regional representative for the National Audubon Society.
Daniel P. Beard, commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Reclamation, said: "All parties have come to the realization that many serious environmental mistakes were made when we constructed the water projects upon which our urban and agricultural sectors now depend. Not surprisingly, some have been reluctant to confront these mistakes. We almost lost Mono Lake because of that reluctance."
Without its tributaries, the lake dropped by nearly a foot a year to 6,375 feet above sea level. The restoration will still be well below the lake's 1941 level, but it will halt the ecological collapse of the lake, reduce its thickening salinity and make it hospitable again for hundreds of thousands of nesting and migrating birds.
Once the target is met, Los Angeles will be allowed to siphon a limited amount of the melting snow that flows into the lake from the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada. But never again will it be able to rely on Mono Lake as it did in the past.
Since Los Angeles stopped drawing on the lake in 1989, it has begun major water conservation and reclamation projects and has bought expensive water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a wholesaler that taps the San Joaquin Valley and the Colorado River.
Until the flow was halted, Los Angeles diverted about 90,000 acre-feet of water from the lake each year. An acre-foot is about 330,000 gallons, enough water for an average family of four for a year.
The city's new water projects will rely largely on new state and Federal funding, including $36 million in a bill signed last week by Gov. Pete Wilson. When they are completed some time in the next century, Mr. Beard said, the projects should allow Los Angeles to cut its total water imports by 235,000 acre-feet a year.
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, a longtime Los Angeles ally of the environmentalists in the water wars, said the city's capitulation was a sign of changing times, in which a voracious economy is finally giving way to concern for the environment.
"It's partly facing the inevitable, partly common sense and partly that the environmental movement is really universal," she said, "even in darkest Los Angeles."
Ilene Mandelbaum, associate director of the Mono Lake Committee, which led the battle to save the lake, said: "This is the climax of one of the most significant environmental battles in the West in this century. It marks a shift in emphasis now from water-supply development and resource exploitation to water reclamation, conservation and better management of existing resources."
Recently, Los Angeles has begun a retreat in three-quarters of a century of struggles over water. In 1991, the city agreed to restore water flow to a 19-mile stretch of the Owens River 120 miles south of Mono Lake. Roman Polanski's movie "Chinatown" told how Los Angeles developers secretly bought most of the Owens Valley in the early years of the century, then diverted its water, and left the river virtually dry.
At the Department of Water and Power this week, Mr. Kodama said the long battle over Mono Lake had been fought because arid Los Angeles had based its development and economy on longstanding assurances of a continuing water supply.
"When we have relied on a resource for as long as we did, 50 years, we weren't going to just give it up because someone thought we should put more water in the lake," he said. But now, he said, the city must find a way to live with "the issues of recreation, visual esthetics, air quality and other factors."
A little over a century ago, Mark Twain visited Mono Lake, and its harshness made him uneasy. In "Roughing It," his account of his travels in the American West, he called the lake a "solemn, silent, sailless sea, . . . lonely tenant of the loneliest spot on earth."
Today, the loneliness is broken by tourists from Germany, Taiwan and Los Angeles. But even their multilingual presence cannot dispel the desolation of the scene.
Surrounded by barren volcanic hillsides, the flat, sullen surface of the lake is fringed by outcroppings of tufa, some of them thousands of years old, their pale, crusted skin changing hue with the weather and the mountain sunlight, from hints of lavender to ochre to pearl grey.
Rare mineral flowerings, they erupt from the lake floor when calcium in the fresh water from the mountainsides mingles with the carbon in the waters of the lake.
"You could call them fossilized springs," Ms. Mandelbaum said . "If you look into the water, you can almost see them growing."

UPSTATE MALAISE HURTS CUOMO'S CHANCES
There's a sour mood abroad in the land, a mood evident in Cattaraugus County. As some see it, times are hard in that corner of western New York, with recession lingering and people hungry for hope. Their favorite target is Governor Cuomo, and the race for his job has become their emotional vent. The depth of Cattaraugus's dissatisfaction is striking: It hints at how enthusiastic his supporters will have to be in New York City and its suburbs to counteract the anti-Cuomo sentiment he is facing in the state's vast rural reaches. A1. 

NEW YORK CITY
 
MANDELA RETURNS TO NEW YORK
On his first visit to the United States as President of a reborn South Africa, Nelson Mandela took a sentimental side trip to a Harlem church to be with people he feels were with him spiritually during the long struggle against apartheid. Asked afterward what he had told the worshipers inside the Canaan Baptist Church, the 76-year-old leader said, "I told them that I was happy to be with them and that I had a feeling of identity with them." Mr. Mandela also visited Mayor Giuliani at Gracie Mansion and met with Governor Cuomo. B3.
 
LATEST COLLECTING FAD? TELEPHONE CARDS
Prepaid telephone calling cards were conceived as a convenience. Callers would buy one for, say, $10, and then have $10 worth of phone time without having to use coins. But in recent months, collecting them has become a fad, not least because of the vivid pictures with which the cards have come to be decorated: images of sports heroes and superheroes, bouquets of daisies, O. J. Simpson's dour mug shot, the likeness of the late Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem M. Schneerson, and personally signed copies of Peter Max paintings. B3.
 
STIMULATING QUESTIONS FROM GIULIANI
With his endorsement held out as the elusive prize, Mayor Giuliani has done his utmost in recent weeks to turn the governor's race into a local referendum on whether Mario Cuomo or George Pataki will do more for his city. Each day, the Mayor poses a new question. Where do the candidates stand on a state takeover of local Medicaid costs? Who agrees that New York City "does not receive its fair share from Albany" for building new schools? And it is lost on no one in state politics that in this quiz, as Philip Friedman, a Democratic political consultant puts it, "only Cuomo has the answers in advance." For in fact, Mr. Giuliani's questions are usually veiled prods to Mr. Pataki to commit himself before the election to providing some sort of assistance to New York City. B4.
 
TRANSIT POLICE OFFICER COMMITS SUICIDE
Yesterday afternoon, Officer Robert Smath of the transit police was in full dress uniform, marching with his fellow officers in the Pulaski Day Parade up Fifth Avenue. A few hours later, he was dead, apparently by his own hand. Civilian employees found Officer Smath, 25, lying on the floor of an employee bathroom in the subway station at 145th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem, said Chief Michael O'Connor of the transit police. B8.
 
REGION
 
NEW YORK TAXES AND SELF-IMAGE
With just over a month to the New York gubernatorial election, it would help to get one thing clear: the tax cut debate between Governor Cuomo and Senator Pataki is not, at its core, about cutting taxes. It is about the state's definition of itself. Because unless New York is prepared to change dramatically what it is and long has been, it will never have low taxes. Lower? Yes. But low? Not likely. Put simply, New York has vast obligations and historically high standards. It spends more than most other states, and not just on the poor. New Yorkers have always had expensive tastes. Even Republican New Yorkers. Metro Matters, B6.
 
CUOMO AND PATAKI'S LOTTERY BATTLE
Squabbling over state lottery funds like two lotto winners with the same ticket, the leading candidates for governor escalated their battle over the budget yesterday, with Governor Cuomo accusing his Republican opponent, State Senator Pataki, of planning to "rip off" the lottery. The Governor's comments were in response to a new television ad by Mr. Pataki in which the Republican announced an unspecified plan to "reduce local property taxes by using state lottery funds."

HEADLINE: Mandela Begins U.S. Visit With a Side Trip to Harlem

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
On his first visit to the United States as President of a reborn South Africa, Nelson Mandela took a sentimental side trip to a Harlem church yesterday morning to be with people he feels were with him spiritually during the long struggle against apartheid.
Gone were the thickets of ticker tape and the throngs that jubilantly lined parade routes during Mr. Mandela's first visit to the United States four years ago, shortly after his release after 27 years in prison. 
 Still, people leaned on their windowsills and sat on fire escapes along West 116th Street near Lenox Avenue, hoping to catch a glimpse of the 76-year-old leader as he entered the Canaan Baptist Church, with its 20-foot-high cross of steel girders on the roof. And several hundred others stood behind police barricades.
When President Mandela emerged after the service ended, shouts of "Mandela! Mandela!" echoed along the block, mixed with high-pitched cries of salutation. A beaming Mr. Mandela strode toward the crowd, with the Rev. Jesse Jackson at his side, and said only a few words before climbing into his limousine. Asked what he had told the worshipers inside, Mr. Mandela said, "I told them that I was happy to be with them and that I had a feeling of identity with them." Nodding to the crowd, he added, "And I have a feeling of identity with you here."
Donald Heyliger, 39, a wire clerk for a Wall Street brokerage house, already felt connected to Mr. Mandela. Holding his daughter, Faith, 5, in his arms, he said: "I remember seeing Mandela when he came to Wall Street, down by my job, after he was released. I got to have eye contact. It appeared that we actually had a connection for a moment.
"Just the energy he gave off seemed very powerful and peaceful for a man who had been incarcerated for so many years; to come out with so much love in his heart."
Faith did not comprehend why her father wanted her there. "Maybe she can see his face and I can point him out and say, 'That's Nelson Mandela,' " Mr. Heyliger said.
Minutes earlier, David N. Dinkins, the former Mayor, and Representative Charles B. Rangel had left the church. Mr. Rangel said of Mr. Mandela's remarks inside: "He said there's no home like South Africa, but whenever he's here with us, he always feels that he is at home."
When someone of President Mandela's international stature comes to the United States, Mr. Rangel said, "and his very first stop is in your community, it's a great sense of pride that he would do this."
He continued: "It means a lot to us. But, like he said, he will never forget those who were with him when no one else was."
Mr. Mandela arrived in New York on Saturday for the start of a weeklong visit to the United States. Mr. Dinkins, who was Mr. Mandela's host during his first tumultuous visit, spoke about the visitor's more official business on this trip. Mr. Mandela, Mr. Dinkins said, "continues to believe that the needs of South Africa right now are jobs and housing, and he believes they are wrapped up in one. The production of housing will produce the jobs."
Last evening Mr. Mandela was the guest of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and addressed 500 guests on the Gracie Mansion back lawn. Citing problems in health care, schools, housing and jobs faced by millions in South Africa, Mr. Mandela said, "By investing in our country, you will be putting sunshine in their hearts."
Later, President Mandela appeared with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo at a news conference, where they announced the opening of an office in Johannesburg to promote trade and business between the State of New York, including private-sector companies, and South Africa.
The office is to open on Nov. 1 and be operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the New York State Department of Economic Development.
At 11 A.M. today, after being greeted by the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Mr. Mandela is to address the General Assembly. In the evening, he is to speak before the National Foreign Trade Council at the Waldorf-Astoria. Tomorrow, he is to fly to Washington for a four-day visit.
Standing outside the Canaan Baptist Church yesterday morning, Thelma Felton, 67, felt that in her own way she had already met the South African leader. "To go through what he had gone through and end up who he is -- a real man -- I really admire him very much," Mrs. Felton said.
Her moment with him, she said, came via television. "I stayed up all night when he was coming out of jail," she recalled. "You would have thought I was his sister the way I carried on."

HEADLINE: NO REST ON TRADE: THE VIEW IN TOKYO;
Japanese Skepticism On Trade

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Oct. 3

 BODY:
The trade agreements reached on Saturday by American and Japanese negotiators were heralded in Washington as a significant breakthrough in opening Japan's markets for insurance, telecommunications, medical equipment and glass. But the view here was that the end results scarcely justified the 15 months of bitterness, name-calling and mistrust required to achieve them.
Japan's financial markets also reacted to the trade settlements calmly. The dollar rose to 99.25 yen in morning trading in Tokyo, up from its Friday close of 98.59 yen. One currency trader said the market was expecting an agreement and had already discounted the weekend's news. 
 Japanese stock prices also moved higher. The Nikkei index of 225 leading issues gained 105 points in the first 15 minutes of trading but then fell back. At midday, the index was up 50.21 points, or 0.26 percent, at 19,614.02.
Newspaper editorials here this morning generally welcomed the agreements but suggested that it was time for Washington and Tokyo to focus on broader aspects of their relationship rather than on specific trade disputes. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's largest business newspaper, called the talks a failure of government, negotiated by "American lawyers who do not know economics" and "Japan's stone-headed bureaucrats."
Newspapers here also described the agreement as "tama-mushi-iro," a reference to an insect whose color changes, depending on the angle from which it is viewed. That means there are vague terms that could be interpreted in different ways by each side, leading to disputes in the future.
"Already the understanding on both sides is different," the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
Japanese officials said Sunday that they had successfully resisted what at one time had been a key demand of American negotiators: the setting of numerical targets for sales in Japan of foreign goods and services. Foreign Minister Yohei Kono, at a news conference Sunday, said, "I think we stuck to our principles."
To be sure, Washington never clearly stated in the early days of the talks what it was aiming at. It said it did not seek single market-share targets, like the 20 percent goal established in a semiconductor agreement signed in 1991.
American negotiators did, however, talk at times about targets that were more vague -- like having the market share of foreign products in Japan match the level in other industrial nations. At one point, American negotiators called for Japanese purchases of American auto parts for use in new cars to continue rising 20 percent a year, as in the past.
Those positions have largely been eliminated, and indeed no deal at all was reached in the sector of autos and auto parts, which alone accounts for two-thirds of Japan's $60 billion surplus in trade with the United States.
"We have not just been talking, we've been listening," Walter F. Mondale, the United States Ambassador to Japan, said last week. "In the process, some of the earlier positions that we tabled have come off the table."
To understand the concept of tama-mushi-iro, consider the agreement's provisions that try to set yardsticks for measuring the sales of imported goods.
The agreement covering Japanese Government purchases of medical and telecommunications equipment, for example, calls for an "annual evaluation of progress in the value and share" of procurement of foreign products "to achieve, over the medium term, a significant increase in access and sales."
Japan did not mind measuring the sales and market share of foreign products but did not want to make any supposition about how the numbers should move. And up until the last minute, Japanese bureaucrats were resisting the use of the term "significant increase," viewing it as tantamount to a numerical target. Japanese officials even consulted several American trade lawyers, who advised that the term could be interpreted as an increase of 15 to 20 percent a year.
But Sunday, one Japanese official said the significant increase was a goal -- not a commitment Japan could be held accountable for.
Still, the incorporation of this language represented a victory for the United States and contributed to the relatively positive assessments the agreements received from American business leaders.
"Over all, the industry is happier this week than they were last week," said William R. Farrell, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. A week ago, many people, particularly in the electronics industry, were worried that the negotiations would produce nothing of value to them.
Still, a "significant increase" is a fuzzier goal than the United States had originally sought, and an agreement on that language makes clear that during the negotiations the Administration softened what it was willing to settle for in specifying results achieved in a negotiated deal.
And the agreement on the insurance market places more emphasis on deregulation than on insuring increases in foreign sales.
In their comments today, Japanese Government and industry leaders generally welcomed the trade agreements.
"We needed a compromise at any cost," said Takeshi Kondo, general manager of the office of political and economic research at the Itochu Corporation, a large trading company. "The bilateral relationship cannot afford prolonged disputes like this on tiny issues."
Another breakdown in talks would surely have led to a renewed rise of the yen against the dollar, further tightening the vise that has been squeezing the competitiveness and profits of Japan's leading manufacturers.
Officials in Tokyo, however, called it "regrettable" that the United States had chosen to initiate sanction proceedings because of the auto sector disagreement.
But Japan stopped short of carrying through on its threat to file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the international body that oversees world trade.
Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Minister of International Trade and Industry, said at a news conference today that since the United States had not yet actually imposed sanctions, Japan would not take any action.
Mr. Hashimoto called for a cooling-off period of unspecified length before resuming negotiations on automobiles and auto parts. He also said Washington's demand to ease the rules on replacement parts for automobiles would compromise safety, asserting that in Japan far fewer auto accidents were caused by breakdowns than in the United States.
The agreements announced Saturday in Washington were the end result of an agreement signed 15 months ago, known as the economic framework agreement, which was supposed to provide a more reasoned and effective way for the United States and Japan to resolve trade disputes.
"The nature of the way in which we've carried out negotiations for the last 12 years, which is that we whine and they won't move, has been one of the more unproductive bilateral relationships," W. Bowman Cutter, an economic adviser to President Clinton, said the day the framework accord was signed in July 1993.
Yet the recent negotiations had as much whining and resistance as talks in the past, if not more. And it was the threat of sanctions that induced Japan to make last-minute concessions, just as the dangling sword brought about agreements in the past on cellular telephones, public works bidding and numerous other areas.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Chinese Utility Is Facing A Big Test on Wall Street

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
China wants to finance the expansion of its cash-starved electric power industry by selling part of the business directly to foreign investors. Whether that strategy will succeed may depend a lot on what happens this week when American depository receipts for shares in Huaneng Power International Inc. begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Huaneng Power is only the second Chinese utility to be listed overseas -- and its biggest obstacle is its predecessor, which has the similar name of the Shandong Huaneng Power Development Company (Hua neng means China power). 
 Since it began trading in August, Shandong Huaneng has fallen almost 11 percent from its $14.25 offering price, closing on Friday at $12.75 for each of its A.D.R.'s. Much of the decline has occurred in recent weeks, as executives from Huaneng Power and Lehman Brothers, the new issue's chief underwriter, have been criss-crossing the country courting investors.
Analysts and fund managers surmise that either Huaneng Power is so much better than Shandong Huaneng that investors are bailing out of the earlier issue to sign up for the new one, or that investors in Shandong Huaneng see a second disaster looming and are cutting their losses.
Comparing the two companies, one is tempted to conclude the former rather than the latter.
Lehman is offering 31.25 million A.D.R.'s, one of the largest Chinese stock issues ever. Half the receipts are designated for sale in the United States and Canada, while a quarter will be offered to Asian investors and the rest to other investors outside China. Lehman Brothers declined to respond to questions about the issue, but fund managers say the expected offering price ranges from $22.50 to $27.50 for each A.D.R., which would raise $703 million to $859 million.
Huaneng Power owns and operates five coal-fired power stations with an output of 2,900 megawatts in one of the fastest-growing markets for electric power. Last year, China's Ministry of Electric Power estimated that the country needed to add 120,000 megawatts of generating capacity by 2000 simply to keep pace with demand.
Huaneng Power already has plans to develop or acquire eight additional plants that will increase its generating capacity to 7,500 megawatts by the turn of the century.
The company owns and manages plants in five Chinese provinces, whereas Shandong Huaneng is really a holding company for assets owned by the Provincial Power Authority in Shandong Province in northeast China. Indeed, the biggest criticism of Shandong Huaneng was that it was created from state assets for the purpose of being listed in New York. The offering's prospectus, prepared by its lead manager CS First Boston, had only one year of pro forma financial records: estimates of how the company would have fared had it been in existence.
Huaneng Power, on the other hand, is a subsidiary of a Chinese state company that was formed in 1985 to construct and operate power stations at a profit using imported power-generating equipment. Its preliminary prospectus supplies three years of actual financial statistics.
"This is a real prospectus," said Sheldon Kasowitz, regional utilities analyst and a director at Jardine Fleming Asia Research in Hong Kong.
Mr. Kasowitz and others also laud Huaneng Power's management. Li Xiaopeng, the 35-year-old vice president, is the son of China's Prime Minister, Li Peng. Such "iron connections" are highly prized in China, though they can become a liability if the political winds shift.
Those who have met the younger Mr. Li say that he brings more to the deal than his name. "He could be a senior executive at any utility in the world, regardless of his family connections," said David Kiefer, co-manager of Prudential's $4 billion utility fund.
But like Shandong Huaneng, Huaneng Power has at least two serious drawbacks: currency risk and an uncertain regulatory environment.
Because the company is selling electricity to provincial power authorities, all its earnings are in local currency. Lehman is trying to hedge the currency risk by factoring a 7 percent devaluation into its financial projections for the company. But with inflation in China still raging and a murky economic and political picture ahead, 7 percent could end up being much too low. Earlier this year, for example, the Government devalued its currency, the yuan, by 33 percent overnight.
Chinese authorities have promised to allow Huaneng Power to raise prices based on a percentage of the amount the company invests in new plants. Investors are guaranteed a 15 percent return on equity and a minimum 7 percent return on debt, depending on prevailing interest rates.
That is similar to deals governing utilities in Hong Kong and elsewhere, but it is new to China. "If the regulatory body believes that the company is making too much money, they can play with the assumptions," Mr. Kiefer said.
Weighing the risks against Huaneng Power's strong growth prospects, Lehman and the Chinese seem to have priced the issue at the upper limit, 17 to 21 times the company's estimated 1995 earnings. "I think they've been a little greedier than they should have been," said Robert Howe, manager of the $2.3 billion New Asia Fund at Rowe Price Fleming, who has agreed to subscribe.
Mr. Kasowitz predicted that the issue would trade well if priced at the lower end of the range. But at the middle to high end, interest among buyers in the secondary market could dry up.
It is a point the Chinese should not take lightly. Another failed issue could sour foreign investors on Chinese utility stocks, forcing the Government back to the arms of entrepreneurs who say they can only complete private power projects at a minimum 20 percent return on assets.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: CAMPAIGN STOP;
Upstate Forecast for Cuomo: Chilly Mood North and West

SERIES: Campaign Stop: Olean, N.Y. -- A periodic report on reaction to the New York gubernatorial race.

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: OLEAN, N.Y.

 BODY:
There's a sour mood abroad in the land and it has not escaped the notice of Allen Cecchi, who for 50 years has tracked the fortunes of this overlooked region from behind a well-situated barber's chair.
As Mr. Cecchi sees it, times are hard in this corner of western New York. Recession lingers; people are hungry for hope. Their favorite target is the Governor, and the race for his job has become their emotional vent. 
 "They want a change and it doesn't seem to matter where the change comes from," said Mr. Cecchi, a Republican who has voted in the past for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo out of ethnic loyalty. "I think people vote this way when they're feeling desperate. They feel alone. They're lashing out at everything around them."
Governor Cuomo has had mixed success here in Cattaraugus County in the past, and probably never expected to carry it this year. But the depth of its dissatisfaction is striking: It hints at how enthusiastic his supporters will have to be in New York City and its suburbs to counteract the anti-Cuomo sentiment he is facing upstate.
The vast reaches of rural, upstate New York have become increasingly hostile territory for Mr. Cuomo, a place peopled by angry Republicans, Perot voters, other insurgents and outnumbered Democrats feeling a little low on pep.
People in the state north of New York City's suburbs -- representing a third of the statewide vote -- are more likely than others to tell poll takers that Mr. Cuomo's time is up, that he has spent too much money, kept taxes too high, bungled the economy and crime. And among themselves, many say they are willing to vote for just about anyone who is not the current Governor, which is good news for Mr. Cuomo's Republican challenger, State Senator George E. Pataki.
Many seem willing to vote for Mr. Pataki -- and even contribute to his campaign -- without knowing much about his record. And Cattaraugus was one of a half-dozen rural upstate counties where Mr. Cuomo's little-known opponent, Lenora Fulani, got upwards of 40 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary without even campaigning in the area.
Here in Cattaraugus County, they complain bitterly about welfare, about the people some say they see using food stamps to buy steak, about the ones they say move across the Pennsylvania border just to get on the New York rolls.
They are angry about taxes and government regulation. They talk of businesses driven out, of the waste water that regulators complained about and that someone then put in an aquarium. (The fish, they say, flourished.)
Not only do they feel picked on; they feel neglected. They believe that their tax money is spent downstate, that politicians ignore them and that outsiders are too eager to dump their waste in the Cattaraugus County backyard.
"They'll vote for anyone whose name isn't Cuomo," said Diane Hamed, 44, a former Cuomo voter whose husband recently spent a year unemployed. "They won't know who they're voting for, but they'll know who they're voting against."
Cattaraugus County is one of those places where there are still drive-in movies. Red barns punctuate the rolling meadows and woods. Cornfields course down the valleys in undulating rivers and roadside signs advertise rod and gun clubs, Bingo, maple syrup.
But life here is not easy. The economy is shifting. Farms are dying; manufacturing jobs have dwindled. Railroad lines are unprofitable and in danger of abandonment. Nearly 7 percent of the people left during the 1980's, leaving behind a population of some 84,000, top-heavy with older people and the unemployed.
To some extent, the problems are beyond state control. Regional planning officials say the county is caught up the national decline of rural areas. Jobs disappear in part because multinational companies have bought local plants, consolidated operations and shut the plants down.
Out of all this has emerged an angry discontent. For the first time ever, the County Legislature went Democratic in 1991 -- then reverted in 1993. Ross Perot landed one-third of the votes cast in the Presidential election, ahead of Bill Clinton and behind President George Bush.
"You get the feeling that there is a whole lot of discontent about a whole lot of elected people, not just the Governor," said Ronald Hackett, the county's Commissioner of Social Services. "We've had program after program to deal with problem after problem, and we still have problem after problem."
Among the biggest problems on people's minds is the business climate (or the perception of that climate). Studies differ on whether conditions are really worse than in comparable states, but there is no question that many people think that businesses could hardly be worse off.
Erick Laine is the 61-year-old chairman and chief executive of an Olean success story, Alcas, a manufacturer of household cutlery, whose work force has grown to 400 from 150 over the last 12 years while sales have gone up, Mr. Laine said, by "many multiples."
But Mr. Laine has never voted for Mr. Cuomo. He called the Governor "a real drag on all things affecting business." He said the state's tax rates are punitive, its regulatory agencies insensitive. "I'll be a blithering idiot if I have to put up with another four years," he said.
"He's failed miserably," Mr. Laine said. "The drain of companies, corporations, factories and employers out of New York State is one of the most dismal records of any governor. And that's why there's such a groundswell to get Cuomo the hell out of there."
Mr. Cuomo lost badly here in his first campaign for Governor in 1982, but carried the county with about 60 percent of the vote four years later. In 1990 he won a three-way race here, but fell short of a majority.
While Mr. Laine said he and others were excited at least as much by the possibility of dumping Mr. Cuomo as by the prospect of electing his opponent, Mr. Pataki, he sensed pleasure that the Republican Party had found "a viable candidate, a man of substance with a rational mind-set."
Asked how much he felt he knew about Mr. Pataki, Mr. Laine said: "I don't know enough. I just wrote a check in support of his candidacy and I thought, 'I ought to learn more about this guy.' Not that I'm worried. I just felt I owe it to him."
Why give money without knowing more? Mr. Laine was asked.
"Because I know enough to know that he's a hell of a lot better than Cuomo," he said.
Mr. Pataki's promise of a 25 percent cut in the top income-tax rate, announced on Wednesday, was well received here. Don B. Winship, 65, the chairman of the County Legislature, said the plan would improve the state's business image, even if it proved not entirely feasible.
Yet over at the Olean campus of Jamestown Community College, Carol Scott was not feeling enamored of either candidate. A divorced mother of two who moved to Olean in 1992 to become the campus dean, she is philosophically a Democrat who registered as an Independent and voted in 1992 for Mr. Perot.
While many people here criticize Mr. Cuomo for opposing the death penalty, Dr. Scott faults him for not opposing it enough. "I would really like for a politician, once in a while, to stand behind their convictions and say something even though it's not popular," she said.
"Maybe I've gotten to the point of thinking that the people who really ought to be politicians aren't running," said Dr. Scott. "It's like being on the board of trustees: The only people on there are the ones who don't have anything else to do."
Even Democrats in this county seem to be suffering from an identity crisis. John Bartimole, a freelance writer, has always voted for Mr. Cuomo. But this time, he said, "His opponent is saying some things that make me think" -- something that hadn't happened before.
Maybe it's age, said Mr. Bartimole, a 40-year-old father of two. He finds himself more conservative, thinking about business issues in a new way. He worries about the return on his tax investment and how much of his health insurance premiums he can deduct.
"I'm not really soured on him," he said of Mr. Cuomo. "But I think that every politician has -- this is a hard term -- a shelf life." Mr. Bartimole's father, a politician, used to tell him: The longer you're in office, the more enemies you make until eventually you're ineffective.
One person in Cattaraugus County who doesn't buy that argument is Prof. Michael Chiariello, a 48-year-old associate professor of philosophy at St. Bonaventure University near Olean, who in past elections volunteered for Mr. Cuomo, mostly organizing students to run phone banks.
"If somebody new was there who was better than Cuomo, I'd understand," he said. "But Pataki, I don't see it. That's what we call in logic 'an argument from ignorance': You don't know what's wrong with them, so there must be something right."
"I would hate to lose a governor as good as Cuomo," said Professor Chiariello. He called Mr. Cuomo "a man of principle, of intelligence, a populist but not a conservative populist."
He has a moral core, but he's not moralistic," the professor said. "He stood against the death penalty -- a rare act of political courage."
But Professor Chiariello said he had heard nothing from the Cuomo campaign. No one had called, as in years past, asking him to deliver some students. It's a bad omen, he said; it suggests that professionals have told the campaign to focus on strongholds and write off the margins.
"It worries me," the professor said. "It's a pessimistic strategy."
 
IN THEIR OWN WORDS
 
H. CARL McCALL
The Democratic nominee for comptroller in a debate yesterday on WCBS-TV. He was asked, "If you could rewrite the responsibilities of your office, what would you propose?"
"I would propose that the comptroller have a real legitimate role in the budget process, so that the comptroller could, hopefully, be part of a process that would change and reform the way budgets are passed. As you know, this year we had a 68-day impasse in passing the budget. It affected our credit rating, and moreover, it affected our image. You see, our image is very important. . . .
"I would want to be at the table when the budget is being developed. So it's not just a matter of certifying it at the end. I want to be part of the process all along, to make the two houses come together, pass a realistic budget and put that budget before the people in public hearings that people comment on the budget and to know there's truly a balanced budget."
 
HERBERT LONDON
The Republican nominee for comptroller, speaking after Mr. McCall.
"I think what you need is an economic impact statement. And a statement that comes out during the budget period talking about what the $63.3 billion monstrosity called the state budget actually does to the state economy. The driving out of private capital is one of the significant developments in New York state history. The fact that we have the departure of businesses is a very significant feature of what's happening in New York today. . . .
"If we are going to recapture the characteristics once associated with New York, that this is the portal of opportunity, then it seems to me what you want is a comptroller who will issue a statement, a statement on behalf of taxpayers, talking about economic impact."

HEADLINE: Israel and Tunisia to Begin First Official Ties

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 2

 BODY:
In another sign that it is shaking off its role as Middle East outcast, Israel agreed with Tunisia this weekend to exchange low-level representatives as a first step toward eventual diplomatic relations.
Technically, the step was a small one. The two countries announced on Saturday night at the United Nations that they would appoint economic liaison officers, who would work out of the Belgian embassies in Tunis and Tel Aviv. 
 The road to true diplomatic ties could still be long.
Nevertheless, the move underlined how far Israelis and Arabs have come toward reconciliation, especially in the 13 months since Israel agreed with the Palestine Liberation Organization on Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories.
The economic link with Tunisia is similar to one that Israel forged last month with Morocco, although it is somewhat weaker in that the Moroccans accepted an exchange of independent offices.
Still, an important new direction has been taken -- "a first-rate achievement," Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel said today -- with the added fillip for some Israelis that Tunis until earlier this year was headquarters for the P.L.O. and its chairman, Yasir Arafat.
It means that Israel now has some sort of official relations with three Arab governments, all in northern Africa. The third is Egypt, the only Arab country to go so far as to sign a peace treaty with Israel.
And the arrangement with Tunisia comes on the heels of a decision by six Persian Gulf countries, led by Saudi Arabia, to end their blacklisting of foreign companies that trade with Israel, although their boycott of Israel itself remains intact.
"It shows that the Oslo agreement is working beyond the immediate region," a senior Israeli official said, referring to the self-rule accord with the Palestinians. "It's working. Things are really changing."
Officials here did not disguise their desire for domestic political gain. They hope they have strengthened their argument to Israelis that coming to terms with their immediate neighbors is a key to broad regional and international acceptance.
But while some officials insist that peace with neighboring Jordan and Syria is at the door, it does not seem quite ready to cross the threshold.
On Monday, Mr. Peres is scheduled to meet with Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan at the White House, but there is no sign of an imminent breakthrough toward a peace treaty, because of continuing land and water disputes.
On the Syrian front, there are few secrets about what it takes to make a deal: Israel's willingness to give up the Golan Heights and Syria's acceptance of a genuine peace. But still up in the air are critical details like the extent of the Israeli withdrawal, the amount of time it will take, the Syrian definition of peace and future security arrangements that may include the stationing of United States forces on the Golan.
Both countries are now waiting for Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is supposed to arrive next weekend for another round of shuttling between capitals in an attempt to narrow differences.
Arab governments began compiling boycott lists even before the creation of the Jewish state in 1948, the aim being to suffocate it economically. At first, the target was Israel itself. Then in 1951 the Arab League imposed a "secondary" boycott on companies that did business with Israel and a "tertiary" boycott on other companies that dealt with those already blacklisted.
As a result, many American and other foreign businesses stayed clear of Israel, costing the country outside investment often estimated cumulatively at $40 billion or more.
Although the Saudis and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council say they have now abandoned the secondary and tertiary bans, the Arab League has not altered its position. Syria, where rosters of blacklisted companies are kept, criticized the gulf states for an action that it called harmful to Arab peace negotiators. Lebanon, Libya and Iran added their condemnations.
Israelis disagreed on the likely impact of the gulf council's decision. Some said it should spring doors open to new foreign investment, but others noted that the boycott has been a shadow of its former self for years, with companies from Coca-Cola to Honda openly selling their products here and in the Arab world.

HEADLINE: Rich and Poor Nations Split on Aid Plan

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MADRID, Oct. 2

 BODY:
A serious new political rift between the world's rich and poor nations opened tonight after finance ministers from 21 nations were unable to agree at a meeting here on a plan to create billions of dollars in development aid.
The aid is intended to help Russia, other former Communist countries and the poorest developing nations build up trade and participate in the emerging world economic recovery. 
 After difficult talks all day, the finance ministers, who come from developed and developing countries and who make up the Governing Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund, could not agree on how much money would be made available.
The United States and the six other industrial powers in the Group of Seven -- Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- said yesterday that they would agree to creating no more than $23 billion in aid, and they insisted that it all be allocated in a way that favored the former Communist world and the poorest nations. But developing countries, backed by the managing director of the I.M.F., Michel Camdessus of France, pressed for an allocation of $52 billion. The Group of Seven considered the higher figure inflationary.
The Camdessus camp also wanted at least some aid to be distributed in a broader fashion, so that all poorer countries would get an immediate injection of monetary reserves.
The aid under discussion takes the form of Special Drawing Rights, an international credit unit developed in the 1970's as a substitute for the dollar and sometimes called "paper gold." The rights are held by countries in their monetary reserves and entitle them to draw foreign currencies from the I.M.F., thus strengthening their creditworthiness and enabling them to buy more foreign goods.
But only about $28 billion of the rights have ever been created, and they have conspicuously failed to replace the dollar as an international reserve currency.
American and other European officials appeared deeply angry tonight with Mr. Camdessus, whom they blamed in part for the impasse, saying he had encouraged the developing world to press for a much bigger allocation than the Group of Seven agreed to yesterday.
"Camdessus miscalculated, whipping up third world expectations," said Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clark, after the meeting.
The finance ministers did agree to allow former Communist and certain developing countries greater access to I.M.F. credit in the future but left the details to be worked out. And they failed to agree on a way to extend and enlarge the special lending program the I.M.F. set up to help Russia and other former Communist nations develop market-based economies.
The negotiations could resume at the finance ministers next meeting in April, but several ministers were cautious tonight. One European said, "We are in no hurry" and insisted the Group of Seven would want assurances in advance that developing countries were ready to accept the group's point of view.
France also angered the United States during today's difficult negotiations by adopting a somewhat ambiguous position in the dispute, officials said.
While Finance Minister Edmond Alphandery of France gave nominal backing to the Group of Seven stand, he did not conceal from other ministers that France had favored a larger sum.
In the view of the United States and a majority of the Group of Seven countries, the expansion of international capital markets already provides adequate credit for developing nations, and the creation of too many Special Drawing Rights would only stoke the fires of world inflation.
Because the former Communist countries and some poorer developing nations did not participate in earlier special rights allocations, and because they are short of reserves, the United States and its allis proposed that the aid under discussion be skewed in their direction.
But such a special distribution would have taken a year or so to arrange because it requires a change in I.M.F. rules subject to ratification by parliaments of member nations.
While much of the dispute focused on the arcane world of Special Drawing Rights, it also represented an attempt by Mr. Camdessus and the I.M.F., which manages the Special Drawing Rights plan, to increase their importance in the international monetary system by raising the quantity of new reserve units held by the world's central banks.

HEADLINE: George L. Bach, 79, Business Educator

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PORTOLA VALLEY, Calif., Oct. 2

 BODY:
George Leland Bach, the first dean of the business school at Carnegie-Mellon University, died on Thursday. He was 79.

 BODY:
The total volume of new securities issues in the United States plummeted 51.5 percent in the third quarter and 29 percent in the first nine months of the year as rising interest rates and fears of inflation led investors to take a more cautious approach.
Because of such a sharp drop in almost all classifications of new stock and bond issues, underwriting fees continued to plunge, with securities firms suffering a 56.6 percent decline in the third quarter and a 32.7 percent fall in the nine-month period. 
 "It certainly was the weakest quarter so far this year," Grant Kvalheim, a managing director of Merrill Lynch, said. "The best thing we can say about it is that the activity level picked up in the last half of September and we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter."
According to the Securities Data Company, a leading research firm, the volume of all domestic new issues dropped to $143.5 billion in the July-September quarter from $296.1 billion a year earlier. For the first three quarters, the volume fell to $588.9 billion from $829.1 billion in the corresponding period of 1993.
Since the Federal Reserve began raising short-term rates in February, total issuance has declined more than 50 percent on a monthly basis.
Bonds represent the bulk of the new issues and investment-grade bonds represent the largest percentage of the bonds that were issued. All debt securities fell 50.2 percent, to $130.8 billion, from $262.7 billion, in the third quarter, and 30 percent, to $528.8 billion, from $733.4 billion, in the first nine months. The investment-grade market tumbled 36.3 percent, to $41.7 billion, in the latest quarter, and 28.7 percent, to $158.7 billion, in the nine-month period.
The issuance of mortgage-backed securities dropped to its lowest level since the second quarter of 1989. And the volume of new issues of junk bonds was lower than in any three-month period since the third quarter of 1991.
In contrast, asset-backed securities bucked the trend, as many new portfolios were repackaged into loans. Volume in the third quarter jumped 47.9 percent, to $21 billion from $14.2 billion. In the January-September period, volume increased 36.3 percent, to $54.4 billion from $39.9 billion.
"The rise in interest rates obviously put off a lot of potential issuance," Mr. Kvalheim said. He noted that the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond advanced to 7.81 percent from 7.60 percent in the third quarter and that shorter-term rates increased even more. "The yield curve has flattened," he added.
On the equity side, new issues of common stock, excluding closed-end funds, fell 54.3 percent in the third period, to $9.5 billion from $20.8 billion. The decline was narrower, at 28.6 percent, for the first nine months of the year, to $42.6 billion from $59.7 billion.
"The I.P.O. market had such a dreadful performance that small-cap money managers said, 'I'm not going to buy anymore,' " Robert L. Cooney, a managing director of CS First Boston, said. "It was a self-correcting and cleansing process in which you get rid of marginal issuers and you bring about more realistic pricing."
Donal Orr, a senior vice president of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said that "portfolio managers have had to be a lot more selective in what they were able to buy."
"We've had a market environment that is fairly fragile and volatile," he said. "Portfolio managers are looking for opportunities in the existing marketplace before they will participate in a more risky I.P.O."
Disclosed underwriting fees declined 56.6 percent, to $999.1 million, from $2.3 billion, in the third quarter of 1994. For the first nine months of the year, disclosed fees fell 32.7 percent, to $4.5 billion, from $6.7 billion.
The Securities Data tally, which gives full credit to the lead underwriter, shows that Goldman, Sachs & Company led in investment-firm fees for the third quarter with $156.4 million, compared with the next highest total, $126.4 million for Merrill Lynch. However, the positions were reversed for the nine-month period, as Merrill Lynch finished with $801.5 million in fees and Goldman, Sachs had $508.3 million.
Merrill Lynch also maintained its title as the leading underwriter of debt and equity, a ranking it has held since the first quarter of 1990, by achieving a market share of 17.3 percent for the third quarter and 16.8 percent for the first nine months.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REVIEW;
Advisers Post Gains In Model Portfolios

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN 

 BODY:
AFTER struggling for a year in a choppy stock market, five investment advisers zipped ahead in the third quarter, with three chalking up gains on par with the previous four quarters combined in their hypothetical retirement portfolios.
Sheldon Jacobs, editor of The No-Load Fund Investor of Irvington, N.Y., widened his lead with a gain of 5.52 percent, bringing his original $50,000 portfolio up to $58,938, an increase of 17.88 percent since the contest began in July 1993. 
 Eric Kobren, president of Insight Management in Wellesley, Mass., held onto second place over all, building his all-Fidelity portfolio to $56,878, but his gain of 3.83 percent put him in fourth place for the quarter.
Harold Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla., had a 4.97 percent gain, the second best of the quarter, to $54,937; John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds of Chicago, had a 4.03 percent gain, to $54,090, and the portfolio of Jack A. Brill, a San Diego investment adviser who uses only what he considers socially responsible investments, advanced 3.52 percent to $53,196.
But these are 20-year portfolios, so it is too early in the derby to count anyone out. The test of a portfolio manager is how he or she performs in both bull and bear markets.
Perhaps the one discouraging note is that the professionally managed portfolios look less attractive when compared with an unmanaged market average. The "efficient market" theory holds that investors cannot beat market averages over the long term, so they should not even try. In this quarter, only Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Evensky outperformed the Vanguard S.& P. 500 Index Fund, which posted a gain of 4.86 percent.
Both put a portion of their money overseas, and those funds gave them their strongest returns. Markets in Latin America and Asia, excluding Japan, have boomed recently.
The portfolio performance is tracked quarterly by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. in Summit, N.J., and the initial results could change slightly early this week as funds finish their quarterly accounting. It excludes transaction costs, sales charges and taxes. The five experts can shift portfolio holdings each quarter. For the coming quarter, four of the five made changes, with three becoming a bit more aggressive.
Mr. Jacobs is standing pat. "My game plan is basically to stay with a well-diversified portfolio that is not overly risky," he said. "I see a very gradually slowing economy that will be a favorable climate for stocks."
He added, "I prefer an all-equity portfolio" for long-term growth, and the economic climate should be right for that.
Mr. Evensky agreed that the economic fundamentals looked good, but said that "it is not clear sailing." He is cutting his stake in the Meridian Fund to 10 percent and adding a 10 percent stake in Penn Mutual, a value fund that was closed when the race began but is now open to new investors.
"Our clients are not looking to make a killing," he said. "They are looking for risk-adjusted consistent return. We deal with those who have made their money and want to keep it."
Mr. Kobren is dropping the Fidelity Capital and Income Fund, which barely gained in the quarter and is replacing it with the Fidelity Fund, which is managed by Beth F. Terrana, a proven Fidelity manager whom he respects.
"Since this is a long-term growth portfolio for retirement, we can stand a little more firepower in the account," he said. "It's a matter of trying to make the portfolio a little more volatile when the economy and corporate profits are still in very good shape." He is keeping Capital and Income, which did very well over the last three years, in conservative accounts.
Mr. Brill is reducing his position in Calvert Social Investing to 13.3 percent and adding a 5 percent stake in the Calvert Strategic Growth Fund, an aggressive portfolio managed by Cedd Moses, who has enhanced returns by using options, futures and short sales.
"This diversifies the portfolio and adds dimensions not previously available to socially responsible investors," Mr. Brill said, referring to those who avoid stocks of companies involved in tobacco, alcohol, nuclear weapons and firearms.
Mr. Rekenthaler is cutting his stake in the Janus Fund to 10 percent and adding a 10 percent position in the new Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock Fund. With a 2.63 percent advance in the quarter, "Janus was sluggish, and that was my major disappointment," he said.
Although he usually avoids a new fund until it has proved itself, "Fidelity has a track record of grooming up-and-coming portfolio managers," Mr. Rekenthaler said, and Jennifer Uhrig is running Mid-Cap aggressively, having won her spurs on several sector funds.
He is optimistic for the long term. "Some of the stuff I like just got cheaper," he said wryly, mentioning European stocks and energy issues, so he is sticking with his basic game plan.
Again, sticking with a game plan is what has kept all five on track. Nervous investors who trade frequently or bail out the minute a holding dips into negative territory generally lose money. All five contestants have solid gains.

Core of Tax Cut Debate: New York's Self-Image

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
WITH just over a month to go before New York elects its next governor, it would help to get one thing clear: the tax cut debate between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and his Republican opponent, State Senator George E. Pataki, is not, at its core, about cutting taxes. It is about New York's definition of itself. Because unless New York is prepared to change dramatically what it is and long has been, it will never have low taxes. Lower? Yes. But low? Not likely.
Put simply, New York has vast obligations and historically high standards. The state is home to a lot of needy people and helps care for them because Federal dollars do not go far enough. But New York does not stop there. It spends more than most other states, and not just on the poor. New Yorkers have always had expensive tastes. Even Republican New Yorkers. 
 For instance, the state spends the largest piece of its budget not -- surprise -- on Medicaid or welfare, but on its schools: Out of a $34 billion budget, nearly $10 billion in state funds (localities contribute, too) goes to the schools, compared with $6 billion for Medicaid and $2 billion for welfare. It so happens that Republicans in the Republican-led State Senate -- where Mr. Pataki works -- hold up the budget every year to win increases for their suburban and rural school districts. And those districts consistently get more than their fair share.
IT is no accident that, statewide, New York maintains one of the best teacher-to-student ratios in the country or that the state contributes to the cost of busing students to and from private and parochial schools.
Such largess is the norm in New York. Federal studies show that combined state and local spending in New York is among the highest in the country in nearly every category, from education to courts to hospitals. It long has been, even when Republicans were in power.
Such traditions are hard to change. Are New Yorkers, whatever their politics or pocketbooks, prepared to do with fewer government services to pay for a large tax cut? Will lobbyists for legions of special interests settle for less? If not, then any large state tax cut would most likely lead to higher local taxes because the state sends $7 of every $10 it collects back to the localities.
Mr. Pataki argues otherwise. He wants to reduce income tax rates significantly -- up to 25 percent over four years -- and says a growing economy and eliminating waste, fraud and abuse -- every campaign's Big Three -- will pay for it. He might, however, keep an eye on New Jersey, where the Republican Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, pledged a 30 percent tax cut over three years, but now says she needs at least another year. Mrs. Whitman is also facing a $2 million budget gap and is hearing complaints that local taxes are going up to pay for her cuts.
MR. CUOMO, no stranger to outbreaks of tax cut fever among the electorate, feels the pressure, too, but is promising what is advertised as a much more modest reduction. The Democratic Governor scorns Mr. Pataki's proposal as "fiction," and predicts it would lead to higher local taxes.
Not that Mr. Cuomo is immune to wishful thinking. Local governments would have to tighten their belts if New Yorkers are to benefit from any state tax cut, he says. But how much can local governments realistically save, given their inescapable costs? Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican Mayor, is cutting to the bone to close his budget gap, in large part because Medicaid is costing New York City more than $2 billion a year, and welfare costs $900 million, out of a $31.6 billion budget. Counties and cities around the state are similarly burdened because New York is one of the few states that demand local contributions to Medicaid and welfare.
Mr. Pataki says that like Governor Cuomo, he favors a state takeover of Medicaid, and he emphasizes the need to reduce fraud and administrative costs. But Mr. Pataki's own campaign staff estimates that efficiencies could save only $300 million from Medicaid's annual state cost of $6 billion.
In fact, barring an economic boom, Mr. Pataki's proposals would not only make New York more efficient. They would also force New Yorkers of all parties to make decisions they have not before been willing to consider. Would they refuse to admit an illegal immigrant to a public hospital or school? Would they put time limits on welfare benefits and shelter for the homeless? Would the more affluent be willing to do without publicly subsidized parks and beach clubs, or publicly financed busing to private schools?
Those are the underlying questions implicit in the tax cut debate. Maybe before the campaign is over, New Yorkers will ask those questions of their candidates and of themselves.

HEADLINE: DANCE REVIEW;
Graham on Themes as Old as Time Itself

BYLINE: By ANNA KISSELGOFF 

 BODY:
"Clytemnestra," Martha Graham's three-act dance treatment of the Oresteia, is nothing short of epic drama, and it received an astonishingly integrated performance on Saturday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Christine Dakin, magnificent and complex in the title role, and the other members of the Martha Graham Dance Company must not be missed when "Clytemnestra" has its repeat performance on Friday.
Nor should, for different reasons, anyone pass up the sections of "Chronicle" that were revived on Friday night for the first time since the 1930's. If "Clytemnestra," choreographed in 1958, is a brazen panorama imbued with overt sexuality and a fragmented modernist structure, "Chronicle" is a stark social-protest piece from 1936, smoldering in the crucible of its very purity. To see Terese Capucilli rise up as a towering red specter of war is to shudder at the apocalyptic height of Graham's vision. 
 This contrast in repertory is a highlight of the current "Radical Graham" series in the Next Wave Festival at the Academy's Opera House (30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene).
Whatever the diversity, Graham's cardinal principles are clear: movement expresses inner emotion and is never diluted into decorative form. More important, her dances are life-affirming. Even the range in the season's second program, the mixed bill on Friday, embodied this concept.
"Appalachian Spring," with its Shaker hymn embedded in Aaron Copland's score, celebrates a frontier roof-raising. But the basic image was actually a metaphor, in 1944, for Graham to reaffirm democratic American values during World War II. In 1946, she shifted ground notoriously with "Dark Meadow," an exploration of Jungian symbols, enhanced by Isamu Noguchi's phallic sculpture, that still leaves viewers uncomfortable or nonplused. Typically, this ritual probing into the mysteries of life and sex ends with an ode to rebirth.
The program, framed by these major pieces, included repeats of the newly reconstructed "Satyric Festival Song" from 1932 and "Deep Song," Graham's antiwar solo of 1937, created during the Spanish Civil War.
The same war was the springboard for "Chronicle." "Sketches From 'Chronicle,' " as the current production is called, conjures a more general desolation. Its second section, "Steps in the Street," was brilliantly revived under Graham's supervision in 1989; it has enough repetitive minimalism to put the current so-called avant-garde to shame. But the two sections just reconstructed, "Specter: 1914" and "Prelude to Action" are more dated, in the best sense. That is, they speak specifically of a 1930's esthetic.
Consistently, however, Graham's most timely pieces have endured through their timelessness.
"Sketches From 'Chronicle' " is, in fact, a study in how potential cliches can be diverted into original expressive purpose. Two sub-sections have not been included in this reconstruction: "Masque," from the first part; "Dances Before Catastrophe," and "Tragic Holiday" from the second part, "Dances After Catastrophe."
But the present sequence -- "Spectre: 1914," "Steps in the Street" and "Prelude to Action" -- tells the story.
The original program note spoke of conquest and "the ugly logic of imperialism," ending with "the taut gathering of new energies and new forces." If this final call to action is militant in its energy, the opening "Specter," subtitled "Drums -- Red Shroud -- Lament," is a lesson in economy.
Ms. Capucilli, in a voluminous skirt with a red lining, remains initially rooted to the platform on which she sits while Wallingford Riegger's score (orchestrated by Stanley Sussman) begins. The movement is concentrated in a tense and mobile torso or crossed fists. After Ms. Capucilli rises tall on the two-tiered platform, there is a typical Graham manipulation of fabric. The skirt becomes a red shroud, draped over the frightening specter of war who sinks and then dissolves from abstract form into a very human woman beating her fists on the floor until she lies back on the platform.
The bloodiness of the central, shattering image (the section was reconstructed by Carole Fried and Ms. Capucilli) is matched perfectly by the stark anonymous patterns of "Steps in the Street" (subtitled "Devastation, Homelessness, Exile"), led by Denise Vale.
"Prelude to Action" (reconstructed chiefly by Sophie Maslow) is a period piece, but a strong one. Ms. Capucilli, now in white, has a leg-swinging solo before the 12 women and Ms. Vale, who supports her, heed her call. They divide into complex overlapping and dynamic units. Energy within form tells this tale.
Elsewhere on the bill, Joyce Herring triumphed as an especially tender bride in "Appalachian Spring." Floyd Flynn was her engaging and youthful husband, Ms. Vale a focused pioneer and Pascal Rioult an impressively fervent preacher. His followers -- Elizabeth Auclair, Sandra Kaufmann, Rika Okamato and Alessandra Prosperi -- danced more than superbly. As for "Dark Meadow," it was led with particular passion by Ms. Capucilli and Donlin Foreman while Kathy Buccellato, as the earth mother and guide, offered an electric performance.
"Dark Meadow" was the prelude to Graham's exploration of Greek myth, which reached its peak with "Clytemnestra." In the latter work Andrea Matthews and Kevin Deas were the fine singers. Halim El-Dabh's score could have been better played.
Ms. Dakin has come a long way since her debut in the role in 1992. The vengeful and sorrowing queen, seeking redemption, became in this performance a creature of sharply shifting moods, with every nuance expressed through movement. A tapestry of brilliant emotional colors was woven by the entire cast, including Graham's wonderfully voracious furies with their twisted mouths.
Outstanding performances came from Mario Camacho, a febrile Messenger of Death arching with special tension and moving with brilliant timing; Mr. Foreman as a powerful Agamemnon; Ms. Capucilli, a dramatic Electra; Mr. Rioult as a carefully thought-out Aegisthus (Clytemnestra's lover); Kenneth Topping, convincing in the difficult role of Orestes; Ms. Vale as a crazed Cassandra; Miki Orihara as a strangely poignent Iphigenia; Mr. Flynn as an agressive Hades, and Ms. Herring as a voluptuous Helen.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
N.H.L. and Union to Go Back to Bargaining Table

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Having each executed a nifty public relations step in the days before the scheduled start of the season, the two sides in the National Hockey League dispute will resume talks tomorrow aimed at getting the season started Oct. 15.
Bob Goodenow, the players' labor leader, spoke with Gary Bettman yesterday and, the league said in a news advisory, told the commissioner he was prepared to meet tomorrow. They will talk again today to set a time and place. 
 The negotiators most likely will meet in New York, though one person from the league has suggested the talks be moved to a neutral site. But it is the substance, not the site, of the talks that will determine whether or not the season starts on its new opening date.
Bettman designated Oct. 15 as opening day on Friday when he countered the union's move of 24 hours earlier.
Faced with a lockout on opening night last Saturday, the players proposed that the season begin on time and be played in its entirety, under the expired collective bargaining agreement, with the players pledging not to strike and the owners pledging not to lock out and restoring the economic benefits Bettman took away before training camp.
Hockey fans, hoping to avoid the misery that befell their baseball counterparts on Aug. 12, welcomed the proposal and eagerly prepared for opening night.
What they didn't understand in the first flush of anticipation, though, was that the owners would be reluctant to play the season under economic terms they were trying to change. Furthermore, the owners were concerned that the players would drag out talks throughout the season and they would reach the end of the playoffs in the same position they are in now.
The Board of Governors was expected to reject the proposal outright but instead developed its own twist. Bettman announced the next day that he was postponing the start of the season to Oct. 15, giving the two sides an additional two weeks to negotiate an agreement before the season might lose games.
Depending on the pace of negotiations, the commissioner said, he would decide in the interim whether or not to open the season on the new target date. He preferred to have a deal in place by then, he said, but he conceivably could accept the players' proposal without one.
With that move, Bettman was not rejecting the players' proposal but instead placing the onus of negotiations on them. If they didn't begin meeting right away or if they stalled when they did meet, they could be made to look responsible for their own lockout.
In an effort to impress upon the players what he saw as the value of the owners' proposal to settle the dispute, Bettman sent each player a three-page letter the same day he announced the Oct. 15 start.
In the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, Bettman cited the economic and image gains the league has made in the past two years.
"I share your concern that a delay in the season will undercut much of the progress that our sport has made over the past year," Bettman wrote. But he went on to say that in the last five years, teams have increased player payrolls $1.14 for every new dollar earned.
"We need a player employment system that avoids making this a league of haves and have-nots," he wrote. "Unless we develop that type of system, our recent success will not solve our economic and competitive problems. This situation must be addressed, and addressed now."
Bettman also noted that the union "refused to meet with us" for more than five months. He then outlined the terms of the owners' proposal, including the luxury tax on payrolls, revenue sharing to benefit low-revenue teams, unrestricted free agency and an entry-level salary system.
Bettman told the players they "should feel free to speak to your club owner or general manager if you have any questions about collective bargaining."
Players generally do not react well to letters that bypass their union and are sent directly to them. It was not known if any of them immediately sought out their owners or general managers with questions. But most of them did hold team meetings after their player representatives returned from a meeting Saturday in Toronto.

3 Teams' Players Call Themselves Informed and United

BYLINE: By JASON DIAMOS 

 BODY:
The Rangers rented a room at the Rye Town Hilton yesterday. The Islanders gathered at Troy Loney's place. The Devils were over at Scott Stevens's house.
Three separate meetings. One distinct purpose. 
 "We went over what we went over yesterday," said the Rangers' Adam Graves, referring to the players meeting held Saturday in Toronto. "Basically, we just updated on everything, took it back to all the guys, talked it over, got everyone's view."
Graves, Mike Richter, Glenn Healy and Nick Kypreos represented the Rangers in Toronto. Loney and Brad Dalgarno were there for the Islanders. The Devils, headed by Bruce Driver, sent the largest contingent of any team: 10 players.
Yesterday, Graves, Loney and Driver emphasized that their teammates were all on the same page after the informational meetings.
"We understand the issues," said Loney. "And that makes our resolve that much stronger."
The Devils decided they would go to the team's training facilities at South Mountain Arena in West Orange, N.J., today to remove their equipment.
One of the major issues discussed in all the meetings was whether to continue practicing together while they are essentially locked out by the owners. Each group came up with a decision, but none will reveal what it was until today, after all the player representatives talk by phone with the Players Association in Toronto. The decision will be leaguewide.
"It isn't the Islanders, the Rangers anymore," said Loney.
"It's the N.H.L.P.A.," said Graves.
Most of the other discussion focused on the league's latest proposal.
"When you look at things at face value, some people are saying to us, 'Why aren't you signing that?' " Graves said. "But when you break it down, we don't think it's very fair. Everyone realizes what this entails. In your heart, you know it's morally wrong. It just isn't fair."
Graves added: "It goes without saying that the guys fully understand what the issues are. To say anyone's happy, no. We're hockey players; we want to play hockey. Right now, we're being locked out unless we agree on what Gary Bettman has given us as a proposal. And in no way do we feel we want to accept it. It would be nice to say you could give or take on this issue, give or take on that issue. But their position is take everything as one or don't play. There's been no give or take."
The players say they will definitely not accept a salary cap in any form. Early in training camp, some older veterans suggested they might be willing to give in to a rookie salary cap.
"But once it was explained, you haven't heard anybody else," said Loney, who just turned 31. "I'm as strong against it as anybody else because with it veterans will lose their jobs. You saw the same situation in football. The same exact thing would happen. Under the cap, the rookies' salaries would be down. It would become an economic decision for teams. You have a rookie, maybe he's not ready, but you need to slash costs. So you release a veteran and the rookie takes his place."

Collaboration Or Coincidence?

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Jim Quinn, a players lawyer who has been involved in landmark litigation in football and basketball, sees it as the ultimate dream. "We could sue them all at once," he said, fantasizing about the idea of mounting a mammoth antitrust case against professional sports.
Shaking himself out of his courtroom reverie, Quinn added, "It may or may not be the seeds of a great lawsuit, but it's interesting that people who purport to be competitors are cooperating." 
 With more professional leagues shut down than operating, players and their lawyers cast a suspicious eye at the officials and some club owners and executives of Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association.
They see, as one lawyer put it, a "cross-fertilization," men who own or operate teams in more than one sport, and they talk of meetings attended by representatives of the three leagues. They do not charge a conspiracy, but some question the propriety of what they suspect is joint planning by officials of leagues that are supposed to be competing for the fans' dollars.
At the same time, members of management talk of joint efforts of the heads of the three unions, pointing to the similarity of player proposals in baseball and hockey in current negotiations as evidence. They don't accuse the union chiefs of illegal acts either, but the suggestions of cross-pollination on both sides add spice to the unique development that has enveloped sports these days.
The National Football League played its full complement of games yesterday, but Major League Baseball neither played its final day of games nor planned for the start of its playoffs tomorrow, and the National Hockey League did not play its two scheduled games. The National Basketball Association doesn't have any games scheduled for another month, but they might not be played either.
Strikes, lockouts, postponements, shutdowns. They have replaced the game of summer, autumn and winter. Even the man who runs Bud Selig's delicatessen in Milwaukee asked the question: Why now? Why are all of these professional sports leagues mired in labor problems at the same time?
One reason is that the collective bargaining agreements in the three sports ended at about the same time. Another is money -- the battle for the billions of dollars in revenue generated by professional sports.
The players want their salaries to be determined in a free market while the owners want to gain control over the escalation of those salaries. Salary cap or luxury tax, the owners' system of choice is aimed at producing less income for labor and more for management. Baseball and hockey owners see the cap at work in the other leagues, and they want their new system.
"It clearly is not by accident," said Selig, baseball's acting commissioner. "It is clearly taken from our experience. This has been coming for a long time. The systems that used to work so well economically don't work anymore. Tragically, I think we were all guilty of not facing up to that. The timing is all too bad, but it should not be misunderstood. No matter what the explanation, it is not a historical accident that the only sport playing has revenue sharing and a salary cap."
As the battle rages, though, the players and their lawyers wonder if the owners said, "Me, too," or if the movement has been orchestrated.
"I don't know if it's a grand conspiracy, but my information is they've been in regular contact and consultation," Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said. "They've had some meetings in Bettman's and Stern's offices."
Gary Bettman is the commissioner of the National Hockey League; David Stern, Bettman's former boss, is commissioner of the National Basketball Association. Selig has not been identified as having been a participant in any meetings, but Richard Ravitch, the baseball owners' chief labor executive, has.
Richard Moss, a well-placed players lawyer, said he has heard about "lots of meetings," and another person associated with players, who spoke on the condition he not be identified, said that when Jerry Reinsdorf, principal owner of the White Sox and Bulls of Chicago, was in New York for baseball labor meetings last month, he met with Bettman.
Reports of interleague meetings or telephone conversations come not only from people on the players' side. One owner with friends in more than one league said he is aware that Ravitch has spoken to the others. A baseball owner said he, too, knows that Ravitch has seen Bettman and Stern "on occasion."
Another baseball person said: "I know they talk a lot. I'm sure they've gotten together at lunch or meetings. Dick often says, 'Gary said this; David said this.' "
But none of the principals acknowledges any such widespread communications.
Stern said yesterday that he could recall having had lunch with Bettman and Ravitch once in the last six months. He denied that they have undertaken any joint efforts or bargaining strategies.
"We rail against economic reality and owners," the N.B.A. commissioner said. "Those tend to be a unifying thing."
Bettman said that he could recall only one meeting among the three men "many, many, many months ago."
"It was a status report as to where we each were and what our unions were telling us," he said. "Nothing more than bringing everyone up to date as to where things were and where they were likely to go. There's no ongoing series of meetings or discussions about who is doing what or what we're going to do, at least not between me and the other guys. As a matter of industry knowledge, you may get an occasional inquiry: 'We read this; what does it mean?' "
Bettman said he and Stern "chat on a regular basis about a lot of things," but he added, "I have a league to run and he has a league to run and guess what? We're competitors. It would be counterproductive to be doing anything with other sports because we compete head to head. In the best of all worlds I'd make a deal next week and baseball and basketball would be out."
It would, the N.H.L. commissioner said, "be an unfair and inaccurate aspersion" to say the sports officials meet and work in unison.
Ravitch said he talks with Stern occasionally but added: "I think we're both guarded. We have our own unique responsibilities. He doesn't tell me his strategy and I don't tell him mine." Ravitch said he has talked with Bettman "once or twice."
The way Stan Kasten sees it, talking among officials, owners and executives in various sports is natural. Kasten is president of Ted Turner's teams in Atlanta, the Braves and the Hawks.
"It's an industry and people tend to have their contacts and expertise across the spectrum of that particular industry," he said. "I don't think it's different from any other industry. We all know each other. We talk."
As a member of the owners' negotiating committee in baseball, Kasten was in New York last month trying to help produce a settlement that would end the players strike and salvage the World Series. As a member of the labor committee in basketball, he will be in New York for a meeting tomorrow.
Kasten said he actively speaks with people in both sports and is a close friend of Bettman. But he said: "The problems of each sport are unique and are being handled very individually. Otherwise, we'd have had a cap in baseball years ago."
The N.B.A. talks won't begin until the union's appeal of a Federal court ruling upholding the league's salary cap is decided, perhaps in three or four weeks. Reinsdorf, the Chicago owner, is another who is interested in those developments as well as the muddied future of baseball.
Abe Pollin (Washington Capitals, Washington Bullets) and the Gunds, George 3d and Gordon (San Jose Sharks, Cleveland Cavaliers) own teams in hockey and basketball. So do the owners of the Rangers and Knicks, whoever they are at any given moment.
Mike Ilitch owns the Tigers and Red Wings of Detroit. Wayne Huizenga owns teams in just about every professional league. John McMullen, owner of the New Jersey Devils, also used to own the Houston Astros. David LeFevre, governor of the Tampa Bay Lightning, used to be a minority owner in baseball.
Bettman worked in the N.B.A. for 11 years. Jeffrey Pash, his senior vice president and general counsel, became the National Football League's chief attorney when Paul Tagliabue became commissioner. Management people, generally anonymously, are quick to mention what they say is an intimate relationship between Fehr, the baseball labor leader, and Goodenow, his less experienced hockey counterpart. Some throw in Charles Grantham, the basketball players' union chief.
"My guess is we don't have the same networking intensity that occurs on the players' side," said Stern. "We're not connected the same way historically."
A baseball official said he has been told that "Don and Charlie and Goodenow are in almost daily contact." But, the official added, "We have no problem with that."
Some N.H.L. people believe Fehr and Goodenow consult on a regular basis. "That's how we got the same proposal," one official said.
Another hockey person said, "I think the thing is so dominated by Donald Fehr that Goodenow won't do anything."
A players lawyer said the unions talk "all the time," but he didn't believe Goodenow was constantly looking over his shoulder. Another lawyer close to the baseball union said Fehr offered Goodenow "very little guidance."
Fehr and Goodenow scoffed at the notion that they daily press each other's button on their speed-dial telephones.
"Bob and I talk every so often," Fehr said. "We have some lawyers we both use in varying degrees and for different things." He said the notion that "Bob and the hockey players do what we tell them is silly."
Goodenow said he speaks with Fehr occasionally, "maybe once or twice since their strike started."
"As a new person," Goodenow added, "Don called me and said, 'If you have any questions, call or stop in. They've been in their new offices, I think, since January, and I stopped there in August for the first time."
Asked about the similarity of the unions' proposals -- a tax on player payrolls, a tax on total revenues or gate receipts -- Fehr said, "If you're going to tax something, there's a limited number of things you can tax."

HEADLINE: Business-Friendlier at City Hall

 BODY:
Movie projectors have not used combustible nitrate film for decades, so the safety risk is long gone. But an obsolete city regulation still requires projectionists to obtain a license from New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs. Likewise anyone who holds a masquerade ball, works in a pool hall, or drives a laundry truck.
These are among the 21 license categories that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani now proposes to eliminate as part of his larger effort to "re-engineer" the city's regulatory process and remove unnecessary burdens on businesses. The City Council will have to determine whether any of the licenses on the City Hall hit list, like the one now required for used-car wholesalers, still make sense as a matter of consumer protection or public safety. But in general Mr. Giuliani's approach to cutting the city's daunting, expensive -- and often mindless -- red tape is both welcome and overdue. 
 Too often, as the Mayor's task force on regulatory reform observes, businesses are "crippled by the triple plagues of unnecessary or unduly harsh rules, uncaring or unthinking enforcement and poor business-government communication."
Some positive changes are already under way. For example, a pilot program begun in August in Queens allows "one-stop shopping" for various construction permits or certificates of occupancy, eliminating a lot of the normal traipsing from agency to agency. The administration plans to phase it in citywide, and to extend the one-stop concept to tax, license and inspection matters.
The city's complex regulatory process is deeply entrenched and cannot be transformed overnight. The budget crunch, which provides an impetus for change, may also make necessary new computer equipment unaffordable. Much of what Mr. Giuliani is now proposing, like allowing businesses to pay fees or fines with credit cards, requires approval from the State Legislature. Licensing is one area where quick progress should be possible. But only two years ago, the City Council rejected many of the same suggestions when they were proposed by Mark Green, then the city's Consumer Affairs Commissioner.
There is reason even beyond the budget crisis to hope that this year will be different. Mr. Green, a Democrat who is now the city's Public Advocate, and Mr. Giuliani, the city's first Republican Mayor since John Lindsay, do not seem to agree on much else. But they are together on the need for sensible licensing reform that protects essential consumer safety and health interests without pummeling law-abiding businesses.

Stop the Bidding War

 BODY:
To the Editor:
With all the talk of businesses leaving New York City, the move of the Swiss Bank Corporation, with its 1,500 workers, to Stamford, Conn., was reported as a "blow to the city" (news article, Sept. 22). 
 But it is Stamford that has placed itself in a vulnerable position with a "gain" that will cost the people who live there $120 million over the next 10 years, which comes to $60,000 per employee. The prospect of lowering local taxes becomes more remote.
In New York City, as in Stamford, the way to attract jobs is to reduce everyone's taxes, not just the taxes of those wielding the most influence.
With each bidding war to lure major companies and institutions, the stakes rise until Stamford's gift to Swiss Bank more than doubled what New York City had ever offered. Let's hope this is the beginning of the end of these programs. This extreme exposes just how silly and ultimately unprofitable the game of corporate bluff is.
Both Connecticut and New Jersey must realize that by weakening New York City's economy, they are weakening their own. Without New York City as the country's financial center, future Swiss Banks will opt for new locations that are much less expensive and much farther away.
As the president of a company that owns and manages two million square feet of New York City real estate, I know that to retain tenants you have to improve the quality of life and lower the cost of doing business.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: WOMEN;
In '94, 'Vote for Woman' Does Not Play So Well

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 2

 BODY:
When Dawn Clark Netsch pulled an upset and won the Democratic primary for governor of Illinois last March, she seemed well on her way to following the trail blazed here two years ago by Carol Moseley-Braun, who rode the sex card to the United States Senate.
Not only is Ms. Netsch the first woman nominated for governor by either major party in Illinois, she is the first woman in the nation with a female running-mate, Penny Severns, as well. Yet Ms. Netsch rarely talks to voters about the historic nature of her ticket, and her candidacy has generated little enthusiasm among women or men. Unlike Ms. Moseley-Braun, a Democrat who drew support from Republican women, Ms. Netsch is having trouble winning over women in her own party and is stalled as much as 30 points behind Gov. Jim Edgar in local polls. 
 "Nobody is really paying much attention," Ms. Netsch, the 68-year-old State Comptroller, said in an interview at her campaign headquarters here. "Maybe it's our fault for not having made more of it. But if you beat everybody over the head with it constantly, then it sounds as if you're saying people should vote for you just because you're a woman."
While the professorial Ms. Netsch is a far different candidate in many ways than the youthful Ms. Moseley-Braun -- and her sex is but one factor in her campaign -- her conflict over whether to emphasize the fact that she is a woman is emblematic of the conflicts faced by female candidates around the country. The impressive gains by women in 1992 have left a complicated legacy for those running this year; many agree that being a woman is not the advantage it was two years ago and can even be a handicap.
Since the raw anger over the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas -- who was accused of sexually harassing a female colleague -- has subsided, many female candidates say they do not think it helps to emphasize their sex. In a turnabout from two years ago, it is the men who now see the benefit of playing up the sex of their female opponents. Crime rather than the economy has become the central issue in many races, leaving women to suffer from a stereotype that they are not as tough as men on crime.
Even women who were elected to the House in record numbers in 1992 are finding the excitement over their victories short-lived. They are now considered insiders, and most of them are Democrats -- not a sure-fire recipe for victory this November. As a result, more than a third of the 48 female House members are considered endangered.
"We're talking about a year where there is less opportunity, where many of the women elected in 1992 are running for re-election in a much tougher political climate," said Harriett Woods, president of the National Women's Political Caucus who lost two Senate races in Missouri in the 1980's. "There has just been an apathy among all the electorate. Women may suffer from it, but I don't think it's people saying, 'Oh, we aren't going to support women.' "
Another dynamic playing against women, pollsters say, is that voters generally find it easier to vote for a woman for a legislative job like senator rather than an executive post like governor. And this year, as opposed to 1992, there are many more contests for governor.
Here in Illinois, Ms. Netsch has not recovered from a barrage of commercials after the primary in which Mr. Edgar attacked her for opposing the death penalty. At the time, her campaign did not have the money to respond to Mr. Edgar, and her standing in the polls plummeted.
Struggling to climb back, Ms. Netsch's senior aides met with worried party leaders last week and decided to redouble efforts to mobilize women and other groups who historically are reliable Democrats. "Women are demoralized for some reason," Kay Clement, a veteran Chicago political organizer and Ms. Netsch's closest friend, said during a women's luncheon here. "They aren't coming out with the support that they did two years ago."
In other states, women have more hopeful stories to tell. Several have fought off aggressive challenges from male opponents to win primaries. The Democrats waging competitive, if not winning, races for governor include Kathleen Brown in California, Bonnie Campbell in Iowa and Myrth York in Rhode Island. At least three woman are favored to win election to the Senate; Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas; Olympia Snowe, a Maine Republican, and Ann Wynia, a Minnesota Democrat.
Even so, there are as many examples of women who waged vigorous primary campaigns with help from national women's groups but lost to male rivals who in most cases were better financed.
They include these Democrats who were defeated: State Senator Debbie Stabenow, in Michigan's primary for governor; State Senator Lana Pollack, in Michigan's Senate primary; Mary Boyle, a local county commissioner, in Ohio's Senate primary; State Representative Joan Wagnon, in the Kansas primary for governor, and Marsha Murphy, a local county executive, in the Missouri Senate primary.
Lynn Yeakel, who capitalized on the furor directed at Senator Arlen Specter for voting to confirm Mr. Thomas to the Supreme Court and won the Democratic Senate primary in Pennsylvania in 1992, did not even make it past this year's primary for governor.
On the Republican side, Ronna Romney, a former radio talk show host, was edged out in Michigan's Senate primary. "What you find as a woman is that the normal networks just aren't open," Ms. Romney said in an interview on the eve of her primary. "We literally had to create a whole new universe and a whole new finance universe."
Whatever the degree that sex plays in the elections next month, the results will inevitably be compared to 1992. As Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat who was elected two years ago, declared last week at a Los Angeles fund-raising event for Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat: "The entire nation is watching California to see if women are up to the job. If the Year of the Women ended in 1992, what does that mean to our daughters?"
If Ms. Feinstein survives a challenge from a well-financed Republican, Representative Michael Huffington, and Ms. Brown manages to defeat Gov. Pete Wilson, California would be the first state where the top three office-holders are women. The second Senator, Barbara Boxer, is also a Democrat.
While Republicans are too savvy to make any sexist appeals that the state is not ready for three women in control, Ms. Feinstein and Ms. Brown are not going out of their way to emphasize their sex. They seem to be trying to preserve their expected support from women without losing male voters. It is a striking contrast to Ms. Feinstein's failed bid for governor in 1990, when she emphasized the historic prospect of becoming the state's first female governor.
Even with diminished voter turnout this year, Mr. Wilson says Ms. Brown's sex gives her an edge. "There are a certain number of women who avowedly say that they will vote for her because she's a woman, purely because of gender," the Governor said in an interview. "There are certain stereotype prejudices that work for and against men and women."
But another stereotype probably works to Mr. Wilson's benefit: crime. Like Mr. Edgar in Illinois, Mr. Wilson has repeatedly castigated Ms. Brown for her stance against the death penalty -- though both women say they would enforce the law on the books. While his attacks would probably work on male opponents, pollsters say they are all the more effective on women.
As part of the subtle effort to characterize her as an indecisive young girl, some of Ms. Brown's detractors derisively refer to her as "Kathy." "They're trying to diminish her, trivialize her," said Celinda Lake, Ms. Brown's pollster.
Don Sipple, the media consultant for Mr. Edgar, Mr. Wilson and George W. Bush, who is running for governor in Texas against Gov. Ann W. Richards, has created look-alike television commercials in all three states that warn viewers that the Democrats are too easy on crime.
"The ads are intended to show rape or assault and to scare the begolly out of people," Ms. Netsch said. "The message they're trying to convey is, obviously, 'This is going to continue if you elect women.' To suggest to women that somehow they are incapable of dealing with or understanding the importance of violence, it really is insulting."
But it works.
Though it may be too late, Ms. Netsch has begun fighting back with a commercial in which she vows to build more prisons if that would keep criminals off the street.
Mr. Sipple insisted that his commercials would be just as effective against men. "Anybody who gets in and thinks they can play a gender card," he said, "they're wrong."
Still, Susan J. Carroll, a political scientist at Rutgers University and an authority on female candidates, said, "When women have positions they believe, like anti-death penalty, it makes it more difficult to counter the stereotype that they're somehow not tough on crime."
Ms. Richards has had an easier time than Ms. Brown and Ms. Netsch in inoculating herself from attacks on the crime issue because she is for the death penalty and has cultivated a tougher persona. "She not only supports the death penalty," Ms. Netsch said, "but she's gung-ho about it."

HEADLINE: NO REST ON TRADE: IN THE TRENCHES;
Foes Line Up To Do Battle Over GATT

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
An eight-week delay in the Senate vote to ratify a global free trade pact has galvanized a broad range of opponents, who vow an all-out campaign this fall in their uphill fight to stop the 123-nation agreement.
A final vote on the pact, which would cut tariffs around the world and expand the free trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to cover farming and services like accounting, has been delayed until after the November elections. This gives the opposition extra time to organize but may also insulate some senators from public pressure. 
 "If we know anything, Congress is never more sensitive to the public than right before an election, and never less sensitive than right after an election," said Ross Perot, who plans to begin condemning the pact in a nationally syndicated weekly radio talk show starting on Oct. 9.
Other opponents are more optimistic, saying Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat, has done them a big favor by using his power as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee to force a postponement of the Senate vote from next Thursday to Dec. 1.
"We were sure to lose next week -- there is nowhere to go but up," said Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, who opposes the pact.
While nobody is seriously predicting that the pact will be defeated, and while some on Capitol Hill still predict that Senator Hollings will relent and allow a vote in the coming days, nervousness is spreading.
"As the arguments are made pro and con, GATT will pick up more opposition that it has now, but whether it will pick up enough to be meaningful remains to be seen," Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who is involved in a tough battle for re-election, said in a telephone interview from Tennessee. Mr. Sasser said he was taking a "wait and see" position on the pact.
The House is scheduled to vote on Wednesday, but some members are calling for a postponement until after the elections.
The same unusual coalition of labor unions, environmentalists, consumer advocates, populist farmers, conservative Republicans including Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, and liberal religious groups that unsuccessfully fought the North American Free Trade Agreement has reunited against the GATT pact. Their three main objections are that the pact will widen the Federal budget deficit, undermine American sovereignty and weaken American laws intended to protect workers, consumers and the environment.
The pact would eliminate $11 billion in Federal tariff revenues over the next five years, and more after that. The Clinton Administration plans to offset the first five years of losses with a combination of cuts in farm subsidies and various extra fees on businesses.
Mr. Nader and other critics describe the tariff cuts as a giveaway to international corporations. But Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has contended for several weeks that the trade pact will stimulate the American economy, and that the taxes on the extra economic output will more than offset the lost tariffs.
The critics also contend that the World Trade Organization to be established under the pact will be too powerful. Its secret tribunals of trade experts will have the power to authorize countries to impose trade sanctions on nations that raise trade barriers, including environmental, consumer and worker safety laws that may act like trade barriers.
A similar trade tribunal ruled three years ago that the United States could not bar the importation of tuna caught in huge nets that also killed many dolphins. The United States was able to block that tribunal's decision from taking effect because until now GATT has required unanimity among its 123 members to impose sanctions.
But the World Trade Organization will operate under the principle of one country, one vote, with a two-thirds majority able to impose sanctions on any country.
The Clinton Administration has contended that the tribunals should be trusted not to challenge American laws. The Administration won a surprise victory on Friday when a GATT tribunal ruled that the American law requiring certain minimum fuel-efficiency standards for cars was not a trade barrier.
A group of 51 journalists joined the ranks of critics on Sept. 14, sending a letter to President Clinton condemning the trade panels as undemocratic and excessively secretive.
Many critics of the pact accuse the television networks and major newspapers of systematically ignoring them, paying attention now only because President Clinton has begun speaking out in favor of it. "Now we have the opportunity to have this public debate -- we've been hollering a long time," said Larry W. Mitchell, the vice president for government relations at the Denver-based National Farmers Union, a populist group of 253,000.
As politicians try to weigh the costs and benefits of opposing the trade pact, public opinion is hard to judge. Recent polls have shown that more than half the people know nothing about it.
Opposition to the current trade pact suffers from the same fissure that divided the movement against the North American Free Trade Agreement: there are those who are totally opposed to free trade agreements and those who collaborate with the Clinton Administration to make trade pacts less harmful to their constituencies.
The most hard-line opponents are consumer advocates like Mr. Nader and labor unions like the International Union of Electronic Workers that would be hit hardest by import competition. In contrast, the national leadership of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., including Lane Kirkland, the president, and Tom Donahue, the secretary-treasurer, has worked with the Administration and won many concessions.
For instance, the legislation proposed by President Clinton to put the pact into American law would protect some American textile and apparel workers from foreign competition; make fewer tariff reductions than initially planned for imports from poor countries, particularly in the Caribbean, and make it impossible for the Administration to negotiate future free trade agreements unless it received separate permission from Congress.
The labor split was apparent when about 75 men and women, mostly from the International Union of Electronic Workers, protested the pact on Friday in Lafayette Park, across from the White House. In introducing another speaker, Mr. Nader said, "Following him surely will be Lane Kirkland or Tom Donahue from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. They're not here? Oh."
By contrast, business backing for the trade pact is monolithic. The Administration has even won over some industries that have suffered from foreign competition and might be expected to suffer from the pact, like textile producers. The White House wrote into the legislation various side deals to grease the way for passage.
The only noticeable exception is the Washington-based United States Business and Industrial Council, a conservative group of 1,500 mostly family-owned businesses in the Midwest that fear competition from multinational corporations based in New York and abroad. The group plans a series of local radio and television advertisements critical of the pact.
"Our members live in the community," said Kevin L. Kearns, the group's president. "It's not like living in Scarsdale and commuting down to Manhattan and laying off 10,000 people."

HEADLINE: The Year's First Winning Quarter

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Is it time for American investors to pay the piper yet? Not according to the summer's stock market, where results for the third quarter show that comeuppance will have to wait.
Despite only moderate overall gains, the leading stock exchanges provided an even richer field of lucrative stocks from which to pick and choose gingerly. For the first time this year, according to figures compiled by Media General Financial Services, there were more winners than losers, and by a wide margin. 
 Of stocks selling for more than $5 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and on the Nasdaq market, almost three rose in price for every two that fell. That is, out of almost 6,000 stocks, 3,324 advanced, 2,364 declined and 228 remained unchanged.
An elite 2.5 percent of this group were especially sweet. The top 50 gainers on the three leading exchanges appreciated in price between 40 percent and more than 80 percent on the Big Board, between 25 percent and 250 percent on the Amex and between 70 percent and more than 180 percent on Nasdaq.
That compares to an improving record for the overall averages. Despite some jarring bumps along the way, caused mainly by market anxieties about inflation, interest rates and the declining value of the dollar, the Dow Jones industrial average during the period was up about 6 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500 up 4 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index up 8 percent.
By contrast, the first and second quarters were clear losers, battered by the increases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board and the resultant plummeting of the bond market. In the first quarter, only four stocks rose for every seven that fell. The second quarter was not much better: Five stocks rose for every seven that fell.
What will happen in the fourth quarter? Wall Street, as elsewhere, is divided in its outlook. But those with sporting blood have their own predilections.
"The cyclicals were the darlings and the interest-rate-sensitive stocks were the laggards in the quarter," said Bill Allyn, director of listed equity trading at Jefferies & Company, who is optimistic about inflation and interest rates. "The easy money has been made on the cyclicals. I'd like to bet on the laggards for the fourth quarter."
But John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said: "The near-term news has obviously been good news. But that good news is already sowing the seeds of downward pressure in the near future."
Mr. Lipsky sees a slowing but still strong fourth quarter, with a possibly difficult first quarter of 1995, with companies experiencing a noticeable slowdown in earnings growth.
Since the Fed started raising short-term interest rates in February and forced traders to look over their shoulders at its chairman, Alan Greenspan, before buying or selling stocks, investors have been asking one question: When do higher corporate borrowing costs lead to thinner profits and lower stock valuations?
For more than two years, many companies have been including a boilerplate sentence in their quarterly earnings reports that said, in effect, that some portion of profits were due solely to interest-rate savings. Those savings, mainly from refinancing old high-interest debt, do not lift profits as much anymore now that the Fed is tightening.
And whether companies have spent those savings wisely on new factories, new products or more efficient production processes that yield more profit is still not clear. How much old debt, long-term financing bound by restrictive covenants, remains to be refinanced at relatively attractive rates is also unclear.
As much as half of the price of a stock, economists say, reflects investor expectations about future earnings, so the fate of those interest-rate savings is critical. So are Wall Street expectations about current earnings. Easton Ragsdale, chief quantitative analyst for Kidder, Peabody, notes that many stocks spurt in price when companies report earnings that exceed analysts' expectations.
But in a recent study, Mr. Ragsdale's group at Kidder found that analysts tended to be too low in their estimates as the year begins, making it somewhat easier for companies to beat forecasts. As the year progresses, analysts tend to raise their estimates, making it harder to beat forecasts.
If, in third-quarter reports, which will be released in the next few weeks, companies continue to exceed forecasts, it will show the continuing strength of the economy as well as the continuing success of cost-cutting and efforts at increased productivity, Mr. Ragsdale said.
The third-quarter stock gainers were not crowded among a lucky few, although cyclical stocks -- those associated with a growing economy -- were clearly in favor. Industries in the S.& P. 500 that rose in share price between 10 percent and 22 percent during the period included household products, tobacco, broadcast media, gold mining, paper products and machine tools.
By contrast, the losers did tend to concentrate among a few groups, like banks, oil and gas companies and airlines. And among the unluckiest few were the biotechnology concerns underwritten by a luckless brokerage house, D. Blech & Co., whose financial problems helped drag down the stock of those companies it underwrote. D. Blech merged with a healthier firm last month.
On the nation's largest stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, chemical companies and specialized electronics firms were among the top 10 gainers. Four chemical companies, with rising earnings and recommendations by Wall Street analysts, rose sharply. American Cyanamid, whose shares rose on the rumor and then the announcement of a merger into American Home Products, rose 77.7 percent, to $99.50 a share.
But the big gainer on the Big Board was the Whitehall Corporation, whose stock rose 83.1 percent, to $20.38 a share, on a strong 1995 outlook for its mix of specialized electronic gear, like seismic survey and acoustic measurement systems.
Similarly, General Datacomm and Network Equipment rose on expectations that their products would be useful in telecommunications and computer networking. General Datacomm rose 75.1 percent, to $28.25 a share, and Network Equipment rose 68 percent, to $14.50 a share.
Big Board losers tended to be those that reported poor earnings or were associated with the interest-rate-sensitive housing industry. Rhodes Inc. a retailer of home furnishings, fell 39.1 percent, to $9.75 a share. And the biggest decliner was UDC Homes, a builder of retirement homes, which dropped 51.1 percent, to $2.63 a share.
Nasdaq winners tended to be high-technology companies; 6 of the top 10 had something to do with computers. Micrion Inc., for example, makes equipment that tests integrated circuits. Its stock rose 184 percent, to $17.75 a share. Alliance Semiconductor, the 10th-largest gainer, makes random-access-memory chips. Its stock rose 106.8 percent, to $22.75 a share.
Nasdaq losers tended to be high-tech concerns, too. Five of the top 10 were such companies, but 3 of these were associated with D. Blech, the brokerage house. The biggest loser was the NDE Environmental Corporation, a detector of leaks in underground storage systems, which reported continuing losses. It fell 83.3 percent, to $1.25 a share.
The biggest Amex winner was the SFM Corporation, a toy and electric machinery company, whose big earnings rise surprised Wall Street and whose plans for a 4-for-1 stock split pleased investors. SFM rose 250.5 percent, to $32 a share. The biggest Amex loser was Greyhound, whose continuing restructuring did little to revive its stock price. Greyhound fell 70.2 percent, to $1.94 a share.

HEADLINE: Legal Aid Society Plays a Big Role in New York's Courts

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
Unlike most American cities, New York relies heavily on the Legal Aid Society to represent the indigent not just in civil matters, but in criminal cases as well.
The strike by the private nonprofit organization will affect the gamut of cases: everything from criminal prosecutions and appeals to tenant disputes, immigration hearings, child abuse and neglect proceedings, prisoners' rights suits, and unemployment and welfare benefits cases. 
 Courts in most major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, and in states like New Jersey and Connecticut, are not nearly as vulnerable as those in New York to the strain imposed by a strike. They use public defenders to represent the poor in criminal cases; as government employees, public defenders are generally prohibited from striking. Civil cases are handled by a variety of local and Federal legal-services organizations including the Legal Aid Society.
The society was started in 1876, largely to offer services to new German immigrants, including representing them in criminal cases. It rapidly expanded, in large measure because of support from philanthropists like John D. Rockefeller Jr., to take on thousands of civil and criminal cases for the poor. In 1961, acknowledging the importance of the society in the lives of the indigent, New York City contributed about $100,000. Last year it paid the society $79 million just for its work on criminal cases.
By 1966, the society had contracted to become the city's primary defender for the poor. That decision was in response to a 1963 United States Supreme Court ruling, in the case of Gideon v. Wainwright, that insured that indigent defendants were entitled to lawyers.
The society does not handle all cases for indigent defendants, however. In matters involving multiple defendants, conflicts can arise, particularly if defendants want to testify against each other.
So a second tier of representation has sprung up, known as the Assigned Counsel Plan and consisting of private lawyers who charge the city by the hour. They are called upon when such conflicts arise. Considered more experienced than many Legal Aid lawyers, they also handle murder cases.
But after a 1982 strike by Legal Aid Society lawyers that crippled the city's courts for 10 weeks, judges increasingly turned to Assigned Counsel lawyers, who represent defendants in nearly half of the city's felony cases. Their bills were expected to reach $50 million this year.
This summer, in a cost-saving effort, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed to return the bulk of the criminal caseload to the society. That program began scarcely two weeks ago. But with the onset of the strike, Assigned Counsel lawyers will presumably once again pick up thousands of new cases.
During the 1982 Legal Aid strike, the Koch administration commissioned a study of the feasibility of adopting a system of public defenders who would be employed directly by the city and prohibited from striking. The report, written by John F. Keenan, now a Federal judge, found the idea worth considering but advised against switching immediately to such a system from an established organization that the report said was well-qualified to perform its function.

HEADLINE: Mandela Thanks U.N. for Apartheid Fight

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Nelson Mandela addressed the General Assembly today as South Africa's first black President, thanked the United Nations for its help in overcoming apartheid and asked it to make a new commitment to fight poverty.
"It surely must be one of the ironies of the age that this august assembly is addressed for the first time in its 49 years by a South African head of state drawn from among the African majority of what is an African country," Mr. Mandela said. 
 Mr. Mandela's speech seemed aimed less at making a policy statement than at ceremonially declaring the end of apartheid before the group of nations that had made dismantling apartheid one of its main official aims.
Mr. Mandela has addressed the General Assembly and other United Nations groups in the past, but today he became the first South African head of state, black or white, to do so. Before him, the highest ranking South African official to speak to the General Assembly was the Foreign Minister; since 1972 no senior South African official had appeared. The General Assembly stripped South Africa of its credentials as a member state in 1974, only restoring them with the formal dismantling of apartheid.
Mr. Mandela's appearance in the vast chamber clearly had an emotional significance for many of the delegates, who rose and applauded as Mr. Mandela was introduced and again when he finished speaking. Mr. Mandela is to go to Washington on Tuesday for meetings with President Clinton and other Administration officials.
"It is indeed a most welcome thing that this august organization will mark its 50th anniversary next year with the apartheid system having been vanquished and consigned to the past," Mr. Mandela said.
"That historic change has come about not least because of the great efforts in which the U.N. engaged to ensure the suppression of the apartheid crime against humanity.
"The millions of our people say thank you, and thank you again, that the respect for your own dignity as human beings inspired you to act to insure the restoration of our dignity as well."
Today's speakers before the General Assembly also included the Cuban Foreign Minister, Roberto Robaina Gonzalez, who denounced the Security Council for sanctioning the invasion of Haiti by American forces, which he characterized as an illegal effort by powerful nations to control the fate of one of the weaker ones.
"The cannons of the invaders and the boots of the foreign occupants were the ones that installed in Haiti the dictatorships of this century and trained and supported those who are still tyrannizing their people," Mr. Robaina Gonzalez said. "How then can we trust that they will encourage democracy in the future?
"The evils of the third world are not resolved through military occupations, which are just used to serve selfish interests."
Mr. Robaina Gonzalez made only a brief reference to recent talks between Cuba and the United States over the flight of Cubans to the United States. He said the talks, held last month in New York, "led to partial solutions to the already age-old dispute between Cuba and the United States."
It what seemed like a conciliatory remark, he described "the spirit of seriousness and respect that prevailed in these negotiations and the will of finding solutions by both sides." That, he said, "made it possible to conclude an agreement satisfactory for both parties that, if totally fulfilled, will lay the foundations for the normalization of migratory relations between the two countries."
The talks have led to a preliminary agreement by which Washington would accept at least 20,000 Cubans a year; in exchange, the Cubans vowed to patrol their waters to encourage would-be emigrants to use official channels.
The two sides plan to meet next month to evaluate the agreement.
Cuba has made it clear it wants future meetings to get into other areas, especially the United States economic embargo, which Mr. Robaina Gonzalez denounced today as "an action without any legal justification, without moral virtues and without ethical principles."
Washington says the talks should be limited to immigration.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN;
Incumbency Dogs a Popular Governor of Colorado

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DENVER, Oct. 3

 BODY:
In an age when more souls are bared on talk shows than in confessional booths, Bruce Benson, the Republican candidate for governor of Colorado, might have been seeking a sort of electoral hug when he surprised an audience during a debate here last month by revealing that he had been arrested twice for drunken driving in the early 1980's.
His opponent, Gov. Roy Romer, in a rather lame effort to join in the spirit of contrition at the debate, said that he, too, had "a confession to make -- I'm worried about world population and I've had seven children." 
 But now Mr. Benson is having to explain some other embarrassing details about his past, a messy divorce that will put the politics of redemption here to a severe test.
The divorce records, made public last month after a lawsuit brought by a Denver television station, disclosed that Mr. Benson had told his son that he was "going to kill" his former wife, Nancy Benson, a remark that the millionaire oil executive has said was simply a figure of speech.
According to an affidavit in the records, Mrs. Benson said that her husband had "harassed, taunted and threatened" her. The records also disclosed that Mr. Benson had been having an affair, which he admits, for two years before he asked for a divorce last year.
Moreover, women's groups in Colorado have criticized Mr. Benson for contributing $1,000 to the legal defense of Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who has been accused of sexual harassment by about two dozen women.
In a news conference after the disclosures, Mr. Benson said that he regretted saying he would kill his wife, and that having an affair was a mistake. "I've fully admitted the errors of the ways of my life," he said.
Mr. Benson predicted that voters would respect his honesty. "That's a rare quality in a politician," he said.
Given Mr. Romer's popularity during his eight-year tenure -- he grew up on the Colorado plains, and his centrist approach has seemed to fit the temperament of the state -- together with a booming state economy and the problems haunting Mr. Benson, it would seem that the Governor would be coasting toward victory. In 1990, Mr. Romer was re-elected with 64 percent of the vote.
But political analysts say the contest could be tight. A Denver Post poll taken in July, before Mr. Benson's divorce records became public, showed the Governor with a five-point lead, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three points. About 11 percent of voters were undecided.
Governor Romer, analysts say, suffers a stigma that many voters deem worse than drunken driving or marital infidelity: he is an incumbent. He is also a Democrat, and the low popularity ratings of President Clinton have been widely seen as a detriment for Democrats in the Nov. 8 elections.
In a bizarre twist to a campaign that is already unusual, Mr. Romer, riding in an unmarked police car, was pursued by a red Chevrolet at speeds of up to 110 miles per hour on Interstate 25 near Greeley on Saturday. The 20-mile chase, which occurred after the Governor and Mr. Benson took part in a debate at the University of Northern Colorado, ended when the state trooper who was driving the Governor was able to shake the pursuing car. The police are looking for the two occupants of the Chevrolet.
The state police car was assigned to take Mr. Romer to his next stop after the Governor's staff received a suspicious call from someone seeking details of Mr. Romer's schedule, campaign workers said.
Both Mr. Romer and his Republican challenger are seen as centrists, with Mr. Benson a bit more conservative.
In television advertisements, Mr. Benson, a former Republican state chairman, has focused on welfare and crime, and has criticized the Governor for his past support of tax increases. He has also blamed Mr. Romer for his support of the new Denver International Airport, which has been plagued by difficulties and is already more than a year behind schedule.
Mr. Romer has countered that Mr. Benson himself donated money to the campaign to approve the new airport. The Governor has also said he supports changes in the welfare system, but has criticized the Republican plans as Draconian.
On crime, Mr. Romer notes that he called a special session of the Colorado Legislature last year to examine ways to fight crime, and that prison construction during his two terms has been the largest in the state's history.
Rodney Hero, a political scientist at the University of Colorado in Boulder, said the Republicans would have a difficult time portraying Mr. Romer as a liberal.
But he said Mr. Benson, who built a fortune in the oil industry, could benefit from a sense among voters that "can-do business barons" are better suited to solve the problems of government than politicians.
Mr. Romer will be most vulnerable, Mr. Hero said, because he is an incumbent. "After a while in office," he said, "you've made as many enemies as friends."

GOVERNOR'S RACE
 
DEMOCRAT: Roy Romer, 65, two-term incumbent
REPUBLICAN: Bruce Benson, 56, oil executive
 
ANALYSIS
Mr. Romer, a centrist with roots in rural Colorado and a style that has always been successful among working-class voters as well as Denver liberals, could be damaged by an anti-incumbency mood. Mr. Benson, an amiable businessman from the moderate wing of the Republican Party, has been embarrassed by incidents in his past: drunken driving convictions and a bitter divorce.
 
LATEST POLL
A survey by the Denver Post/KCNC TV from July 14 showed Mr. Romer with 47 percent; Mr. Benson with 42 percent; and 11 percent undecided. Margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.

HEADLINE: Sister Mary Margaret Johanning; Lecturer and Consultant Was 57

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Sister Mary Margaret Johanning, a lecturer and consultant on theological affairs and the former international community leader of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, died on Saturday at St. Marys Health Center in Jefferson City, Mo. She was 57 and lived at St. Peter's Convent in Jefferson City.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Jefferson City said. 
 Sister Mary Margaret was elected to the Provincial Council of the School Sisters of Notre Dame in St. Louis in 1971 and served as the international leader in Rome from 1977 to 1987. In that position, she led the community through a revision of its constitution, enabling the nuns to expand on their roles as teachers in Catholic schools to add a variety of activities, including parish ministry. The order has 7,500 women serving in 35 countries.
In 1989, Sister Mary Margaret became Chancellor of the Jefferson City diocese, a position reached by only a few women in the Catholic Church in the United States. As such, she served as Bishop Michael F. McAuliffe's principal administrator for 87 parishes and their 37 parochial schools.
She held the title of Chancellor at her death and was on leave from that position. She also directed the planning commission of the diocese and the office of leadership services. As of the end of 1993, the diocese counted 87,000 parishioners.
Sister Mary Margaret, a native of Glasgow, Mo., was an economics graduate of Notre Dame College in St. Louis. She earned a master's degree in theology and a doctorate in religious studies at Marquette University in Milwaukee.
Beginning in 1962 as an elementary school teacher in a St. Louis parochial school, she was soon lecturing widely at workshops and retreats in the United States and abroad. Before her election to the Provincial Council in St. Louis, she was an instructor in theology at her alma mater, Notre Dame College.
She entered the Congregation of the School Sisters of Notre Dame in 1958 and professed her final vows in 1966.
Sister Mary Margaret is survived by her parents, Bernard and Gertrude Johanning of Glasgow; four brothers, Jerome, of Mound, Minn., Myrl, of Shawnee, Kan., Bob, of Glasgow, and Don, of Sturgeon, Mo., and two sisters, Joetta Jones of Jasper, Ind., and Cindy Monnig of Jefferson City.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Cuomo: Warning of Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:

CANDIDATE Mario M. Cuomo
 
 PRODUCER The Garth Group, New York City 
 VISUAL The words spoken by the announcer scroll up the screen in yellow letters, interrupted only by a picture of an editorial from the Buffalo News, titled: "In Season of Big Promises, Beware of Rosy Tax Cut Plans."
 
 SCRIPT Announcer: "Do you think raising local property and school taxes is a good idea? George Pataki does. But Governor Cuomo and local officials across the state don't. Financial experts are calling George Pataki's plan a disaster. Felix Rohatyn, a member of President Reagan's economic commission, said the plan would devastate the state's finances. And mayors are warning about cuts in state aid to schools and higher property taxes. When Republicans named George say read my lips, it's politics as usual all over again."
 
 ACCURACY The Cuomo campaign's assertion that Mr. Pataki thinks raising local property and school taxes is "a good idea" may be the most outrageous claim in any ad in this year's campaign, and that's saying something. Mr. Pataki, of course, has never said such a thing. Instead, Mr. Cuomo has taken one possible effect of Mr. Pataki's proposed income tax cut -- an increase in local property taxes -- and attributed it to the Republican candidate as intent.
 
 It is true that some financial experts believe that Mr. Pataki's tax plan is based on overly optimistic assumptions about economic growth and that Mr. Pataki has not explained how he would compensate for lost revenues. Mr. Rohatyn, however, is hardly objective. He is a longtime Cuomo ally, whom the Governor appointed as chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation. The "read my lips" quip, while clever, is somewhat disingenuous, given that Mr. Cuomo is also promising tax cuts, albeit less ambitious ones.
 
 SCORECARD Mr. Cuomo watched a political novice, Christine Todd Whitman, get elected Governor of New Jersey last year because she promised massive tax cuts, and he is determined to make sure that history is not repeated in New York. The key to success is to attack Mr. Pataki's credibility, to dismiss his plan as pie-in-the-sky that bears little relationship to fiscal reality. It is a sophisticated argument to make to an electorate that does not always examine such issues in depth, but Mr. Pataki has given the Governor an opening by proposing half a plan that trumpets the good news while suppressing the bad.

HEADLINE: A Sound Japanese Trade Pact

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has negotiated a good trade agreement with the Japanese that should benefit both countries. By opening up Japanese markets for insurance, telecommunications and medical equipment, the accord will bring lower prices to Japan and higher sales to the U.S. The U.S. backed down from benighted demands that numerical targets be set for imports into Japan -- and seems willing to turn down the rhetoric that has needlessly inflamed trade disputes.
The economic impact of the accord will be small -- boosting Japanese imports by less than $2 billion, by one estimate, only some of which will come from U.S. companies. Nor is the agreement novel; in hammering hard at blatantly protectionist rules and regulations in Japan, it mirrors accords that previous Administrations struck on computers and farm goods. 
 The Japanese Government did not, to its credit, agree to numerical targets for imports. Applied to insurance and other markets, numerical targets would require Tokyo to ride herd over private companies, which would run counter to the deregulatory approach the United States advocates for Japan. Japan did agree to a "substantial increase" in government purchases of equipment. But even here, the language is murky. The Japanese will say the pledge is a goal; Washington will call it a commitment. The fudge could lead to endless squabbling.
Left unresolved is a dispute over automobiles and auto parts, which account for two-thirds of the bilateral trade deficit. The U.S. triggered a negotiating process over auto parts that will last perhaps 12 months and could culminate with sanctions. The best U.S. strategy would be continuing to focus on unfair government rules, such as discriminatory safety inspections of American-made parts, and use international dispute panels, not unilateral sanctions, to resolve disagreements.
The Clinton Administration has achieved a useful trade accord by focusing on market barriers. It will help both countries and preserve the U.S. commitment to international rules of fair play.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Hunt Them Down

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
When a nation sets out to persecute a segment of its population, to hound them down, mark them, deprive them of the human care it gives to others, tells them they cannot work to earn their bread, that nation takes a large step toward persecuting other groups who live within its borders. It follows as blood the wound.
In dictatorships, the first persecution is carried out by command, in full knowledge that other groups are on the list. 
 In democratic countries, the first persecution is usually the result of generalized public anxiety and uncertainty, manipulated and deepened by politicians who scavenge and batten on antagonism within society.
The antagonism becomes a political movement in itself, frightening into silence politicians who are aware of the dangers of the acceptance of any persecution of any group but willing to push that into the back of their minds.
All this is taking place in America -- the anxieties being directed against a small slice of the population, the heightening by political propagandists, the submission of the political center.
The target is the residents of the U.S. who have come to this country in search of work or refuge without securing admission papers -- the 3.2 million people called "illegal aliens" or "undocumented immigrants." Usage depends on whether you despise them or can muster up some memory of America's debt to the paperless.
Americans suffering from jumpy nerves about immigrants should demand that Washington spend more billions of their tax money to make the borders tighter, knowing total tight is impossible. And it is in democratic order for the Government to use its legal powers to deport illegals.
But it is not in democratic order for politicians to spread falsehoods about the the economic "burden" of immigrants, legal and illegal, to use clubs of fear to drive out immigrants, or to saddle the country with immigrant-hunting computer banks and work licenses that will cut away at every American's liberty.
Immigration, legal and illegal figured in, adds up to an economic boon to America. The estimate of the Urban Institute in Washington is that they contribute $25 to $30 billion more money in taxes and jobs than social benefits paid out.
Benefits. On the West Coast, there is lots of political noise about removing them from illegals, to drive them out. Mean-spirited referendum items may pass but they will bring little economic benefit. The truth is that the dreaded benefit-swilling illegals now receive little more than the schooling for children upheld by the Supreme Court and emergency medical help.
And now, an immigration "reform" commission appointed by the Clinton Administration calls for a nationwide computer bank that would grant or withhold the permission to work. Every job applicant, immigrant, naturalized or native-born, would have to be computer-cleared as a legal resident of the U.S. fit for a work license.
Lovely. Tomorrow, the Government could ask the computer to hunt down every person who broke a law, had a bad credit rating or ever had a contagious disease to see whether he should be permitted to work. Will Americans really stand for this?
While we think it over, the "anti-illegals" crowd is moving against its next target: immigration itself, the concept of America as a haven for refugees and a place of economic hope for some of those who stupidly failed to be born in America.
The anti's are so strong that many Republican and Democratic politicians who are opposed to them just keep quiet. As antidote, I give you two quotations.
One is from Mario Cuomo, Governor of New York. "I love immigrants," he said. "Legal, illegal -- they are not to be despised."
And this is from New York City's Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani.
"If you come here and you work hard and you happen to be in an undocumented status, you are one of the people who we want in this city. You are somebody that we want to protect and we want you to get out from under what is often the life of being like a fugitive, which is really unfair."
One of them is a Democrat and the other Republican. But when it comes to understanding America's roots and the dangers to them, you can't tell these fellows apart -- my happy thought for the day.

HEADLINE: Neighborhood Grocers, Not Big National Chains, Need Support

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your Sept. 22 article and Sept. 24 editorial about an effort to build a Pathmark supermarket in East Harlem: A subsidized superstore in East Harlem is neither needed nor wanted by residents and merchants. There are more than 15 supermarkets in this low-income community. They are not "overpriced" or "understocked" bodegas. They occupy the same buildings that were abandoned by the chains that fled with the urban disorders of the 1960's. 
 When the chains abandoned neighborhoods like Harlem, East Harlem, Jamaica and the South Bronx a retail desert was created. Offices closed, bank branches moved elsewhere. The only retailers willing to come into these neglected areas were Dominican supermarket owners and Korean greengrocers.
You repeat the canard that food prices are confiscatory at neighbor
hood markets. The New York City Human Resources Administration publishes a "Diets and Dollars" newsletter that surveys grocery prices in eight city neighborhoods. These surveys demonstrate that independent neighborhood supermarkets compete with (and undersell) the supermarket chains.
The New York Economic Development Corporation found in a marketing study commissioned early in the Pathmark project that 89 percent of community residents surveyed were satisfied with their supermarkets.
This project is disgraceful. Charitable money and municipal tax abatements are being used to subsidize an $8 billion corporation.
There are 1,000 independent supermarkets in New York City, whose owners have invested in our poorest neighborhoods. City officials need to recognize and encourage this kind of organic growth. We should not subsidize out-of-towners to do what local retailers can do very well themselves.

HEADLINE: Long-Term Rates Highest in 2 Years

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates rose yesterday to their highest levels in more than two years as fresh evidence of economic strength and rising inflation reverberated through the bond market.
By late in the day, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/32 , to 95, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.85 percent, from 7.81 percent on Friday. It is the highest yield on a 30-year bond since June 1992, when yields were at 7.87 percent. 
 Traders of short-term Treasury securities, betting that the recent spate of strong economic reports will force the Federal Reserve Board to increase the overnight Federal funds rate again soon, also responded by pushing up short-term rates. Rates on new three-month and six-month Treasury bills auctioned yesterday rose to their highest levels in three years.
The rise in rates, which traders said came on low volume, was attributed to the results of a monthly survey on the nation's purchasing managers.
For credit market participants, who dote on data that show the economy is growing at a moderate, noninflationary pace, the numbers in September's survey of the nation's purchasing managers did not make for reassuring reading.
The survey, which is issued the first business day of each month, showed not only that the manufacturing sector was booming last month, but also that factory costs, reflected in the prices purchasing managers paid for their goods, rose to their highest level in six years during September.
"The manufacturing sector is rolling along at a pretty good clip, and is not slowing down to a sustainable rate," despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve so far this year, said Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at BA Securities Inc.
Equally sobering, analysts and economists said, was a rise in the employment component of the survey to its highest level since December 1988.
"The employment component left people feeling pretty confident that we are going to get a pretty good increase" when the Labor Department issues its September employment report on Friday, said Dana Johnson, head of capital markets research at First Chicago Capital Markets.
Most Wall Street economists are forecasting that the report will show that payroll employment increased by 250,000 to 275,000 last month.
With the employment report ahead, a number of market participants said results of the purchasing managers' survey convinced them that the Fed would move soon to lift rates. But they said they were equally convinced that the next Fed move would not be the last.
"Securities like two-year and five-year notes are priced to reflect as much as another half-a-point increase in the funds rate," said Dan Callahan, a managing director in charge of Government securities trading at Paine Webber. "But the Fed is going to have to shift from a neutral policy stance to a restrictive one to slow the economy down, and 50 basis points is only the first leg on the way to a restrictive monetary policy." A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 1/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price of 979/32 late yesterday, down 10/32 , to yield 7.64 percent.
The 7 1/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 1/8, down 9/32 , to yield 7.33 percent. And the 6 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered at 9923/32 , down 1/8 of a point, to yield 6.65 percent.
At the Treasury's weekly bill auction, the new three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 4.92 percent, up from last week's average of 4.79 percent. It is the bills' highest rate since Oct. 28, 1991, when the average was 4.99 percent. Six-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.38 percent, up from 5.22 percent last week. It is the bills' highest rate since Sept. 3, 1991, when the average was 5.39 percent.
The selloff in the Treasury securities market spilled over into the secondary markets for corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds.
Traders said prices of some municipal issues were off as much as a quarter to a half point. Actively traded corporate issues fell by a similar amount, traders said.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.756	97.280	Discounted Rate	4.92%	5.38%	Coupon Yield	5.05%	5.61%	High Price	98.779	97.385	Discounted Rate	4.87%	5.37%	Coupon Yield	5.00%	5.60%	Low Price	98.756	97.280	Discounted Rate	4.92%	5.38%	Coupon Yield	5.05%	5.38%	Accepted at low price	47%	95%	Total applied for	$46,011,018	$44,814,877	Accepted	$12,458,153	$12,415,014	Noncompetitive	$1,514,412	$1,358,423A	
 
Both issues are dated Oct. 6, 1994. The three-month bills mature on Jan. 5, 1995, and the six-month bills mature on April 6, 1995.

HEADLINE: Confidence In South Africa Debt

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
South Africa won a long-sought prize from Wall Street yesterday: an investment-grade rating from a major credit-rating agency that is certain to make it less costly for the country to borrow money to build roads, provide electricity and create jobs for millions of poor black citizens.
Moody's Investor's Service, one of the two major firms that judge the ability of corporations and governments to pay back what they owe, awarded South Africa a rating just above subinvestment, or junk bond, status. 
 But the second major rating agency, Standard & Poor's, gave South Africa a rating just below investment grade, in part because the agency said it wanted more time to evaluate the changes in South Africa. Still, the firm indicated that the rating could be raised to investment grade in the next few years.
The rating actions come as President Nelson Mandela of South Africa is in the United States on a visit aimed in part at encouraging investment in his country. Mr. Mandela took office in May, decisively ending the era of apartheid.
Even though South Africa got a split rating from the two agencies, that leaves it in a position comparable to that of several countries that have been struggling politically and economically. Mexico, for example, has a split rating, even after its substantial efforts to open markets.
Under the previous all-white Government, South Africa's debt was unrated, and for years the nation was unable to borrow money at interest rates it could afford. Many international investors, like pension funds and mutual funds, will not buy securities of companies or governments that do not have investment-grade ratings.
Now, South Africa can draw on the vast international capital markets by issuing bonds and other debt, enabling it to borrow more money for longer periods of time than it could get in loans from banks.
South Africa has not put a price tag on its program of reconstruction and development, but during the next decade, the cost may total billions of dollars, analysts say.
Split ratings by Moody's and Standard & Poor's are not unusual. Of 43 countries rated by both firms, 20 have split ratings, including Sweden and New Zealand.
But the split rating will have market consequences by tempting some potential bond buyers to use the lower rating to demand higher interest rates when South Africa issues debt. In the end, the markets will determine which agency was right.
A smaller rating firm, IBCA of London, gave a subinvestment grade rating to South Africa less than two weeks ago. The firm, which did not have access to South African officials or special Government data, cited the nation's challenge of managing "high black expectations of improving living standards even though its own budget deficit is too high."
Moody's gave South Africa its minimum investment-grade rating of Baa3 yesterday, while Standard & Poor's assigned a rating of BB, two notches below investment grade. S.& P.'s rating, however, was accompanied by the notation "with a positive outlook," meaning the rating could be raised in one to three years.
No South African corporation or governmental unit can claim a higher rating than what the firms have assigned to the country.
The ratings should help the nation financially, but South Africa will still have to pay millions of dollars more in interest charges than more creditworthy issuers do. The United States, for example, with the top AAA rating, might pay an interest rate of 7.3 percent for a five-year Treasury note, while South Africa might have to pay 8.8 percent, based on the Moody's rating. Under the S.& P. rating, South Africa might have to pay 9.3 percent or more. Market conditions could force even higher charges.
In South Africa, Chris Liebenberg, the Minister of Finance, said the Government was pleased with what happened. He said both ratings firms had shown confidence in "the coherence of the economic policies and political stability brought to the country by the new Government of national unity."
The Moody's Baa3 rating puts South Africa on a par with Indonesia and Greece and above Hungary, but below Chile. On the S.& P. scale, only South Africa has a BB, which sets it above Argentina and the Philippines but below Uruguay and Mexico.
S.& P.'s "positive outlook" is a hard-won notation for a country. In July 1992, Mexico, one of the fastest-growing countries in Latin America and one praised by Western investors for its market orientation, received a BB+ "with a stable outlook," meaning that S.& P. did not plan to change the rating anytime soon. It was only in November 1993 that Mexico got a "positive outlook," offering the prospect of an eventual change in rating.
For Goldman, Sachs & Company, South Africa's investment adviser, yesterday's ratings bring to a close an extensive process that began in July and involved the preparation of 150 pages of data on economic, political and social trends in the country. Officials of Moody's and S.& P. visited South Africa for a week on separate trips, talking to 25 to 30 prominent South Africans both inside and outside the Government.
Guido E. Cipriani, the senior analyst for S.& P. overseeing the South Africa review, described the process as thorough and hardheaded. "There are no right answers for the questions we ask a country," Mr. Cipriani said. "We essentially want to know how a government would manage in a crisis. O.K., how would you handle an oil shock? What happens if Mandela dies? We want to hear the cogency of their analysis. Whether we buy it or not is another matter."
Richard B. Davis, a former head of corporate ratings at Moody's from 1973 to 1979, helped lead a Goldman, Sachs team of bankers that prepared South African officials for their presentations to the agencies. Mr. Davis, who helped pioneer the rating of "sovereigns," or countries, at Moody's, said the task was aided by the careful record-keeping of officials in South Africa.
Carlos Cordeiro, a Goldman, Sachs partner in London with responsibility for Europe and Africa, described the work as "exhilarating" and inspiring. "A country that did not exist six months ago in its present form," he said, "has won an investment-grade rating only four months into a new administration."

Mandela Seeks Investors
 Nelson Mandela urged United States investors last night to accelerate their participation in South Africa, saying that a partnership with foreign investors would play a "central and valuable" role in the economic development of his country.
In a speech to the National Foreign Trade Council, a nonprofit organization that promotes international trade and investment by American companies, at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, Mr. Mandela, the President of South Africa, said it had been three years since investors were encouraged to prepare to enter the democratic South Africa.
"The conditions are now ripe for practical work to start," he said. "We do appreciate that many companies have already taken major steps in this direction, and we urge that this should be accelerated.
"This is not to say that foreign investments on their own will solve our economic problems," he added. "They will, however, play a central and valuable role in our economic development."
Mr. Mandela said the country was not engaging in "special pleading. That is why I speak of a partnership, to signify a relationship of mutual benefit."
Mr. Mandela said he would work to create a stable and predictable policy and regulatory framework that promoted investment, reduced protectionism, and increased investment opportunities for all.

HEADLINE: A G.M. Test of Productivity: Making Parts 24 Hours a Day

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Two General Motors components plants in the Midwest are operating round the clock seven days a week as part of a broad effort to wring greater productivity from the company's high-cost workers, a G.M. executive said today.
The highly unusual pace of production, a one-year experiment, is proving efficient, the executive said, and G.M. may put other plants on similar schedules as it hunts for ways to increase capacity on the cheap. 
 "We're heading in that direction," said J. T. Battenberg 3d, president of G.M.'s parts-making subsidiary, who was here to discuss his worldwide operations at the Paris Auto Show. "We're expecting our facilities to work harder than they ever have before."
Just Friday, G.M. agreed to hire more than 500 workers represented by the United Automobile Workers union at a plant complex in Flint, Mich. But today Mr. Battenberg had harsh words for the union's pay scale, saying his operations had hired no workers represented by the U.A.W. for at least six years, and had no plans to hire any.
"We have not hired U.A.W.," he said. "It just isn't economically feasible." Workers at the two Midwestern plants, operated by G.M.'s Packard Electric division, are represented by the International Union of Electric Workers, which has been more willing to meet G.M.'s wage and scheduling demands.
At the two plants in Warren, Ohio, about 600 people have been working in four crews, putting in 12-hour shifts for three days in a row with three days off. The plants make plastic moldings and copper cable for wiring harnesses. The work schedule has been in place for about nine months.
Mr. Battenberg said his operations had been driving down their labor costs by shifting U.A.W. workers into capital-intensive factories while hiring non-U.A.W. workers for labor-intensive work. In addition, establishing more flexible work arrangements in some U.A.W. plants, like multi-crew operations that keep production going through the weekend, could make them competitive even at high wages, he said.
Mr. Battenberg said that about 38 percent of the parts-making subsidiary's 178,000 hourly workers worldwide were paid top U.A.W.-level wages of about $44 an hour, including benefits. Several years ago, he said, up to 70 percent were. The average wage in the subsidiary, he said, is about $24.50 an hour. But Mr. Battenberg said he was now hiring workers for a new wiring and electronics plant in Alabama at only $8.50 an hour, including benefits.
The lower wages reflect the success that the subsidiary, known as the Automotive Components Group, has had bargaining contracts with unions that represent rubber and electrical workers, rather than with the U.A.W. The trend presents a dilemma for U.A.W. leaders, who would like to shore up their membership roles but would alienate many members if they agreed to reduced wage scales.
Mr. Battenberg also said the components group's business with companies besides G.M. was growing more than 10 percent a year and was on track to reach 30 percent of total sales by 1996. The group had $25.1 billion in revenue in 1993, 25 percent of which came from outside G.M.
The parts-making operations have been trying to increase their outside business to 50 percent by 2002, to insure that they are competitive in costs and technology with other suppliers.
Mr. Battenberg said he had sold $3 billion worth of uncompetitive businesses since 1992, and was negotiating to sell one more operation, Magnequench, which makes magnets. Mr. Battenberg said that his target was to sell $3.5 billion worth of businesses, but that he might sell more.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mostly Lower, but Dow Gains 3.70

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks were mostly lower yesterday after a report by the nation's purchasing managers showed that manufacturing activity in September was stronger than expected. Blue chips showed a gain, but the broader market declined.
The purchasers' report bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve would act soon to raise interest rates for the sixth time this year to cool inflation. 
 "We've had the view the economy is too strong for the Fed, and this report confirms that view," said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at CS First Boston.
Todd Clark, senior director in equity trading at Mabon Securities, said, "We're getting right back to the earnings-versus-rates argument." Stocks didn't fall more because the strength in factory output bodes well for manufacturers' earnings, he said.
That expectation helped the Dow Jones industrial average eke out a gain of 3.70 to close at 3,846.89, after falling as much as 17.16 earlier in the day. Alcoa and Goodyear led the advance. Alcoa gained 1 1/8, to 85 7/8, and Goodyear rose 1 1/8, to 34 1/2.
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported yesterday that its manufacturing index, a barometer of activity in the nation's factories, climbed to 58.2 in September from 56.2 in August. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing.
"This report would be good for names like Alcoa and Goodyear," Mr. Clark of Mabon Securities said. "With the N.A.P.M. index as high as it is, people are thinking the deeper cyclical companies are going to report impressive earnings."
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 0.97 to 461.74. The index gained as much as 0.60 initially, then fell as much as 2.38 after the purchasers' report. The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.35, to 458.46. The Nasdaq Composite Index, led by Intel, declined 3.41, to 760.88.
Semiconductors paced today's retreat after a profit warning from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. The stock slid 3 1/4, to 26 1/2, in active trading after the company told analysts that microprocessor price cuts could hurt fourth-quarter earnings. Intel dropped 1 1/4, to 60 1/4; Micron Technology slumped 2 1/8, to 32 3/8, and Texas Instruments Inc. fell 2 1/2, to 65 1/2.
Declining stocks on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 1,351 against 841 gainers. Trading was moderate, with about 278.4 million shares changing hands on the Big Board.
Stock investors may grow more concerned if the strength of the purchasing managers' index, one of several economic reports this week, is echoed by the report scheduled for Friday on September employment. The report is expected by many economists to show that the economy added 250,000 jobs last month, up from 179,000 in August.
Care Network rocketed 13 1/8, to 24, after Humana offered to acquire the company for $123 million, or $25.25 a share.
Healthsource jumped 1 1/2, to 37. The health maintenance organization was rated intermediate-term "above average" and long-term "buy" in new coverage by an analyst at Merrill Lynch, Lucy Olwell.
Oxford Health Plans Inc. rose 1 1/2, to 78 1/2. New York State insurance regulators granted the company's requested 8 percent average rate increase on some contracts.
Purolator Products soared 6 5/8, to 24 5/8. Mark IV Industries, which owns 4.7 percent of the automotive-filter maker, agreed to buy the rest for $25 a share, or $264 million.
Brilliance China Automotive Holdings slumped 3, to 13. The mini-bus maker said first-half profit fell to 22 cents a share from 50 cents a year ago.
Information America vaulted 1 7/8, to 5 3/4. The information services company received a $6-a-share takeover offer from West Publishing.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Lifted by Trade Pact, But Bond Selloff Curbs Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended with modest gains against most other leading currencies yesterday as a rally from a trade agreement between the United States and Japan was blunted by a selloff in the American bond market.
The currency market cheered the trade accord between the United States and Japan, which was announced on Saturday. In trading in Asia, the dollar jumped nearly a full yen. In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 99.57 yen, up from 99.15 yen on Friday. 
 While the compromise trade deal is not expected to reduce significantly the trade imbalance between the two countries, a key factor behind the dollar's steady decline, it sets the stage for more talks and removed the immediate threat of United States sanctions against Japan.
But the dollar's advance stalled in early trading in the United States after Treasury bond prices dropped following a National Association of Purchasing Management report indicating a surge in American manufacturing last month and higher inflation at the producer level.
"The inflationary signals irked the bond market," said Stephen Flanagan, a Paine Webber vice president. "The dollar is going to have a tough time rallying no matter what the news is when bond prices are off."
Currency dealers have been following American asset markets to gauge demand from foreign investors for dollars.
Also blunting the dollar's advance beyond the key 100-yen level, market participants said, was heavy selling by Japanese manufacturers, which hold abundant stocks of the dollar generated by their exports.
"They don't care about what's going on in the trade talks," said Koichi Takenaka, a vice president at the Industrial Bank of Japan in New York, adding that these companies have fixed their internal budgets at 100 yen to the dollar. "They think the dollar still faces risks to the downside."
Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst for Smith Barney, said that many American and European traders had concluded by late last week that there would be a trade agreement and adjusted their positions accordingly.
In other currency trading in New York yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5543 German marks, from 1.5518 marks on Friday, and rose to 1.2930 Swiss francs, from 1.2880 francs on Friday. The British pound was quoted at $1.5788, up from $1.5765 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Smaller Asian Markets Did Well in 3d Quarter

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

 BODY:
After favoring Japanese stocks early in the year, international investors moved toward other Asian markets in the third quarter. Markets were tepid in Europe, but strong in Latin America.
"It's sort of a reversal of what happened in the first quarter," said Steven Nagourney, chief global strategist at Lehman Brothers. "We're moving into a new paradigm here." 
 Investors sent Japanese stocks down 5.53 percent, the worst performance on any major market in the quarter. Concern about the yen, together with unusually high stock prices -- the average price-to-earnings ratio hovered between 70 and 80 times earnings -- contributed to the decline, Mr. Nagourney said.
Smaller markets in Asia picked up the slack. Three of them were among the world's five best performers: Malaysian stocks rose 18.49 percent, leading all major markets; Hong Kong stocks increased 9.98 percent, and shares in Singapore were up 9.74 percent.
"Money in Asia is staying there," Mr. Nagourney said. "You're just getting a shift into emerging markets."
Yet other analysts said that Japan's slip might have been inevitable after two strong quarters. The third-quarter decline in Japanese stocks followed a 28 percent rise in the first half of the year when measured in dollar terms, reflecting both stock prices and the increase in the exchange value of the yen.
William Wendler, a vice president at Rowe Price Fleming International, a unit of T. Rowe Price managing international funds, said his company remained bullish on Japan, expecting economic and political stability to spur a new rise in stocks in coming quarters.
"The market is still expensive," Mr. Wendler acknowledged. "But we definitely see the economy in recovery. You see it in private construction, car sales and even in retail sales."
By contrast, European markets were slack in the third quarter, and look as if they may remain so in the last three months of 1994. With the exception of Finland, a tiny market that rose more than 14 percent, most European markets grew marginally.
German stocks dropped 1.23 percent, French issues lost 0.61 percent, and British equities rose 3.28 percent.
"The equity market at the moment looks sort of O.K.," said Tim Brown, British strategist at UBS Phillips & Drew International in London, echoing the ho-hum attitude shared by many analysts. "I don't expect it to look significantly different a year from now."
A brighter picture has emerged in Latin America, where stocks grew strongly. Mexican stocks jumped 18.48 percent.
Geoffrey Dennis, emerging-markets research chief at Bear, Stearns & Company, said that the upswing was built on market gains in the United States, and on favorable economic and political news in much of the region.
"Once investors feel comfortable about the U.S., they tend to quickly look overseas for a growth kicker," Mr. Dennis said. "Forgetting very quickly, of course, what happened earlier this year."
When concern about stocks in the United States led to some drops in February and March, Mr. Dennis recalled, emerging markets fell sharply.
He expressed concern over the assassination in Mexico last Wednesday of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary general of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, the second prominent victim of political assassination there this year. But he thought that Mexico's political situation was probably stable enough to support continued market gains in the coming year.
Mexican stocks rose most sharply in August, Mr. Dennis said, after the nation's second-quarter growth was reported at 3.8 percent, well above the expectations of local and international analysts.
"We've lightened up on our forecast in Mexico," said Mr. Dennis, who now predicts a 10 percent gain in stocks there by the end of the year. His favorite Latin American markets are those of Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Mexico, in that order.

HEADLINE: Volvo, on a Rebound, Faces a Survival Test

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GOTEBORG, Sweden

 BODY:
Given their reputation for durability, the boxy station wagons and sedans rolling off the Volvo Group's production lines here these days may well be shuttling suburban families and other loyal buyers reliably around for many years, even decades to come.
The question now is whether Volvo itself can last as long. 
 Despite a recent surge in sales and profits driven by economic recovery in its three largest markets -- the United States, Britain and its home base of Sweden -- Volvo is facing the stiffest test yet of its ability to survive as an independent company.
As one of the smallest of the major car manufacturers, and as one of the few not to have been snapped up by another auto maker in the frenzy of consolidation that has swept the European industry in recent years, Volvo increasingly risks being run down by giant competitors in Europe, the United States and Asia.
Still, Volvo seems determined to go it alone. Late last year, the company aborted a planned merger of its car and truck operations with Renault S.A. of France, complaining that Volvo's financial and strategic interests would not be well served by the deal. Although it continues to work with the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation of Japan in developing a small car, Volvo is betting that it can muster on its own the efficiency and financial strength it will need to control its destiny.
To help it do so, a new management team under Soren Gyll, who took over as chief executive after leading a successful board-room revolt against the Renault deal, has abandoned the elaborate diversification strategy championed by his predecessor, Pehr Gyllenhammar, and is paring the company back to almost nothing but its car and truck operations.
By selling Volvo's extensive interests in pharmaceuticals, food and other industries, whose proceeds could total $5 billion over three or four years, Mr. Gyll plans to reduce debt and finance development of new vehicles. At the same time, he is pushing to cut costs further, speed up product development and protect the brand's image as a paragon of safety and reliability.
"A lot of people have questioned our ability to survive," Mr. Gyll said. "So people are working very hard. It's the Volvo spirit. We are small but we will show everyone that we are good."
Volvo, however, is far from assured of making it on its own. It sells only two lines of cars worldwide, the big, sturdy 900 series and the slightly sportier 850, plus a line of smaller cars, the 400 series, that is not sold in the United States.
Because Volvo sells relatively few cars -- 311,800 last year, or less than 1 percent of the world market -- it can afford to develop new cars only at widely spaced intervals, meaning that each model must not only be successful, but also be successful for years longer than competing models. Its last entirely new model, the 850, was introduced in 1991.
Despite big improvements, Volvo remains saddled with high costs. It takes about 47 hours of labor to produce a car here, down from around 70 hours in the late 1980's but still behind the 20 hours or so needed by Japanese auto makers. Volvo also produces cars in Ghent, Belgium, where productivity is higher, and in Born, the Netherlands, the site of its small-car venture.
Moreover, Volvo's leadership in automotive safety, reliability and environmental friendliness -- the attributes that have made Volvo so strong in the affluent family market -- is under attack from a wide range of rival auto makers that can make valid claims to improved safety and durability.
While Volvo can make it on its own for the medium term, said John Lindquist, a senior vice president at the Boston Consulting Group in London, "there is an issue for the longer term."
"If they cannot maintain their differentiation in the marketplace, if they cannot maintain cost competitiveness and get much better at development, then they'll be forced into joining up with someone," he said. "If they can do all those things and make careful alliances with producers for key components, then they can probably get by. But it's a tall order."
Volvo executives acknowledged that they could not afford any missteps, especially when it came to developing new cars. The expensive process typically runs into the billions of dollars.
"We are small," Mr. Gyll said. "Each product has to be good. The pressure on the organization is tremendous."
Despite the failed merger with Renault, Volvo is pressing ahead not only with the small-car project with Mitsubishi but also with plans to add to its high-end product lineup, he said. The new small car will replace Volvo's current 400 series.
Although he declined to provide any details about the higher-end cars, Mr. Gyll said Volvo wanted to expand its reach beyond what he called the family market, which generally means buyers between the ages of 35 and 55, and into cars that would appeal to older drivers.
"We want to be stronger in the pre-family and post-family markets," he said.
In the long run, Mr. Gyll said, Volvo cannot rule out alliances or joint ventures with other auto makers and component suppliers, or even an outright merger. But he said he had no doubts about the ability of the company to thrive on its own at least through the end of the decade.
For the first six months of this year, Volvo sold 189,000 cars, 20 percent more than in the corresponding period last year, and its market share increased in most countries. Volvo sold 45,213 cars in the United States in the first six months, or 19.1 percent more than in the corresponding period in 1993.
Its truck business has also been strong, with a new model, the FH series, helping to push deliveries up 37 percent in the first half of the year, to 32,400.
Operating profits for the car group were 1.475 billion Swedish kronor, or about $197 million, in the first half of the year, compared with a loss of 70 million kronor, or $9.4 million, in the period a year earlier. The truck group earned $237 million in the first half, up from $8.2 million.
Helped by divestitures that yielded gains of $550 million in the first half, Volvo reduced its debt by the end of June to about $120 million, from $1.9 billion at the end of 1993.
Volvo is also benefiting from the weakness of the Swedish currency, analysts said. The weak krona makes Volvo's exports less expensive in terms of other currencies and makes earnings in dollars and other foreign currencies worth more when translated back to kronor.
Over the last several years, Volvo has closed two of its three car production plants in Sweden, consolidating its Swedish production in Goteborg. Employment in the car division, which peaked in 1989 at 34,607, has fallen by 22.6 percent, to 26,803.
The company is taking steps to protect itself from competition. This year, for example, it is pioneering an advance in safety with the introduction of side air bags in the front seats of the 850.
It is also seeking growth by pushing into new markets, particularly in Asia.
"We're building on our strengths in the niches where we are strong," Mr. Gyll said.
To a large degree, though, Volvo's prospects will ride on the company's success in slogging through the process of cutting costs and improving efficiency. Volvo's engineers, like those at nearly every other auto maker, are being forced to keep the cost of producing their designs uppermost in their calculations. Increasingly, they are also being asked to save money by using the same components in different models as often as possible.
On the production line, most of the progress to date has come from fairly predictable steps. Volvo has automated the process of bolting together the chassis and the body of its cars. Employees working on a car's underside have been given easier access by turning the chassis on its side during one stage of assembly.
Workers have also been given more authority to stop the production line to rectify problems, saving the time and expense of having a separate team go back later to deal with errors and quality problems. Quality-control teams spot-check the assembly line, and production teams can earn bonuses by avoiding errors.
A big portion of the company's productivity problems over the years have been linked to high rates of worker absenteeism, a chronic problem throughout Sweden. Absenteeism is now running at less than 5 percent a day here, down from 15 percent a few years ago, largely because of new Swedish Government policies, including a reduction in sick-pay benefits.
"We're looking at a whole new degree of competition, in Europe in particular, in terms of trying to match Japanese efficiency," said Nigel Griffiths, an auto industry analyst at DRI/McGraw-Hill in London. "For Volvo, a lot of their future will come down to their own resilience."

HEADLINE: Workers Scarce but So Are Raises

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Pressure is building on Corporate America to bid up wages to attract machinists, computer specialists and other skilled workers increasingly in short supply. But companies are resisting the pressure with numerous tactics, from turning away business to hiring the unskilled at low wages and then training them.
No one knows how long this effort can keep hourly wages from rising faster than inflation for millions of production workers, especially if the economy continues to grow at a brisk pace. Already wages are rising in a few cities, most spectacularly in Phoenix. But mostly, executives say, companies are holding the line -- an assertion that is backed up by some Labor Department data and Federal Reserve surveys. 
 "There is a certain amount of stubborness, a determination not to pay more," said Tucker Hart Adams, chief economist of Colorado National Bank, who surveyed 60 companies in Denver, where labor shortages have appeared but not wage increases. The resistance, she said, comes in part because employers say they cannot raise prices to cover higher wage costs. "I tell them, 'At some wage, people will answer their help-wanted ads.' And they say they can't go up more than 25 cents an hour or their profits will disappear."
Rather than bid for people already skilled, companies are increasingly training unskilled lower-wage workers, interviews with executives suggest. This may mean that a company's work force is less productive for a while, but the Clinton Administration hails the practice as a way to reopen good jobs to the unskilled.
In another tactic, many companies that once recruited only locally now cast their nets across the nation. Some push existing employees to work more hours. Some also agree among themselves not to hire away one another's skilled people.
And when fat raises are given to keep valued workers, the extra cost is increasingly offset by denying raises to others, according to a survey of big corporations by Towers Perrin, a consulting firm.
In Rochester, Jasco Tools Inc. embraces several of the tactics. Jasco is not planning any increase for the time being in the $10-to-$15-an-hour base pay that most of its 250 machinists receive. Jasco, in fact, needs 20 more machinists to keep up with orders for the auto and aircraft parts, cutting tools and other metal products that the company makes, Gary Rogers, the president, said.
"If you bid for machinists, then your base wage for everyone has to go up," Mr. Rogers said. "And even though our products are in demand now, the market is very competitive and you cannot cover the rising wage cost with higher prices."
So Mr. Rogers is turning away business. But he has hired a full-time instructor to recruit and train high school graduates and people laid off at nearby Eastman Kodak and Xerox plants to be Jasco's new machinists. Fifteen trainees are now on board, earning $5 to $7 an hour.
"It takes three weeks to a year to train them, depending on their level of experience and the machining tasks that we will require of them," Mr. Rogers said. Once trained, their wages rise as they acquire skills. But it will take four years for the most qualified to reach $10 an hour.
"Before Kodak and Xerox had trouble, these giants scooped up people, paying them more and setting the tone for wages," Mr. Rogers said. "That has stopped, of course."
Shawn McDonald, now 19, said he did not even consider seeking a job at Kodak or Xerox when he graduated from high school 18 months ago and joined Jasco as a trainee at $5.50 an hour. He could have made more at those companies, he says.
"I just knew that you learn more at the smaller shops with their one-on-one training," Mr. McDonald said. He is now an apprentice earning $6.75 an hour. And he is already functioning as a novice machinist.
Chase Manhattan Bank in New York is similarly reluctant to bid up wages to hire technicians and programmers who are experts in the networks of desktop computers that are now so popular. Such people are in short supply in many cities. But Chase has a surplus of programmers for big mainframe computers, which have been phased out at the bank, and these extra programmers are being retrained.
"We would have to pay 30 percent more in wages to hire a qualified programmer for desktop computers," Craig Goldman, a Chase senior vice president, said.
But for Mr. Rogers at Jasco, training the inexperienced is a successful tactic only if competitors do not hire away his experienced machinists -- and with them orders that might otherwise have gone to Jasco. As president of the Rochester Tooling and Machining Association, he has helped to engineer an informal agreement among members to provide employee training instead.
Jasco's workers are not unionized. But union contracts sometimes prevent wage bidding. That is the case at General Motors, which has agreed to hire or call back assembly workers in Flint, Mich., at wages established under an existing contract. It is also true among union carpenters in Washington, D.C., where construction is booming.
They are members of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, which limits the wage they can demand to the $17.09 an hour specified in the current contract. Membership in the Washington area had declined since 1990, mostly because there was not enough work, until a recent step-up in Government projects, said Edward E. Shaw, secretary-treasurer of the union's district council for Washington.
The union is trying to rebuild its ranks, and it has signed up 100 immigrants from Mexico, who in hard times had taken jobs from union members by working for less money. They are in enough demand today to receive the union wage.
Still, the union is acting mostly as a brake on wages, helping in effect to contain the pressure for higher wages, Mr. Shaw said. Aside from the recruiting of immigrants, carpenters are being brought in temporarily from Baltimore, where the demand for them is not as great. "We have been able to get just enough people to keep up with the demand without forcing contractors to bid for carpenters," Mr. Shaw said. "We feel we have an obligation to help the contractors, so they will stick with us in bad times."
The tightest labor markets are mostly west of the Mississippi and include Austin, Tex.; Albuquerque, N.M.; Denver; Des Moines; Minneapolis, Phoenix, and Sioux Falls, S.D. In those cities, unemployment rates are less than 4.5 percent, well below the national average of 6.1 percent. And expanding a staff without bidding up wages to lure scarce workers is not always easy.
The Principal Financial Group, a financial services company based in Des Moines, is adding 1,200 people this year to the 8,500 it already employs in Iowa -- without raising wages. The company cannot raise wages without pushing up the entire pay scale, Max Johnson, vice president for human resources, said.
The biggest problem for Principal, he said, has been the recruiting of 150 new college graduates in computer science at a $30,000 starting salary; they can get $36,000 in Chicago, 400 miles away.
Principal has expanded its recruiting to both coasts, particularly aiming at schools with big minority populations. "We are doing this for affirmative-action purposes," Mr. Johnson said. "But we also find that we can recruit them at our wages."
In Phoenix, by comparison, the bidding for construction workers is spectacular. The Intel Corporation and Motorola Inc., among others, are building or expanding factories, and thousands of new homes are going up to accommodate the new arrivals. Plumbers who earned $10 an hour in January get $13 or $14 now, and when one of the 65 plumbers employed at the Gilbert Plumbing Company fails to show up on a job, Ward Gilbert, the vice president, knows right away what happened.
"They are getting calls at home at night from other contractors, and some come in to us and say, 'We got this offer, will you match it?' " he said. "Or they disappear and we find them after a few days and offer to match the increase. Usually it is 50 cents an hour, and we tell them to be quiet about the raise, but it filters out and then we have to raise others."
Trying to avoid this pressure, Mr. Gilbert has 12 people in training at $6 an hour. He is hoping that in six months they will have learned enough to do some of the tasks on a job. Meanwhile, he has given notice of a 6 percent price increase. New-home prices have risen 7 percent this year, according to the Greater Phoenix Economic Council.
That is the sort of inflation connected to rising wages that frightens the bond market and encourages the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Some economists and corporate executives argue that the fear is unwarranted, that Phoenix is the exception and that corporate resistance to wage increases is much greater than it was 15 years ago.
Average hourly wages for non-supervisory workers, adjusted for inflation, did spiral upward in the late 1970's as the unemployment rate declined, reaching a low of less than 6 percent. But the next time unemployment got that low, in the late 1980's, there was no such response. Now unemployment is roughly where it was in the late 1980's, and hourly wages adjusted for inflation have not yet popped up.

HEADLINE: Let's Also Think of Biotechnology Safety

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Biodiversity Pact on the Ropes" (editorial, Sept. 26): More than just "Republican opposition and Democratic lethargy" are combining to put the Convention on Biological Diversity on the ropes. 
 The international agreement is about the protection and maintenance of biological diversity. Other concerns, while important, should be subordinate. Biosafety should not be judged in terms of free flows of biotechnology exports, but rather of effective maintenance of diversity.
Experts agree that there is a wide range of risks associated with genetically engineered organisms. Recently, Prof. Elaine Ingham of Oregon State University and Michael Holmes, a doctoral student there, presented findings of one risk at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America.
In testing a bacterium genetically engineered to produce ethanol, they found an unpredicted side effect: the bacterium cut the amount of beneficial mycorrhizal fungi in the soil by more than half. Given the fungi's critical role in the uptake of plant nutrients, Professor Ingham noted:
"If the organism survived readily and spread widely, very likely we would be unable to grow crops without a control mechanism for this organism."
No one denies that biosafety risks are real. These risks, the economically inconvenient byproducts of our scientific creativity, need to be carefully assessed and addressed. Neither our own United States regulatory system nor that of the rest of the world appears to be doing an adequate job. You reported Sept. 20 that gene transplants in salmon have resulted in transgenic fish that grow at much faster rates and may achieve huge changes in body size.
You did not report, however, that if such fish were to escape, they might displace native salmon, with irreversible economic and environmental consequences.
Because fish and other genetically modified organisms are not likely to respect international boundaries, an international biosafety protocol is crucial. Concern about the ecological consequences of the introduction of new species, whether fish, bacteria, weeds or viruses, is legitimate.
When the United States goes as an observer to the first conference of the parties to the biodiversity agreement in the Bahamas, it should offer as evidence of our concern a call for a stringent biosafety protocol, not for greater access to genetic resources.

HEADLINE: Stairmasters and the Internet Invade a Staid World;
To Attract Younger Alumni, Particularly Women, University Clubs Try to Modernize

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL 

 BODY:
All along Clubhouse Row in midtown Manhattan, university clubs are trying to knock their stuffiness out.
The Princeton Club asked recent graduates if dropping the coat-and-tie requirement in the Tiger Bar and Grill would persuade them to join. The Harvard Club formed a committee to find portraits of female graduates after the overwhelmingly male membership realized that not one of the dark oil paintings lining its dark, wood-paneled walls depicts a woman. And at the Yale Club, members can sign up for an evening class that teaches them "to play the blues instantly." 
 The changes are earnest, if uncertain steps in a fight against eroding memberships and declining use at the tradition-steeped clubs, many of which occupy the blocks of 43d and 44th streets between Vanderbilt Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas.
Steeply falling revenues have been a factor in backing some clubs into bitter labor disputes recently. At the Harvard Club, waiters, cooks and dishwashers have been on strike since April. At the Princeton Club, union members began "informational picketing" two weeks ago, handing out fliers in a prelude to a strike.
Princeton reports that its membership dropped 28 percent, to about 7,000, from 10,000, in the last five years. The 100-year-old Harvard Club, whose membership has dipped to 10,300, from 10,500, since 1992, says revenues from its dining rooms and functions fell 20 percent in six or seven years.
The older Ivy League clubs are all envious of their latest neighbor, the Penn Club, which signed up 10,000 members just three months after opening in June. It is a success that Penn Club officials attribute in large part to aggressively seeking young alumni, especially women.
All the clubs are fighting for new blood, and that has meant that menus conceived during the Hoover Administration, featuring prime rib and popovers, are being replaced by deep-fried skate and beef carpaccio. And oxblood leather armchairs are giving way to Stairmasters.
"The role of the club in society is changing," said Jim Lawler, a club consultant and the acting general manager of the Chemists Club, an association of scientists. "Simply being a nice place to have lunch that features deceased animals and heavy wood is not going to happen anymore."
Not everyone, however, is thrilled. Daniel P. Lieblich, president of the Princeton Club and a member of the class of '38, said that after an experimental loosening of the dress code in the bar this summer, "I had some comments about how terribly informal it is downstairs."
To their most loyal members, university clubs are sanctuaries where, as Holly Golightly described Tiffany's, it feels as though "nothing bad could ever happen to you." Open to all who attended a particular school, they offer familiar faces, generous Scotches, moderately priced rooms for out-of-town members, business and social networking and a clean restroom in midtown. Annual dues range from around $150 for recent graduates to around $900 for senior members, less if they live outside New York City.
Yet, these very icons of an established old-boy culture seem to have lost some appeal, particularly for the young. A 37-year-old independent video producer said he resigned from the Princeton Club several years ago because of its buttoned-down dress code.
"I never wore ties to meetings, and I felt like I was 7 years old if you had to walk in and borrow a tie from them," said the producer, who declined to be identified for fear of offending friends and colleagues.
University club managers cite a variety of reasons for the declines in members and usage: the long regional economic slump, changes in generational attitudes toward clubs and, to a lesser degree, the elimination of the tax deduction for club dues and the lowering of the deduction for business meals from 80 percent to 50 percent. Weaker clubs, like those of Columbia University and New York University, closed their doors in the last decade.
But at the same time, newcomers have eagerly jumped into the game. The Penn Club opened at 30 West 44th Street after a $25 million renovation of a 1900 Beaux-Arts building. It joined the Cornell Club, at 6 East 44th Street, which opened five years ago after adding 4 stories to a 10-story building.
And this summer, the Chemists Club signed up Georgetown University and Polytechnic University of Brooklyn as affiliates, an arrangement that lets the alumni share the club's new building, which opened on West 45th Street last December. Vassar College recently became an affiliate of the Williams Club at 24 East 39th Street, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has joined with Princeton.
The spurt of activity reflects the recognition by universities that clubs bind alumni to their alma maters and build endowments. Whereas clubs like Harvard, Yale and Princeton are member-owned, the newer ventures are subsidized by the universities.
Almost all of the older clubs are studying the success of the Penn Club, whose membership is younger and includes more women: 46 percent of members are under 35, and 38 percent are women.
Rachel Spasser, the club's 27-year-old marketing manager, said, "This is an accessible place, not where you feel uncomfortable walking in -- where, as a woman, you feel intimidated."
The club promises career development seminars, an Internet link to the university's job placement office and a Thursday happy hour, when the coat-and-tie dress code is abandoned.
Arthur I. Hirsch, a divorce lawyer who is the chairman of the Harvard Club admissions committee, defended the institution, whose members include Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and, at one time, Ivan F. Boesky, who did not attend Harvard but was admitted to the club after donating millions to Harvard's School of Public Health.
"This whole stereotype about the stuffiness, it just ain't so," Mr. Hirsch said. "There is a remnant of that, O.K.? It's like Yiddish: my grandmother spoke Yiddish, but we don't speak it anymore. It's dying out. The emphasis at the club is 'lighten up,' basically."
The Harvard Club says 75 percent of its members are over 32 and 15 percent are women, although among those admitted in May and June from the latest graduating classes, women make up 36 percent. There are seven women on the 20-member board of governors.
Trying to let down its hair, the club set up a "recent graduates' room" last summer that was outfitted with a pool table and a wide-screen television. But its popularity was limited. "In our clumsy way, we may not be succeeding, but we are trying," said Michael D. Yamin, a board member.
Thomas Inglis, the general manager of the Cornell Club, cautioned that clubs ought not banish the old boys just yet. "The older, more mature people are farther on in their careers, and they utilize the food and beverage facilities more," he said. "They also pay higher dues and are more likely to bring in out-of-town guests to stay in the rooms."
Indeed, there is the possibility that as clubs attract more women, their all-important income from bars and restaurants will decline.
"Women's expense accounts aren't as lofty, and women are more concerned with health," Mr. Lawler, the club consultant, said. "Men are more likely to feel comfortable about treating themselves, so to speak, at lunch or the cocktail hour."
While many older club members enjoy entertaining guests in a club dining room, younger members often prefer trendy restaurants. Manhattan restaurants are beginning to recover from dire times, but club dining rooms are not bouncing back as fast. One reason seems to be that traditional club cuisine, says Robert Trainor, the chef at the Penn Club, "has become very passe."
To compete with city restaurants, Mr. Trainor serves wild mushroom ravioli and eggplant terrine at the Penn Club.
Despite their troubles, university clubs have one thing going for them, the value of which is probably even higher in shaky times: they offer members many discreet opportunities to advance in the business and social worlds.
Mr. Lawler said that in planning for the future, other clubs might look to the Penn Club, which attracted younger alumni by pitching itself as a halfway house between coddled campus life and the indifferent city. "It's like a warm nest on a rainy day," said Dan Forman, 21, who is hunting for a first job in advertising.
Club officials say they will have a solid future if they can maintain that welcoming feeling. In their own way, they seem to be trying. A few years ago, the Princeton Club demolished the floor of its barroom, on which was inscribed the slogan: "Where women cease from troubling and the wicked are at rest."

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about university clubs in Manhattan misstated the closing date of a club for Columbia alumni. It was in 1973, not in the last decade. The article also omitted the Columbia Club's current status. Since 1990, it has been an affiliate of the Williams Club.

HEADLINE: Man in the News: Fernando Henrique Cardoso;
Brazil's Big Winner

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Hooded, handcuffed and listening to friends' cries under torture, a leftist sociology professor facing interrogation one night 25 years ago thought his life might end at the hands of army intelligence agents. Indeed from 1964 to 1985, the years of Brazil's military dictatorship, he suffered exile, imprisonment, blacklisting and the bombing of his social research group.
But today, voting returns and exit polls indicated that Brazilians had elected the professor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, to be President by the widest popular margin since a retired army general was chosen to lead the nation in 1945. 
 The election of Mr. Cardoso as Brazil's first President in decades with a strong political power base bolstered the strength of civilian democracy in a country that has had its share of political instability. It also signaled to many that Brazil would stay on a firm course of fighting inflation and spurring economic growth through free-market policies after many false starts and promises.
Indeed, there were many predictions that Mr. Cardoso, a former Foreign Minister and Finance Minister, would also push Latin America's largest economy into a new period of rapid economic growth that would draw in huge amounts of foreign investments and imports.
With only 13 percent of votes counted by nightfall, Brazilians relied on three exit polls, which gave Mr. Cardoso victory with about 54 percent of the vote, enough to avoid a runoff against his closest challenger, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. Until a few weeks ago Mr. da Silva, a trade union leader, was the front-runner.
This evening Mr. da Silva declined to comment on the results, but he in effect acknowledged his defeat by saying his party would not ask for any positions in the new Government.
With a reputation in this capital for cordiality and congeniality, the 63-year-old intellectual chosen to lead Brazil is a complex person who defies easy labeling. He described himself today as a leader of "the viable left," and many in Brazil hailed his victory as a vindication for his decades of dissent.
"The generation of the exiles finally reach power," the daily Jornal do Brasil said today, joining virtually all of Brazil's press in informally annointing Mr. Cardoso as the next President.
In some respects, the optimism over Mr. Cardoso's election recalled the hopeful spirit that existed when Brazil's last elected President, Fernando Collor de Mello, took office in 1990. But Mr. Collor later tried to rule by dictating to Congress, and after being disgraced by a congressional corruption inquiry, he was forced to resign in 1992.
In contrast, Mr. Cardoso has a reputation as a patient conciliator. "He's a coalition builder, naturally more a prime minister than a president," said Alfred Stepan, a lifelong American friend who is now president of Central European University in Budapest.
In a country where two-thirds of the electorate never finished primary school, Mr. Cardoso vowed in the campaign to spend billions of dollars to guarantee education and health care for all. "We are an unjust country," he said. "The great Achilles heel of Brazil is injustice."
On the other hand, a survey of executives of Brazil's top 500 companies found that, of the eight presidential candidates, Mr. Cardoso won the support of 97 percent of those who responded.
"What this guy brings to the table is the power of Sao Paulo," an admiring American banker said, alluding to Mr. Cardoso's legislative constituency in Brazil's financial capital. "For the first time in memory, Brazil has a political leader not only with moral and technical authority, but also with political authority."
He flashes the easy grin of a man born in Rio, but Mr. Cardoso will be Brazil's first elected president in 65 years who came to prominence in Sao Paulo. Propelled by opinion polls indicating that Mr. Cardoso would win, stock prices on the Sao Paulo's exchange have risen about 80 percent since July.
Convinced that Brazil is entering a high growth phase similar to the "miracle" years of the 1970's, business executives cite the free-market track record forged by Mr. Cardoso during his one year as Finance Minister, which ended last April. As a candidate, he promised to maintain a tough anti-inflation fight that has reduced Brazil's monthly inflation from 45 percent in June to 1.5 percent in September.
Although recent economic projections have been encouraging, some skeptics have wondered about the veracity of the numbers. These skeptics pointed out that three days before the vote on Monday, Brazil registered its lowest monthly inflation rate in five years.
Mr. da Silva charged that Mr. Cardoso's business backers were artificially holding back price rises and that the anti-inflation plan would fall apart after the election.
In interviews during the campaign, Mr. Cardoso vowed to open oil, telephone, mining and public works to foreign companies, to gradually privatize state companies, to maintain Brazil's six-month-old foreign debt accord, and to maintain trade policies that have rapidly opened up an economy larger than Russia's.
For the first time in almost a decade of civilian rule, Brazilians say they believe that their president will have the political power to carry out many of his promises. On Monday Mr. Cardoso's three-party coalition apparently won a loose majority in Congress. Centrist candidates also fared well in races for powerful state governorship posts.
On the world stage, Mr. Cardoso is expected to raise Brazil's low-key profile dramatically. Itamar Franco, Brazil's current President, speaks only Portuguese, is visibly uncomfortable around foreigners and often cancels overseas trips on short notice.
With English honed during the 1970's as a visiting lecturer at Berkeley, Oxford, Princeton, Stanford and Yale, Mr. Cardoso also speaks fluent French, the traditional foreign language of Brazil's elite. He is also fluent in Spanish and taught in Chile during one of his periods of exile. Unlike most Brazilians who travel in Latin America, Mr. Cardoso speaks proper Spanish, not a hybrid, improvised "Portunhol."
Arrested and then banned from teaching in Brazilian universities by the military in 1969, Mr. Cardoso founded Cebrap, the Brazilian Analysis and Planning Center. A haven for other blacklisted professors, the Sao Paulo research center was bombed by right-wing terrorists in 1974.
The author of 21 books, Mr. Cardoso is best known abroad as the co-author, with Enzo Faletto, of "Dependency and Development in Latin America."
Fernando Henrique Cardozo was born on June 18, 1931, in Rio de Janiero. Drawn into politics 20 years ago, Mr. Cardoso served as a Sao Paulo senator from 1983 to 1992. In 1988 he helped to found the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, a center-left group that opposed corruption.
Mr. Cardoso's wife, Ruth Correa Leite Cardoso, stayed in Sao Paulo while her husband moved to Brasilia. An anthropologist at Cebrap, she specializes in studying community movements by women and blacks in Sao Paulo shantytowns. Their three children are grown and married, and Mrs. Cardoso said last month that she would move to Brasilia if her husband won the race.
Although Mr. Cardoso's inauguration on Jan. 1 will mark the 10th anniversary of civilian rule, the threat of military intervention is never distant. According to a book issued today, "A Historia Real," Mr. Cardoso helped to defuse an incipient military rebellion against President Franco last February.

HEADLINE: MISSION TO HAITI: AT THE U.N.;
ARISTIDE, AT U.N., EMPHASIZES NEED FOR CONCILIATION

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Pledging that "in 11 days I will be in Haiti," its exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, told the United Nations General Assembly today that he is committed to a policy of reconciliation and reconstruction under which civil violence will not be tolerated and retribution will be left to the judicial process.
"We will prepare our reconciliation coffee with the filter of justice, so that no traces of violence or vengeance will be found," he said, quoting a Creole saying. He devoted much of his address to outlining a recovery plan, suggesting also that Haiti's Army, which he called a drain on the economy, would be reduced in size. 
 "The first black republic on earth, today torn asunder by the coup of Sept. 30, 1991, is marching resolutely and definitively toward the establishment of a democratic society," he said.
Father Aristide's remarks drew sustained applause at several points in his address.
Later at a news conference, he repeated his belief that a political amnesty, now being discussed by the Haitian Parliament, cannot cover those who have committed criminal acts while in power. He said that he would wait for the Haitian Parliament to complete its amnesty law, but that he would also look to the courts -- which he plans to reform -- for justice.
"When you talk about crimes against humanity, you don't talk of a general amnesty," he said.
President Aristide also said he would like to see the two remaining military leaders, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras and Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby -- whom he did not mention by name -- follow the example of Lieut. Col. Michel Francois and flee the country.
In response to a question, he said he had hoped that Colonel Francois, who headed the police in Port-au-Prince and had the allegiance of the paramilitary units, would have gone farther away than the Dominican Republic, to which he apparently fled earlier today.
The Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, until recently cooperated little with international embargoes intended to deprive the Haitian military of essential supplies. Some Haitian exiles fear that Colonel Francois, with the help of a brother living there, could set up a base of resistance to Father Aristide.
But in general today, President Aristide was optimistic and effusive in his thanks to the world, the United States and the Haitian people for having stuck by him and preparing the way for his return. He said he would be ready to go back to Haiti sooner than Oct. 15 -- the date by which the Haitian military leaders had agreed in talks with former President Jimmy Carter to step down -- if the two generals resigned before then.
President Aristide deflected a question about what agreement he might make with the United States on the role of American forces in Haiti. He said that now, everyone involved in the Haiti issue is working in unison. He said that he had no complaints about how the Americans were carrying out their mission.
Much of Father Aristide's speech today was devoted to a review of Haiti's economic problems and his plans for development of the country, the hemisphere's poorest. Leaving aside the populist, socialist platforms and slogans of his earlier years, he loaded his address with statistics.
"Why is it that we have one soldier for every 1,000 Haitians and 1.8 doctors per 10,000 inhabitants when the industrial countries have on average one doctor per 400 people?" he asked.
"It is time to create a stable environment permitting national reconciliation across this land where we will no longer have 7,000 men absorbing 40 percent of the national budget," he said. He proposed cutting the army over time to 1,500 troops.
For the first time in Haitian history, he said, he will permanently separate the army and the police force.
Father Aristide, looking toward the bicentennial of Haitian independence in 2004, proposed to build schools and introduce an aggressive literacy program. About 1.2 million children are not in school, he said, approaching twice the number of those enrolled. He said Haiti needs between 35,000 and 100,000 new teachers and up to 20,000 schools to meet the demands of 3 million children within 10 years.
In health, he said his goal is to build up to 8,000 infirmaries and rural health centers and increase hospital beds substantially. He wants to see life expectancy raised from 54 to 65 years by 2004.
Father Aristide laid out detailed plans for restructuring local government and the Haitain justice system from the rural areas upward, and for doubling the number of trained lawyers. He also mentioned reforestation and road-building as social priorities for Haiti.
Following economic plans he has devised with the help of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, Father Aristide spoke warmly today of foreign investment and the need to reduce $81 million in payments due on Haiti's international debt. He said that on resuming office, he would release $13 million to begin to pay the arrears.
When asked at his news conference about his abandonment of earlier economic principles, he replied, in effect, that it was necessary to get in step with those who can help.
In his speech, Father Aristide made a strong appeal to Haitian exiles to return and rebuild the country in the decade before the bicentennial.
Speaking alternately in French and Creole, President Aristide sent this message to what he called the Haitian diaspora, referring to them as the country's 10th department or district. Haiti has nine major political-geographical divisions.
"Bravo for the 10th department!" he said. "Haiti is the biggest wealth of Haitians. Haiti is always our home. Come home. We will brighten it like a rainbow."

HEADLINE: U.S. AND CHINESE RESOLVE DISPUTE ON MISSILE SALES

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
As a sign of improving relations, the United States today agreed to allow the export of high-technology satellites to China that was frozen after Beijing secretly transferred missile components and technology to Pakistan.
In return, China pledged that once those sanctions are waived, it will not sell or transfer surface-to-surface missiles covered under an international accord controlling the transfer of sensitive missile technology. 
 The agreement, signed by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China and Secretary of State Warren Christopher before television cameras in the State Department Treaty Room, also commits the two sides to cooperate in promoting an end to the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons.
Even though China has promised in the past to abide by the international missile accord, only to break its promises, Mr. Christopher touted today's agreement as "a very important step forward."
Mr. Qian's two-day visit, which included a meeting on Monday with President Clinton, reflected an improvement in relations between the two countries since the United States softened its tough stance on human rights and extended the trade benefits to China in May.
In recent weeks, China signed $6 billion in trade deals with American companies, and on Monday Mr. Qian presented letters from President Jiang Zemin inviting Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to visit China.
Mr. Jiang is said to be eager, even desperate, for Mr. Clinton to visit Beijing, and more than a month ago the Chinese began asking the Americans what kind of diplomatic breakthrough would be needed to get Mr. Clinton to go. The probings come amid fresh reports that have reached the American Embassy in Beijing that the health of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping is worsening.
Mr. Clinton has no plans at the moment to visit China, the White House spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, said today.
In Mr. Clinton's meeting on Monday, as in other meetings with Mr. Qian and other Chinese officials, the issue of China's deteriorating human rights record was raised. "The President expressed disappointment" about the lack of progress on human rights, a White House statement said on Monday.
Among the Administration's requests were the release of Wei Jingsheng, China's best known dissident, as well as Chinese political prisoners who are ill and Tibetan prisoners, senior officials said.
These officials said they could not confirm a report in a Beijing-backed newspaper in Hong Kong today that Mr. Wei, who has not been seen in public since he was detained last April, has been granted parole and sent to several economically advanced regions to see how China had changed under its reforms.
"We made clear during these discussions that human rights is an important part of our relationship with China," one senior Admninistration official said. "The human rights situation certainly hasn't gotten better."
Under the agreement signed today, China for the first time accepts the internationally recognized definition of what constitutes a violation of the missile accord, known as the Missile Technology Control Regime. In addition, it commits China to ban the export to any country of surface-to-surface missiles with a range of at least 185 miles and a payload of at least 1,100 pounds.
But the Administration has yet to persuade Beijing to follow the lead of Russia and formally adhere to the accord in its entirety, or to become a full member of the accord.
In a recognition that there is still a long way to go on arms-control issues, a State Department statement issued at the ceremony said, "The two countries agreed to work together to promote missile nonproliferation through a step-by-step approach to resolve differences over missile exports."
In August 1993, after American intelligence agencies reported that China had sent technology and parts for M-11 missiles to Pakistan, President Clinton banned the export to China of several high-technology satellite systems for two years.
But the sanctions, which were scheduled to expire in any case in August 1995, hurt American business and were a major irritant in the relationship between Washington and Beijing.
Even with the sanctions, the Administration has permitted the export of satellites that did not include sensitive military technology. In other cases, American companies themselves withdrew their applications for approval because of the sanctions.
Today's agreement paves the way for American companies to begin to sell their satellite technology to China once again. In particular, it will immediately allow three satellite projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars to proceed, if the manufacturers decide to do so.
Senior Administration officials denied that today's decision was driven by commercial considerations.
"This is really not an economic decision," one such official said. "This is a non-proliferation decision. The thrust of the story should not be that to develop American exports we wiggled around non-proliferation concerns."
China has never admitted that it sold components for M-11 missiles to Pakistan in violation of the international agreement intended to curb the spread of such technology.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: NEW YORK GOVERNOR;
Deep Discontent With Cuomo Strengthens Pataki, Poll Shows

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:
Five weeks before Election Day, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and his Republican rival, State Senator George E. Pataki, are locked in a tight race because many New Yorkers are so disenchanted with the three-term incumbent that they are willing to support a challenger who remains largely unknown, according to a New York Times/WCBS-TV News Poll.
The statewide telephone poll, taken between Sept. 29 and Oct. 2, shows a virtual dead heat, with Mr. Pataki holding a slim lead of 44 percent to 41 percent among registered voters. Twelve percent are undecided. The distance between Mr. Pataki and Mr. Cuomo is within the poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, meaning that either candidate could actually be ahead. 
 The Governor remains far more popular in New York City, his hometown, than in the rest of the state. The poll shows him leading Mr. Pataki by 66 percent to 25 percent in the city, while Mr. Pataki leads Mr. Cuomo by 47 percent to 36 percent in the New York City suburbs and by 56 percent to 28 percent upstate.
Despite the closeness of the race, the survey reveals deep disillusionment with Mr. Cuomo, and suggests that the burdens of 12 years of incumbency, which Mr. Cuomo refers to as "my albatross," will not be easy to overcome.
Mr. Cuomo won re-election with a record 65 percent eight years ago and was considered a leading Presidential contender for both 1988 and 1992. In the poll, however, more people viewed him unfavorably than favorably, and fully a quarter of those who said they voted for him in 1990 said they now plan to vote for Mr. Pataki.
The poll suggests that New Yorkers believe that at least half of the Pataki campaign slogan that Mr. Cuomo has been "too liberal for too long." Three-fifths of those questioned said he had been Governor for too long, although 54 percent said he was not too liberal.
Despite Mr. Cuomo's campaign pledge to cut taxes, 55 percent said they believed he would raise them if re-elected, compared with 28 percent for Mr. Pataki (few actually believe that either candidate will succeed in lowering taxes). And perhaps most damning, when asked to name the best thing Mr. Cuomo has done as Governor, 57 percent gave no answer.
But the poll does suggest that Mr. Cuomo has one political asset that he has yet to fully exploit: a reservoir of good will from New Yorkers who believe he is a strong, honest and compassionate leader. The poll shows that 71 percent of those questioned believe he has strong qualities of leadership, compared with 32 percent for Mr. Pataki. Sixty-one percent believe he has the honesty and integrity they want in a governor, compared with 43 percent for Mr. Pataki. Fifty-three percent believe he cares about the needs and problems of people like themselves, compared with 44 percent for Mr. Pataki.
And yet, only 29 percent of those questioned have an overall favorable opinion of Mr. Cuomo, while 40 percent view him unfavorably. For Mr. Pataki, 18 percent said they viewed him favorably and 19 percent unfavorably, while 63 percent said they were either undecided or did not know enough to have an opinion. Of those who said they would vote for Mr. Pataki, 30 percent said the main reason was because they did not like Mr. Cuomo, and another 31 percent said they simply wanted a change.
Many respondents were like Margaret Serro, a 53-year-old seamstress from Merrick, L.I., who is not enrolled in a political party. She said in a follow-up interview that she had voted for Mr. Cuomo in the past and knew virtually nothing about Mr. Pataki, but would vote for the Republican anyway.
"I dislike Mario Cuomo that much," she said. "He hasn't done anything for us in the years he's been in office. He's got all this money in New York State and we don't see any return for the working people. Politicians will be politicians and I don't know that Pataki will be any better. But at least you'll see somebody different."
Other respondents said they faced a tough decision. Mary Lou Miller, a 47-year-old school guidance counselor who lives in Avon, 20 miles south of Rochester, said the state needed a change. But Ms. Miller, a self-described "bipartisan Republican," said she disagreed with Mr. Pataki's support for the death penalty and was uncertain whether he strongly supports abortion rights, as she does.
"I'm going to be in a real Catch-22," she said.
The poll depicts a highly volatile race, largely because Mr. Pataki, a freshman Senator from Putnam County, is such an unknown quantity. That leaves Mr. Cuomo, who still has millions of dollars for television advertising, with a chance to portray Mr. Pataki in such an unflattering light that New Yorkers will find him an unacceptable alternative.
That effort, of course, has been under way for weeks. The Cuomo campaign has broadcast a steady volley of ads depicting Mr. Pataki as a dishonest right-wing extremist who is controlled by his patron, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Mr. Pataki has countered with ads that deride Mr. Cuomo's policies on taxes, welfare and crime. Thus far, however, there is no evidence that either campaign's advertising has had a decisive effect.
The poll of 1,148 registered voters began last Thursday, the day after Mr. Pataki disclosed his plan for cutting personal income taxes.
In the poll, Mr. Pataki's 3 percentage point lead among all registered voters grew only slightly, to 49 percent to 44 percent, when undecided respondents were asked who they leaned toward, and when the survey was limited to those who said they definitely would vote. The poll did not specifically give respondents a choice of three other candidates -- Robert T. Walsh of the Right-to-Life Party, B. Thomas Golisano of the Independence Fusion Party, and Robert Schulz of the Libertarian Party -- but 1 percent said they would vote for someone other than Mr. Cuomo or Mr. Pataki.
Three other independent polls taken during the last three weeks have shown Mr. Pataki with a lead of between 1 and 10 percentage points, while one showed Mr. Cuomo with a 4 percentage point lead. That poll, by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute in Hamden, Conn., was weighted so that 37 percent of the respondents lived in New York City.
Both candidates sought yesterday to put the most generous spin on the numbers.
"The momentum is clearly building and heading our way," said Mr. Pataki, after a Manhattan news conference.
Mr. Cuomo, in Albany, saw things differently. "We should be further behind, according to my pollsters," he said. "That probably is going to shake up my people because it threatens my underdog status."
The poll shows that the issues that most concern New Yorkers, in order, are crime, taxes and unemployment, which was 6.7 percent in August. Sixty percent of the New Yorkers questioned said they rated the economy as either fairly bad or very bad, compared with 46 percent in a nationwide poll take by The New York Times and WCBS-TV last month.
Asked about the state's sentencing practices for murderers, 47 percent said they support the death penalty, 36 percent said they support a maximum sentence of life without the possibility of parole, and 6 percent said they favor long sentences with the possibility of parole. The death penalty is a significant issue in the campaign because Mr. Pataki supports it and Mr. Cuomo has vetoed it for 12 consecutive years. The Governor contends that New Yorkers would choose his life-without-parole option in a referendum.
On abortion, 47 percent said it should be available to those who want it, as Mr. Cuomo says, and 35 percent said it should be available under stricter limits, as Mr. Pataki contends. Fifteen percent said it should be illegal.
And in perhaps another foreboding result for Mr. Cuomo, 56 percent said that statewide public officials should be limited to two four-year terms, while 38 percent said they should be allowed to serve as long as they continue to be re-elected.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/WCBS-TV News Poll of New York State is based on telephone interviews conducted from Thursday to Sunday with 1,552 adults throughout the state. Of these, 1,148 said they were registered to vote.
The random sample of telephone numbers was provided by Survey Sampling of Fairfield, Conn.
Within each household, one adult was randomly designated as the respondent. The results have been weighted to take into account household size and number of telephone lines at the residence, as well as to adjust for variations relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In addition, results about respondents' intended votes in November have been weighted by the statewide distribution of actual ballots in recent elections from New York City (31 percent), its suburbs (24 percent) and the rest of the state (45 percent).
According to statistical theory, in 19 of 20 cases, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all registered voters in New York State.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, results based on residents of New York City would be plus or minus 4 percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any opinion survey may introduce error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.

HEADLINE: Mandela Bids U.S. Assist In New Fight

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
In his first visit to the United States since his inauguration, President Nelson Mandela thanked the American people today for helping to overturn the apartheid system and then implored them to join South Afria in its newest struggle: overcoming poverty and building its economy.
At an emotional White House ceremony that included a 21-gun salute and trumpet flourishes, Mr. Mandela said that after coming so far in helping the rebirth of his nation, the United States should not abandon its friend, but must instead invest in a new South Africa. 
 "We have now opened a new battle line, to fight against poverty, against hunger, against joblessness, against homelessness," Mr. Mandela said, standing beside President Clinton on a podium on the South Lawn. "It may prove to be a more difficult battle than the one we fought with arms and other pressures. It needs, first and foremost, resources."
In his weeklong visit to the United States, the 76-year-old South African leader has brought the same message as other prominent foreign leaders, including President Lech Walesa of Poland and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia -- he no longer wants help for his political struggles, but needs aid for the daunting economic challenges ahead.
"I have come here with a message," he said. "People of the United States of America: Open your markets to us. People of the United States of America: Come and invest in our country."
Mr. Mandela's schedule includes not just a state dinner at the White House tonight, with the singer Whitney Houston entertaining, and an address to a joint meeting of Congress on Thursday, but also many gatherings with chief executives of blue-chip corporations. At those meetings, Mr. Mandela is stressing that it is time to invest in South Africa because the days of violence and instability are over.
For the diplomats, members of Congress, black leaders and others among the 4,500 invited guests at the White House ceremony, it was quite a sight to see Mr. Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison because of his fight against apartheid, walking with his stiff but dignified gait to inspect the honor guard with President Clinton.
Mindful of the civil wars in Rwanda and Bosnia, Mr. Clinton hailed Mr. Mandela for his success at promoting reconciliation in his deeply fractured nation and at spearheading the peaceful liberation of his people.
"Now all over the world there are three words which spoken together express the triumph of freedom, democracy and hope for the future," Mr. Clinton said to thunderous applause. "They are, President Nelson Mandela."
Mr. Clinton promised that the United States would continue to extend a helping hand to South Africa. His Administration plans to increase aid to South Africa during the next three years, to $800 million from $600 million, by, for example, providing more than $100 million in loan guarantees for housing and electrification projects in poor townships.
In addition, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation is to announce on Wednesday two investment funds totaling $150 million that are intended to generate about $1.3 billion in investment in South Africa.
Mr. Mandela's visit has spurred some investor interest. Duracell, the battery company, closed its South Africa operations in 1984 but said today that it would start selling batteries again in that country, aided by $13 million in political risk insurance provided by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Then, in a move that is expected to create at least 400 jobs, the Subway Corporation has agreed to open 80 sandwich shops in South Africa.
A group of American blacks, including the actor Danny Glover and the basketball star Shaquille O'Neal, announced this week that they would put up $15 million to invest in a Pepsi-Cola bottling venture.
Mr. Mandela said corporate America "can play a decisive role in insuring that there are enough homes, there are enough jobs, there are enough schools."
The guest list for the White House dinner included many big-city mayors, black leaders, members of Congress and a sprinkling of prominent business executives. Among them were the Rev. Jesse Jackson; Coretta Scott King; ex-Mayor David M. Dinkins; Sidney Sheinberg, president of MCA; Stephen J. Friedman, chairman of Goldman, Sachs; Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman of I.B.M.; John H. Johnson, chairman of the Johnson Publishing Company, and Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of J. P. Morgan & Company.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
New G.M. Revamping Focuses on Car Design

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 4

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation announced its fourth reorganization in 10 years today in an effort to streamline its approach to developing cars. Executives stressed that the latest attempt would not yield cataclysmic change, like the reorganization of 1984, which paralyzed the company.
G.M. said it would merge its four North American car development operations into two, while more closely allying them with its European ones, as a way to achieve economies of scale and to stifle the traditionally fratricidal competition among divisions of the company. 
 Other auto makers are also shaking up their organizations to cut vehicle development costs. But G.M. has the greatest challenge: For decades, different teams designed unique vehicles for the company's rival divisions.
G.M. executives say they have learned that customers generally do not notice if, for example, some Chevrolets and Pontiacs share engines, suspensions and other components, provided the vehicles are styled differently and have other distinctive features.
As a result, the executives say, G.M. can save money by combining the engineering teams to design a basic platform, or car chassis, and then taking advantage of economies of scale in producing more similar parts.
In addition, G.M. said the reorganization should shorten vehicle development time. Many analysts have criticized G.M. for taking more than five years to develop some vehicles, making the cars seem stale when they are introduced.
This reorganization signals that the old G.M. system of internal competition is dead, executives said. "There aren't any kingdoms left," G. Richard Wagoner Jr., president of G.M.'s North American operations, said in a meeting with reporters in Warren, Mich., today. "Like it or not, we've got to work together."
John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s president and chief executive, said in an interview before the opening of the Paris Auto Show, "It's just another evolution."
"This just gets everyone a little closer," he continued, "particularly the North American unit."
Mr. Smith said he had no estimate of how much would be saved by the reorganization.
Mr. Smith has been consolidating G.M.'s sprawling operations since taking over as chief executive two years ago, and auto industry analysts welcomed the latest changes as a sign that his efforts had not lost momentum, even though the company's profits have been rising.
"After a lot of agonizing, this is the final step to put in place" to streamline car development, said Joseph Phillippi, auto analyst with Lehman Brothers in New York. At G.M. now, he said, "It's taken too long to do a product, as well as consuming a lot of resources."
G.M. is combining its four car development groups into two: a small-car group and a midsize and luxury car group. G.M.'s North American operations also include a truck development group, a powertrain group and a sales service and marketing group.
G.M.'s Saturn subsidiary -- until now an independent company within G.M. -- will be folded into the small- car group. Previously Mr. Smith had said Saturn would have a separate platform. The decision to combine its future development with that of other small cars, like the Chevrolet Cavalier, is risky because Saturn workers and buyers tend to think of Saturn as unique and unrelated to G.M.
But Mr. Smith said the change was needed to cut costs at Saturn. "I don't think they are taking a step backwards," he said of Saturn, because with its different styling, other features and sales system, the car will still seem different from other G.M. products to buyers.
In addition, Saturn's president, Richard G. LeFauve, 59, was promoted today to vice president and group executive in charge of the small car group, suggesting that Saturn's interests will be protected.
Louis R. Hughes, president of G.M.'s international operations, said in an interview here that he expected that platforms in the United States and Europe would increasingly share parts. "We have platforms in the United States and Europe that are within millimeters of each other," he said. "That's a fact, and long term, that makes no sense."
But while the Ford Motor Company is merging its European and American auto operations, Mr. Smith emphasized that he favored keeping G.M.'s operations independent, instead forming alliances between the units to work on specific projects.

HEADLINE: U.S. Index Suggests Growth Into New Year

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
The Government's chief forecasting index posted its biggest advance in five months in August, a sign that the economy will grow briskly through the holidays and into the new year.
The advance of six-tenths of 1 percent in the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators was the latest in a series of consistently strong reports since last Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve Board decided it was not yet time to increase interest rates again. 
 Today's results were not a surprise, because most of the components of the index had been published. But they seemed to solidify opinion that the economy has not slowed much and may be rebounding from a summer lull.
Combined with yesterday's report from corporate purchasing managers of a robust September in factories, the rise in the leading index "means the Fed has not tightened enough," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber.
Nine of the 11 index components contributed to the August advance, with the biggest factor being a jump in new factory orders for consumer goods and materials. This was despite a large buildup of inventories in the spring that seemed to imply a pause while stocks were worked off.
The second-biggest contributor to the August rise was more companies' reporting slower deliveries from suppliers, a measure of production bottlenecks that is thought to be a favorite gauge of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman.
"That is a precursor of inflation," said Paul D. Mastroddi, a managing director at J. P. Morgan in New York.
Separately, the Bureau of Mines said its Primary Metals Index, intended to predict activity in steel and other basic industries, jumped 1.9 percent in August, the biggest increase since November. This index, compiled with the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University, edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in July.
David B. Bostian Jr., economist at Herzog, Heine, Geduld, a New York brokerage firm, said his own forecasting index rose just three points for the month, to plus 197, warning of what he said would be a "sharply" slowing economy in 1995. The Fed, he predicted, is increasingly likely to raise interest rates this month, not waiting for its first policy meeting after the elections on Nov. 15.
Another private-sector index, from Safian Investment Research in White Plains, rose four-tenths of 1 percent in August, with 17 components up and 7 down. What lies ahead, according to Kenneth Safian, is a "continued though moderating advance in business activity."
But the Commerce Department's index, which broke a streak of four months with little or no increase, seemed to leave little doubt that the economy would remain strong, despite the Fed's repeated attempts this year to force its growth rate back below 3 percent.
Other positive contributors to the August increase were a decline in first-time claims for unemployment benefits, higher stock prices, another rise in the price of materials sensitive to the business cycle, higher consumer expectations, a longer average workweek and more building permits. The only negatives were a decline in the money supply and lower factory backlogs on durable-goods orders.

HEADLINE: MISSION IN HAITI: POLITICS;
Aristide Backers Start to Surface

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Slowly, cautiously, a government-in-waiting is surfacing here.
Evans Paul, Mayor of this gritty, impoverished city by the sea, can now speak openly with politicians, journalists and friends, arriving nattily dressed at City Hall and at luxury hotels to appear on television to discuss Haiti's future.
But when night falls he does not go home. Instead, with memories of his arrest and beatings still in mind, he moves around the capital, seeking refuge in the homes of those who promise shelter. 
 Joseph Fignole, a member of Parliament and a staunch supporter of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, chooses not to hide. But visits must be carefully arranged.
On Saturday, after a meandering drive up pitted back streets, a stranger was asked to stop and wait for an exchange of passwords before a guide would show the way to the house that has several times sheltered him from gunfire.
Samuel Madistin, the chairman of Parliament's human rights and justice commission, left the country just one day before Guy Malary, the Justice Minister, was assassinated last year. Seventeen days later, Haitian soldiers circled Mr. Madistin's parents' home, riddled it with automatic weapons fire, beat his 60-year-old father and drove the couple from the country.
Mr. Madistin returned to Haiti on April 28. The next day he had to run from an ambush on Carrefour Road.
"The problem is not when you leave," Mr. Madistin said. "It is when you come back."
Now he lives at home for the first time in years. But he is unsettled. "Nothing has changed so far," he said. "We have seen what happened this week. We have seen more killings. It is no time for confidence."
Three years and more than 3,000 deaths after Father Aristide was driven from the country, the civilian Government here is struggling awkwardly into the open beneath a protective shadow cast by American troops.
Though Father Aristide and many in his Cabinet are still safely ensconced in Washington and Montreal, others guided by ambition and ideology are working here for deep changes in a political system long driven by brute force.
Meeting in cars, in embassy residences, in friends' houses and occasionally in public, they have spent months trying to cobble together a transition to civilian rule and democratic principles. But as they do so, they must fight well-founded fears for their own safety, internal rivalries ignited by the promise of elections next year and prevalent doubts about their ability to govern an angry population choked by a crippling economic embargo and embittered by years of desperate poverty.
They also must still hide.
"It is like a game of cat and mouse," Mr. Madistin said.
"They look for us and we elude them," he said of the paramilitary groups that have threatened and harassed political figures opposed to the military's de facto government.
It is a sinister game that affords both sides some natural advantages. Since only two main streets lead through Port-au-Prince, spotters working with the military can easily trace most movements. That has forced the underground to use the back routes and sometimes travel in disguise.
Children have proved an unexpected problem to some of those in hiding. "They know my face," Mayor Paul said.
Staying too long or getting too comfortable in one place can spell trouble, too. "If you stay, the usual things change," Mr. Paul said. "Children cannot have their friends over. The house is quiet. People notice."
And on back streets, money buys betrayal.
Telephones, though preposterously unreliable, have worked to the underground's advantage. Since Haiti's communication system is so primitive, said Micha Gaillard, a socialist politician who serves as chief of staff for the Education Minister, "they can only tap about 25 lines at a time." He laughed, and added, "I was too small for that list."
Still, Mr. Gaillard was hardly out of danger. He left home when someone left a macabre message at his doorstep. One morning before dawn, as he prepared a pot of coffee, he heard a spray of automatic weapons fire just outside the family gate.
A man lay sprawled in blood on his driveway. The killing came after dozens of threats. So Mr. Gaillard disappeared out a back door, taking his wife and children into a place the Haitians call "maronage," a life of hiding.
Now he is back, relaxing over a computer chess game with a son and working 15-hour days to revamp the Government and shore up his political party, Konakom.
For him, the changing tide brought by the arrival of American troops presented an odd dichotomy. He opposed intervention. But now that the troops are here, he cannot help celebrating.
"Today, I receive you with a fan," he said grandly, welcoming a visitor and flicking a switch on a portable fan, though a stiff breeze off the sea was rustling the papers on his desk. "The Americans went to the local power station and they said, 'Give us more power!' So now we have electricity. It is great!"
That relief is not broadly shared yet. Many lawmakers remain in hiding to some degree; others remain in exile. And thousands of others make up a modern diaspora that began under the dictatorship of the Duvaliers and has continued to the present.
"More than 300,000 people were displaced," said Ira Kurzban, a Miami lawyer who represents the Aristide Government. "It is like a boot has been lifted off their necks. But as long as the weapons are not confiscated, there is still tremendous tension."
At the government radio station, the fear has meant only a skeleton staff to run things since American troops wrested control from the military. Television service will take longer to restart.
Parliament, too, is faltering between two forces. When Mr. Fignole went there this week for an emotional reunion with other legislators who support the exiled Government, he traveled with an American military escort. The situation, everyone says, is still tenuous. Many other exiles and members of the "maronage" have yet to reappear.
"None of us go through this without tears and hardship," Mr. Madistin said. "To have lived for three years of fear and brutality is not nothing. It is hard for many people to go back home and get to work, because they know exactly what's waiting for them if democracy is not back."
"Thursday, they threw a grenade," he said of an attack on demonstrators calling for Father Aristide's return. "It was a reminder. We fight. But we also die."
In this odd time between hope and history, many in hiding simply wait and watch. History has not been kind here. And hope is thin gruel to a country where the natural response to the question, "How are you?" is the bleak Creole utterance, "Papi mal" -- "Not worse."
Mayor Paul, who is thought to harbor dreams of the presidency, deflects a pointed question about his own future with a simple segue as though not to tempt the fates.
"What is important to me," he said, "is the right to conduct my life, the right to live in my house, the right to invite a friend to a restaurant and the right to go to a meeting or go jogging if I want to."
But even with thousands of American troops on Haitian soil, the Mayor still looks over his shoulder as he drives through town. And he has yet to go home.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: CUOMO AND TAXES;
Governor Delays Plan For Cuts

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo delayed releasing his tax-cut proposal, saying today that he wants to hear more details of how his Republican challenger, State Senator George E. Pataki, will pay for his own plan to slash the top personal income tax rate by 25 percent.
"First, I want to hear from him," Mr. Cuomo said in a news conference after a state police cadet graduation here. "I don't want to set up a fog that allows him to escape. Let's hear their answers first. Why should we get to my plan?" 
 And in a day devoted to sniping over economic issues -- both campaigns see their credibility on tax cuts as a key to the election -- Mr. Pataki charged that business has been stifled because of 6,000 new regulations adopted during Mr. Cuomo's tenure. Mr. Pataki pointedly declined, though asked at least three times, to name any specific regulation he considered onerous.
"We could give you a list after list of regulations we think are onerous," he said at at news conference in Manhattan. "But it wouldn't serve a point. The point is that there are 6,000 new regulations that have been adopted since Mario Cuomo took office."
Last week, Mr. Cuomo's aides said he would release the final details of an estimated $1.5 billion tax cut in Buffalo on Wednesday. But today the Governor said he would delay, charging again that Mr. Pataki's plan, which would cost $5.6 billion a year by 1998, would raise local property taxes substantially.
Mr. Cuomo appears to be gambling that he can keep the focus on Mr. Pataki's proposal, which the Governor says is unworkable, and that the voters will, on closer inspection, agree with him. But he may risk looking petty or to be playing the same game -- of refusing to be specific -- that he accuses Mr. Pataki of playing.
Mr. Pataki blasted Mr. Cuomo for his decision. "Let me say that I'm not surprised that the Governor is having confusion putting together a tax-cut package because it's something from his record he's not been very good at," he said.
Surrounded by green books titled "Official Compilation: Codes, Rules and Regulations of the State of New York," Mr. Pataki said he would take several steps to ease regulations on businesses. Among those steps would be requiring state agencies to analyze any regulation's effect on the economy and ordering a review of all state regulations to reduce "as much as possible the burden that the people of this state suffer under."
But Mr. Pataki conceded that not every state regulation has a direct effect on businesses.
For his part, Mr. Cuomo defended his record of cutting regulations. "Everybody overregulates," he said. "We're probably doing more to cut that back than most states."
Although Mr. Cuomo linked his decision to delay his tax plan to a further explanation from Mr. Pataki, a Cuomo spokesman said later that the Governor's plan had not been completed. But Thomas Conroy, the spokesman, said Mr. Cuomo still planned to travel to Buffalo to deliver a speech on his overall agenda for economic development.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Rose 7.4% Last Month

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Sales of cars and light trucks rose 7.4 percent in September, as the Big Three auto makers gained market share from foreign producers by virtue of the surging popularity of pickup trucks, mini-vans and four-wheel-drive vehicles.
The strong gain in sales, reported today by the auto makers, came despite concerns that higher interest rates could choke off consumer confidence and the ability of consumers to make monthly payments. The report briefly unnerved the bond market, which saw it as a sign that higher rates were failing to moderate growth, and Treasury prices fell. [Page D15.] Stock prices were also lower yesterday. [Page D8.] 
 For the month, total sales reached 1,208,691 cars and light trucks, compared with 1,125,456 in the comparable period a year ago. The results did not include sales of the Mitsubishi Motor Corporation, which said it would not report results today because of internal reporting problems with its dealers.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales of domestically built vehicles was 7.1 million cars and 5.6 million light trucks, according to the Commerce Department. The year's brisk pace of sales showed few signs of letting up.
Joel Pitcoff, sales analyst for the Ford Motor Company, said, "We've been saying we're on track for selling 15.5 million cars and trucks by year's end, and I see no reason to change that." If the industry reached that total, it would be the best auto sales year since 1988.
Some analysts, however, were expecting even stronger results. Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said, "total sales were a little less than expected." Mr. Webb said he was concerned that household incomes had not grown fast enough to support the current sales pace, and consumer debt was rising.
But Ron Nippe, general sales manager of Ira Oldsmobile-Toyota-Lexus-Mazda in Danvers, Mass., north of Boston, said he saw no signs of slowing sales. "There's pent-up frustration in the buying public," he said. "They have been keeping cars longer and they need to buy new cars."
Mr. Nippe said the Toyota brand was "especially hot," and Oldsmobile's new Aurora model was "selling faster than we can get them."
Encouraged by robust consumer demand, North American auto makers have planned the most aggressive fourth-quarter production in a decade. Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter, said auto makers would build about 4.1 million cars and trucks through the end of 1994, up 9 percent from 1993.
The General Motors Corporation, the No. 1 auto maker, posted monthly car and light-truck sales of 396,216, an increase of about 15 percent from a year ago and well ahead of G.M's pace for the first nine months of the year. Car sales rose 22.3 percent, and light-truck sales were up 4.7 percent.
William E. Hoglund, executive vice president of G.M., said sales might have been higher but for tight availability of light trucks and two assembly plants -- in Lordstown, Ohio, and Fairfax, Kan. -- that have just begun to produce new models.
"We're feeling pretty good," Mr. Hoglund said. He noted that G.M. had sold an unusually large number of vehicles to rental fleets in the month. That did not represent a change in the auto maker's policy of reducing its reliance on sales to rental fleets, Mr. Hoglund said. "It was just a timing issue," he said.
The Ford Motor Company's car and light-truck sales in September were 321,153, or about 8 percent ahead of last year. Car sales were 4.1 percent higher and light-truck sales were 12.2 percent higher.
"Our trucks were impressive across the board, but two areas of strength stood out in particular -- mini-vans and pickups," said Robert L. Rewey, group vice president of marketing and sales for Ford. He said sales of Ford's three mini-van models -- Aerostar, Windstar and Mercury Villager -- were up 37 percent.
The Chrysler Corporation's total vehicle sales rose more modestly, compared with those of its rivals. Chrysler, the No. 3 auto maker, said its car and light-truck sales rose only 2 percent for the month, to 168,074, because of a drop of about 17 percent in car sales.
The auto maker said the slip was caused in part by the lack of availability and the discontinuation of some models. Sales of light trucks, including mini-vans, rose 17 percent for the month.
Two of the larger Japanese producers posted lower September sales. The Honda Motor Company reported a drop of 12 percent in car sales, compared with the comparable month last year. Honda said last year's results were unusually strong because of a special clearance of 1993 models.
Noting that the sales for the 1994 model year were 6.6 percent ahead of the previous model year, Tom Elliott, executive vice president of Honda's United States sales organization, said, "We expect '94 calendar year sales to be even stronger." The 1994 model year ended on Sept. 30.
The Toyota Motor Corporation reported sales of 83,953 cars and light trucks for the month, down 11.1 percent from last year.
The Nissan Motor Corporation posted sales of 69,822, up 10.7 percent from last year. Earl J. Hesterberg, vice president of the auto maker's Nissan division, said, "Nissan's momentum continues to accelerate." Sales of the Altima compact sedan rose 6.9 percent in September, to 15,297, making it Nissan's best-selling model.
The Mazda Motor Corporation reported monthly sales of 30,735, up 6.3 percent. Mazda's subcompact Protege outsold all other models.

HEADLINE: Man in the News;
New SUNY Chancellor: Thomas Alva Bartlett

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
As Thomas A. Bartlett recalls it, "it was a complete bolt out of the blue."
There he was, one afternoon early in June, sitting contentedly in the Portland office of the University of Oregon. At 63, retiring after five years as Chancellor of the Oregon state university system, he was looking forward to assuming the mantle of chancellor emeritus, and leading a different sort of life. There was his cattle farm in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, and some projects connected with international education. Maybe even a book. 
 Then, the telephone rang.
Now, as a result of that bolt-out-of-the-blue call from an executive search company, Dr. Bartlett plans to sell his 130 head of cattle and take office on Dec. 1 as the fifth Chancellor of the State University of New York in the 30 years since Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller created the post and led an expansion of the system.
As a successor to D. Bruce Johnstone, who stepped down in March because of cancer, Dr. Bartlett is to receive $172,500 a year to head the largest state university system in the United States. SUNY has 400,000 students, 64 campuses and a budget of just over $5 billion a year.
"It's a little bit like getting married," he said of his decision to accept the SUNY post after much reflection and evaluation and many discussions. "It isn't just a job. It's not a contract. It's a relationship."
But it is clear that he sees the relationship as one that extends far beyond ivy-covered walls.
"I think of the chancellor's role as strategy, structure, leadership," he said.
With a background in foreign affairs that includes nearly eight years with the United States Mission to the United Nations, he sees the impact of world economy and the state's politics on education. "Is the public going to decide it wants to invest less in higher education?" he said.
He knows that people educated in the university will ultimately play a role in the research and public policy that shape decisions on issues like health care and the environment.
"Public higher education exists to serve individual needs and social needs, and much of the trick of leadership is to keep those two in the right balance," Dr. Bartlett said. "Our fundamental challenge is to combine access and quality, or quantity and quality, if you like."
Dr. Bartlett, who has also been Chancellor of the University of Alabama and the president of Colgate University, assessed his role in New York this way:
"I think it is the job of the chancellor to help the board of trustees -- and through the board of trustees, the political processes of the state -- to understand the choices, make sure those choices are clear, get the best possible professional advice on how to get the most results from our money, to make the best educational choices and to make sure that we've got able people at the right places in the organization."
David B. Frohnmayer, the president of the University of Oregon, who worked with Dr. Bartlett for nearly a dozen years in various capacities, called him "a very intelligent, very intense and extremely experienced higher education administrator" whose background in diplomacy will serve him well.
Yetta G. Samford Jr., an Opelika, Ala., lawyer who was a trustee when Dr. Bartlett headed the Alabama system, described him as "a person of superior intellect. He demands academic excellence."
Discussing Dr. Bartlett's managerial style, he said, "He lets his people have free rein as long as they keep within the mission that they've agreed on."
Even as a teen-ager, Thomas Alva Bartlett thought of a career in education. The youngest of the three sons of Cleave Bartlett, a auditor-bookkeeper and real estate broker, and the former Alma Hanson, a housewife, Dr. Bartlett was born in Salem, Ore., on Aug. 20, 1930.
At Salem High, he was student body president, a member of the football team, a champion debater and, he says with apparent modesty, "a pretty good student." He considered a future in politics or education.
"It seemed to me that it was a great big world out there that I didn't know nearly enough about, and I wanted to see it and experience it and find out as much as I could about it," he said. "In my opinion, that -- at that point in my life -- said education."
After graduation from Salem High in 1947, he spent two years on a Rotary scholarship at Willamette University and two years at Stanford University on a Newhouse Foundation scholarship before receiving a bachelor of arts degree, Phi Beta Kappa, in political science with an emphasis on international relations.
Next stop was Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, studying philosophy, politics and economics. He was granted a master's degree in 1953.
While working toward a doctorate in political science that he received from Stanford in 1959, he was recruited as an adviser to the United States Permanent Mission to the United Nations and remained there until 1963, when his work on Arab-Israel relations led to a proposal to become the president of the American University in Cairo.
He then was the president of Colgate and of the Association of American Universities, before assuming chancellorships in Alabama and Oregon.
Since 1954, he has been married to the former Mary Bixby, known as Molly, whom he met at Stanford.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Fall Moderately

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were moderately lower in fairly subdued trading yesterday, as a sales report by the Ford Motor Company showed continued strength in that sector.
According to some analysts, the market had been expecting the monthly sales data to dip slightly after the strong showing for August, but the first September figures out, those of Ford, were much stronger than expected. 
 Gerald A. Guild, a senior vice president and manager of the taxable fixed-income department at Advest Inc. said a malaise of pessimisism had infected the market, and as a result a decisive negative bias continued to be built into trading. "And the next test of that will be on Friday when the employment number comes out and in the week following when the inflation producer price and consumer price numbers are released," he said.
The reaction to the Ford sales numbers may have been exaggerated because of the recent strike settlement with General Motors, Mr. Guild noted. "The market may have seen that settlement as a victory for labor and saw the specter of higher labor costs and the negative prices pressures generated that could lead to higher inflation," he said.
Mr. Guild added, "But I see nothing magical about 8 percent on the long bond, and bet that rates have to come down."
Others are not so sure. George Mateyo, chairman of Carnegie Capital Management in Cleveland, which has assets totaling about $3 billion, sees the Fed moving to raise rates again within the next 60 days. So in the meantime he says, "You try to structure yourself to take advantage of it."
Many traders and investors yesterday avoided making any large commitment amid concern that any one report -- notably this Friday's employment numbers -- showing economic growth is too brisk might prompt the Fed to raise short-term rates sooner, rather than later.
The 30-year bond fell 10/32 , to 9521/32 for a yield of 7.88 percent, up from 7.85 percent on Monday and the highest since June 10, 1992, when it was 7.89 percent. Shorter bill rates on the other hand were mixed, with the three-month issue up 3 basis points, to 4.94 percent, and the six-month bill down one basis point, to 5.37 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Earlier in the day Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, in opening remarks at the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting in Spain, said he was concerned about the worldwide rise in interest rates, but that long-term rates in the United States were still lower than was typical for this stage of the expansion. His statement did nothing to soothe the market's frail nerves.
Traders said that yesterday's report on the index of leading indicators for August had little impact on the market, since most of the data that made up the index were already known.
The index was in line with market expectations, posting a six-tenths of1 percent increase, the highest reading since March. Nine of the 11 components registered increases in August.
In the corporate bond market, traders said, Eastman Kodak's plan to buy back up to $4.8 billion in outstanding debt could eventually give a lift to Treasury securities, particularly the short end, if and when those bondholders reinvest that cash.
Dean Witter, Discover, a former unit of Sears, Roebuck, sold $895 million of floating-rate and fixed-rate debt backed by Discover credit card receipts at a price of par to yield 35 basis points more than the one-month London interbank offered rate, which international banks charge one another for loans. Late in the day yesterday, the one-month rate was at 5.125 percent.
In another financing as rates rose yesterday, Sears sold $522.6 million of fixed-rate securities backed by credit card receipts in two parts through Goldman, Sachs. An issue of $500 million of the fixed-rate securities with an average life of 2.88 years was priced at $999.51 per $1,000 of bonds to yield 7.38 percent. The remaining subordinated securities with an average life of 3.4 years were priced at $999.41 per $1,000 of bonds to yield 7.74 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mostly Trades Lower But Is Steady Against Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading European currencies yesterday, following American bonds lower. But optimism about last weekend's trade accord between the United States and Japan kept the dollar steady against the yen. .
Prices of Treasury bonds fell yesterday after the Ford Motor Company reported a strong surge in vehicle sales in September. Such signs of a vigorous economy often disturb bond investors because rapid economic growth can produce inflation, which erodes the value of the fixed interest payments that bondholders receive. Currency traders, in turn, watch the American stock and bond markets to gauge foreign investors' appetite for assets priced in dollars. 
 "Lack of interest in U.S. assets will continue to hurt the dollar," said Peter Gloyne, manager of institutional foreign exchange trading at First National Bank of Chicago.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5465 German marks from 1.5543 marks on Monday. The dollar dropped to 5.2815 French francs, from 5.3020 on Monday, and to 1.2845 Swiss francs from 1.2927.
The dollar held its ground against the yen amid optimism that a partial trade agreement signed on Saturday would prevent a trade war between the United States and Japan. The agreement is considered the first step toward curbing Japan's $60 billion annual trade surplus with the United States, a gap that many currency traders consider the source of the yen's strength. The surplus means that Japanese exporters have a constant supply of dollars to sell for yen when they send profits home.
Negotiators from Japan agreed Saturday to increase Japanese Government purchases of American telecommunications and medical equipment and to reduce barriers to American insurance and glass products. The agreement, coming after 15 months of difficult talks, narrowly averted an imposition of American trade sanctions on Japan.
"A partial deal is better than no deal, and it's certainly better than a trade war," said Karl Halligan, a trader at CF-CIC Bank New York. "The dollar looks a lot more stable now than it did a month ago, that's for sure."
The dollar edged up to 99.65 yen in New York trading yesterday from 99.57 yen on Monday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Hog and Cattle Prices Fall As Supplies Remain Strong

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Hog futures prices fell to 14-year lows yesterday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, as record supplies continued to flood the market. Beef futures prices also collapsed.
On other commodity markets, copper continued higher and coffee futures jumped, while lumber sank and energy prices finished lower. Grain and soybean prices were mixed. 
 The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodity prices fell 0.74 point, to 230.30.
October live hogs fell 1.05 cents, to 35.20 cents a pound, the lowest prices for a nearby contract since 1980, Charles Leavitt, a livestock analyst with the Alaron Trading Corporation in Chicago, said. However, February frozen pork bellies rose 0.45 cent, to 39.27 cents a pound.
October cattle fell 0.57 cent, to 67.95 cents a pound, and October feeder cattle fell 0.25 cent, to 72.70 cents a pound. Beef and pork prices are slipping in the face of record total supplies. Demand has been high this year but not enough to keep up with increasing supplies.
"We've got a situation where productivity is going bananas," Mr. Leavitt said. "Cows and pork are getting heavier, thanks to farmers trying to get rid of record supplies of corn and soybeans and nowhere to put all this meat."
Lumber futures prices plunged on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Figures this week pointing to a robust economy are prompting fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to prevent inflation. Higher interest rates would slow home building and sales, which leads to fewer lumber sales.
December copper on the Commodity Exchange in New York rose 0.85 cent, to $1.15 cents a pound, as industrial demand remained high.
December coffee on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York rose 4.55 cents, to $2.14 a pound, on continued dry weather in Brazilian growing regions.
Energy futures prices ended lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, mainly on technical factors. November light sweet crude retreated 11 cents, to $18.08 a barrel. November home heating oil fell 0.49 cent, to 49.75 cents a gallon. November unleaded gasoline fell 0.32 cent, to 46.34 cents a gallon, and November natural gas rose 0.9 cent, to $1.69 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
N.H.L. Revises Its Proposal To Players

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Eleven days before Opening Night II, the National Hockey League presented its players with a revised proposal yesterday. Neither side offered details of the proposal, but a person familiar with the offer said it contained nothing the union could be expected to embrace as a way of ending the dispute.
Commissioner Gary Bettman made the revised offer in an effort to inject some impetus into the stalled talks and get the two sides moving toward an agreement that would enable the league to open the season on Oct. 15. That's the date Bettman set last Friday when he announced he was postponing the scheduled Oct. 1 start. 
 The person familiar with the alterations in the plan that would tax payrolls above the league average would say only that it gave the players a couple of points to check out. Another person said the league added a tax on gate receipts, borrowing from the players' proposal.
However, the first person said the proposal retained the maximum tax rate of 125 percent on payrolls that the union found offensive when the original proposal was made last week.
With the players essentially locked out of what they thought would be the first week of the season, when they would begin earning their salaries, they have chosen to stop working out. The urgency to forge an agreement thus becomes even greater because the longer it takes, the more time the players will need to brush up on their conditioning for league play.
Nearly seven hours after the negotiators resumed the talks that had broken off a week earlier, Bob Goodenow, the players' labor leader, held a short news briefing at the New York Hilton and said, "The league gave us a revised proposal to what they gave us last week."
Goodenow said the union would "analyze matters" last night and resume meeting with Bettman and his aides this morning.
"The best thing is we're going to be meeting again tomorrow," said John McMullen, owner of the Devils, who was one of four club representatives at the session.
Ronald Corey, owner of the Montreal Canadiens, said he liked the amount of time the two sides spent in discussing the revised proposal.
"They showed flexibility," Corey said.
How could he tell, since it was the owners who made the proposal?
"We discussed it a long time."
Unlike negotiations in previous years, owners and team executives had not attended bargaining sessions this year. But yesterday Bettman was joined by McMullen, Corey, Howard Baldwin, owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins, and Harry Sinden, president of the Boston Bruins.
"Having their presence is obviously a plus," Bettman said at his news conference. "It was important to me that to the extent they would be in a position to answer questions the players might have, they would be there. I had said previously we always would be happy to bring owners in. All they had to do was request it. This wasn't requested, but I figured what the heck, let's do it."
Goodenow said the owners' presence had "changed some of the communications, but I'm not going to get into that."
Bettman said the four men would attend today's session as well.
Goodenow and Bettman declined to characterize the talks or the proposal or the way in which it was revised. They said they agreed not to discuss it publicly.
Last week Bettman said the league had not made its best proposal. Asked if this was it, he said: "It's not realistic to respond to that in the course of collective bargaining. We made a proposal, the players are considering it. If this takes us down the road to a deal, it would be great."
When the negotiators met in Toronto last week, the league presented a new proposal, coming off a plan that would have levied two levels of taxes on team payrolls that rose above the league average. The first 10 percent of the amount over the average would have cost a team an equal amount, 100 percent, or a dollar for a dollar. Everything over that level would have cost a 200 percent tax, $2 for every $1.
The new plan also was a luxury tax but not as steep.
Under that plan, a team would be taxed 5 percent for every $250,000 over the average payroll, up to a maximum of 125 percent. Based on last year's payrolls, six teams would have been hit the heaviest under that tax structure.
The Detroit Red Wings and the Rangers would have paid the most, each contributing a sum equal to 20 percent of its payroll. The Red Wings would have paid $4 million on a $20.2 million payroll, the Rangers $3.965 million on a payroll of $20,172. The deductible would have been $14 million, the average payroll.
The money collected under any tax plan would be divided among the low-revenue teams. The league says it is imperative that these teams, such as Winnipeg, Edmonton and Quebec, be bolstered financially so that they can compete with the high-revenue teams.
"We need a system that will enable all of our teams to be competitive," Bettman said yesterday.
Nevertheless, it is not all that clear that all of the owners agree with that quest. Some owners have said their primary interest is in seeing to it that players' salaries are reduced. They say the escalation of salaries has inflicted the most economic damage on teams generally.

Help Us, Oh Help Us, We've Got Buildings

BYLINE: By Joe Lapointe 

 BODY:
One of the big issues in hockey's labor hassle is the suggestion that team owners share revenue. The players want the owners to redistribute some gate receipts so that wealthy clubs from big cities can help their less-fortunate partners in smaller markets.
The owners, represented by Commissioner Gary Bettman, have rejected the proposal, so far. Although they speak in generalities and provide few details, they insist they are losing money as a group, so why spread red ink? 
 Operators of two large-market clubs, the Philadelphia Flyers and the Montreal Canadiens, spoke recently of one major reason for keeping their cash to themselves. Both Ed Snider of Philadelphia and Ronald Corey of Montreal are building big new arenas with some 20,000 seats, trimmed with luxury boxes like frosting on cake. They say they need to pay for the buildings.
"I don't have any money to share," said Snider, adding that the Flyers lost "$3 million in cash" last season on revenues of $30 million.
"What do I have to share?" he said.
A skeptic might wonder about the $15 million Snider sent to Quebec in the 1992 Eric Lindros deal or about the $40 million a bank is paying him to put its name on Snider's new building.
When the National Hockey League Players Association looked at his financial statement two years ago, Snider said the union accused him of "hiding the money in the arena and the hot dogs and everything else."
He is offended at the thought.
"We're spending over $200 million to build a new arena," he said. "What's going to pay for it? The hot dogs! Not the players."
One reason for what Snider describes as his stretched financial state is that the Flyers haven't qualified for the playoffs for the last five seasons. Roughly two-thirds of N.H.L. teams make the tournament, where the biggest profits are made.
A business student might suggest that smart management succeeds and makes money while less-enlightened management enjoys less success, that there are always winners and losers in business, and that people who are failing should sell their business at a profit instead of investing in a new infrastructure.
Corey's Canadiens are considered among the shrewdest operations in hockey, and Corey has admitted "I made $8 million" in the last fiscal year. But he said the league already shares enough revenue from television and souvenir sales.
"We are making an investment of $200 million," he said, referring to the new Forum being raised in downtown Montreal. "My first objective is to pay for the building."
Moreover, he said, "you have to understand that not everybody has the same fixed costs," and that it costs more money to do business in places like Montreal and New York.
"We cannot see sharing gate revenue," he said. "Nobody's paying for my new building. We have no subsidies from anybody."
And what a fine new building it will be. It will have 135 luxury boxes, which sell for a minimum of $100,000 a year. All have been leased, and the leases will last 11 years.
Back in Philadelphia, Snider said the ones who suffer most are the fans.
"Every ticket in the lower level of the Spectrum is $50," Snider said. "I will not raise those tickets another dollar. We are pricing our great fans out of the game. My dream is when we open up that new building, to reduce ticket prices. Hopefully, the corporate revenues will give us enough revenue to do that for the average Joe out there."

 
 A student of elementary economics might suggest that most prices in a market economy are set by supply and demand. It might be suggested that if people keep paying $50 to see Snider's team not make the playoffs, the ticket prices will stay the same or go up, assuming that capitalism is working as it should. It will be interesting to see whether Snider makes good on his dream for the average Joe.
"This is about the fans," Snider concluded. "And it is about the players' meeting the owners halfway and solving the problems of this game."
Sounds fair enough. And it might help the fans and the players and the news media understand the problems of the owners if they would make public a little more financial data. Some sample questions:
What was your gross ticket revenue last season? What did you take in for luxury boxes? For advertising on signboards? For concessions? For parking? What were your operating costs, including salaries paid to members of the front office and to owners? How much did you take in from television and radio?
Are you including money from expansion teams as part of your financial statements? What is the line by line breakdown of your operating costs? What was your share of licensing revenue for N.H.L. products? What was your team worth when you bought it and what is it worth now?
Given enough data, the average Joe can add up the numbers.

HEADLINE: Quel Shock! The Italianization Of French Cuisine

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL 

 BODY:
FOR more than three centuries, France has set the international gold standard for fine restaurants. From lobster thermidor to beef Wellington, the nature of dishes was as immutable as the order in which each course was served, the arrangement of flatware as unyielding as the presence of sweet butter on the well-laid table.
So there is, understandably, much consternation at the growing Italian influence in haute bastions like Le Louis XV, Alain Ducasse's three-star restaurant in Monte Carlo. Increasingly, the menu offers more and more pasta, risotto and Italian-style vegetables. And last summer, the chef took the butter off the tables and set them with five different varieties of olive oil -- Italian olive oil. Quelle horreur! 
 "There are no borders anymore," said a retired inspector for the Michelin guide in Paris, who commented only on condition of anonymity. For a country that wears its epicurean superiority as proudly as some citizens wear their Legion of Honor pins, the blurring of national culinary borders is as inconceivable as the establishment of a single standard European currency.
Prominent chefs like Mr. Ducasse, Roger Verge and Paul Bocuse, who all admit a fascination with Italian cooking, are trend setters, crucibles in the continuing evolution of French cuisine. They acknowledge that the emergence of the casual Italian style in three-star restaurants may be due in part to its greater ease of preparation and lower cost.
But the consequences could be grave, the inspector said: it could eventually allow an erosion of the exacting French cooking techniques that are the bedrock of traditional cuisine.
Such fear wasn't fed by the last trend that rattled the haute table. With its Japanese influence, the nouvelle cuisine of the 1970's bred even more precision in the mighty galleys of France. Traditionalists bemoaned the style's wacky flavor combinations, and they chafed beneath the lightened sauces and unpredictable, idiosyncratic menus. But none feared for the future of French cuisine.
The Italian invasion is different. The increased use of olive oil and decreased deployment of butter in top French restaurants represents a change in cooking medium that strikingly affects the character of the dishes. The increased use of basil and tomatoes, of flat-leaf Italian parsley rather than the more delicate chervil, of garlic rather than shallots, transforms the flavor of dishes.
But traditionalists fear a change of mind-set more that a change of menu. The simple, direct Italian approach to cooking is antithetical to the precise, cerebral approach of classically trained French chefs.
"Italians are constitutionally incapable of complicating food, said Sirio Maccioni, the Tuscan-born owner of Le Cirque restaurant in New York. "It is against their mentality."
For the last decade, Mr. Maccioni has led dozens of notable French chefs, including Mr. Bocuse, Mr. Verge and Mr. Ducasse, on epicurean tours of Italy. "Tasting the wine, the Parmesan, the white truffles, the olive oil changed them," he said. "They began to appreciate simplicity." Gradually, Italian wines and white truffles crept into three-star restaurants.
Now, Mr. Ducasse said, "the Italian trend in French cuisine is spreading like an oil slick, an olive oil slick, of course."
He is proud to be in the vanguard of French chefs looking beyond geographic (and psychic) borders. "France has been too pretentious," he said. "Its refusal to listen to what's going on in the rest of the world is killing French cuisine. I am influencing a trend that is revitalizing cuisine."
But he is quick to add, "I am not an Italian restaurant!"
But of course. French chefs under the Italian influence remain, first and foremost, French chefs.
"We are still French, but now we are also European," said Mr. Verge, the owner of Moulin de Mougins and a consulting chef at the French pavilion at Epcot Center in Florida.
In his restaurant, as well as in his book "Roger Verge's Vegetables in the French Style" (Artisan Press), Mr. Verge's cooking has clearly crossed the Italian border. But along with other Francophiles who are enthusiastic about the growing Italian influence in French restaurants, he seeks to place this influence in a wider and less revolutionary-sounding context.
While some historians dispute the claim, it is popularly held by most French people that Catherine de' Medici brought the table fork as well as cooks and ingredients from Italy to France in 1533, when she married the man who would eventually become King Henry II, and that she introduced a seminal form of fine dining.
Even the historians who argue that the development of French cuisine wasn't instigated only by the culinary dowry of Catherine de' Medici acknowledge that her Florentine chefs brought superior ways with pastry -- a harbinger of culinary finesse -- to the French court. They also credit the Medici family with bringing artichokes, broccoli and savoy cabbages to the French table.
The historic exchange may account for the similarity between some French and Italian dishes -- as well as centuries-old disputes as to the origins of certain dishes. "Ravioli was originally from Nice," Mr. Verge said. "So was gnocchi."
Italian food historians like Faith Willinger, a cookbook author and owner of Cucina Toscana, a company in Florence that arranges custom food tours, point out that until the last century, Nice was a part of Italy. Nevertheless, French chefs under the Italian influence today employ such claims to emphasize their fundamental Frenchness.
Mr. Verge, for instance, doesn't deny that olive oil, vegetables and pasta have been given a new prominence on the French table. He merely hints that perhaps this is a renewal of a historic French tradition.
When Patricia Wells was gathering recipes for her Italian cookbook, "Trattoria!" (William Morrow & Company, 1993), she was struck by how closely many recipes echoed ones she had collected for "The Food Lover's Guide to France" (Workman, 1988). Ms. Wells said the similarities were strong, particularly in food from the south of France, which shares Italy's Mediterranean climate.
But the Italian influence is no longer limited to dishes served in modest bistros in the south of France. Mr. Ducasse said he could not think of one three-star restaurant in France today that did not offer a pasta dish and at least one dish prepared with olive oil. Moreover, a spate of Italian restaurants has opened in Paris, two of which, Paolo Petrini and Le Carpaccio, have become favorites of French chefs.
Ms. Wells, who is also the restaurant critic in Paris for The International Herald Tribune, calls these developments "a drop in the bucket." The French, she said "are never going to allow a major invasion of cuisine."
Jean-Yves Bonhommet, the editor of Saveurs, France's sleek and highly respected food magazine, agrees that "influence" should not be misconstrued as "invasion." In fact, he is uncomfortable with using the word "influence."
"I prefer to speak of 'co-existence of Mediterranean and French cuisine,' " he said. "How could one possibly cook a cassoulet with olive oil or serve Alsatian choucroute with olives? Some have tried, but with no great success."
He admitted that it was difficult to find a chef in France today who was not influenced by the Mediterranean but said that "one may think it Italian, but that is only because Italian cuisine has, more than any other, integrated the characteristics of Mediterranean cuisine."
In fact, dishes like Mr. Ducasse's ravioli made from bitter greens and even the vegetable compositions at Joel Robuchon in Paris are painstakingly precise, labor intensive French pronunciations of dishes from the Italian cooking vocabulary.
And noting this characteristic, Mr. Bonhommet said: "I am not at all worried about the future of French cuisine. On the contrary, it has blossomed in recent years."
Nevertheless, it is not clear that such French modulations will satisfy the growing appetite for Italian food in France or anyplace else in the world where "French cuisine" has until lately been synonymous with "the best." Part of that appetite, Ms. Willinger said, is the international impatience with the French "high-minded food for people who wear high heels" and the growing appeal of cooking that "is easily appreciated and best eaten in loafers."
Since tourists are significant supporters of top French restaurants, shifts in taste preferences are significant to three-star French chefs. And tourists and French nationals alike are less willing to pay dinner prices mandated by the enormous labor costs inherent in elaborate cuisine, the chefs interviewed said.
"There is a perception that Italian cooking is easier and more profitable," Mr. Verge said. He added that the shift to Italian techniques and ingredients began when the economics of restaurants began to tighten about 10 years ago.
While Mr. Verge maintains that cooking fine Italian food is as demanding as cooking fine French cuisine, strict traditionalists don't see today's Italian influence as the cosmopolitan touch to French cooking. They see it as the "dumbing" of cuisine.
"Anybody can make a plate of pasta," Julia Child, the American-born French cooking impresario, said in an interview last year. "You have to have some talent and training to make a fine French meal."
Even Mr. Maccioni has trepidations about the long-term effect of the trend toward Italian cooking in France today. The Italians, via Catherine de' Medici, may or may not have pushed the French to begin refining their cooking. But the French indisputably established the professionalism and technical expertise that, over the last 300 years, transformed fodder into cuisine. "If you create chefs who can make only pasta, pizza or a veal chop, eventually you lose an art," he said.
The international appetite for Italian food, he said, was in no small part nurtured in Manhattan, where over the last 20 years "Italian" has come to mean "elegant and hip and possibly healthy."
But he doesn't believe that Italian influence on French cuisine is economically determined. No, the fate of cuisine lies in the hands and palates of the cooks who train for about 20 years before presuming to call themselves "chef."
"The problem is that all they want to eat is Italian food," Mr. Maccioni said with the mixture of pride and remorse one would expect from an Italian native who owns a stylish French restaurant in Manhattan. "Oh, what have I done?"

Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about the role of the economy in the New York State campaign for governor misstated State Senator George E. Pataki's position on reducing the number of state employees. Mr. Pataki says he would fill only two-thirds of the job openings that occur each year, not that he would cut the workforce by a third.

HEADLINE: Quit Stalling on Trade Accord

 BODY:
The symbolism was apt. In the front row at a White House rally this week for GATT -- the international trade accord that the House leadership will try to bring to a vote today -- sat Lawrence Eagleburger, Secretary of State in the Bush Administration, and Brent Scowcroft, its national security adviser. Free trade is a bipartisan policy and, after the cold war, the country's foremost foreign policy. Trade binds disparate nations and creates wealth; the GATT accord is expected to raise world income by $500 billion, and American income alone by $100 billion.
That is why it is important for the House to stop stalling and approve the GATT accord today. The Senate -- because of the unconscionable opposition of a single textile-belt Senator, Ernest Hollings of South Carolina -- must wait until after elections to vote. Once the U.S. ratifies the treaty, more than 100 other nations are likely to follow soon. But delay plays into the hands of protectionists abroad.
Besides die-hard protectionists, some environmental and consumer groups also oppose the accord. These opponents worry that international dispute panels, which oversee enforcement of GATT rules, might undermine U.S. health, safety and environmental laws. But the threat is mostly fictitious -- as a ruling this week by such a dispute panel convincingly proves. 
 The European Union challenged U.S. laws that penalize manufacturers of cars with low average fuel efficiency (known as CAFE standards), tax such cars and tax high-priced cars. These laws, the Europeans claimed, target sales of their cars.
The dispute panel rejected the European claims because trade laws permit tough environmental standards if they do not unjustifiably discriminate against imports. Environmental protection, then, is O.K. but protectionism disguised as environmental regulation is not. Indeed, the panel proved the point by rejecting one provision of CAFE that separately treated foreign-built cars in order to block imports.
Beyond this single ruling, U.S. laws are well protected. Few countries, if any, are likely to challenge American laws and risk a trade war with the U.S. The gargantuan size of the U.S. economy provides a protection no trade accord or dispute panel can ever strip away -- guaranteeing that the GATT accord will generate huge benefits and no important threat.

HEADLINE: Mourning in Sitcomville

 BODY:
It is a sad day in Sitcomville. To say this is not to belittle the human loss that her real-life family is experiencing at the death of Harriet Nelson in California this week. For Mrs. Nelson, her husband, Ozzie, and their sons, David and Ricky, were also inhabitants of a mythic electronic community.
It seemed vaguely Californian. People wore sweaters at all seasons, and the hedges were always healthy. Inside the house the geographic location seemed less important than its commercial orientation. The kitchen looked like the kind of place where Betty Furness would feel comfortable touting the appliances. The cabinets seemed to be hiding food products that deserved to be praised in the golden tones of Ed Herlihy. 
 The economic base of Sitcomville was hard to figure out for folks who lived in industrial towns with round-the-clock shift work. Except for William Bendix on "The Life of Riley," there did not appear to be many clock punchers in Sitcomville. There were no strikes and lots of time off. There was a feeling that Mr. Nelson and Ward Cleaver, the father of the newcomer family in "Leave It to Beaver," worked in the same vague, clean commercial enterprise. They made a fair amount of money and came home early to ask their wives about snacks for the fellas who were coming over to play cards that night.
As far as the nation was concerned, Ozzie and Harriet's main role was not economic but psychological. They made the world less dangerous. The night that Ricky was allowed to imitate Elvis did more than launch Ricky's recording career. It also assured all the parents who took cultural signals from the Nelson living room that the hip-shaking menace from Memphis was a safe product to bring into their own homes.
That turned out to be less than totally true, but Ozzie and Harriet can hardly be blamed for that. By the time the neighborhood got raucous ("All in the Family," "Maude" and the grandiose dysfunctions of "Roseanne"), their boys were grown and the Nelsons themselves were retired.
There were some attempts to bring back the old days in Sitcomville with the retro sunniness of "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years." It was not quite the same. For one thing, the world would not stay as safely at bay as it did in the pioneer days in the video suburbs. In real life, Harriet Nelson lost Ozzie in 1975 and Ricky in 1985. She died in Laguna Beach, Calif., a nice enough place, but not nearly as comfortable as the town she and her husband invented for themselves and for America. It is an abandoned place now, its once proud bungalows, its shining kitchens, its flawless children and prattling couples exiled in the weedy back lots of Cableland.

HEADLINE: German Train Isn't the Fastest

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Germany's experimental magnetic levitation train is by no means the world's fastest at only 240 miles per hour, as you erroneously report Sept. 25. The French high-speed train, T.G.V. (train a grande vitesse), has bettered that speed on a number of occasions and attained 320.2 miles per hour during a test run in May 1990. Long sections of the new T.G.V. line south of Lyon were built for commercial service of 200 miles an hour at less than half the per-mile cost of the German Transrapid. 
 Since T.G.V. can also run on standard railways at lower speeds, the trains are not restricted to specialized, expensive rights of way as are all forms of magnetic levitation. The T.G.V. can enter urban areas on existing infrastructure and have access to many cities and towns served by rail lines.
One way to illustrate this would be to look at plans that have been developed for a Los Angeles-to-San Francisco, T.G.V.-style route, on which through service from off-line cities is contemplated.
True, the Germans have discovered how to lower the formerly very high energy consumption levels of magnetic levitation, but service to the many more areas that T.G.V. makes possible would lower total energy use for all transport modes, since travelers have deserted their automobiles and parallel airlines in great numbers wherever this service has been initiated.
This is one of the many reasons those Germans who are environmentally sensitive are fighting the use of $6 billion to build a single 170-mile Transrapid, when the same funds could easily pay for 500 miles of high-speed lines that are compatible with existing rail systems.
The already operational German high-speed ICE (intercity express) train does not go as fast as T.G.V. and is not as profitable; perhaps this has helped promote German enthusiasm for a shiny new attention-getter, whatever the cost to the environment. As in this country, the problems may be more psychological and political than technological.
In the United States, enormous Government subsidies to aviation and highway transport have long obscured the economy and efficiency of modern railways, which can easily outperform the other two inherently wasteful modes on a level financial playing field.
No wonder Southwest Airlines panicked when plans for a Texas T.G.V. were announced and used expensive lobbyists to defeat it.
One can only hope that recent news of worldwide climate shift because of carbon emissions will bring our "fly and drive" leaders to their senses.

HEADLINE: No Reaganomics Redux

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The return to Reaganomics espoused by most Republican candidates for Congress (editorial, Sept. 28) would saddle the Federal Government with huge debt increases and would jeopardize our economy. A balanced budget amendment is useless if combined with policies that add to the deficits. 
 Adam Smith warned in "The Wealth of Nations" that public debt endangers private wealth. The Republican core constituencies -- the wealthy and business executives -- would have the most to lose from the program that is advocated by those who would represent them in Congress.

HEADLINE: Evolution of the Workplace Alters Office Relationships

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RYE, N.Y.

 BODY:
The Giffnock Corporation, a small company just off Interstate 95 in Rye, N.Y., that rents office suites to itinerant business executives, is the kind of place that would give an organization man fits: it's a thoroughly modern office.
Most of the people working there are barely connected with one another. They work for large and small companies elsewhere or for themselves -- merely leasing their offices for a monthly fee. There's a foreign-currency trader for a big Wall Street brokerage house telecommuting in one office, just down the hall from a former I.B.M. executive trying to make it on his own. Freelance headhunters stalk the halls. 
 Giffnock's six employees exist in a new realm as well. They work at Giffnock (named for a small town in Scotland where the president's father was born), but all, including the president, George Russell, are employed by another company, which provides their benefits and signs their paychecks. They are leased employees.
"All the relationships that we've grown up with, they're all changed," Mr. Russell said.
Relationships are at the center of any workplace, and for decades the white-collar empires of the New York metropolitan area conferred stability and a certain predictable order on the universe of work. People made careers inside single companies, developed their internal networks and treated office mates as extended family.
But much of that universe is gone, management experts and psychologists say. Downsizing and layoffs have released tens of thousands of highly trained and educated executives onto the landscape, some of whom have alighted at places like Giffnock. Increasing reliance on temporary employment contracts, employee leasing and outsourcing -- where a whole department might be suddenly taken over by a specialized contractor -- have further fractured relationships, forcing people to reorganize their lives, make friends and relate to one another in subtle but fundamentally different ways.
"What's happening now is that people are feeling their way toward a new workplace and a new definition of what the corporation is," said Philip Anderson, an associate professor of business administration at Dartmouth University. "Whether you're downsized or outsourced, whether you're fired or continue to work, it'll be under a completely different relationship -- the idea of large numbers of white-collar people working in one corporation, moving up and getting a pension is a phenomenon of the 1950's that is drawing to an end."
Statistics support the view that businesses are becoming smaller, jobs more fleeting. In Manhattan, where large corporations still dominate the employment landscape more than just about any place in the nation, nearly 38 percent of the work force of 1.9 million in 1988 worked at a company that had 500 or more employees, according to State Labor Department figures. By 1993, that percentage had slipped to 33.9 percent.
At the same time, even as hundreds of thousands of jobs were being lost in the region, the numbers of temporary corporate cadres and leased employees were climbing. Between 1990 and 1993, 20,000 people joined the ranks of leased workers in New York and New Jersey -- a 17 percent increase in three years, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of companies in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut that specialize in placing white-collar executives in temporary contract jobs has nearly tripled since 1990, to 45 from 16.
At Drake Beam Morin Inc., a Manhattan-based concern that specializes in "individual and organizational transition," displaced white-collar workers are told up front that any job they get, in any company, should not be expected to last longer than three to five years -- if they are lucky and they stay on their toes.
"People have got to look at employment as a temporary assignment," said Barbara Collins, a senior vice president and managing director at the company. "If not, they'll get sucked right back into the old paradigm. With companies changing so fast, the person who is going to survive in all this is the one who can change in a heartbeat."
Stories of survival and adaptation abound.
Take Steven Bitterman. A former employee of Chase Manhattan Bank, he still sits at his same desk at the bank's downtown Brooklyn operations center, surrounded by many of the same co-workers, doing the same work he did before as a controller for the telecommunications department. But now he works for the AT&T Corporation. Over a weekend this spring, Mr. Bitterman's department was outsourced to AT&T, which now handles the bank's communications operations.
"On the Friday we went home Chase people, and on Monday we came in AT&T people," he said. "Some people actually changed mid-shift, at midnight."
Mr. Bitterman, who is 50, said that after 16 years inside one company, quickly adapting to another company's culture was stressful but eminently preferable to unemployment. "There was a little bit of joshing," Mr. Bitterman said. "They said, 'Now you're one of them.' "
The transient nature of work in the new office environment has disrupted the way people make and keep friends. On the other hand, if people no longer envision working together for decades, they do not have the same incentives for cutthroat office politics, since a once-coveted job like a manager's is probably the most tentative now.
Rhonda L. Miller, a human resources consultant who lives in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn, has been a migrant corporate executive since taking a voluntary severance package from the State Power Authority last year. Her network -- for friendship, support and business contacts -- is alive and well, but now it is mostly in her head and her Rolodex, friends who have stayed in touch and helped each other since leaving their jobs at the power authority.
The idea of long-term allegiance to any particular employer, she said, is obsolete. In the new world, informal associations of like-minded colleagues are everything.
"Where people used to be loyal to a company, now they're loyal to a profession," she said.
Another former power authority employee, Sandy Wells, a consultant in Austin, Tex., said the key to surviving in the fragmented office was to make friends in every job, because chances are you will meet somewhere else.
"It's not really a question of coming up through the ranks anymore," she said. "In a flattened organization, you jump."
Sometimes, the new order results in confusion. At Giffnock, a typist once complained that she was being sexually harassed on the job.
The accused harasser was not employed by Giffnock -- he was simply renting an office suite. And the typist, like all Giffnock staff members, also worked under the hybrid management -- Mr. Russell was her boss, but she was paid by International Charter, an employee-leasing operation, which also rents a suite at Giffnock.
Mr. Russell said he negotiated this jurisdictional jungle mainly through bluster. He and International Charter's president, Cleve Lynn, confronted the offender, who was apparently chastened.
Some companies take over the work of others while shipping out some of their own. Xerox, based in Stamford, Conn., has developed a niche by taking over other companies' mail rooms and print shops: sign the contract, and all your shipping, receiving and internal document production becomes a unit of Xerox. At the same time, the company has eliminated its telecommunications operation, outsourcing the operation to Electronic Data Systems, a unit of General Motors.
Freeport-McMoRan, a natural resources company in New Orleans, created a new company to handle its communications department and gave all the former department's 21 employees shares of stock in the company that now employs them.
"The boss, for all intents and purposes, who sits behind a 200-pound steel desk with a sledge hammer is dead -- and if he's not dead, we're all in trouble," said the new company's president, Garland Robinette.
Those experiencing these changes in the workplace voice a mixture of nostalgia, optimism, melancholy and ambition.
"It used to be that if you were with I.B.M., you'd bank with I.B.M. and have parties with I.B.M. -- I don't think that world exists anymore," said Douglas Shanks, who works on Long Island for I.B.M., which has been one of the region's most aggressive companies at trimming its staff and embracing new management and employment forms.
The price of those changes, Mr. Shanks said, is greater insecurity and probably some loss of company loyalty. The bittersweet reward is self-knowledge, he said.
"You immediately understand whether you have the right skills for the marketplace," he said.
Alan J. Klavans, a former senior vice president at Simon & Schuster, who rents an office at Giffnock for his one-man consulting and investment banking company, speaks fondly of the old days as well.
"I loved it at the time," he said. "I loved the Concord trips to England -- it's heady stuff."
And sometimes he feels that not so much has changed. He still works too hard.
"I told my wife I hadn't read a book in a while, and I didn't like it," he said. "I'm getting to be as busy as I was when I was with a big company."
 He was Steven Bitterman, a former employee of Chase Manhattan Bank, who still serves as a controller for Chase's telecommunications department but works for AT & T; he was not George Russell, president of the Giffnock Corporation.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN;
In Oklahoma's Senate Race, Both Candidates Are Running Against Clinton

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: OOLOGAH, Okla., Oct. 4

 BODY:
President Clinton is probably more unpopular in this state than in any other, says one of its Senators, David L. Boren, a Democrat who is retiring this year.
"When Bill Clinton ran for President, people here hoped he was one of them," Mr. Boren explained in an interview. "Our guy next door, they thought, New Democrat, a lot less liberal than Dukakis or Mondale or Carter. So he carried the state. Now they've decided he ran under false colors, and that has infuriated them." 
Which is why Representative Dave McCurdy, the Democrat who is running for Mr. Boren's seat, is so frustrated. The more he tries to suggest that he is a real New Democrat, unlike Mr. Clinton, the more his Republican opponent, Representative James M. Inhofe, portrays him as a Clinton clone.
If the President has a champion in Oklahoma this midterm election season, his voice is faint and his sword is dull.
Mr. McCurdy has not invited Mr. Clinton to come to Oklahoma to campaign for him. When he is asked whether he intends to, he replies that he has asked Garth Brooks, the country singer, instead.
A survey taken last weekend by Kielhorn & Associates, a Democratic consulting firm, put Mr. McCurdy six percentage points up; a poll completed only a few days earlier by Cole Hargrave Snodgrass & Associates, a Republican firm, gave Mr. Inhofe a five-point edge.
Gary Copeland, a political scientist and associate director of the Carl Albert Center at the University of Oklahoma, said he was "as confounded as anybody by the disparity." But he said he considered an Inhofe victory improbable because of the huge Democratic registration edge in the state and Mr. McCurdy's greater prominence.
The race here, one of a handful that will help decide which party controls the Senate for the last two years of the President's term, is like many this year, only more so. Few Democratic candidates are eager to embrace a President down on his political luck, and voters everywhere speak of their disillusionment with Mr. Clinton on questions like family values and personal responsibility.
"Every time the President has needed a vote," said Mr. Inhofe on Monday amid the heat and the din of the Liberty Glass Company factory in Sapulpa, near Tulsa, "Dave McCurdy has been right there with him -- on the budget, for example, and gun control."
Mr. McCurdy, a leader on Capitol Hill who succeeded Mr. Clinton as chairman of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, said he had been disappointed by what he termed the President's "screwed-up priorities."
"I've been critical of him from Day 1 on foreign policy," Mr. McCurdy said. "He should have been concentrating on Russia, China, Korea, the Middle East, but instead he's been messing around in Bosnia and Somalia and Haiti. I wanted more spending cuts, and I sponsored alternative health care and welfare reform bills."
Oklahoma is a deeply conservative state, especially on what voters term "the morality issue," a heading under which they group questions about the President's private life and topics like abortion, homosexuals in the military and prayer in public schools.
Mr. McCurdy's longtime friend, Representative Mike Synar, whom he has known since their undergraduate days at the University of Oklahoma, was defeated in the Democratic primary last month, in part because he stood with Mr. Clinton on the unpopular side of several of the big social issues.
Now Mr. McCurdy faces a similar threat. He has to "make sure," he conceded, "that the voters understand that Mike is more liberal than I am, exactly as Clinton has turned out to be."
When Mr. Inhofe visited an immense power station owned by the Public Service Company of Oklahoma today, he encountered a parking-lot full of pickup trucks with bumper stickers like "Sayonara Synar" and "Ban McCurdy and Not Guns."
Inside the plant, in Oologah (pronounced OO-luh-gaw), a small town about 25 miles northeast of Tulsa and the birthplace of Will Rogers, Mr. Inhofe found plenty of support. Marcus Dennis, a technician who was wearing a black electrical workers' union T-shirt, said he would back Mr. Inhofe because of his opposition to abortion and to gun control as well as his support of prayer in public schools.
Wayne Watts, a maintenance mechanic who conceded that he knew little about either candidate, said he would vote for Mr. Inhofe. Why? "Clinton supports homosexuals, that makes me sick, and McCurdy's for Clinton," he said. "I can't stand Clinton's wife, either."
But a third member of their crew, Darrell Mitchell, pressed Mr. Inhofe on his opposition to the President's health care plan, asking again and again what the candidate would do "for the guy who makes seven, eight dollars an hour and doesn't get insurance." He said later he would vote for Mr. McCurdy "on economic issues."
Such issues are one of Mr. McCurdy's best weapons. He noted in a recent speech that only 4 of Oklahoma's 77 counties were at or above the national average in income, and while he makes a bow to social concerns by talking about the importance of families as building blocks for society, he also emphasizes the need for better technological education as a step toward economic growth.
Mr. McCurdy, a Pentagon stalwart on the House Armed Services Committee and a captain in the Air Force Reserve who served in the Persian Gulf war, sells himself as the best hope of retaining the jet engine repair center at Tinker Air Force Base. Threatened with closing, it is the state's largest employer with 13,000 workers.
In talking to voters and in his television commercials, Mr. McCurdy has also gone on the attack surprisingly early against his opponent's personal probity and record as a businessman.
One topic is a life insurance company inherited by Mr. Inhofe that failed in the 1980's -- because of the recession, Mr. Inhofe says; because it was run into the ground by dubious investments, Mr. McCurdy asserts.Another is a lawsuit that Mr. Inhofe brought against his brother over the family business, and a third is the $588,000 a Federal court ordered him to pay the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in a dispute over a loan.
The character questions about Mr. Inhofe have been intensified by the recent disclosure that he received his degree from the University of Tulsa, not as he maintained in his published biographies, in 1959, but in 1973, when he was already in the State Senate.
Mr. Inhofe's somewhat uneven business experience has been echoed in his political experience. Before being elected to the House in 1986, he had failed in campaigns for governor, for mayor of Tulsa and for the House, and had been elected mayor three times.
Still, the Clinton problem haunts Mr. McCurdy. He said on Monday night that "without it, this thing wouldn't be close."
Picturing himself as a conservative Democrat like Mr. Boren, who has a reputation for independence of Mr. Clinton, Mr. McCurdy denounces Mr. Inhofe as a captive of the religious right. Mr. Inhofe has put up billboards asserting that Mr. McCurdy has voted with the President more often than Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, another Democrat in jeopardy this fall.
Mr. McCurdy can cite his role in helping to kill the President's proposed B.T.U. tax, hated in this oil- and gas-producing state, which is chronicled at length in Bob Woodward's book, "The Agenda." He can cite his early opposition to an invasion of Haiti.
But his votes for gun control and for federally financed abortions remain liabilities, as does his prominent role in helping to make Mr. Clinton President.
It is widely remembered here that when Mr. Clinton was in trouble early in 1992, beset by Gennifer Flowers's accusations and by the story of his draft avoidance, Mr. McCurdy took his military credentials and his clean-cut aura to New Hampshire and stumped for Mr. Clinton. Eventually, Mr. McCurdy campaigned for Mr. Clinton in 37 states and delivered a seconding speech at the Democratic National Convention.
Mr. McCurdy sought a major job in the Administration, preferably Secretary of Defense, but he was passed over, and the Clinton staff spread the word that he had tried too hard. Soon, Mr. McCurdy was openly criticizing Clinton policies, declaring as early as May 1993 that the Administration was proposing too many taxes and too few spending cuts.
Since then he has been seen in Washington political circles as a maverick. His chances for the Senate depend largely on whether he can sell that picture of himself to the voters of Oklahoma.

HEADLINE: Utilities See Costly Time Warp In '78 Law

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
The 1978 law that shook the utility industry seemed like a good idea to Congress. Aimed at reducing the nation's use of imported oil by spurring the development of alternative energy sources, it requires utilities to buy power from independent generators.
Now the industry is saying that the prices set for that electricity more than a decade ago are so high that utilities are paying hundreds of millions of dollars extra for power they no longer need, hurting stockholders and raising bills to consumers. 
 Utilities around the country are petitioning their state regulatory commissions, which Congress left to carry out the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, to lower these costs or allow them to renegotiate contracts with the independents. Under the law, utilities are required to buy most of the power generated by the independent plants.
The impact is most acute in New York and California, states that had wanted to cut their dependence on oil and provide incentives for a new industry to compete with regulated utilities. In New York, utilities signed hundreds of long-term contracts with the independents at state-mandated rates of about 6 cents a kilowatt-hour.
The Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, an upstate utility that serves 1.5 million customers, signed more contracts than any other utility in the state, but now says it generates all the power it needs and can buy more from other utilities at a rate of about 2.5 cents a kilowatt- hour. It has asked the State Public Service Commission for help in modifying the old contracts.
 "This is being watched by everyone in the industry," said Raymond E. Moore, the utility analyst for Dillon, Read & Company. "It could show whether regulators will provide a means for utilities to be able to adapt to competition."
The New York commission estimated this year that in 1997, seven of the state's utilities will pay $1 billion more because of the old contracts than if they were allowed to buy the power in the open market.
The independents counter that they risked capital to build the plants, in some cases enabling utilities to avoid spending billions of dollars to build plants themselves.
Lawrence J. Kostrzewa, senior vice president at Indeck Energy Services, which built a number of plants under the Federal law, including several with Niagara Mohawk, called the strategy similar to what many industries do -- enter into long-term contracts to buy commodities to guard against future price increases.
"They signed contracts that were a hedge against $40-a-barrel oil," he said. "Now they don't want to pay for the hedge."
When many of the early contracts were signed, oil prices were between $30 and $40 a barrel, with forecasts of big increases. And even as oil prices fell in the late 1980's, many analysts kept predicting an upturn. Instead, oil prices gradually declined further, hitting a low of $14 a barrel last year before recovering to about $18 this year.
State regulators around the country are trying to deal with the fallout from the policy. They must decide whether to grant relief to the utilities or continue to provide incentives to the independents, which have been responsible for 53 percent of the nation's new generating capacity in the last four years. About 7 percent of the electricity produced nationally comes from independents.
In 1978, the policy was seen as a logical response to the energy crisis earlier in the decade. Congress, trying to cut dependence on foreign oil, promised entrepreneurs who built generating stations that they could sell power to utilities.
The law required utilities to buy the power at a rate equal to what the utilities would otherwise have spent to generate it themselves. Many states set rates based in part on estimates of future oil and natural gas prices.
In 1979, before most states had established programs, the accident at the nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island, near Harrisburg, Pa., cast the future of nuclear power into doubt. Many utilities began to cancel plans to build nuclear plants.
As a result, the law also had the effect of giving these utilities a cushion of extra power to meet growing demand.
Then, as Eugene R. McGrath, the chairman of the Consolidated Edison Company, said recently, "The world changed."
Oil prices began to drop, and demand was much lower than expected. The long-term contracts that had set rates based on future fuel costs, with some projections of oil hitting $100 a barrel, no longer made sense to utilities. And with the recession in the early 1990's, utilities found themselves generating more electricity than they could sell.
"The projected demand and oil price contracts turned out to be much too high," Peter Bradford, chairman of the New York commission, said in a recent interview. He said the state was looking at ways to provide relief for utilities, such as reducing their state and local taxes or taking over the ownership of their high-cost nuclear plants.
In 1981, New York State had guaranteed independents a floor rate of 6 cents a kilowatt-hour. But in 1992, the state, then trying to reduce the program's impact, eliminated the floor rate for new contracts. No major new deals have been negotiated since then, but hundreds of old long-term contracts are still in effect.
But utilities fear that the high price they pay for power under those contracts will make them less competitive if the industry is eventually deregulated and customers can shop around for cheaper electricity. California is considering a move toward deregulation and other states may follow.
 In California, regulators are still pressing the major utilities to enter into new independent contracts, even as the state's utilities have excess capacity and can buy cheap power from other utilities out of state.
The struggle with these contracts is considerable at Niagara Mohawk Power. It receives electricity from about 150 independent generators, which supply about 29 percent of the utility's power.
Niagara Mohawk estimates that this power costs it an extra $350 million a year. That $350 million has been passed on to customers as higher rates, and the company estimates that as a result, its customers pay about 12 percent more for electricity.
A few weeks ago, however, the staff of the New York commission recommended that such pass-throughs be limited and that Niagara Mohawk begin absorbing some of the contract costs.
"Taking such an action would devastate the financial viability of the company," William E. Davis, the chairman of Niagara Mohawk, said in an interview. "These costs were largely imposed on us by the state government."
Wall Street, however, does not care whose fault it was. Its reaction was quick. Within a week of the staff's recommendation, Niagara Mohawk's stock price had dropped more than 20 percent, from $15.50 a share to $12. The Standard & Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Service put the company's bonds on credit watch. The stock closed yesterday at $13.125, down 25 cents.
What riles Mr. Davis is that the same commission promoted the use of the contracts in the 1980's, brushing aside warnings from management at the time.
William J. Donlon, a former Niagara Mohawk chairman, sent a letter in 1987 to Mr. Bradford, the commission's chairman, warning that the utility was getting locked into more contracts with such plants while it could buy power elsewhere at about half the cost.
Typical of such projects was a plant that Indeck Energy proposed in 1988, which would burn natural gas and provide steam for an International Paper Company plant in Oswego, N.Y. Indeck's excess power was sold to Niagara Mohawk under the state program for about $20 million a year.
Ralph Leidy, the manager of the Indeck plant, said that it ran at capacity most of the time because Niagara Mohawk had to take all the power the plant generated.
"The more efficiently we run, the better the profits for the company," he said.
The utility estimates that unless it can renegotiate contracts with Indeck and others, its customers will pay about $3 billion more for power between now and the year 2008.
Consolidated Edison is in a similar bind. The company decided about three years ago to buy out some of its contracts, paying independents about $170 million not to build six plants that would have provided it with 580 megawatts of power. Mr. McGrath, Con Ed's chairman, estimated it would have cost $150 million more annually for the next 20 years had the utility bought the power.
But such contract buyouts cause much debate because regulators must decide whether the costs should be passed on to customers or shouldered by shareholders.
Abraham Glezerman, chief executive of Inter-Power, an independent power producer in Colonie, N.Y., said that instead of trying to kill new plants and long-term contracts, utilities should close their old, polluting coal plants and nuclear plants that produce high-cost power.
"We can produce electricity better, cheaper and with less pollution," he said.
 Niagara Mohawk Power, 11.4 cents; Consolidated Edison, 14.5 cents; New York State Electric and Gas Corporation, 11.8 cents; Long Island Lighting, 16.8 cents; Orange and Rockland Utilities, 14.3 cents; Rochester Gas and Electric. 11.4 cents; Central Hudson Gas and Electric, 11.3 cents.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The U.S. and Japan are happy, but the trade truce is fragile.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
DETERMINED American trade negotiators bargained into the wee hours with their equally determined Japanese counterparts and, miracle of miracles, both sides went to bed happy. For what Gary Saxonhouse, an economist at the University of Michigan, calls "an artful compromise" allowed both to claim victory at a moment neither could afford defeat.
The catch is that the agreement does nothing to dispel the myth that Japan and America are engaged in a Darwinian economic struggle one or the other must lose. And that virtually guarantees continuing friction over trade. 
 The agreement marks a timeout in the bitter trade confrontation between the Clinton Administration and a series of weak Japanese governments. It began with a demand by the White House that Japan set numerical targets for growth in imports -- a demand justified as the only way to get the wily Japanese to keep their promises, and resisted as a step toward carving world markets into government-directed cartels. It was settled with some practical moves to assure foreigners a better shot at the Japanese markets for medical and telecommunications equipment, insurance and plate glass.
What makes the agreement artful is that it also gave American advocates of managed trade a symbolic victory without guaranteeing market shares or rates of import growth. In insurance, for example, the Japanese agreed to speed approval of new sorts of policies and allow independent brokers to serve as go-betweens -- measures that should increase American sales because American insurers lead the world in marketing savvy. Medical equipment, largely purchased by the Japanese Government, is to be judged by quality as well as price, a move seen as giving American makers of super-expensive, high-tech gadgetry a leg up on Japanese competitors.
The big concession to the managed traders is to consider the pact successful only if imports rise. But that is well short of the infamous deal that divided the Japanese market for computer chips in the 1980's. For one thing, it does not require more regulation of private enterprise. For another, the growth of Japanese imports is nearly a sure thing anyway because the overvalued yen buys so much more abroad than it does at home.
Not surprisingly, spin masters on both sides are working overtime to extract earthshaking news from modest events. Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's unwieldy coalition, facing increasingly organized opposition from reformers, needed to prove their leader could stand up to Washington. President Clinton, bloodied in the health care battle, needed a victory to stave off a Republican sweep in the November elections and to keep alive prospects for ratifying the GATT pact.
Spin, however, can only go so far to obscure some unpleasant realities. Japan's rejection of imported auto parts on the ground of consumer safety plays into the worst fears of Japan-bashers: very, very few auto injuries in America are related to mechanical failure.
By the same token, notes Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, America's reluctance to take the case to the new World Trade Organization advertises a lack of commitment to rules-bound dispute resolution. Indeed, the day America announced the investigation of Japan's unfair trade practices in auto parts, a GATT panel ruled in favor of Washington in its dispute with Europe over mileage standards for imported cars.
In Mr. Lawrence's view, there is an almost tragic tendency for America and Japan to talk past each other on trade matters. Just as Japanese policy makers seemed to accept the idea that it was in Japan's long-term interest to deregulate markets, he notes, America embraced managed trade as the trade cure of last resort.
Most disturbing is the apparent decision by the White House to minimize the impact of the only Japanese action likely to reduce the trade imbalance noticeably: a delay of a sales tax increase that had been proposed to offset scheduled income tax cuts. That delay will stimulate domestic purchasing power, diverting Japanese goods from export markets and sucking in imports.
Japan would probably have postponed the tax increase, with or without American pressure: higher consumer taxes are anathema to the left wing of Mr. Murayama's ruling coalition. Still, the American silence is evidence of how few movers and shakers in the Clinton Administration understand the overriding importance of fiscal and monetary measures in balancing trade -- and how those who do have given up trying to explain the point to Congress or the public.
All this augers poorly for relations with Japan. Exhausted negotiators have retired to toast their accomplishments in defending domestic interests. But the truce is fragile, and bound to be shattered before long if Americans persist in blaming Japanese perfidy for their economic ills.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: PATAKI;
Pataki's Tax-Cut Plan: How to Pay for It?

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
How much can New York afford to cut state taxes?
With just a little more than a month before the election, that question encompasses the central debate between the two major candidates for governor. And at the heart of that debate is the question of how the Republican candidate, State Senator George E. Pataki, can pay for his plan to slash personal income taxes, saving taxpayers at least $5.6 billion a year by 1998. 
 Mr. Pataki says it can be done by curbing the growth of state spending. But his own campaign promises would make that difficult, if not impossible, many experts say. The only places left to find the money he needs, they say, are in government support programs for the poor and economic development subsidies for big business.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo agrees that taxes should be reduced but has delayed releasing all the details of his own, much more modest, $1.5 billion tax-cut proposal in an effort to keep the focus on Mr. Pataki's plan.
Mr. Cuomo, who yesterday termed the Pataki plan "a con job," insists that it would inevitably push local taxes higher to make up for lost state revenues. Of his own tax plan, the Democratic Governor said yesterday that he would reduce the top income tax rate for most people, but he declined to say how he would pay for it. [Page B13.]
To independent analysts, significant tax cuts may be within reach, but only if Albany is prepared to reduce spending across a wide array of popular government services that in the past have proved largely immune to attack. The job is made much more difficult because the state itself only spends directly about a quarter of the money it raises; most of the state's money goes for local school aid and to localities and nonprofit organizations for social services, including Medicaid.
"How many state troopers can you cut?" said Michael Brooks, a former state budget analyst who said he is a Democrat but who worked for a Republican state comptroller. To reduce state income taxes by as much as Mr. Pataki wants, said Mr. Brooks, now a municipal bond specialist at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a Wall Street investment house, "the only place you're going to be able to achieve savings of that magnitude is by cutting state aid to education. And if he's not prepared to cut there, where is he prepared to cut?"
Indeed, on the campaign trail, Mr. Pataki seems to be finding it a lot easier to add than subtract. He has vowed to increase state support for schools, avoid cutting aid to local governments, provide property tax relief, bolster law enforcement, even restore some previously lost funds for day care. Yet, to fulfill his promise to cut New Yorkers' top income tax rate of 7.875 percent to 5.9 percent over the next four years, Mr. Pataki says he must prevent government spending from growing faster than the rate of inflation.
How is all that possible? Other than suggesting a few relatively painless cuts in state patronage jobs and a crackdown on waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid and welfare, Mr. Pataki is not yet saying.
The unacknowledged prime target, Republican supporters of Mr. Pataki say, must be billions of dollars to be squeezed from the costly Medicaid program that provides health care for poor people, nursing homes for many not-so-poor people and a host of other medical services for the mentally ill and disabled. "There is no good reason," Mr. Pataki said last week, "why Medicaid should cost three times as much per patient in New York as it does in California."
Edwin S. Rubenstein, an economic columnist for National Review who is close to those who are running the Republican campaign for governor, said that reining in Medicaid spending -- while long overdue -- would not come without pain.
"New York has the most generous eligibility rules and provides more optional services than any other state," Mr. Rubenstein said. "So cutting back does not mean you have to bash the poor. But it would affect the medical establishment and the more affluent. The income rules on nursing homes, for instance, have become so easy to get around that Medicaid has become an unacknowledged entitlement for the middle class. That's not just unneccessary, it's immoral."
So far, however, in decrying Medicaid's excesses, Mr. Pataki has carefully avoided specifics. Instead of saying which services now provided by Medicaid would be eliminated, or whose benefits should be reduced, he has proposed administrative reforms that his staff says would save perhaps $300 million. But the program currently costs the state $6 billion, and that cost is increasing at least 10 percent a year. (Albany and local governments, which now pay more than $4 billion a year, share the expense of half of the cost of Medicaid that is not paid by the Federal Government.)
"Something has to give," said Steven Gold, director of the Center for the Study of States in Albany. "On the spending side, I don't see how you get from here to there."
To meet his vow to keep the growth in state spending under the rate of inflation -- expected to average about 3 percent a year -- Mr. Pataki would have to put Albany in a fiscal straitjacket. He said that is exactly what he intends to do.
"I will put in place a real cap on state spending," he said. "We are no longer going to add up all of the spending demands of every special interest in Albany and then raise taxes on the hard-working people of this state to pay the tab."
But a look at the state budget shows the difficulty of keeping spending in check. In the fiscal year that runs through March, the state plans to spend $43.3 billion of what it collects in taxes and fees. To keep spending from outpacing the expected inflation rate, next year's budget could not exceed $44.6 billion, giving the state as much as $1.3 billion extra to spend.
That may sound generous, but all of it and more would quickly be chewed up by commitments that the state cannot easily escape and promises that Mr. Pataki has already made.
To begin with, $10 billion comes from special assessments dedicated to particular purposes like road building and mass transit, making it practically impossible to cut the spending without also cutting the revenue that supports it.
Beyond that, the state is already obligated to start paying back pension funds, at a cost of almost $170 million next year; to provide an extra $169 million for preschool children of the handicapped, and to increase school aid by an additional $166 million.
Mr. Pataki's campaign promises are also adding up fast. At a stop in Manhattan on Monday, for example, he told Republican legislators that he wanted state support for local schools to keep rising as it has over the last decade, or roughly double the inflation rate. "I would like to see education aid increase," he said. "I want to see us do everything we can to remove the burden from the property taxpayer, particularly for the funding of education."
To increase the $9 billion Albany now funnels to schools by 6 percent would add more than $500 million to the state budget next year. That alone would eat up 38 percent of what Mr. Pataki would allow spending to grow by.
Adding it all up, the state faces a potential budget gap of at least $2 billion next year and more than $3.5 billion by the fiscal year that starts in April 1996.
"Unless the economy booms in an unprecedented way," said Frank Mauro, executive director of the labor-supported Fiscal Policy Institute, which traditionally has opposed tax cuts, "the next several years will bring more of the same: a structural deficit that undercuts both the programs that allow the state's neediest residents to keep their heads above water and the services essential to the quality of life for all, while putting unwarranted pressure on the regressive property and sales taxes upon which local governments must rely."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Unveils a Few New Tax-Cut Details

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Oct. 5

 BODY:
With a trickle rather than a splash, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo continued to disclose some details about his tax-cutting plans today, proposing a cut in the top personal income-tax rate that he said would benefit almost all the New Yorkers who pay that rate now.
The Governor proposed lowering the top tax rate to 7 percent from its current level of 7.875 percent for middle- and upper-middle-income earners, a reduction that eventually would be worth $600 million. But he would not say how long it would take to phase in the cut or what spending he would eliminate to pay for it. 
 The cut would bring the top tax rate to the level promised in a 1987 law signed by Mr. Cuomo. The last phase of that three-year reduction has been deferred by Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature for five consecutive years because of the recession.
Mr. Cuomo also said today that he wanted to lower the state's tax on utility revenues from 4.25 percent to 2 percent and to insure through state laws that the gains would be passed along to ratepayers.
At the same time, Mr. Cuomo unleashed a blistering attack on State Senator George E. Pataki's more ambitious tax-cutting plan, calling his Republican rival's proposal "a con job" that would devastate local governments and schools.
Mr. Cuomo argued that Mr. Pataki's assumption that New York's revenues would grow at 6 percent next year is transparently faulty and suggested that the Republican is promising tax cuts he knows he will not be able to deliver.
"I will not cheapen our government and insult your intelligence by trying to fool you with empty promises so I can win the right to disappoint you next year," he said.
Mr. Pataki, who spent the day campaigning in Staten Island, the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn and Maspeth, Queens, responded: "Mario Cuomo has no credibility on the tax issue, coming up with a plan four and a half weeks before the election. It's a plan that sounds like he just made it up in response to ours."
Also today, Democratic officials said that former Mayor David N. Dinkins would endorse Mr. Cuomo in Manhattan on Thursday. Mr. Dinkins has said for months that he planned to endorse the Governor, but the enthusiasm of the former Mayor's embrace -- or the lack thereof -- may send an important signal to black voters and other Dinkins loyalists in New York City.
Mr. Cuomo spoke today to several hundred people in an auditorium at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, a state facility where the state Dormitory Authority is financing $241 million in renovations and new construction. Mr. Cuomo has showcased the hospital and research center in a campaign advertisement.
The Governor had originally planned to fully outline his tax-cut plan in today's speech. But in a strategic decision, he drew back in an effort to keep attention focused on the plan that Mr. Pataki unveiled last week. The Cuomo campaign has depicted that plan, which promises tax cuts worth $5.6 billion a year by 1998 in a general-fund budget that is currently $32 billion, as an irresponsible and cynical play for votes.
Mr. Pataki has said that some top taxpayers would see their taxes drop by 25 percent. But he has provided only the vaguest information about how the state would afford such a massive reduction in revenues.
Mr. Cuomo told reporters after his speech that he preferred to let the news media continue to explore that question, rather than engaging in a tax-cutting duel.
"It hasn't really been fully explicated," he said of Mr. Pataki's plan. "I want to give him plenty of room. I don't want to get you all busy with my detail before seeing his, you know."
And yet, Mr. Cuomo made incremental progress in outlining his own plans. His speech marked the fourth time since August that the Governor has revealed pieces of his plan without fully explaining it.
He first disclosed that he would cut taxes up to $1.5 billion over an unspecified period. Then he announced that one of the taxes he would cut would be the gross-receipts tax on utilities. Then he announced that his other two tax cuts would be a reduction in the personal income tax for some payers and an increase in the income-tax credit for those with high property taxes. He still has not provided any detail about that element of his plan.
Under the income-tax cut Mr. Cuomo proposed today, the top income-tax rate would drop to 7 percent for married taxpayers with taxable incomes above $26,000 but below $100,000, and for single taxpayers with incomes above $13,000 but below $50,000. Currently, all married taxpayers who earn more than $26,000 and all single taxpayers who make more than $13,000 pay the top rate of 7.875 percent on income above those levels. Under Mr. Pataki's plan, the top rate would drop to 5.9 percent by 1998, and the top tax bracket for a married couple would rise from $26,000 to $50,000.

HEADLINE: Mayor Moves To Cut Role Of Legal Aid

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
Striking Legal Aid lawyers returned to work yesterday, but Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani insisted that he would not restore the nonprofit Legal Aid Society to its position as the primary defender of the poor in the city's packed courts.
Contending that the city should not be subject to lawyers' strikes, Mr. Giuliani said he would be looking for alternative arrangements to the Legal Aid Society in some city courts, suggesting that new options could be tried in Queens and Staten Island. 
 "We will not be having a primary, singular service deliverer for accused criminals who want representation or even indigents," the Mayor said.
Several leaders of the city's municipal unions, who had watched the tug of war, expressed relief that the strike had ended without broadening into a long, polarizing labor confrontation. But one union leader conceded that the Mayor had won a victory that would make bargaining more difficult next year when all municipal contracts come up for renegotiation.
"It makes our fight tougher," said Arthur Cheliotes, the head of Local 1180 of the Communications Workers of America, which represents about 10,000 city administrators.
Although Legal Aid lawyers work for the Society and are not city employees, the Society gets $79 million a year from the city, and the Mayor had said he would not accept wage increases during a time of fiscal hardship. Instead, he said he would cut off the city's 28-year contract with the Legal Aid Society.
Disillusioned and grim Legal Aid lawyers spent much of their day back at work yesterday arguing among themselves, many admitting that their strike had boomeranged to the advantage of the Mayor. [Page B7.]
The Mayor declined to endorse the tentative contract agreement hammered out Tuesday night between the lawyers' union and the Legal Aid Society, under which the lawyers would receive bonuses of 2 percent in each of the next two years.
"If there's room for a raise then that would mean there's probably room for a reduction in the amount of money that we supply for the Legal Aid Society," Mr. Giuliani said, "unless it can be demonstrated to us that's going to be done through productivity, with the productivity first demonstrated and produced rather than paid for up front."
At a union meeting last night, the lawyers voted 544 to 150 to accept the agreement. Participants said there had been emotional speeches both to accept the contract and to return to the strike.
"We're the best lawyers in this city," said Michael Z. Letwin, the president of the lawyers union. "We take pride in the fact that these lawyers represent poor people not for the money but because we believe in it."
The lawyers, seeking a 4.5 percent wage increase over two years, walked off the job Saturday after their contract expired. But confronted with an ultimatum by the Mayor to return to work or be replaced, union leaders agreed to a deal Tuesday night that was close to the offer they had originally rejected.
The average salary of the lawyers is $45,000 a year.
The bonuses in the new contract are similar to what the Legal Aid Society had previously offered. But while the management had sought higher payments by union members for health care, medical payments would remain at about current levels in the first year and then be submitted for arbitration the following year.
"I think this is a much better package than the original," said Mr. Letwin, the union president. He said his members also won some non-economic concessions such as a union management committee to examine workloads in some areas.
Still, it was far from clear whether Mr. Giuliani would approve the new terms, and whether Legal Aid would end up with anything near the city financing it had before the strike caused the Mayor to terminate the city's contract. Last year, the society received $79 million from the city for criminal work alone and provided the lawyers to represent about 60 percent of indigent defendants.
The Mayor said yesterday that the city might not provide enough money to Legal Aid to pay for the bonuses it had negotiated with the lawyers and the raises planned for its managers. "It may very well be that the city can save money by not funding all that," he said, adding, "It leaves a lot of options open."
The Mayor did not explain further how he would find other lawyers for the poor, and Katherine N. Lapp, his criminal justice coordinator, said it was "premature" to say what options would be considered. On Monday, the Mayor had said the city could consider setting up a public defenders office or contracting for lawyers with the city bar association.
Paul S. Goldstein, the president of the Queens County Bar Association, said that he had had no inquiries from the Giuliani administration. "We have an active private bar which may distinguish us from other counties," he said. "But to contract with us on a fee basis, I don't know, because we'd have to see what they're prepared to spend."
Many indigent defendants are already represented by private lawyers who charge the city by the hour under what is called the Assigned Counsel Plan. Their bills were expected to reach $50 million this year. But several months ago, the Giuliani administration had proposed giving the bulk of that criminal caseload to the Legal Aid Society in a cost-saving effort.
In a letter sent to the Legal Aid Society last night and released publicly by the Mayor, Ms. Lapp said the administration would also require that any new agreement with the Legal Aid Society include a provision granting the city the right to impose penalties if lawyers strike and a clause requiring "that lawyers who breach their ethical obligations to clients be terminated." Mr. Giuliani had called the strike a breach of ethics.
Ms. Lapp has said that the lawyers who return to work will be paid at the rate of the existing contract while the administration negotiates with the Legal Aid Society. She said, "This payment arrangement can continue only until such time as either new contracts are negotiated or we are unable to amicably agree upon future contractual relationships."
Pat Bath, a spokeswoman for the Legal Aid Society, said that if the city substantially reduced the size of its contract with the society, it might have to dismiss many of its 1,131 lawyers. "He would be telling us we won't have as much work and then we wouldn't need as many people to do as much," she said.
But Mr. Letwin, the union leader, expressed confidence that Legal Aid would still prove the best alternative for representing indigent clients. "We think it's clear that the society's the most cost-effective and best quality in the city," he said, "and I think we have a lot of allies on that."
The showdown between the Mayor and the Legal Aid lawyers came at a time when the city faces a $1 billion budget gap this year and multi-billion-dollar annual deficits for the foreseeable future. Mr. Giuliani used the strike to emphasize that he would be granting no wage hikes for several years, unless paid for through increased worker productivity.
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President who had rallied to the side of the striking lawyers, yesterday accused the Mayor of using the lawyers' dispute to distract the public. "There are major budget problems afoot and perhaps the Mayor's looking for a way to keep his and everyone's mind off of them," said Ms. Messinger, a Democrat who is considered a potential challenger to the Mayor in 1997.

HEADLINE: G.S.A. Chief Undergoes Inquiry Into Use of Staff

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
One of the highest-ranking Republicans in the Clinton Administration, Roger W. Johnson, is being investigated after he was accused of using top aides for personal errands.
Mr. Johnson, who heads the General Services Administration, the Government's chief landlord, is under investigation by his agency's Inspector General. He has been accused of using subordinates to carry out personal tasks for him, like taking his Mercedes to the car wash. 
 In a statement released today, the agency officials described Mr. Johnson's troubles as "inadvertent actions occurring during his transition from 35 years as a private sector executive to public service."
The statement said, "As Mr. Johnson became aware of any actions which were inappropriate, he took full responsibility for the infractions and insured that similar actions did not recur."
Mr. Johnson became the agency's administrator in July 1993 after spending a decade as president and chairman of the Western Digital Corporation in Irvine, Calif. He had been a regular contributor to Republican candidates but broke with the party in 1992 over its economic policies.
Besides the taking of his car to be washed, the investigation is looking into accusations that Mr. Johnson used agency employees to wait at his home for deliveries and repairmen, and to handle his personal correspondence.
Agency officials declined to comment further because of the investigation. For now, the White House is taking a similar approach to the matter.

HEADLINE: Markets Plunge, but Dow Loses Only 13.79

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
American and European financial markets shuddered yesterday, with United States stock and bond markets plummeting so far and so fast as trading in New York opened that their counterparts in London, Paris and Frankfurt, nearing the end of their sessions, suddenly buckled.
After falling as much as 53 points, the Dow Jones industrial average recovered late in the day and closed at 3,787.34, down 13.79 points, for only an 0.36 percent drop. But the damage was already done. British stocks fell 1.5 percent, German stocks, including after-hours trading, dropped 2.16 percent, and French stocks plunged 2.26 percent. 
 Bond prices fell and yields rose sharply to smoke out buyers, who nonetheless continued to refuse to buy bonds in volume. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond came perilously close to an 8 percent yield, finishing at the end of the day in New York at 7.95 percent, up from 7.88 percent.
Bond yields across Europe soared, with French yields reaching a 22-month high and German yields a 25-month high.
The worsening market performance in the United States is coming ahead of what is normally market-moving economic data, like the monthly unemployment figures due tomorrow, the Producer Price Index due Oct. 13 and the Consumer Price Index Oct. 14.
And the American outlook -- characterized by a weak dollar, rising yields for bonds and sharply declining stock prices in heavy trading -- has spread to Europe at a time when local factors, like German political uncertainty, were already driving stock and bond prices down there.
The nub of traders' anxiety on both sides of the Atlantic, some anlaysts say, is the Federal Reserve's decision last week to forgo raising interest rates, contrary to what many traders had come to expect.
Traders are thus anticipating the next rate increase by bidding down the prices of stocks and bonds to cushion the blow of the expected interest-rate action. But the most pessimistic of traders seem to be imagining ever-darkening worst-case scenarios and thus refusing to buy either stocks or bonds.
The source of the market pessimism is clear. With a steadily lengthening list of Government and private-sector reports indicating a quickening rather than a slowing economy, traders are wondering whether the Fed is "behind the curve" and too slow to act against inflation. The more pessimistic traders now see two Fed rate increases by year's end, rather than one, as expected only two weeks ago.
Tomorrow will be an especially nerve-jangling day for the financial markets because the Labor Department releases data on job creation. A number close to or above 300,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs in September could indicate enough economic strength that the Fed may have to raise rates immediately, said Neal M. Soss, co-founder of Soss & Cotton Enterprises, a market research and private investment firm. While stock and bond prices are sure to plummet, traders may find themselves feeling better because the Fed had finally acted.
"The market will want a number that is cathartic," Mr. Soss said. "If it isn't cathartic, if it's ambiguous, then it will just fill the market with dread and foreboding."
The Dow fell so far and so fast that the New York Stock Exchange's "circuit breaker" rules, designed to slow high-speed computer-guided trading, kicked in at 12:29 P.M. But the Dow, as well as the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite index, spent the rest of the day recovering lost ground.
By the end of the day, the S.& P. 500 fell only 1.07 points, to 453.52, and the smaller-company Nasdaq fell 1.02 points, to 746.28.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 360.3 million shares changing hands.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.10 points, to 250.36, with advancing stocks lagging declining stocks by 543 to 1,761. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 2.70 points, to 451.11.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 19 fell, led by Alcoa, which dropped 1 3/4, to 82 3/4. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 302 fell, led by AT&T, which lost 3/8, to 52 1/4.

HEADLINE: New Study On Jobs: Good News To Whitman

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., Oct. 5

 BODY:
A quickening pace of job growth is helping New Jersey lead the region out of the recession, but the job recovery lags behind the national growth rate. That's what two Rutgers University economists told an audience of New Jersey business people here today.
The figures compiled by James W. Hughes and Joseph J. Seneca for the State Data Center's annual economic conference are good news for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. If current trends hold, the two predict, the state will have recovered all of the 262,000 jobs lost in the 1989-92 recession by early 1997, the year Mrs. Whitman could be expected to run for re-election. 
 The economic update, which attracts business people from around New Jersey, is an annual event of the state's economic statistics service, which is part of the State Department of Labor. Those who attended the conference also heard presentations today from the state's business development agencies and from Governor Whitman's special panel to improve New Jersey's business climate. Today's event therefore had the quality of an economics seminar with a distinct whiff of business boosterism.
From May 1993 to May of this year, New Jersey ranked 35th among the states in job growth with an annual rate of 1.6 percent, while New York ranked 46th with 0.8 percent growth and Connecticut, beset by defense industry cutbacks, ranked 48th with 0.4 percent growth. The national average for the same period, however, was 2 percent, and it was that robust level of job creation, at better than three million new jobs a year nationally, that helped pull New Jersey along, Mr. Hughes said.
New Jersey's recession bottomed out before New York's did, Mr. Hughes said. And the Garden State has also profited from the diversity of its economy in pharmaceuticals and financial services, while also developing a lead in specialized services like architecture and engineering, he said.
This year has been the second year of recovery from the recession, which lasted from early 1989 through March 1992 in New Jersey, longer than for the nation as a whole. The latest figures, Mr. Hughes said, show an acceleration of job growth in construction and services, and an end, for now at least, to the decline in manufacturing jobs that has been a feature of the state's economy since the 1950's.
"This is the year a boomlet threatens to become a full-scale boom," Mr. Hughes said. "We're being swept along by a potent level of national job creation, and we've been helped by a housing recovery that is an area where we benefit from suburbanization."
The state's highest growth in employment came in the suburban fringe counties of Somerset and Ocean, while New Jersey's urban counties continued to lag.
Because of the overall improvement in the state's employment health, Mr. Hughes said New Jersey had entered "a post-nightmare economy." Since the end of the recession two and a half years, the state has made back about 47 percent of the jobs lost.
Mr. Hughes spelled out just how bad the nightmare was: the 262,000 jobs lost in the recession amounted to about 7 percent of New Jersey's total employment between 1989 and 1992. The losses were 10 times the number lost during the previous recession, in 1981 and 1982, and the recovery, in turn, took far longer.
But Mr. Seneca noted that New Jersey had managed to keep its relatively high level of personal income despite the recession. The state's per capita personal income, which stood at 31 percent above the national average in 1989, was still at 29 percent above at the end of last year.

HEADLINE: Opponents Successfully Challenge Hoboken Rent-Control Limits

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J., Oct. 5

 BODY:
An effort to relax rent control on vacant apartments in small buildings in Hoboken has been stymied by tenant advocates, very likely forcing the issue onto the ballot for voters to decide.
Invoking a New Jersey law allowing citizens to challenge local ordinances, opponents of the measure last week filed a petition blocking an amendment to the city's Rent Control Ordinance that would have let landlords charge market value for some regulated apartments that become vacant. Now the measure goes back to the City Council, which can repeal it or set a referendum. 
 Cathy Cardillo, a member of the Campaign for Housing Justice, a tenant advocacy group, said, "The Council has not shown, by statistics or any other way, any harm to homeowners" under the 21-year-old rent-control law .
Mayor Anthony Russo, however, defended the decontrol, which was approved by the City Council early last month. "I thought we should give small homeowners an opportunity to get market value for their property," he said. Mr. Russo attributed the challenge to "a very small group of people," adding, "It's the democratic process at work."
The measure would cover owner-occupied buildings with up to four units in Hoboken, a city of 30,000. While landlords are now limited to a small annual cost-of-living increase they could increase rents to market value for the affected apartments.
Opponents claim the measure would give landlords economic incentive to evict rent-controlled tenants and that it is the first salvo in an effort to completely eliminate Hoboken's 1973 Rent Control Ordinance.
Supporters of decontrol, however, said it was intended to provide economic relief to small landlords, many of whom have been suffering under the impact of property-tax increases and other rising costs.
"Homeowners need some relief, and not at the cost of existing tenants," said Michael Buoncristiano, the president of the Hoboken Homeowner's Alliance. "That's what this amendment does."
Apartments in small, owner-occupied buildings account for one-fourth to one-half of the city's nearly 12,000 nonsubsidized rental units, depending on who is asked.
The Mayor said that based on his own observations and on census figures, he thought the new measure would affect only higher-income residents who he believed could easily afford market-value rents.
Between 1980 and 1990, median rents in Hoboken increased by about 230 percent, according to the Census Bureau.
"This is in part due to landlords' skirting the rent-control law altogether," Ms. Cardillo asserted. "Most people in Hoboken don't even know they are rent controlled."
Apartments rented to households with income of more than $20,000 increased to 7,601 in 1990 from 2,786 in 1980, the Census Bureau said.
"It's for small homeowners who stuck out the years of blight before the economy and the quality of life here improved," the Mayor said of the decontrol measure.
But tenant advocates say the current law allows rent increases for legitimate expenses like higher property taxes or renovation. "If there's a problem with the rent-control law, fix it," said Dan Tumpson, a principal behind the challenging petition. "Don't destroy the law."
Tenant advocates said the Council ignored their input on decontrol. City officials denied this, saying they amended the measure before passage to add language preventing landlords from gaining higher rents by arbitrarily evicting rent-controlled tenants. But Ms. Cardillo contended that loopholes remained.
If the Council schedules a referendum, it would probably be in December or January.
Citizen challenges of local actions have occurred several times in recent years in Hoboken. In 1988, the City Council repealed a vacancy-decontrol measure after tenants' groups filed a similar petition. In 1990 and 1992, voters rejected a city-sponsored project for development of the waterfront after a similar citizen petition opposing the plan.
The citizens acted under a section of the state's Municipal Government Law under which opponents of new local ordinances can submit petitions to challenge the law.

HEADLINE: U.S. Pledges Over $1 Billion in Aid Projects for South Africa

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Answering Nelson Mandela's pleas to help South Africa's fractured economy, the Clinton Administration announced today that it would provide loan guarantees to build housing, begin sending Peace Corps volunteers and set up investment funds to generate more than $1 billion in projects.
As part of President Clinton's efforts to support Mr. Mandela's cause, O.P.I.C., the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, unveiled two new equity funds, totaling $150 million, which aim to produce $1.3 billion in investment. 
 The Agency for International Development announced $150 million in loan guarantees to build housing and electrification projects as well as a $100 million enterprise fund to help South Africa and neighboring countries. Andrew Young, the former mayor of Atlanta, will oversee that fund, which will provide money for small and medium-sized companies to expand.
At a joint news conference on the South Lawn of the White House, President Clinton said, "President Mandela, you can be certain that the United States will continue to do everything in our power to support the new nation you and your South African people have created and now seek so strongly to build."
With all the new aid programs announced today, several Administration officials estimated that aid to South Africa would climb above $700 million over the next three years. Mr. Mandela's two-day state visit here is part of a weeklong trip to the United States.
During the visit, President Clinton repeatedly hailed Mr. Mandela's remarkable journey from prison to the presidency and pledged stepped-up support to South Africa. For his part, Mr. Mandela repeatedly extolled Mr. Clinton's qualities as a leader.
At a White House luncheon given for Mr. Mandela and the Congressional Black Caucus, the South African lavished so much praise on President Clinton that the American leader appeared to choke up for a few seconds.
"I must say that to have a strong leader, highly competent but with a common touch, who worries himself about the needs of the people, is a species that is very rare in the world today," Mr. Mandela said, gesturing to his American counterpart. "In our President here, we have a man who is endowed with such virtues, with such qualities. And the world is rich as long as he remains the President of this country."
This morning, Mr. Mandela met with Vice President Al Gore to complete details for a new cooperative commission on which Mr. Gore will serve as co-chairman along with Thabo Mbeki, the South African Deputy President. The commission will bring together Cabinet members of both countries to give a high-level boost to projects involving energy, education and economic development.
The United States has set up such a commission with only one other country, Russia.
Encouraged by Administration officials, President Mandela announced today that he would meet on Thursday in Washington with Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The Clinton Administration has quietly urged the South African leader to meet Father Aristide in the hope that Mr. Mandela's singular success at promoting reconciliation in his bitterly divided country could serve as a model for Haiti and could reassure President Aristide's opponents.

HEADLINE: Inquiry on Rental Car Sales

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Detroit's Big Three auto makers said today that they were cooperating with a Justice Department investigation of their sales to rental car agencies, but denied any wrongdoing.
The General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation were first notified of the probe in July. 
 Executives of the auto makers said the inquiry centered on whether they had cut back on repurchase incentives to independent car rental companies.
Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman in Washington, said the department was investigating certain auto sales practices, but declined to elaborate.
Ford controls the Hertz Corporation and has a financing arrangement with Budget Rent-a-Car Inc. G.M. has an equity stake in Avis, and owns National Car Rental System, which it recently agreed to sell to an investor group. Chrysler owns the Dollar and Thrifty rental chains and recently sold Snappy Rent-a-Car.
Some rental agencies have asserted that auto makers will no longer buy back vehicles -- an incentive used during the recession to sell off car inventories.
"Some of the smaller rental operations are complaining that we are not repurchasing enough vehicles from them," a Ford spokesman, Bill Carroll, said. "Our contention is that we do provide a lot of vehicles to them. Some we repurchase and some we don't." He said Ford required a minimum purchase of 100 cars for a repurchase agreement.

HEADLINE: New Orders At Factories Climb 4.4%

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Factory orders and shipments surged at the fastest rate in more than a year during August, the Commerce Department said today, fanning fears that a strong economy may soon force interest rates higher.
The value of orders received by manufacturers jumped 4.4 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $286.5 billion, after falling a revised 2 percent in July. 
 Not only was it the strongest monthly gain in orders in more than a year and a half, but the report said finished goods were also shipped at the fastest rate in 15 years, especially popular new cars.
"It adds to the impression accrued over the past couple of weeks that the economy is on pretty firm ground," said Dick Berner, an economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "The notion that it is slowing down is being deflated rapidly."
Although the central bank did not raise rates when its policy makers last met on Sept. 27, a string of strong economic data leading up to the September employment report, scheduled for Friday, has set financial markets on edge.
Every recent indicator, including September new-car sales, August new-home sales and personal consumption expenditures have shown strong rises that suggest credit-tightening so far has not been enough to deter consumers.
A Federal Reserve governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, told a bankers group in Atlanta today that policy makers were determined that inflation "is never going to get in the headlines" before it applies another dose of preventive medicine.
The rise in August factory orders was the strongest since December 1992, when they gained 5.6 percent, the department said. Orders have been up in 11 of the last 13 months.
Shipments of manufactured goods, which reflect more immediate demand than orders, increased 4.5 percent in August -- the largest for any month since May 1979, when they were up 4.7 percent -- after a decline of 1.1 percent in July.
Previously, the Commerce Department said July factory orders had fallen by 2.3 percent.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
A Declaration of Chip Independence

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Seven years ago, when the United States semiconductor industry was reeling in the face of a Japanese invasion, American chip makers persuaded the Government to establish a groundbreaking federally financed manufacturing consortium intended to resurrect their industry.
The argument was that by investing in manufacturing technology, it was possible to reverse declining United States market share for the fingernail-sized circuits that were increasingly being viewed as the crude oil of the information age. 
 Today, with American chip companies not only leading the world again but also expecting to control about half the $77.3 billion global semiconductor market by the end of the year, the consortium, Sematech, declared its national mission accomplished. At a news conference in Washington, leaders of the consortium politely thanked the Government and said they would wean themselves off Federal financing -- now $90 million a year -- by 1997.
The group, to be financed solely by industry money, intends to concentrate not on "national industrial policy," but on the nuts and bolts, and microscopic circuits, of the chip maker's art.
Does Sematech prove the case for a national industrial policy -- the practice of using taxpayers' money to revitalize American industries under threat from foreign competitors? Not necessarily, because there were other, arguably larger, economic and market forces contributing to the United States semiconductor resurgence.
But the Sematech example indicates that when the Government allows -- indeed, encourages -- industry leaders to collaborate, the national economy can benefit.
"My hope is that the model of government, industry and university cooperation will have proved so effective that more government programs in the future will want to follow our example," William J. Spencer, Sematech's president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview today.
Sematech's members are 11 of the nation's biggest chip makers, including Intel, I.B.M., Motorola, National Semiconductor and Texas Instruments. Since the founding of the consortium, the Government has invested $690 million, while the members together have matched that amount, with companies' contributions based on their annual revenues.
On the face of it, the group has overseen an astounding industry comeback. In 1988, Japanese companies controlled 46 percent of the market, compared with 43 percent for United States concerns. Currently, American companies supply 48 percent of the world's semiconductors, while Japanese companies provide 36 percent.
While Sematech can rightly claim some credit for this reversal, the chip industry has received a great deal of help from larger technological and international trends.
Continued American control of the personal-computer industry has helped United States chip makers act as standard-setters. Meanwhile, the slowness of the Japanese semiconductor giants like NEC and Toshiba to move beyond commodity memory chips and excel at making more lucrative "brain" microprocessor chips, has been a drag on Japan's world market share. At the same time, South Korean memory chip makers like Samsung have put new pressure on the Japanese. And the rising value of the Japanese yen has benefited chip makers in the United States and Europe.
Still, most American semiconductor industry executives now seem willing to call Sematech a success -- something that might not have been predicted in the late 1980's, when the consortium stood at the middle of a fierce debate about whether the Government should be in the business of picking winners and losers. Even some formerly bitter enemies of Sematech now seem prepared to wish it well.
"My last major objection to Sematech was that they were on the Government dole," said T. J. Rodgers, president and chief executive of Cypress Semiconductor, a chip maker in Santa Clara, Calif. "So I now say more power to them."
Because his mid-sized company chose not to pay the $1 million minimum membership fee to join Sematech, Mr. Rodgers said he was originally angered because Sematech seemed to be locking up American-made chip-making equipment only for its 11 members. Thus, Mr. Rodgers saw his company as under attack from the very Federal money that had been designated for saving American semiconductor companies. But that policy changed, he said, in 1991, after Mr. Spencer, the former vice president for research at the Xerox Corporation, took over as head of Sematech.
Other chip makers that are not part of Sematech say the Government's money has been well spent. "We've wasted a lot more money more fruitlessly than on efforts like Sematech," said Bernard Vonderschmitt, president of Xilinx, a small Silicon Valley chip company. But, Mr. Vonderschmitt cautioned, "it's dangerous to extrapolate that we are better off now simply because of the investment."
Indeed, there were some glaring errors made in Sematech's effort to save chip makers and producers of chip-making equipment.
A notable and costly failure was the 1993 collapse of GCA. The company, based in Andover, Mass., was a leading maker of a multimillion-dollar tool called a stepper -- one of the most critical elements in chip making. Three years earlier, GCA had been one of only two American stepper makers left in a market that was dominated by two Japanese companies, Nikon and Canon.
Using $60 million of Sematech's money, GCA developed a new line of steppers that would have catapulted the company into the forefront of the technology wars. But the project was a year late and GCA did not have Nikon's reputation for good service. Even Sematech members preferred to continue using Japanese steppers.
The project failed and GCA's parent, the General Signal Corporation, shut the operation last year.
"It was a perfect example of how Sematech failed to understand the political and business issues," said G. Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research Inc., a Silicon Valley firm that tracks the chip industry. "They approached GCA as a technology problem and not as a market or a business problem."
Sematech officials say they are doing better with the remaining American stepper company, Silicon Valley Group Lithography of Wilton, Conn.
One point on which there seems to be little debate is that by focusing on manufacturing, Sematech created a new kind of esprit de corps and pride within the American chip industry. And the results paid off in better efficiency and higher quality.
For Mr. Hutcheson, the most striking proof is the fact that even Japanese companies now point to the quality of American factories. One of NEC's most productive chip factories, for example, is in Roseville, Calif. It surpasses all the company's Japanese manufacturing sites in terms of productivity and is second by that measure only to an NEC plant in Scotland.
During the period when Sematech was devising ways to beat Japan, "the Japanese were sitting on their laurels, praising themselves for the strength of Japanese manufacturing techniques," Mr. Hutcheson said. "They made the same mistakes we made during the 1980's."

HEADLINE: Javits Center Inquiry Says Workers Have Mob Ties

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
Despite repeated efforts to curb corruption at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, a court-appointed investigator charged yesterday that 100 carpenters who put up and take down most of the displays there are hired by union officials with connections to organized crime.
The investigator, Kenneth Conboy, said in a report that "an alarming number" of the 100 carpenters also appear to have connections to the Genovese crime family. In addition, the report said, about a third of them have been arrested or convicted of crimes ranging from arson to drug trafficking to murder. 
 The union's employment practices mean higher costs for exhibitors, who have complained about labor expenses and frequent shakedowns since the glass-enclosed Javits Center opened eight years ago.
In 1990, Federal prosecutors described the Javits Center as a hiring hall for mobsters and former convicts, who earn more than $60 an hour. They are often assigned, at time-and-a-half rates, to work at night, on weekends and on holidays, assembling or disassembling displays under tight deadlines.
Some 125 to 400 people -- carpenters, electricians, teamsters and laborers -- work at the center daily, depending on the size of the shows and meetings scheduled. Mr. Conboy's report charged that because the Javits Center regularly hires only the 100 carpenters on a "pool list," the union's 30,000 members are effectively locked out of jobs that are considered virtually recession-proof.
Unlike construction jobs, which all but disappeared in the recession, most convention centers boomed. In part because of high labor costs, however, the Javits Center lost business.
Mr. Conboy's report said that the way the carpenters are hired violates a consent decree that Judge Charles S. Haight Jr. approved in Federal District Court in Manhattan in March.
That agreement settled a civil racketeering suit filed by the Government in 1990 against the union, the District Council of New York City and Vicinity of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners. At the time, prosecutors said that the accord would limit the power of union officials to assign members to jobs.
But Mr. Conboy's report said that the tainted system at the Javits Center persisted even after the consent decree was signed. The report said that the 100 carpenters on the pool list for the Javits Center are hired "before any jobs there are referred to rank and file members of any of the local unions."
The day-to-day hiring decisions are made by two union stewards with little experience as carpenters but extensive mob connections, the report charged. It said that one, Anthony D. Fiorino, is the brother-in-law of Barney Bellomo, who is believed to be the acting boss of the Genovese crime family.
The other, Lenard J. Simon, is the brother-in-law of Ralph Coppola, a convicted arsonist with mob ties, the report said. Mr. Simon, an unemployed taxi driver, told Mr. Conboy's staff that he had joined the carpenters' union at Mr. Coppola's urging, falsely declaring that he had extensive construction trade experience.
Mr. Coppola handled the work referrals at the Javits Center until August 1991, when Frederick W. Devine, the district council president, dismissed him as the Javits Center steward, quoting the racketeering suit about his connections to organized crime.
Since then, Mr. Conboy said in the report, "President Devine has sought to avoid responsibility for the procedures governing the allocation of work at the Javits Center by testifying that he is largely unaware of matters involving the center, has been on the premises only a few times, and did not even know Messrs. Simon and Fiorino (except by their first names) when he made them the District Council's handpicked representatives" there.
The report also said that Mr. Devine testified under oath that he had selected the two men "without any knowledge of their relationship to Coppola and Bellomo," despite the fact that the ties were mentioned in newspaper articles and in the racketeering suit. Mr. Devine was himself a defendant.
"According to President Devine," the report said, "he did not see the newspaper articles, only read very selective portions of the complaint and selected Messrs. Simon and Fiorino because Fabian Palomino, the president of the Javits Center, brought these men to his attention."
Mr. Palomino did not return calls for comment yesterday.
Mr. Conboy's report said that Mr. Fiorino and Mr. Simon had invoked their Constitutional privilege against self-incrimination when interrogated by Mr. Conboy's investigators. They refused to answer any questions about contacts or conversations with organized crime figures, including Mr. Bellomo and Mr. Coppola, or the employment of organized crime associates at the Javits Center.
Bernard Cohen, the general counsel for the district council, said that he had not read Mr. Conboy's report. But he attacked Mr. Conboy, a former Federal judge in Manhattan whom Judge Haight appointed when the consent decree was signed.
"He'd be far better off trying to work on what he's supposed to be doing, which is to root out corruption," Mr. Cohen said of Mr. Conboy, "as opposed to looking to battle windmills where there are no crimes committed."
Mr. Cohen said that Mr. Devine had repeatedly asked Mr. Conboy for proof of allegations that Mr. Fiorino and Mr. Simon were organized-crime figures, not just relatives of organized-crime figures by marriage.
As for the list of carpenters who are hired regularly at the Javits Center, Mr. Cohen said it has 800 names, not 100, and will be expanded by the end of the month to include everyone in the union.
But the report said that the expansion was a bogus reform, because the union is imposing new requirements that could exclude all but the 100 workers now on the job. Carpenters hired for the Javits Center must now have at least three years' experience in handling large trade-show displays.

HEADLINE: Banks Give Russia Time On Loans

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Russia agreed with its foreign bank creditors today on a deal to postpone repayment of $26 billion in loans, relieving a little of the pressure on the nation as it struggles toward a market economy.
The agreement followed a year of negotiations that came down to whether Russia should be treated as a developing country or accorded first-world status. The logjam was broken only after the banks dropped a demand that they be free to seize Russian Government funds and property around the world if Moscow defaulted on the loans. 
 Russia argued strenuously, and ultimately successfully, that it deserved the same "sovereign immunity" from such actions enjoyed by the world's richest nations.
Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr N. Shokhin, Russia's chief debt negotiator, called the agreement "an important vote of confidence from the international financial community."
The deal, which must be ratified by Russia's 600 lenders around the world, requires a $500 million payment to the banks by the end of this year. After that, Russia will have a five-year grace period during which it will not be required to pay either interest or principal on the loans, which were made before the Soviet Union broke up at the end of 1991.
After the grace period, Russia will have to pay off the loans in twice-yearly installments over 10 years. Unlike most other nations involved in debt-restructuring deals, Russia neither sought nor was granted any reduction in the loan principal.
The main creditor banks are German, including Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. Today's announcement affects American banks only marginally because whatever loans they made to Moscow were tied to trade deals, and not made directly to the Government.
"The agreement reached today indicates considerable progress toward reaching a final agreement, but the impact on U.S. banks will be minimal," said James H. Mitchell, a spokesman for the Bank of America.
Before the agreement, Russia was reported to have fallen $2 billion behind in interest payments to the banks. In delaying repayment, the accord gives the cash-pressed Russian Government a little more leeway at a time when it is struggling to hold on to the considerable economic gains it has made over the last year.
Inflation, which fell to 4 percent in August from 22 percent in January, bounced up in September to a range between 6 and 8 percent, depending on the calculation. The ruble, which seemed to have stabilized earlier in the year, has been plunging in value the last several weeks, and traded today at 2,808 to the dollar, down 36 percent in a little over a month.
Russian budget planners, hoping to bring their huge deficit under control, are seeking big cuts in subsidies to ailing industries and farms, but business lobbies and unions are exerting tremendous pressure to retain or increase the subsidies.
The agreement should also remove an element of uncertainty about Russia from the calculations of foreign banks that are considering making new loans to rapidly expanding Russian private businesses.
The deal with the banks is part of a broader debt-restructuring effort undertaken by the post-Soviet Government. It agreed to assume the Soviet debts, but argued that it should be given some leeway in repayment by Western governments and banks as it dismantles the central economy and tries to establish democracy and capitalism.
In addition to the $26 billion in bank debt, Russia owes foreign governments and other creditors nearly $60 billion. The governments have agreed several times in recent years to postpone interest payments, including $7 billion due this year.
Although the Russian Government could not immediately provide details, Russia by some estimates faced interest and principal payments this year of nearly $30 billion in the absence of any restructuring agreements, but was able to budget only $4.5 billion for debt service.
Western economists said it was far from certain that Russia would ultimately be able to repay all its debts, as much would depend on the course of the economy and on President Boris N. Yeltsin's ability to keep the nation on a reformist track.
The breakthrough on bank debt came after two days of meetings in Madrid between the creditors' group, led by Deutsche Bank, and Mr. Shokhin. Many leading bankers and government finance officials are in Madrid for the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

If Ars Is Really Longa, Is New Money Brevis?

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
IT sounded like a great idea in its first incarnation. It still sounds, for those who value the arts, like a great idea. But it is no longer as advertised. Little in government ever is, actually. Reality has a funny way of getting in the way.
The original suggestion came in February when the cultural world, starved for government money, proposed a way of loosening up public dollars: give us $10 million in matching money if we raise our own $10 million in private donations. This proved to be an irresistible proposition to elected officials. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yes, so did the City Council and the State Legislature, and the Cultural Challenge Initiative was born. 
 There is only one hitch.
Though there was never any question that the cultural institutions were supposed to match the public money with new money -- an increase over 1993 -- few now say they have succeeded in doing so, and apparently they do not have to.
The application for a challenge grant does not specifically ask if the money represents new or higher contributions, and officials of both the City Department of Cultural Affairs and the State Council on the Arts indicate that they are prepared to be flexible. Which means that a number of New York's cultural institutions could share $10 million from the government, money that might have gone to other needs absent the compelling prospect of aggressive, private fund-raising.
"THE whole initiative is to encourage additional and/or new activities," said Schuyler G. Chapin, City Commissioner of Cultural Affairs. "Because it is essentially a new initiative, we are encouraging new money. But it is not a program that requires new money in every sense of that word."
John Dyson, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said he'd wait to see the grant applications later this month before passing judgment. "The Mayor is unequivocal that we are providing new money for new money," he said. And if arts groups do not provide new funds? "To the extent I can find it out, the city won't fund them. But money is fungible, and that's the problem."
Defining "new," suggested Nathan Leventhal, president of Lincoln Center, "is not as simple as it seemed." Apparently not. For instance, if a group got $1,000 from a foundation last year, and $1,000 this year but is applying that money to the matching grant, is that "new" money or an accounting device? "I think what one could say is, even if it is the same old money, as long as it's really there, it's in a sense new," said Rochelle Slovin, director of the American Museum of the Moving Image. "For those of us in the trenches, every time we get a grant from a corporation or foundation, for us, it's new."
AVAILABLE money, she and others suggest, is limited. "We deal with finite resources," said Robert Crane, vice president for programs at the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation. "We will make $2 million in grants next year. We don't have a way to say, 'God, this is wonderful, let's increase the grants to $4 million.' It doesn't work that way with most foundations, because grants are based on endowments."
With that in mind, leaders of some cultural groups, convinced that the new-money pledge was unrealistic, even talked to one another about trading contributors to prove they had "new" money. "It was, 'I'll trade you my 1993 donor for your 1994 donor, and that way we'll both have new money,' " said an executive with one city cultural institution, quickly adding that the trades never took place.
Of course, as Mr. Dyson notes, absent an army of auditors, the city and state will have to take a lot on faith, and arts groups say they are trying. But will the Challenge Initiative ultimately expand cultural programs, draw larger audiences and spur economic development, as originally intended? Or will it amount to an increase in government grants dressed up as something more ambitious?
Not that the city's cultural institutions or their benefactors are all that concerned about the fine print. "The good news is that there is some new money from the city and state," Mr. Crane said. "That's the 'new money.' And it's good news because the arts community needs every penny it can get."

HEADLINE: House Vote on Trade Accord Is Postponed

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Stymied by election-year politics, leaders from both parties in the House of Representatives decided tonight to postpone until after the elections a House vote on legislation to allow the United States to participate in a new worldwide trade agreement.
The Senate decided last week to hold a lame-duck session after Thanksgiving to vote on the measure. 
 The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, said the delay did not mean the measure would not ultimately be enacted. "It is going to become law," he said at a news conference this morning. "And anybody who doesn't think that is right is betting a very bad bet in my view."
The Republican leader, Robert H. Michel, agreed with that assessment.
But Mr. Foley and the other Democratic leaders who set the schedule for the House were forced to postpone the final vote because all but a handful of Republicans planned to vote against a procedural resolution, called a rule, that would have allowed a vote on the trade legislation this week.
Congress hopes to recess at the end of the week to begin the final stretch of campaigning before the Nov. 8 elections.
Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, said his party needed more time to examine the fine print of the bill. But there was no doubt that many Republicans who support free trade wanted to delay a final vote until after the elections to deny President Clinton what has become his top remaining legislative priority this year. Enough Democrats oppose the measure that it cannot be passed without Republican support.
The top House leaders from both parties wrote President Clinton tonight that the Senate's decision to postpone a vote on the trade measure had "frankly undermined our ability to guarantee strong bipartisan support for this effort in the House at this time."
They said that the House would vote on Nov. 29 and that they would work to see that the legislation was enacted.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said the White House was satisfied with the arrangement. "I think we are assured we will move forward," he said.
The bill would change the United States laws to conform with the trade pact, under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, that negotiators from the United States and 122 other countries have signed.
The trade accord would reduce tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, by an average of 40 percent during the next 10 years and include a few services like accounting under international trade rules for the first time. Especially important to the United States, it would require all countries to guard against the abuse of patents, copyrights and trademarks and the illegal copying of computer programs.
The agreement would be supervised by a new international organization called the World Trade Organization.
At a hearing this morning, Mr. Kantor said the expanded trade under the accord would create as many as 700,000 new jobs in the United States during the next decade. He said the agreement would force other countries to abide by trade rules that the United States considers fair.
"Like it or not, change is inevitable," Mr. Kantor told the Senate commerce committee. "We can't stop the globalization. We've got to make it our friend."
At a news conference, President Clinton called the trade agreement "the biggest world tax cut in history," and said it would be "a huge job gainer for America."
But opponents of the bill said it would put American products at a disadvantage, because this country's markets would be opened to goods manufactured in low-wage countries. The result, the opponents say, would be the loss of thousands of American manufacturing jobs.
In the debate on the House floor tonight, many representatives expressed opposition to the trade agreement. For example, Representative David E. Bonior, a Democrat from Michigan, argued that the United States would "run the risk of seeing more companies pack up and move overseas."
But there seemed to be little doubt that the large majority of representatives supported the accord. "We should not turn our back on this opportunity for our children and their children," said Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas.
In the main, the broad middle of the ideological spectrum of economists and politicians from both parties support the trade pact. But it is opposed by people like Ralph Nader on the left and Patrick J. Buchanan on the right.
It is also opposed by most of organized labor. The jobs that would be lost in manufacturing are of the kind that are often unionized, and the jobs that would be gained would tend to be in service industries and others where workers are less likely to be union members.
In the Senate, Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who is chairman of the commerce committee, has exercised his authority to delay a vote on the legislation for 45 days. As a consequence, the Senate plans to return to Washington for a lame-duck session and to vote on Dec. 1. Leaders from both parties say the measure will be approved then.
Some representatives would also find it easier to vote for the pact after the election. They are generally Democrats with large labor constituencies and Republicans who are trying to appeal to supporters of Mr. Buchanan and Ross Perot, who also opposes the trade pact.

30-Year Bond Nears 8% As Prices Fall 3d Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices tumbled yesterday for the third consecutive day, as investors, fearing inflation, pushed up the yield on the Treasury's long bond to 7.95 percent, its highest point in 28 months.
After opening quietly, Treasury securities turned down after the release of the August factory orders data, which showed exceptional strength in the economy and at the same time increased investors' uneasiness that the Federal Reserve could move soon to increase short-term interest rates for the sixth time this year. 
 The 30-year bond fell 23/32 , to 9429/32 , for a yield of 7.95 percent, up from 7.88 percent on Tuesday, which means bondholders lost about $7.10 for each $1,000 of bonds. The yield yesterday was the highest since May 7, 1992, when it was 7.96 percent, the same week investors saw the yield drop below 8 percent.
Rates on shorter-maturity bills gained only slightly, benefiting as investors moved away from the volatility of the long end to the relative safety of the short end.
Traders said the large number of Fed officials making comments about the economy yesterday might have added to the nervousness. For example, Robert P. Forrestal, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta, said in Gadsden, Ala., that the Fed, while honoring a strong commitment to curb inflation, must avoid harming the economic expansion by raising rates too rapidly.
Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City, Mo., told an audience in Colorado that the economy was generally sound, and the outlook generally favorable. A Fed governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, addressing a bankers group in Atlanta, said that policy makers were determined not to let inflation become a problem. "In the long run we will be better off acting sooner than if we had waited," he said.
And in El Paso on Tuesday night, Robert D. McTeer Jr., president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas, was reported to have said that the central bank was not concerned that healthy economic growth would cause an acceleration in inflation.
Analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette said that a 4.4 percent rise in August factory orders reported by the Commerce Department yesterday indicated even more momentum in the manufacturing sector than was implied by last week's statistics on durable goods orders.
Durable goods orders rose 6.1 percent, while nondurable orders rose 2.5 percent. The strength of the data added to the bearish tone in Treasuries and heightened speculation of a near-term tightening.
Peter McTeague, MCM Money Watch-Boston, saw the fundamentals of the economy still strong, as the factory orders helped confirm yesterday. "With the pace stronger than expected, the market is preparing for a 300,000-type jobs number," he said, referring to the scheduled release on Friday of September employment figures.
Mr. McTeague said market participants, especially the large hedge funds and dealers that had been positioned to take advantage of the spread between the short end of the market and long end, have been cashing in during the market's recent narrowing of that spread. "We saw some of it on Tuesday," he said. "Today they were unwinding positions and all rushing for the same exit at the same time. The market just can't handle that."
He said that some of that money came out of the market on Tuesday, and more came out yesterday. By today, all of it may be out of the market, he added.
Traders and analysts said they thought the short end of the market might already be priced to reflect a near-term 50-basis-point rise in interest rates that is expected from the Fed. As a result, some see limited scope for additional losses in the shorter maturities. But not so in the long bond, which is approaching 8 percent. These analysts say that the longer the Fed waits to raise rates, the longer the long end of the market will suffer.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Cotton Recovers on Hints Of Strong Demand for Crop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Cotton prices recovered from a nine-month low yesterday on indications of strong demand for a huge American crop.
In other commodity movements, wheat futures retreated from a two-and-a-half-year high and hog futures fell to a fresh 14-year low. Lower crude oil and gold prices helped push the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities down 0.44 point, to 229.86. 
 On the New York Cotton Exchange, the cotton contract for October delivery rose 0.58 cent, to 66.75 cents a pound. Its session low of 65.90 was the lowest price for near-term deliveries since Jan. 4. American mills bought futures as insurance against rising prices, while speculation of an impending large purchase by China stirred speculative buying, analysts said.
"The expectation for the U.S. crop is now close to 19.5 million," Judy Ganes, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said. "Having China as a buyer is going to be a must. We certainly need that buying to help absorb some of the large supplies from the U.S. crop."
She said China's crop, currently estimated by the Agriculture Department at 20 million bales, may be reduced by a million by pest damage.
Cotton has tumbled from an early September high of nearly 73 cents a pound on expectations that this year's crop in the United States will exceed 19 million 480-pound bales, compared with last year's 16.1 million -- an 18 percent increase. But demand for cotton clothing, bedding and furniture upholstery is also rising, and the trend should strengthen as the economy improves.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat for December delivery settled at $4.075 a bushel, down 1.25 cents, after trading at a two-and-a-half-year high of $4.13 3/4. Prices dipped on sentiment that the market could not sustain such high prices without stronger export demand.
"Despite the fact we've had a lot of export business, total sales are still trailing year-ago levels," said Joel Karlin, research analyst with Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago.
Hog futures plunged 0.95 cent, to a 14-year low of 34.25 cents a pound, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as abundant supplies of livestock continued to put pressure on prices.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues to Falter After Decline in U.S. Bonds

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against other leading currencies yesterday, dragged down for a second day by a decline in the American bond market.
Prices of United States Treasury securities dropped after a strong factory orders report contributed to inflation fears. While higher interest rates tend to bolster a currency, foreign-exchange traders have been tracking American asset markets to gauge demand by foreign investors for dollars. Yesterday, the dollar fell sharply against the British pound and dipped against the Japanese yen and German mark as investors fled dollar-denominated assets. 
 "People are looking at where the capital is really flowing, and the U.S. market is not that attractive," said Chris Iggo, a currency strategist with Chase Manhattan Bank. "The dollar bears the brunt of that."
The pound advanced amid signs that the British economy was improving since the Bank of England raised a key interest rate on Sept. 12, currency dealers said. In late New York trading yesterday, the pound was quoted at $1.5860, a 17-month high, up from $1.5810 on Tuesday.
The dollar traded in narrow ranges against the German mark and Japanese yen as market participants, awaiting tomorrow's release of the United States employment report for September, stuck with their positions. The dollar also continued to be buoyed against the yen by the trade agreement announced on Saturday between the United States and Japan.
The dollar slipped yesterday to 1.5435 marks from 1.5465 marks on Tuesday. The dollar settled unchanged against the yen at 99.65 yen.
But the dollar gained against the Italian lira, rising to 1,570 lire, from 1,559 on Tuesday, after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Government was thrown into political turmoil.
Many traders and analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the sixth time this year. The jobs report should give a clearer picture of when a tightening may come.
"Some people think it will happen in October, others think the Fed will wait till November," Dorit Ronnen, a currency trader at Bank Leumi Trust in New York, said.
The dollar remains under pressure until the Fed moves, she said, because inflation fears will continue to roil the bond market, which weighs down the dollar.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
N.B.A. and Stern Take the Road Less Traveled

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
On a day when locked out hockey players rebuffed two management plans, and striking baseball players mulled an owners' proposal to freeze free agency rules, the National Basketball Association yesterday traveled the labor road not taken: it declined to set a date to lock out players and said it expects to start the season on time.
"We want to separate ourselves from other sports," said Larry Miller, the Utah Jazz owner. "Setting a lockout date would inflame discussions." 
 Not setting a lockout date, he said, was a reaction to harsh, pre-emptive moves by Gary Bettman, the National Hockey League commissioner. Unhappy with his negotiations with the hockey players' union over a new collective-bargaining agreement, Bettman first set a deadline for postponing the start of the season, then did postpone it, deferring the start until at least Oct. 15.
"He felt desperate," Miller said. "We have time and we want to keep this in a nonhostile environment."
The N.B.A. season begins Nov. 4. David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, said: "I plan to be in Houston on Nov. 4 to give the Rockets their rings."
Charles Grantham, executive director of the players' union, said before the N.B.A. Board of Governors met yesterday that he expected a lockout date to be set. But after the announcement he said: "It was definitely an effort to show optimism and not get pushed into an arena of confrontation. It sounds like the hawks are at bay for a while. This gives us optimism that the league wants to talk."
If events do not force a change, the league's stance, combined with the cheerfulness expressed by Stern, stood in sharp, almost comic, relief to the grimness of the baseball and hockey negotiations.
"I not only love this game, but I am in love with our players," Stern said jovially, in the day's guise as the roundball Mr. Rogers, standing downstage from a red and blue chart that depicted the rise of N.B.A. revenues and player salaries since revenue-sharing and the salary cap came into being a decade ago.
Stern's demeanor was in keeping with his desire to extend the era of good feeling in the N.B.A. that began in the early 1980's with the agreement to share 53 percent of defined gross revenues with players via the salary cap. But that period of amity has eroded as the union became persuaded that the cap has outlived its usefulness by restricting free-agent mobility and salaries. The collective bargaining agreement between the N.B.A. and its players expired June 24, and the players now want to eliminate the salary cap, as well as the college draft and restrictions on free agency.
Stern's rhetoric yesterday stressed that the league believes all problems can be resolved and extreme measures are unneeded. He said the season could start without a labor agreement, a different tack from the one taken by Bettman, who wants a deal before starting the season because, he said, more than half the teams are losing money and the league's economics must be overhauled.
The N.B.A. is different. Unlike Bettman or Bud Selig, baseball's acting commissioner, Stern is not pleading poverty. "I'm not here saying the owners are doing poorly," he said. "We'd like a deal before the season. But there are no ultimata here. There's no gauntlet being thrown down."
Not only that, but Stern also said the league would make its financial documents available to the players.
Miller acknowledged that the owners had discussed the lockout option for about 10 minutes during the N.B.A. meeting yesterday at the Plaza Hotel. But Stern said the league was wary of its ability, and the players' ability, to shut down the game.
"We have mutually assured destructive capacity," Stern said. "But we've never called these actions. We haven't used them and don't plan to."
David Falk, a player agent whose clients include Patrick Ewing, said: "I'm not sure what you'd accomplish by locking out the players. This is a sport that's growing, and gains nothing with a lockout. Basketball has been in the lead in labor negotiations and a lockout is simply counterproductive."
Underlying Stern's percolating confidence that an agreement with the players' union can be negotiated without harming the season is a belief that the players will lose their Federal Court challenge to the N.B.A.
That challenge currently is in the United States Court of Appeals in Manhattan, where the union is appealing a lower-court ruling on the N.B.A.'s salary cap, draft and right-of-first-refusal signings, saying they violate antitrust law. A Federal District Court judge ruled in favor of the league last July, saying that the dispute should be decided under labor law, not antitrust statutes.
Miller said one goal of the league's labor-relations committee was to initiate settlement discussions of the union's court appeal.
Grantham said the union will not engage in formal talks with the league until the Court of Appeals issues a ruling, which may come within days of the start of the season. The union wants to maintain the upper hand it would gain by winning the lawsuit; if it loses, it would probably have to accept an agreement that looks much like the one that recently expired.
"It sounds like we're both moving in the same direction," Grantham said. "It's not unusual that we start the season without a collective-bargaining agreement. We can play while we resolve the issues."
Stern expressed an openness to renegotiate how much revenue is shared, and how to restructure the salary cap, which owners would like to strip of its loopholes, turning it from a "soft" to a "hard" cap. A "soft" cap is one with provisions that enable teams to exceed the payroll limit.
But Stern is unlikely to want to radically alter the status quo that has so greatly enriched the N.B.A.
'There is no line in the sand," he said.
He said owners would explore increasing the percentage of defined gross revenues shared, but not at levels that would hurt team profitability or discourage owners from signing players in order to be competitive. He said going as high as the 64 percent of revenues shared by National Football League teams with its players "would wipe out a number of franchises and our profitability."
He also said monies not shared with players are now "on the table." The revenues include more from domestic licensing, and a first crack at cash from sponsorships, arena concessions, international TV and luxury-suite rentals.
Stern estimated that the newly negotiable revenues are worth $100 million, beyond the $925 million that was shared with players during the 1992-93 season. But Grantham said they were worth closer to $175 million.
"Whatever numbers they're putting out don't represent the potential for change in the future," Grantham said. "And it doesn't reflect the eight or nine new arenas being built with three times more luxury boxes than in the past."

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about disputes in the Haitian Parliament over legislation to grant amnesty to leaders of the September 1991 coup, which overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, misstated the circumstances of the death of Silvio Claude, leader of the country's Christian Democratic Party. He was killed during that coup, not at the time of Father Aristide's taking office in February 1991.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE REPUBLICANS;
More Black Candidates Find Places on Republican Ballots

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NORMAN, Okla., Oct. 4

 BODY:
J. C. Watts Jr., who is running for Congress, is still remembered here as the quarterback who directed the Oklahoma Sooners down the field for a dramatic victory over Florida State in the waning seconds of the 1981 Orange Bowl.
But what really makes Mr. Watts stand out is that he is a black politician in a state that is overwhelmingly white, and a Republican amid a national black population that is overwhelmingly Democratic. Mr. Watts was the first black person elected to statewide office in Oklahoma when he won a spot on the utility-regulating Corporation Commission four years ago, and he is widely regarded as the favorite to win on Nov. 8 in the Fourth District in southwestern Oklahoma. 
 Since the New Deal, the term "black Republican" has been a virtual oxymoron, and even now, national polls suggest that barely one-tenth of all blacks consider themselves Republican. But though the numbers are still small, there is clear evidence this fall of a growing number of black candidates running under the Republican banner at both the Federal and state levels.
Of this year's Republican nominees for Congress, 25 are black, nearly double the number in 1992 and by far the most of any year in the nation's history, including Reconstruction.
The few black Republican candidates given any reasonable shot at winning are running in districts that are largely white. They include Mr. Watts, candidates in Missouri and Texas and incumbent Gary A. Franks of Connecticut, who in 1990 became the first black Republican elected to the House since the Depression. And Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to nominate blacks in such districts.
Of this year's 38 black Democratic nominees for the House, only one is running in a district that has a majority of white voters, while 8 of the 25 Republican nominees are running in such districts, according to research compiled by David A. Bositis, senior analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington research group specializing in issues affecting black people.
Republican leaders and black candidates suggest that the increase points to the party's growing appeal to blacks, who may feel that Democratic solutions to poverty and racism have failed. Even a minor surge in black allegiance to the Republican Party could profoundly affect the balance of power between the two parties, especially in the South.
But Mr. Bositis said that although such a shift could occur in the future, it was not necessarily heralded by the growing number of black Republican candidates.
"If they're elected, they'll be sent to office by white voters, not black voters," he said. "There will be no real shift until you can look at a black Republican who is elected with black votes."
That appears unlikely to happen this fall. Indeed, several black Republicans running in districts with large black populations are considered little more than sacrificial candidates, running against veteran black Democrats like Representatives Maxine Waters of Los Angeles or Ronald V. Dellums of Oakland.
Many black Democrats are scornful of or even hostile toward black conservatives like Mr. Watts, who advocates an overhaul of the country's "sick, pathetic" welfare system and preaches the benefits of a cut in the capital gains tax for inner-city blacks.
Ed Coles, a black member of the Democratic State Committee in Mississippi, speaking generically of black conservative candidates, said: "I mean, come on. For a black man to be talking about no food stamps or no public housing, or some Draconian welfare reform, that's just ridiculous."
But many of the Republican candidates say that such dismissals are based on an exaggeration of their political views and a misreading by black Democrats of a fundamental conservatism among many blacks.
"One Democrat on public radio took it upon himself to accuse me of being a Tom or whatever, and the Republican Party was basically using us," said Dorothy LeGrand, a black lawyer who is the Republican candidate in the Fifth Congressional District in Minnesota.
"I'm not running on Jesse Helms's platform," she added. "I'm not running on Willie Horton. I will say he's a thug and a hoodlum and should be locked up. The Willie Hortons of this world are a threat to African-Americans."
Mr. Horton, a black convicted murderer who raped a white woman while on parole, was the subject of a Republican-produced commercial in the 1988 Presidential campaign that many blacks said was racist in tone.
Michael Murphy, a black man who spent 18 years as director of consumer affairs for Dunkin Donuts and is now running for Congress in Massachusetts, said that the welfare state had failed and that Republican policies would offer black people greater chances of advancement. "The system will be more of a trampoline than a swamp," he said.
In Houston the other day, at a national conference of hundreds of black conservatives, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, drew steady refrains of "Amen" and "Tell it" as he called for an overhaul of the country's welfare system.
Some black Republicans even use images of slavery to suggest that some Democratic-inspired programs have done little more than entrap blacks in poverty. "Now we're returning to the party of our liberation," said Marvin B. Scott, a Republican candidate for Congress in Indiana's 10th District.
Others said that they had put up with no end of grief from fellow black Democrats when they switched to the Republican Party.
"Most of them thought I was brain-dead," said Bill Jordan, a lawyer and minister who is the Republican nominee in a black-majority district in Mississippi. "But that's part of the problem that blacks have in this country. We so blindly support Democrats. Democrats know that no matter how ineffective programs might be, if they have the right name on them, blacks will support them."
The Republicans also have several black candidates at the statewide level this year. In Texas, for instance, the Republican nominee for state comptroller is Teresa Doggett, whose husband, John, gained brief prominence at the 1991 Senate Judiciary hearings on the Supreme Court nomination of Clarence Thomas when he testified that Anita F. Hill had acted disturbed after he had rejected her overtures for a date.
It is impossible to characterize these candidates as a group. Some said they hoped to act as a moderating influence on the party in the mold of Edward W. Brooke, the black Republican who represented Massachusetts in the United States Senate from 1967 to 1979.
Others, however, are unabashed conservatives, including Mr. Watts. He campaigns on a platform of staunch opposition to homosexuals in the military and to abortion in all cases except when a pregnant woman's life is endangered. Abortion is "a scriptural issue, not a political issue," he said.
Of public-assistance programs, he said, "Congress for too long has defined compassion in America by how many people are on food stamps and in public housing. I think we should measure compassion by how few people are on food stamps and in public housing."
And, taking a page from the playbook of Jack Kemp, a former Republican Congressman, Housing Secretary and football star who has come here to campaign for him, Mr. Watts said: "We've got to go into the black communities, and we've got to talk about capital formation. We've got to talk capital gains."
Mr. Watts, with 92 percent name recognition in one poll and known almost universally here as just J. C. (which stands for Julius Caesar), has shown a wide lead in some early polls in his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha. Many people expect the race to tighten considerably and predict that some white voters who told pollsters they would vote for Mr. Watts would not.
But Frosty Troy, editor of the Oklahoma Observer, a bimonthly political newspaper, said that Mr. Watts's conservative, Christian image was so firmly established that it could overcome the reluctance of many white conservatives to vote for a black man.
Perhaps even more tellingly, Mr. Troy added, Oklahomans seem to like their football stars this fall. Mr. Watts was a Sooners quarterback in his day, but so was the Democratic nominee for Governor, Lieut. Gov. Jack Mildren. A Republican nominee for Congress in Tulsa, Steve Largent, a former Seattle Seahawk, holds the National Football League record for career receptions. "Oklahoma," Mr. Troy said, "seems to be a jockocracy this year."

HEADLINE: Census Sees Falling Income and More Poor

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Despite the growth of the overall economy, the typical American household saw its income decline in 1993, and more than a million Americans fell into poverty, according to figures made public today by the Census Bureau.
The numbers show the persistence, and perhaps even the quickening, of one of the most worrisome trends in the American economy, the long-term growth in inequality. 
 The numbers may help explain the voter discontent that threatens to turn next month's elections into a nationwide rebellion, despite an expanding economy and relative international peace. While voters have voiced concern about everything from declining moral values to rising immigration, at least some of their anger may have its origins in a familiar place: the pinched pocket.
"Even though the economy looks good on the surface, most Americans are not yet seeing a substantial change in their fortunes," said Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary. "There's a lot of resentfulness out there, a lot of frustration, and a great deal of anxiety."
Mr. Reich stressed that the trend toward inequality had been apparent for the better part of two decades and defended the Administration's long-term strategy for fighting it. But he made no effort to hide his alarm. "America is in danger of splitting into a two-tiered society," he said. "This is not anyone's idea of progress."
From 1992 to 1993, median household income declined by about $300, when adjusted for inflation, to $31,241. While this 1 percent decline was small, most economists had expected an increase, because the economy bounced back from the recession that ended in 1991.
The decline in household income looks much larger when measured against 1989, the peak of economic expansion in the 1980's. From 1989 to 1993, the typical American household lost $2,344 in annual income, a fall of 7 percent.
There is a similar pattern in the percentage of Americans who fell below the poverty line. The 1993 figure of 15.1 percent was not significantly different from the previous year's, but was sharply higher than the 1989 figure of 13.1 percent. A family of four was considered poor in 1993 if it had an income of less than $14,763.
The stagnation that bedeviled the broad middle class came despite what seemed to be encouraging numbers on the overall economy. The economy grew by 3 percent in 1993, and the unemployment rate fell, to 6.8 percent from 7.4 percent the previous year.
The numbers even surprised economists who make a career of studying such trends. "It's quite rare to have median income fall in a year where there's aggregate growth overall," said Rebecca Blank, an economist at Northwestern University. "It's not a good sign."
While average per capita income was up, by 1.8 percent, most of the benefits flowed to the wealthiest Americans. The Census report showed record levels of inequality, with the top fifth of American households earning 48.2 percent of the nation's income, while the bottom fifth earned just 3.6 percent.
The trend toward greater inequality has a number of causes, many of them working to depress wages. Economists disagree over which factors are most responsible for wage stagnation or erosion, but the list of suspects includes increased international competition; the shift from a manufacturing to a service economy; the decline of unionization; and the erosion of the minimum wage.
While the decline of wages has been most pronounced for those with the least education, the wages of college-educated workers has also stagnated since 1987, said Isaac Shapiro, acting director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington advocacy group.
President Clinton made promises to meliorate these trends a major part of his 1992 campaign, and the voter anger may reflect disappointment that change has been slow to arrive. Mr. Clinton promised, for instance, a middle-class tax cut, but dropped it after taking office to fight budget deficits that he said were even worse than previously reported.
Gene Sperling, a White House economics adviser, said the President had put in place other strategies for helping average Americans, but that it was too soon to feel their effect. He cited, for instance, an expansion of tax credits for low-wage workers that will amount to more than $20 billion over the next five years.
He also cited a variety of programs aimed at raising the skills of average Americans to boost their wages. These include new training opportunities for dislocated workers and a change in student loan programs that allow borrowers up to 25 years to repay the Government.
"We are moving in the right direction, but we'd be the first to say there's still a long way to go," he said.
Mr. Reich made similar points, but with a tone of greater alarm, saying the nation's broad economic anxiety set the stage of demagogy on both the political right and left. "America has the most unequal distribution of income of any industrialized nation in the world," he said. "We cannot have a prosperous or stable society if these trends continue."
In issuing this year's poverty numbers, the Census Bureau adopted a system of statistical weighting that is different from previous years. While last year's official poverty rate was 14.5 percent, for instance, under the new system it would have been 14.8 percent. The increase to this year's figure of 15.1 percent does not meet tests of statistical significance.

HEADLINE: Revised Tax on Domestic Help Passes House and Goes to Senate

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
The House today easily approved a loosening of the requirement that household employers pay Social Security for domestic workers, a levy that gained attention last year in confirmation hearings for top jobs in the Clinton Administration.
The vote was 423 to 0. Passage by the Senate would send the measure to President Clinton, who is expected to sign it. 
 The bill would require household employers to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on any worker earning at least $1,000 a year, up from the current threshold of $50 a quarter. Teen-age baby sitters would be exempt.
The issue of the "nanny tax" has been a recurrent problem for the Administration, starting with Zoe Baird, President Clinton's first choice for Attorney General. Several other candidates for top positions were also embarrassed by revelations they had not paid Social Security taxes on their domestic help.
The Internal Revenue Service estimates that only about one-fourth of household employers pay taxes on their baby sitters, housekeepers and gardeners.
By raising the threshold and requiring employers to file taxes once a year, instead of quarterly, lawmakers believe that more people will pay taxes on their employees, allowing them to qualify for benefits from Social Security when they retire or become disabled.
The bill lets employers file both Social Security and unemployment taxes annually, and on their own 1040 Federal tax returns. Many states collect state unemployment taxes quarterly, however, and the bill addresses that by letting the Treasury Secretary enter into agreements with states to collect those unemployment taxes annually as well.
Under the bill, the $1,000 threshold would rise with future growth in wages, with increases occurring in $100 increments.

Syrian Foreign Minister Meets American Jews

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
The Foreign Minister of Syria has held the first formal meeting with leaders of American Jewish organizations, members of Congress and Jewish spokesmen said.
Mr. Shara met eight Jewish spokesmen in Washington Wednesday for a 45-minute session after an initial discussion with six members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The committee organized the meeting at the request of the Syrian Embassy, people attending the meeting said. 
 Mr. Shara told the American Jews that President Hafez al-Assad of Syria had made a strategic commitment to peace with Israel and there was no time to waste in getting a peace agreement signed.
Mr. Shara said that Syria would absolutely not take part in a high level conference to be held in Casablanca, Morocco, on the regional economic development of the Middle East, said Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations.
"But he said Syria's first priority was to change the region from war to peace," Mr. Hoenlein said, adding that Mr. Shara and the American Jews pledged to have further talks in the future.

HEADLINE: MISSION TO HAITI: POLICE;
U.S. Scrambles for Recruits to Bring Order To the Streets of Haiti's Two Largest Cities

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
With the interim police force it had hoped to install in Haiti now in disarray, the United States is scrambling to cobble together another force for Haiti's two largest cities and may soon hire "auxiliaries," basically any at least marginally trustworthy Haitian they can put in a uniform, senior Administration officials said today.
The military's plan to use members of the existing police and Haitian military for a new police force -- allowing American troops to hand off policing duties they accepted only reluctantly -- has faltered as many of the uniformed Haitians have either fled or refused to cooperate. 
 American commanders are now rushing to put together a credible force for both Cap-Haitien and Port-au-Prince, the capital, before the planned return of Haiti's exiled president, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in another week or so. But the effort is by no means assured and may leave the United States military stuck with policing duties for months to come.
"The plan hasn't been developed as far as we'd like," a senior Pentagon official acknowledged today. "In fact, we don't quite have a plan yet. We don't have the timing, the structure or the components down."
Although they have received only scant training, about 25 of the 900 recruits from refugee camps at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, will be sent to Cap-Haitien soon to take part in a police force as "public safety trainees." Out of desperation, the military is now discussing hiring other recruits from among ordinary Haitian working people. "That would be a total joke," said one senior American officer involved in Haiti planning, rolling his eyes.
The first group of some 840 international police monitors, some of whom have already arrived in Haiti under the direction of Raymond W. Kelly, the former New York City police commissioner, is ready to supervise a new Haitian force. But the monitors, carrying sidearms, will not perform police duties themselves.
A senior State Department official disagreed with the Pentagon's bleak assessment and said an interim police force in Cap-Haitien would be "up and running by Monday." The State Department official also said the Administration would not likely resort to using the auxiliaries.
Administration officials insist that an interim force will be in place within days, even if at first it is only an inexperienced constabulary that directs traffic. A symbolic force like this, composed of unarmed clerks taught how to march, would leave United States Army soldiers responsible for the more dangerous job of maintaining order until a permanent Haitian police force can be trained.
"Our mission is very clear: to maintain essential civic order," said the senior Pentagon official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "But we're also conscious of avoiding mission creep. That's why we're working so hard to put together an interim public security force."
Under the last-minute diplomatic agreement brokered by former President Jimmy Carter, the Haitian police and military agreed to be responsible for internal policing duties. But American and Haitian forces clashed almost immediately, culminating in the death of 10 Haitian police in a shootout with marines in Cap-Haitien on Sept. 24.
Since then, many Haitian security forces in Cap-Haitien and Port-au-Prince have stripped off their uniforms and fled, or refused to cooperate with American troops, forcing Army soldiers and Special Forces troops to fill the vacuum. "It is our feeling that the existing police and their effectiveness in many areas has almost totally disappeared, and in others degraded," Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters this week.
American commanders express confidence that they can eventually lure Haitian security forces out of hiding or their obstinacy with salaried jobs in an interim force, coveted treasures in Haiti's devastated economy. Indeed, a senior aide to Mr. Kelly said that uniformed Haitians and police monitors from Argentina, Jordan and St. Vincent started patrolling parts of Port-au-Prince together on Wednesday.
But the experience in Cap-Haitien, Haiti's second-largest city, raises doubts. The United States plans to establish an interim force first in Cap-Haitien and then phase in a similar force in Port-au-Prince precinct by precinct.
With no effective civilian police force in Cap-Haitien now, the American high command asked Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the head of the military, to send Haitian forces from elsewhere in the country. "General Cedras gave the order to deploy other people, but it was either not transmitted or it's been stalled in some way," said the senior Pentagon official, who said the incident illustrated how the authority of General Cedras and other senior military leaders is "coming unraveled."
The senior State Department official said the American commander in Haiti, Lieut. Gen. Hugh Shelton, had been ordered to find a Haitian military or police unit to go to Cap-Haitien. International monitors would accompany these forces.
Haitian refugees recruited at Guantanamo Bay would serve as clerks or traffic police. Members of President Aristide's Government and State Department officials chose the recruits based on a literacy test and a personal interview.
The recruits received three days of training in ethics, Haitian criminal law, and basic skills like traffic control, said Michael Berkow, the Haiti police project manager for International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program, a Justice Department agency.

HEADLINE: Mandela Says U.S. Must Aid World's Poor

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa told a joint meeting of Congress today that the United States and other wealthy nations must resist the lure of isolationism and dedicate themselves to improving the lot of all the world's people.
After spending the last two days asking the Clinton Administration to help his country, President Mandela had a broader message: As nations grow closer together, rich lands need to do more to aid poor ones because that will serve the cause of peace, prosperity and democracy. 
 Mr. Mandela said that if "the world is one stage and the actions of its inhabitants part of the same drama," then "each one of us as nations, including yourselves, should begin to define the national interest to include the genuine happiness of others, however distant in time and space their domicile might be."
In an appearance that was equal parts celebration and sermon, Mr. Mandela used the forum to serve not as a national spokesman, but as a global statesmen and visionary outlining his prescription for the post cold-war world. It was a vision in which the masses of Africa and elsewhere in the third world would not be marginalized, but central to a cooperative international effort to increase prosperity and freedom.
The "new world order that is in the making must focus on the creation of a world of democracy, peace and prosperity for all," Mr. Mandela told the lawmakers.
With the speech, Mr. Mandela became just the third foreign leader, after Winston Churchill and Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, to address a joint meeting of Congress more than once. Mr. Mandela spoke to a joint meeting of Congress in June 1990, shortly after he was released from 27 years in prison.
In a 33-minute speech that was interrupted more than a dozen times with applause, Mr. Mandela said that with the cold war over, it was time to move "to the positive," to "the global creation of the conditions which will make it possible for all peoples to enjoy the right to full human dignity."
He thanked the United States for its political and economic aid and expressed his gratitude to Congress in particular for leading the nation's efforts to fight apartheid. In 1986, Congress overrode a veto by President Ronald Reagan to impose economic sanctions against South Africa.
After explaining how interconnected Africa, America and the rest of the world have become, Mr. Mandela said: "I come out of a continent with whose travails and suffering you are very familiar. You will therefore understand it easily why I stand up to say that for such a powerful country such as yours, democracy, peace and prosperity in Africa are as much in your national interest as ours."
He saw 21st-century telecommunications creating a problem for fledgling democracies like South Africa.
"The new age will surely demand that democracy must also mean a life of plenty," he said. "As the images of life lived anywhere on our globe become available to all, so will the contrast between the rich and the poor" become a "force impelling the deprived to demand a better life from the powers that be."
On Wednesday night, the Hunger Project, an organization that fights malnutrition, awarded Mr. Mandela a $100,000 prize for his role in fighting hunger throughout Africa.
In a speech Wednesday night to 1,400 guests at a Washington hotel, Mr. Mandela said that Africa faced "a terrible food crisis." He estimated that 34 million people in the sub-Saharan region face daily shortages of food, adding that this was "the worst humanitarian crisis in modern times."
For most of Mr. Mandela's weeklong visit to the United States, he has focused on persuading the Clinton Administration and American businesses to assist his nation's economic revival. On Wednesday, the Clinton Administration announced plans for a $100 million enterprise fund to help small- and medium-size business in southern Africa as well as $150 million in loan guarantees to build housing and electrification projects in South Africa.
Mr. Mandela was originally scheduled to hold a long meeting today with Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, but they met for only a few minutes and agreed to schedule a longer session for Friday.
The Clinton Administration has urged such a meeting in the hope that Mr. Mandela's success at promoting reconciliation in South Africa can serve as an ideal for Haiti to follow.
"The most important thing South Africa can do for Haiti has been accomplished by President Mandela coming to the United States at this historic moment, and then on top of that agreeing to meet with President Aristide," President Clinton said at a news conference. "The Haitian people will see that you can bring a country where there have been deep, even bloody divisions together and work together in a spirit of freedom, reconciliation, democracy and mutual respect."

HEADLINE: U.N. Study Finds a Free Eastern Europe Poorer and Less Healthy

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 6

 BODY:
The unsettling years of transition from Communism to free-market democracies have left the most vulnerable people of Eastern and Central Europe significantly poorer, less healthy or fed and more prone to accidental death and homicide, according to a report published today by Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund.
Economic changes have "provoked a deterioration of unparalleled proportions in human welfare throughout most of the region," the Unicef study says. Rising incidence of infectious diseases, stress, malnutrition and alcoholism, already documented in Russia, affect a much wider area, the report shows. 
 "This health crisis is unprecendented in the peacetime history of Europe in this century," James P. Grant, the director of Unicef, said at a news conference today. He added that the crisis "is obviously contributing to eroding political support for the reforms that are under way.
The study covers developments from 1989 into early 1994 in Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia and Ukraine.
Giovanni Andrea Cornia, director of social and economic policy research at Unicef's International Child Development Center in Florence and the author of the report, told the news conference that low tax revenues and inflation buoyed by more spending on social programs was a major cause of the crisis.
He said that a shortage of drugs and vaccines, one result of reduced government spending, was having "a massive health impact."
Mr. Grant said that statistics from Russia continue to be the most discouraging, with a 10-fold increase in families living below the poverty line and a mortality rate up by 35 percent compared with the pre-1989 rate. The homicide rate in Russia had reached twice that of the United States by 1992, and is still rising. In Romania, the number of homicides had increased 60 percent since 1990.
While Unicef began its studies with a focus on women and children, Mr. Grant said, it soon became apparent that the group most at risk were young adult men, where cardiovascular disease, alcoholism and violent death are on the increase.
Unicef surveys not included in the report show that public satisfaction with living conditions is highest in the Czech Republic, with 54 percent of the people satisfied, Mr. Grant said. "But when you get to European Russia, 79 percent say they are dissatisfied with their living standards," he said. "When you get to the Ukraine, it's 88 percent.
Mr. Cornia said that as of early 1994, conditions were still declining in Russia and the Ukraine, but had begun to register some improvement in eastern Europe.
Among other findings of the report, titled "Crisis in Mortality, Health and Nutrition," are indications that school enrollments have begun to decline, often with kindergarten and higher education first to be eliminated by families who cannot afford to pay for services that were once heavily subsidized. Many children are also experiencing more instability in their families with increased poverty and violence.
Iodine deficiency disorders are endemic in all countries studied except parts of Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In Bulgaria the situation is as bad as in central Africa. Such deficiencies lead to goiter, nervous system damage, growth retardation and cretinism.
Protein and calorie intakes have been declining with shortages or rising costs of the most nutritious foods. The sharpest drops in consumption were in milk, fruit and vegetables, the report found.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
From Postwar Italy, With Style

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
YOU needn't have cruised down the Via Veneto on a Vespa in the 1960's to know what is meant by la dolce vita. It means Ferrari, Ferragamo and Fellini, Pucci and paparazzi: Italy during its years of postwar prosperity epitomized glamour. Beginning in the late 50's, the country enjoyed what Italians considered to be a miracle of economic and industrial expansion after the degradation of the Fascist years. But the biggest miracle was the number of talented people who came to maturity after World War II and gave to resurging Italy a culture and style that reached a peak by the mid-60's.
"The Italian Metamorphosis, 1943-1968," which fills the Guggenheim Museum, is a gigantic survey of what they accomplished in painting and sculpture, film and photography, fashion, architecture and design between the fall of Mussolini and the rise of a generation opposed to Italy's new opulence. 
 The subject is a great one. The exhibition is good, not great. It could have been better selected and more creatively organized to make relationships across the arts clearer. Still, it gives a sense of the range of achievements, and it includes, among more than 1,000 objects, classics like the sleek modernist Olivetti typewriter that Ettore Sottsass designed in the late 60's, and the teensy Isetta automobile that Ermenegildo Preti created in the early 50's, a two-seater with gills, a door through the front and bumpers about the size of your shins.
There are ornate and fabulously creative pieces of jewelry, some by artists whose work looks better on a small and decorative scale, where elegance counts, than on the scale of their paintings and sculptures. And there are works by artists who deserve to be better known in America, among them Mimmo Rotella, whose collages like "The Tiger" from the early 60's, made of ripped posters, brought a distinctive brand of Pop to Italy at the same time that they playfully referred back, in their all-over compositions, to Action Painting. The story of postwar Italian art is partly the story of a trans-Atlantic dialogue with America, but not -- as chauvinistic Americans tend to assume -- one in which we did all the talking and they did all the listening. Rotella is an example of an Italian original.
Francesco Lo Savio is another. He was doing Minimalism before the Minimalists, hanging monochrome canvases and bent black metal sheets on walls as early as 1959. Fausto Melotti is yet another, a sculptor of delicate, twittering forms.
Besides Lo Savio, Melotti and Rotella, far more important figures, like Alberto Burri, Lucio Fontana, Piero Manzoni and some members of the Arte Povera movement who came to prominence in the mid-60's using materials as unorthodox as ice and lettuce, prove that Italian postwar painting and sculpture, at its best, was vital, experimental, original.
At its best. At its worst, it was dreary, and the show provides evidence of this, too. Modernism was not altogether quashed under Mussolini as it was under Hitler; geometric abstractions continued to be painted. But after the war, it became necessary to redefine abstraction in Italy, and artists like Giuseppe Capogrossi, Afro Balsadella, Giulio Turcato and Piero Dorazio helped to do so by making it something that represented liberalism, freedom and change. Symbolically significant though their works may be, however, they are ignored in America for a reason.
Their paintings set this show off to a shaky start. You get the sense that paintings and sculptures in the exhibition, on the whole, could have been more meticulously selected. A bold artist like Emilio Vedova is represented by good and bad examples. So is Fontana. Luciano Fabro, Tano Festa and Jannis Kounellis look entirely uninteresting.
A couple of themes emerge from the exhibition. One has to do with the baroque. Germano Celant, who headed the team of nine curators that put the show together, writes in the catalogue that Italian postwar art was largely ignored by the rest of Europe and by Americans because it was "too much in line with 'leftist' thought, to which the West demonstrated an absolute aversion." But, he adds, its rejection "may also have been caused by its sensual and 'baroque extremism.' " Just look at Fontana's colored-glass and stone-encrusted canvases or his ceramic "Crucifixion," not to mention Salvatore Ferragamo's shoes and Arnaldo Pomodoro's jewelry, to see what Mr. Celant is referring to. There's even a baroque quality to certain of the Arte Povera sculptures.
Another theme has to do with materials. Italian artists and designers were exceptionally resourceful. When Roberto Mango echoed a 1950 design by Don Knorr for his own 1952 chair, he nonetheless gave it a new twist by using string for the seat and back. Carla Accardi made tubular sculptures out of rolled Sicofoil decorated with yellow, orange and black stripes.
Burri was more remarkable. His abstractions at first looked very loosely like Mondrians, then evolved into something closer to Abstract Expressionist paintings. But his materials included scraps of burlap, which he sewed together, creating Robert Rauschenbergs before the fact. He used rusted iron, as Richard Serra would do. And he took sheets of plastic and burned and twisted them, to create a strangely elegant and visceral music that struck its most gothic note in the blood-red cobwebs and burn holes of "Red Plastic" (1964).
Manzoni's materials, too, were unusual. His works from 1958-59 are white-on-white canvases creased in the middle, as if squeezed by corsets. He used straw, rabbit skin and burned wood to concoct sculptures in the manner of Meret Oppenheim, in one case at least, and pictures that were readymade Action Paintings, with flying fur in place of flying paint. Eventually he canned his own feces.
Then, of course, came Arte Povera figures like Alighiero Boetti, who froze sculptures, and Michelangelo Pistoletto, who bent and spray-painted burned corrugated cardboard into the shape of a rose, and Mario Merz, who used sacks of earth, neon tubing and even a raincoat.
Arte Povera is a movement Mr. Celant defined in 1967, so it's not surprising that he presents the whole postwar period as culminating in it. The exhibition's painting and sculpture section takes up the Guggenheim ramp, with the Arte Povera artists at the top. Everything else is in side galleries. But the scale of the show isn't a problem, as you might think. Design, glassware, jewelry and ceramic sections could have been bigger, if anything. There should have been one for textiles, too.
It's important that different media be brought together. An artist like Fontana, for example, painted and did sculptures, ceramics and jewelry. Too bad there is none of his work in neon here, just a photograph of a neon he did for the 1951 Milan Triennale. (A Fontana neon would have looked better in the Guggenheim's rotunda than Gae Aulenti's pointless installation of giant triangles does.) In postwar Italy, as Fontana illustrates, art connoted more than painting and sculpture. It included everything from shoes to vacuum cleaners to the lighting of a room. It was a way of life.
"The Italian Metamorphosis, 1943-1968" remains at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Fifth Avenue at 88th Street, through Jan. 22. The show is sponsored by the Italian Trade Commission, Centro di Firenze per la Moda Italiana and Telecom Italia. The show travels to Milan in February and to Wolfsburg, Germany, in May.

HEADLINE: China Energy Stock Listed on Big Board

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
China's booming energy sector received a cash infusion yesterday with the listing of a second company on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company, Huaneng Power International, China's largest independent power producer, issued 31.25 million American depository receipts at $20 each. 
 "Investors like the company very much," said Michael Bugel, an analyst with James Capel Asia in New York. "It has very strong government contacts."
Huaneng Power's stock was the sixth-most active on the exchange, with a volume of 2.64 million shares. It closed unchanged from its offering price of $20.
The listing came a day after the chief underwriter of the issue, Lehman Brothers, announced that it would lower the offering share price to $20, from the $27.50 noted in the company's preliminary prospectus.
An American depository receipt, or A.D.R., represents stock in a foreign company that is held in trust by a United States bank. A.D.R.'s are traded like stocks of American companies.
Half of Huaneng Power's A.D.R.'s are designated for sale in the United States and Canada, while a quarter will be offered to Asian investors and the rest to other investors outside China.
China's appetite for energy has outstripped supply in recent years, with the economy growing at double-digit rates. The country's total power generating capacity was 181,000 megawatts at the end of 1993. Official estimates call for an additional 17,000 megawatts in each of the next six years to meet demand.
Huaneng Power owns and operates five coal-fired power stations in various Chinese provinces and plans to acquire several more plants to expand its generating capacity to 7,500 megawatts by the end of the decade.
Huangeng Power is a subsidiary of a Chinese state company that was formed in 1985 to construct and operate power stations at a profit using imported power-generating equipment.
An unrelated company, the Shandong Huaneng Power Development Company (Hua neng means China power), became the first Chinese utility to list on the Big Board on Aug. 4. It reached a high of $14.375 on Aug. 12 and has since declined more than 10 percent. It closed yesterday at $11.625.

Bond Prices Mixed Ahead Of Jobs Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices were mixed yesterday as investors and traders waited to see if today's employment report for September would confirm that the economy is expanding and thus heighten fears about the possibility of accelerating inflation.
The price of the 30-year bond was unchanged at 9429/32 to yield 7.95 percent, with rates for shorter-maturity bills also holding the line. 
 With inflation fears come new market expectations of another increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. For the market to rally, traders said, it must have confidence that the central bank is doing its job, while the bank has to show it is staying ahead of inflation.
A sharp rise in jobs today could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates for the sixth time this year, analysts said. Market estimates of how many jobs were added to the economy last month range from 250,000 to 300,000, up from 179,000 in August.
An increase of more than 300,000 is likely to spur some move in the Federal funds rate or discount rate or both, analysts said. Since February, the central bank has lifted the Federal funds target to 4.75 percent from 3 percent and the discount rate to 4 percent from 3 percent.
David Cohen, an economist with MMS International in San Francisco, a market research and analysis firm, noted yesterday that only a month ago a report showing nonfarm payroll growth moderating to 179,000 in August was widely seen as corroborating the expansion's slowdown. Now the market awaits the September data worrying that a potential strong bounce in payrolls would confirm a new round of explosive growth.
Mr. Cohen said that a "moderate" payroll increase of 210,000 in September would suggest that "while the flow of data in the past month has reflected considerably more vitality than anticipated, it did not alter the likelihood that gross domestic product growth indeed slowed during the third quarter from the unsustainably strong pace of the previous three quarters."
Similarly, he said, that payroll growth -- averaging a robust 270,000 through the first eight months of 1994 -- is unlikely to be sustained.
An increase of 210,000, Mr. Cohen said, "would nevertheless be most respectable, reflecting a healthy labor market, consistent with the recent easing in initial unemployment claims to their lowest sustained level since 1989."
As far as wage pressures building, Mr. Cohen said that employers were holding the line, and expects that the average hourly wage in September will continue at a growth rate of two-tenths of 1 percent that had been the trend for the last three years.
"However, an uptick here or in nonfarm payrolls will raise the likelihood of a Fed tightening by mid-month," he said. "We see little chance of an immediate move on Friday."
His bet is for a rate increase of 50 basis points after the Fed's policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, meets next month. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
For most of the trading session yesterday, bonds bounced in a narrow range, with the Conference Board's help wanted index spurring short-covering early in the day.
The index for August fell 4 points, to 118, suggesting hiring had moderated after sustaining a rather torrid pace through much of the year.
Also yesterday, the initial jobless claims report for the week ended last Saturday released by the Labor Department rebounded 7,000, to 317,000, in line with market expectations but somewhat higher than anticipated by MMS International analysts. Despite the week's rise, the four-week moving average fell further to 319,000, its lowest level since May 1989.

HEADLINE: Waiting Out Japan's Trade Surplus

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Even as the United States struggles to reach new market-opening agreements with Japan, some foreign and Japanese economists believe that natural forces could eliminate Japan's huge trade surplus within the next decade or two.
"The trade surplus will disappear toward the end of the decade," Robert Alan Feldman, the chief of economic research for Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, predicted. Edward J. Lincoln, an economic adviser to the United States Embassy in Tokyo, said, "Certainly in the first decade of the 21st century it will disappear." 
 According to some economic theories, what will make the trade surplus disappear is the aging of Japan's population, which will bring about an economic and social transformation of the nation that could liquidate its current account surplus -- essentially the trade surplus adjusted for some other flows, such as foreign aid, gifts to relatives in foreign countries and earnings from foreign investments. This surplus measured $131.4 billion last year.
By the year 2020, about one in four Japanese is expected to be at least 65 years old, compared with about one in seven now, in large part because of a low birth rate. That could give Japan, which celebrates a national holiday every September called Respect-for-the-Aged Day, the oldest population in the world.
Older people tend to draw down their savings to support themselves. So as Japan's population ages, the nation's currently high private savings rate should decline.
Economists say that Japan's current account surplus is a byproduct of the fact that Japan saves more than it invests at home. That difference is what it invests overseas -- and by definition it equals the current account surplus. So if saving is replaced by consumption, and if there is not an equal drop in investment within Japan, the inevitable result will be a drop in the current account surplus.
Japanese households save about 14 percent of their disposable income compared with about 4 percent for Americans. This is partly because many Japanese remember the deprivation after World War II. They must also save for a long time for home down payments, which are extraordinarily large compared with those in America, both because housing is expensive and because mortgage lenders demand large equity cushions.
But Charles Horioka, a professor at Osaka University, predicts that Japan's savings rate will "decline very sharply, possibly approaching zero or even negative by 2010 or 2020." The rate has already dropped from a peak of 23 percent in 1974.
The Japanese Government has been citing such an argument to its trading partners out of self-interest. Tokyo has urged other countries to take a long-term view of its perennial trade surplus, because the problem will go away as Japan's working- age population shrinks. In the short term, some Japanese say, the trade surplus is needed so the nation must keep saving to prepare for the burden of caring for more and more elderly citizens.
"There is an aspect of preparing for the aging society in Japan's current account surplus," Motoshige Itoh, a professor at the University of Tokyo, wrote in "Misunderstandings about the Trade Surplus," a book published this year by the research institute of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
Washington ran into this argument recently when it urged Tokyo to cut taxes to stimulate its economy, which would in turn increase imports. When the Japanese Government recently cut income taxes, it also decided to offset this by raising the sales tax, partly on the ground that it was worried about affording care for the aging population.
Even if Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world falls away, it might not mean better trade relations with the United States, since the surplus with America could continue.
While the trade imbalance between the United States and Japan of roughly $60 billion a year has come to symbolize the larger trade problems between the two nations, pressure to correct it comes from American companies that have trouble selling in Japan.
"It's not just an issue of macroeconomics, it's also an issue of fairness," Ambassador Walter F. Mondale of the United States said at a news conference last week.
Even if Japan's trade surplus were to disappear, Western economic analysts say, there could still be complaints that Japanese markets are closed, just as there are complaints from other countries about trading practices of the United States, which runs a large trade deficit.
In fact, relying on theories alone is chancy, because Japan's trade surplus has defied other predictions and proved remarkably resilient. In the last two years, the surplus has soared to new records, partly because Japan's recession reduced domestic demand for imported goods.
Kenneth Courtis, an economic strategist at the Deutsche Bank in Tokyo, points out, moreover, that in the future Japan will have a huge stream of income from the investments it is now making overseas with its surplus savings. That income, he argued, will largely offset the decline in the current account surplus caused by an aging population.
Even those who expect the surplus to diminish say it may not take place soon. Yukio Noguchi, a professor of economics at Hitotsubashi University, has analyzed this question, and thinks the surplus will turn negative for Japan, but not until the year 2025 or so.
Clinton Administration officials agree that the recent agreements opening Japan's insurance, government procurement and flat glass markets will not shrink Japan's trade surplus very much by themselves. An agreement on automobiles and auto parts, which accounts for the largest part of the American trade deficit with Japan, could have far more effect, but over the long run.
Far more effective in reducing Japan's surplus, some economists say, has been the increase by roughly 25 percent of the yen against the dollar in the last two years. That makes Japan's exports less competitive abroad and the country's imports more attractive at home.
The rising yen, coupled with a resumption of economic growth in Japan, should reduce the nation's current account surplus to below 2 percent of economic output in a few years. This is one of the goals of the trade framework agreement signed by the United States and Japan last year. The International Monetary Fund predicted last week that Japan's surplus would fall to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product this year and 2.6 percent next year, compared with 3.1 percent last year.
But complete elimination of the deficit might have to wait until Japan grows older. The nation has the world's highest average life expectancy, with women likely to live for 82.51 years and men for 76.25 years. The Government reported last month that 5,593 Japanese were now at least 100 years old in a population of 125 million, up by 791 from last year.
Kazumasa Iwata, a professor of social and international relations at the University of Tokyo, said that a reduction in savings by the Government would go far toward eliminating the trade imbalance.
Japan has slipped into a national budget deficit, although it still has a surplus in its social security account. But as people get old and start drawing their social security payments, that surplus, too, will turn into a deficit.
The effect of demographic change on investment in the domestic economy remains unclear. With the labor force shrinking, some economists say, investment in new factories might decline. Or it might rise, as more automation is stimulated by the scarcity of labor.
"We do not know what will happen to investment," Professor Noguchi said.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 11.78 as Market Awaits Report on Jobs

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market declined again yesterday as traders nervously awaited a closely watched economic indicator today: the announcement by the Labor Department about monthly job creation.
"It was the least interesting day in the last two weeks," said Bernard Spilko, senior vice president of Bank Julius Baer, about yesterday's market. "But the holding pattern will end when the employment numbers are reported." 
 If these numbers demonstrate that the economy is growing too fast, it could be a sign of accelerating inflation, and the Federal Reserve may move quickly to raise interest rates for the sixth time this year. "Otherwise, the increase could come after Election Day," Mr. Spilko added.
All three major market indicators fell, with the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average down 11.78 points, to 3,775.56. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks dropped 1.16 points, to 452.36, while the Nasdaq composite index declined 2.09 points, to 744.19.
In addition, declines on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered advances by 1,124 to 988. Volume was 271.4 million shares, slightly under the yearly average and well below Wednesday's turnover of 360.3 million shares.
Cyclical issues, which are sensitive to swings in the economy, led the downturn, just as they did the previous day. An example was the auto stocks; General Motors declined 1 5/8, to 44; Ford Motor fell 3/8, to 27 1/4, and Chrysler dropped 7/8, to 44 1/4.
Biotech stocks, which had been moving up in the last two weeks, were hard hit by profit taking. Included were Biogen, off 2 1/8, to 49 1/4, and Chiron, off 2 3/8, to 61 3/8.
On the other hand, many mining companies moved against the trend and wound up on higher ground. Cyprus Amax rose 5/8, to 30; Battle Mountain Gold advanced 1/2, to 12 3/4, and American Barrick increased 5/8, to 25 5/8.
Among the special situations, Union Pacific dropped 1 7/8, to 50, after its hostile offer on Wednesday to acquire Santa Fe Pacific for stock it valued at $18 a share. Santa Fe Pacific, the most active stock on the Big Board and currently in a merger deal with Burlington Northern, gained 7/8 to close at 13 1/2.
Also on the down side, Apple Computer declined 1 5/8, to 36 1/4, a day after it jumped 4 1/8. There have been widespread rumors that the computer company will be acquired by Motorola, and both companies refused to comment.
With hot weather in September discouraging customers from buying fall and winter merchandise, TJX, a leading retailer, announced a decline of 4 percent in same-store sales, and its stock fell 2 3/8, to 17 7/8. International Paper, an important component of the Dow Jones industrials, dropped 1 1/8, to 76 3/8.
Printonix, which makes microcomputer printers, rose 2 3/8, to 22 1/4, after reporting sharply higher second-quarter earnings this week. First Alert, a producer of a new carbon monoxide detector for residential use, advanced 3 1/2, to 38 3/4, after an American Stock Exchange statement that option trading in the company's stock would begin on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Little Changed As Traders Await Jobs Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed against most other leading currencies yesterday as dealers awaited a report on United States employment in September.
The jobs data could give the Federal Reserve persuasive evidence that inflation in the United States is accelerating. That , in turn, could prompt the central bank to raise short-term interest rates. 
 "All the markets -- bonds, stocks and currencies -- are waiting for the nonfarm payroll data," Tom Benfer, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Montreal in New York, said. "The market is bracing for a strong number" in the increase in payrolls for the month, he said.
The Fed has increased interest rates five times this year. Bond prices tumbled after the previous rate increases, dragging down the value of the dollar. Currency dealers have been taking their cue from the American bond market to gauge demand among foreign investors for the dollar.
"There is no demand for dollar assets," Earl Johnson, a vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, said. "U.S. stocks and bonds are weak, so foreign investors have little need for dollars."
While higher rates should, in theory, bolster the currency by attracting money into short-term dollar deposits and assets such as Treasury bills, that has been more than offset this year by weakness and volatility in American stock and bond markets.
"Although rates here are now higher relative to Europe, foreign investors suffer losses if they buy into U.S. bonds and interest rates go higher," Mr. Benfer said. "They will flock back to U.S. assets when they're convinced that the Fed is done" raising rates, he said.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was virtually unchanged against the German mark, at 1.5436 marks from 1.5435 marks on Wednesday. The dollar rose slightly to 1.2795 Swiss francs, from 1.2785 Swiss francs on Wednesday. The dollar also edged up against the yen, rising to 99.88 yen, from 99.65 yen on Wednesday
But the dollar continued to weaken against the British pound, which has gained from higher interest rates. The pound was quoted at $1.5905 in New York trading, up from $1.5860 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday, were: 5.2760 French francs, up from 5.2745; 1,567 Italian lire, down from 1,570, and 1.3468 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3453.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: POLL;
Giuliani's Approval Rating Rises to 61%

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Bolstered by his maverick support of a Democratic Federal crime bill, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani now has the approval of a majority New York City residents, according to a New York Times/WCBS-TV News Poll.
The poll, taken between Sept. 29 and Oct. 2 with 495 city residents participating, shows that the Mayor's approval rating has shot upward in the last three months, increasing to 61 percent from 49 percent in June. His rating is roughly tied with the first rating of Mayor David N. Dinkins four years ago; but Mr. Dinkins's popularity quickly began to decline, while Mr. Giuliani's seems to be on the rise. 
 In another finding, the poll showed that among registered voters across New York State, the state comptroller's race is a dead heat, with H. Carl McCall, the Democratic incumbent, tied with the Republican challenger, Herbert London.
The poll also showed that Karen S. Burstein, the Democratic candidate for state attorney general, has a comfortable lead over Dennis C. Vacco, the Republican, although neither candidate commanded a majority of those polled.
The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points among city residents and 3 percentage points among registered voters statewide.
The increasing popularity of Mr. Giuliani, who is a Republican, comes at a time of municipal retrenchment, with the Mayor ordering deep cuts in city spending and services to balance the budget. But few of his new supporters mentioned his belt-tightening in follow-up interviews. Rather, they cited his support for President Clinton's crime bill and his refusal to endorse automatically the Republican gubernatorial candidate, two positions that have annoyed many Republican Party leaders.
"He doesn't show partiality to any party," said Abraham R. Cutler, a retired city administrator who lives in the Pelham Parkway section of the Bronx. He now approves of the Mayor, after being undecided three months ago: "If he thinks something is good for the city, like the crime bill, he supports it, just like he's doing with Cuomo and Pataki. He's got an open mind on things."
The Mayor has so far withheld his endorsement in the gubernatorial race between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and his Republican opponent, State Senator George E. Pataki.
But the poll showed that despite the Mayor's popularity, his endorsement makes no difference to 69 percent of the New York City residents polled. Seventeen percent said it would make them more likely to vote for his choice, and 11 percent said it would make them less likely.
Mr. Giuliani's approval rating is lower than that of former Mayor Edward I. Koch at his peak in 1981, when 71 percent of New Yorkers approved of his performance. Mr. Koch's rating eventually declined to 33 percent in 1989. Mr. Dinkins's rating began at 56 percent in 1990, and quickly declined to 29 percent by the next year. It was at 45 percent at the end of his term.
In an indication that even municipal layoffs cause jitters in a troubled economy, 46 percent of the city residents polled said they would rather have local taxes raised than see the city lay off workers to balance the budget. Twenty-eight percent said they would prefer the layoffs.
The results in the comptroller's race indicate that Mr. McCall is having difficulty generating name recognition and support from his incumbency. Though he is the only black candidate running for statewide office on a major ticket, Mr. McCall has even failed to make significant headway among black voters. The poll showed that he is supported by 57 percent of black voters, and that 30 percent of the respondents who are black are undecided.
In another statewide race, the poll showed Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the incumbent, with a wide lead over Bernadette Castro, the Republican candidate. If the election were held today, 65 percent of those polled said they would vote for Mr. Moynihan, and 18 percent said they would support Ms. Castro.
The poll asked several questions about Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a leading supporter and organizer of Mr. Pataki's run for governor. As they did in a similar poll two years ago, only a quarter of respondents expressed a favorable opinion of Mr. D'Amato, while a plurality -- 35 percent -- had an unfavorable opinion, and 45 percent said they believe he does not have the honesty and integrity they would like to see in a senator. Thirty-one percent said they believe he does.
Fifty-two percent of those polled, however, said it made no difference to them whether Mr. D'Amato would exert influence over Mr. Pataki if he were elected. The Cuomo campaign has repeatedly tried to stress the close ties between the two Republicans, hoping some of Mr. D'Amato's tarnish will rub off on Mr. Pataki.
Another poll, released yesterday by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute in Hamden, Conn., found a 3 percentage point lead for Mr. Pataki among likely voters. The poll, conducted among 691 people who said they would definitely vote on Nov. 8, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The results were similar to those of the Times/WCBS-TV News poll, released Tuesday, which also showed the Republican gubernatorial candidate leading by 3 points. Because his lead was within the margin of error of the two polls, Mr. Pataki and Mr. Cuomo are considered statistically tied.

 Japan's huge trade surplus could disappear because of natural forces, some economists believe. The surplus, which the United States points to as a symbol of the larger trade problems between the two nations, will shrink as the Japanese population ages, these economists say.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Congress, Haiti and Ravens

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Often, listening to some of the American journalists and politicians who opposed the U.S. intervention in Haiti, you can hear clearly what they do not say. They want the mission to fail and Haiti to explode into violence and chaos.
They do not want American troops to be killed. But if casualties do come, they are poised, mouth and computer at the ready, to scream havoc. 
 They think of themselves as in favor of democracy. But they are so committed to the idea that Haitians are incapable of achieving or maintaining it that they await the first stumbles with chilling eagerness.
They are so full of angers at President Clinton that they get hives at the thought that his decision to move against the Haitian dictators will burnish his name internationally and maybe even do a little something for him in 1996.
These ravens are a minority compared with Americans who opposed military involvement in Haiti but hope it will work. The reason to take account of them now is that at the first sign of trouble they will demand the one step guaranteed to wreck the American mission: the immediate military and economic desertion of Haiti.
Nothing, I think, can raise the raven people from the dyspeptic ditch into which they have thrown themselves. But for Americans with open eyes, hearts and mind, the operation has been a great teacher of the nature of dictatorship. Many Americans, blessed with freedom, might not have understood.
Even with American troops present, the dictatorship beat their people with clubs, or shot them dead in the street.
We could understand then that the dictatorship was destined to do this, although the world watched. The police had no other choice because the dictatorship could conceive of no other way of dealing with the people.
We learned that unless American troops had landed, the generals would never have agreed to leave power. Only when they knew that American troop planes were in the air did the generals acknowledge that their reign was over. All the negotiations, for the three years they were in power, were a fraud. By definition honorable dictators do not exist.
And when we saw Haitians run to greet the Americans we knew at once that the joy grew out of the hate they bore for those who beat them and shot them. In the streets, it was election day in Haiti -- under the guns of the tyranny but poignantly clear in choice.
President Clinton and U.S. forces still have work to do in Haiti and enemies to take on. But they have done much of what they can do by themselves. Now it is up to President Aristide and Congress. Either can make and destroy the mission.
President Aristide, although elected by his people and overthrown by killers, is not liked in America, very not liked. "Loony Communist" is the most affectionate term of the ravens. But large numbers of non-ravens also resent him.
He has given them plenty of reason. The Heritage Foundation has compiled a list of bone-mean Aristide insults and inanities about the U.S., incitements to kill, Socialist blather and capitalist-baiting. He admires Che Guevara and thinks Christopher Columbus was nothing but "a big white man, a colonial" who stole and exploited America. Columbus was not at all big.
But the mission was not simply to restore Mr. Aristide but to prepare the way for an elected successor next year. American officials urge amnesty for Haitian murderers. If Mr. Aristide works toward a free election, Americans and Haitians will find it in them to give him amnesty for leftish nastiness.
Congress can do more to help or hurt Haitians than Mr. Aristide can. The good news is that right now it is helping, by resisting pressure to set a specific date for withdrawal of U.S. troops. Republican and Democratic senators understood that would be a gift to the followers of the dictatorship.
But when the troops withdraw, Congress could nullify their work and the whole mission unless it appropriates some money to help Haitians get the small-business credits they need so desperately, build roads and communications destroyed by the decades of tyrannies.
To help a neighbor out of a burning house and then walk away leaving him naked and hungry -- it does not seem sensible, compassionate or the American way, if raven-friends will forgive the sentimentality.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Gets Warning On Auto Emissions Rules

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
New Jersey legislators were told today by Federal officials that they must enact tough new auto emissions standards by February or face sanctions that could virtually shut down road-building and business expansion in the state by next summer.
Officials of the United States Environmental Protection Agency told the lawmakers at a hearing here that the state had exhausted its discretion under the Federal Clean Air Act of 1990 to obtain additional time to lower pollution from automobiles. They said that Federal sanctions would be triggered automatically if the February deadline passed without tough new state standards. 
 Members of Governor Christine Todd Whitman's cabinet also urged passage of the required legislation. But the legislators, many of whom face re-election next year, said they were worried about the reaction of motorists to a program that some say is too expensive and unworkable. Some lawmakers said they doubted there were enough votes to approve the new standards.
The Environmental Protection Agency, under the 1990 Federal law, is requiring New Jersey to create an enhanced system of inspection and maintenance to cut down on auto emissions. Senator Robert E. Littel, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that it could cost as much as $700 million to create the new system.
"The E.P.A. has a failed system on its hands and instead of admitting it and returning to the drawing board, they attempt to punish the states that refuse to implement their system," he said.
The new testing system would be a significant technical advance over the current tailpipe test, which measures hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, two of the three major pollutants from auto exhaust. In the new test, computers connected to a dynamometer -- a treadmill device that causes a car to replicate its highway performance at various speeds -- measure those two pollutants as well as nitrogen oxide, which creates ground-level ozone.
Several states in the Northeast have either suspended their new auto emission testing programs or refused to create them. But Richard Wilson, Deputy Assistant E.P.A. Commissioner for air and radiation, said most of the 23 states under Federal orders to adopt enhanced emissions tests in their urban areas were complying. He said that the few holdouts were expected eventually to come around.
Maine, for example, has suspended its mandatory testing program, but is expected to resume it in March. Vermont has refused to adopt legislation and faces Federal sanctions. Delaware put its program on hold while it looked for less expensive ways of meeting the Federal guidelines. And Virginia is discussing the program with the E.P.A.
"It's a new program and there is always some controversy when you introduce something that affects all the public," Mr. Wilson said.
Because it is the most densely populated state in the country, New Jersey is the only state required to conduct the new tests in all parts of the state. Other states must introduce the tests only in urban centers. To meet the Federal guidelines, New Jersey must reduce auto emissions of organic compounds including hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide by 25 percent and nitrogen oxide by 75 percent by the year 2005 in southern New Jersey and 2007 in the northern half of the state.
Motorists would pay a fee of $28 for the new test. But if their cars fail, they might be required to pay at least $450 for repairs to fix the emission problem, according to Federal officials.
But Mr. Wilson said that only 3 percent of the cars are expected to need major repairs. He said most problems could be fixed for less than $100. He said that the new system, far from being expensive, represents "the best and cheapest way to provide clean air for New Jersey."
Several senior members of the Whitman administration -- Frank Wilson, the Transportation Commissioner, Deborah T. Poritz, the Attorney General, and Robert C. Shinn Jr., the Environmental Protection Commissioner -- warned the legislators that the state faces serious consequences if new regulations are not adopted on time.
Mr. Wilson said his department "could be effectively out of business after Feb. 2, 1995." He said New Jersey could lose $500 million in Federal highway funds and 20,000 construction jobs, as well as money for mass transportation. Other witnesses said the sanctions would impose tough new pollution-control requirements on businesses seeking to expand or move into the state.
Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., chairman of the Senate Natural Resources, Trade and Economic Committee, which conducted the hearing along with the Assembly Environment and Energy Committee, said he was frustrated by the inflexibility of the program and what he characterized as the apparent indifference of Federal officials to the consequences of the threatened sanctions. "If imposed, these sanctions would essentially bring the economy of this state to a standstill," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. SENDS FORCE AS IRAQI SOLDIERS THREATEN KUWAIT

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Iraqi troops took up positions near Kuwait today, prompting President Clinton to dispatch Navy and Marine forces to the region and to warn that Washington would defend its Persian Gulf allies.
Pentagon officials said that Iraq had moved 10,000 troops, including forces from its elite Hammurabi division, to the area near Basra, about 30 miles from the Kuwait border, bringing the total number of Iraqi troops in the area to between 40,000 and 50,000. 
 The division, part of Iraq's Republican Guard, escaped destruction in the Persian Gulf war three and a half years ago and is among the country's most potent and highly trained forces.
Another division, the Nida, was also reported to be heading south. Pentagon officials said they did not know if this division intended to take up positions near Kuwait.
American officials said the troop deployments, the most threatening moves Iraq has taken since the gulf war, were probably a bluff intended to encourage the United Nations Security Council to lift economic sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
But chastened by the failure to anticipate the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait three years ago, officials said that they could not be sure of President Saddam Hussein's intentions and that Washington was making a commanding show of force to warn Baghdad not to attack. Despite its defeat, Iraq has never acknowledged Kuwait's autonomy.
At a White House press conference, Mr. Clinton said he had ordered "precautionary steps" and would not permit Baghdad to intimidate the United Nations into lifting sanctions. "It would be a grave mistake for Saddam Hussein to believe for any reason that the United States would have weakened its resolve on the same issues that involved us in that conflict just a few years ago," President Clinton said.
Pentagon officials said that the next two days could be critical in determining whether to send ground troops or take other military steps.
The state-run Iraqi News Agency denied any intention by Baghdad to invade Kuwait, saying "peace-loving Iraq has no aggressive intentions."
But at the United Nations, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, delivered a scathing speech demanding that the Security Council end trade and oil embargoes that have devastated the Iraqi economy.
Madeleine K. Albright, the United States delegate to the United Nations, countered that Mr. Aziz was ignoring Iraq's failure to abide by several United Nations demands.
To strengthen its forces, President Clinton ordered the American aircraft carrier George Washington from the Adriatic to the Red Sea, which would put its planes within striking distance of Iraq. An Aegis cruiser, which is equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles, is also being deployed to the Red Sea. Pentagon officials said it would take four or five days for the ships to get there.
The Pentagon also ordered a Marine amphibious group to leave the United Arab Emirates and steam to the northern Gulf. An Aegis cruiser and a destroyer, each equipped with cruise missiles, are already on routine patrol in the Persian Gulf.
One of the most important steps the Pentagon took was to order maritime prepositioning ships, huge floating warehouses based at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, to set sail for the Gulf. The ships contain tanks, vehicles and war materiel for a force of 16,500 Marines, including 5,000 fighting men.
In addition, the Pentagon is sending ships with Army equipment from Diego Garcia, perhaps enough to equip a brigade of 6,000 troops. The Army has already stored enough equipment in Kuwait for a brigade.
A senior Pentagon official said that American troops, whose number he put at less than 20,000, had been alerted for possible deployment to the gulf. They would be flown in to link up with the equipment now en route.
The United States has also stepped up reconnaissance flights. Washington still has about 70 planes on the Arabian peninsula, which have been enforcing the no-flight zone in southern Iraq.
Ms. Albright told a closed meeting of the Security Council, that if Iraqi forces continued to stream south, Iraq would have a total force of 60,000 to strike Kuwait. The force would be equipped with 700 tanks and 900 armored personnel carriers.
The American force being sent is substantial, but still a far cry from the allied force of more than 500,000 that defeated Iraq in the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
The swiftness of Washington's response reflects the Clinton Administration's belief that Iraq remains a menace to the region. The Bush Administration sought to destroy Iraq's ability to threaten its neighbors during the Persian Gulf war, but fell short. According to the Central Intelligence Agency, half of the Iraqi Republican Guard, including about 365 T-72 tanks, got away.
One of the divisions, the Hammurabi, was the unit that was spared destruction when President Bush ordered an end to the ground war after only 100 hours. Officials said that the two Iraqi divisions heading south have about 350 tanks.
All told, Iraq has about 28 divisions, including 7 Republican Guard divisions. According to estimates, Iraq's army numbers about 350,000, about 100,000 of which are reservists. That is far short of its one-million-man military during the gulf war. But it is enough to intimidate and invade tiny Kuwait.
Administration officials said the Iraqi deployments are probably saber-rattling intended to underscore Baghdad's demands for the lifting of the economic sanctions. The Security Council is scheduled to take up the issue of the sanctions next week. The United States wants to keep the sanctions, but Turkey, Russia and France want to lift them.
Iraq may be trying to show that it will stir up trouble if the sanctions are not lifted. Baghdad may also be calculating that the United States has been distracted by its intervention in Haiti and the fighting in Bosnia. On Oct. 4, President Saddam Hussein condemned the American-led effort to maintain the sanctions, saying that "the Iraqi people will render helpless those harboring ill intentions."
But American officials said that the Iraqi actions would strengthen Washington's argument that the sanctions should not be lifted. Defense Secretary William J. Perry said the troop movements "are not routine and are not typical of what we've seen in the past and therefore cause us concern."
The Saudi Foreign Minister, Saud al-Faisal, met briefly with President Clinton this afternoon. Mr. Clinton assured the Saudis that Washington has an ironclad commitment to Saudi security, and the Saudis were reported to have said they would cooperate with American efforts to defend the Gulf.


GRAPHIC: With members of the elite Iraqi Republican Guards heading toward the border with Kuwait, the United States called a limited troop alert and sent an aircraft carrier to the Red Sea. It is also sending 2,000 marines to the Gulf and dispatching huge floating warehouses of weapons in case troops are flown in. (Sources: Department of Defense Associated Press) (pg. 6)

HEADLINE: CONGRESS WINDS DOWN: THE PRESIDENT;
Clinton Assails G.O.P. for Effort To 'Kill It or Just Talk It to Death'

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
After months of watching Congress shoot huge holes in his legislative agenda, President Clinton fought back today, saying the Republicans had pursued a strategy to "stop it, slow it, kill it or just talk it to death."
Mr. Clinton's accusation of obstructionism, issued as Congress prepared to leave town without a crowning achievement and with the midterm elections now little more than four weeks away, was meant to transfer blame to Republicans for inaction that polls indicate has left many voters disillusioned with Congress and with Washington in general. 
 Today the Senate dealt a final blow to legislation that would have restricted lobbying and gift-giving in the capital and then, with the House, resumed an agonizing crawl toward adjournment that left what remains of their business in limbo. [Page 9.]
But the White House had already begun to switch gears for a daunting political campaign, scheduling the formal afternoon news conference at which the President made his case.
Mr. Clinton not only complained about the way the Republicans, led by Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House minority whip, had blocked a whole string of measures in the final weeks of Congress, but he also tried to make the case for why Americans should vote for Democratic candidates, particularly the party's endangered incumbents.
He mocked the national "contract" of promises that Republicans presented in Washington last week, calling it a throwback to failures of the past. While he acknowledged that the achievements of the 103d Congress had been modest, he said it had taken substantial strides in important directions.
"It was only a beginning, and more could have been done," Mr. Clinton said of the successes and failures of his first 20 months in office, which have left him burdened by low public approval ratings. He said he feared that his economic achievements had too often been overlooked.
But on health care, campaign finance reform and a welter of other areas in which he had promised that his Presidency would make a difference, he declared that the void that remained was the fault of Republicans intent on turning back the clock.
"What is the direction you want?" Mr. Clinton said, rehearsing the question he plans to pose across the country between now and the elections on Nov. 8. He said the Democrats were committed to "fighting for the future, not going back to the past," and echoed the plea that President Ronald Reagan made to voters as midterm elections neared 12 years ago, at a time of recession-driven political distress.
"Staying the course," Mr. Clinton said, "is good for the country."
An election held today could result in Democratic losses so heavy as to leave the Senate and even the House under Republican control, some polls show. That would almost certainly leave Mr. Clinton unable to deliver on his many unredeemed campaign promises, and his aides said he planned to travel to a dozen states in the next 25 days alone in trying to fend off that politically catastrophic prospect.
With his own popularity sagging, aides to Mr. Clinton recognize that the effect of his appeals may be limited. But they said his remarks today served as the opening volley of an effort to convince voters angry at gridlock that the way out lies not in repudiating incumbents but in punishing the Republicans, whom the President portrayed as standing in the way of progress.
In denouncing the "contract" that 300 Republican Congressional candidates offered last week on the steps of the Capitol, Mr. Clinton renewed Democratic efforts to apply an unsavory appearance to a potentially appealing package that includes calls for a balanced-budget amendment, tax breaks and a military buildup.
"Do they really want this contract," the President said of American voters, "which is a trillion dollars of unfunded promises, a contract which will certainly lead to higher deficits, cuts in Medicare and throwing us back to the years of the 80's, when we lost jobs and weakened our country?
"Or do we want to face up to the challenges which were not met in this Congress and use the next Congress to keep the economic growth going, to pass health care reform, to pass welfare reform, to pass political reform and to deal with these environmental issues?"
Mr. Clinton looked and sounded somewhat tense throughout the 45-minute news conference, in the chandelier-adorned East Room of the White House. The political message he offered had been developed in weeks of meetings involving him and top advisers, but some aides said he recognized the risk in arguing, as he did today, that the country is moving in the right direction when polls show that nearly 6 in 10 Americans believe it is on the the wrong track.
The President began the session by reading a statement intended to underscore his accomplishments in creating jobs and building a healthier economy. But he had to contend with questions that lurched from his political plight to military moves by Iraq to accusations of impropriety leveled against Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
On the subject of Mr. Cisneros, the President voiced strong support for the Housing Secretary, saying a controversy over his payments to a former mistress should not disqualify him from continuing to serve in the Cabinet. Mr. Clinton was not asked about what his aides regard as the more sensitive question: whether Mr. Cisneros lied to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the payments when the bureau was conducting its pre-appointment background check on him.
Mr. Clinton attributed his own lack of popularity to "a period of drag" that has plagued nearly all modern Presidents in midterm election years. He noted that Republicans suffered heavy losses even in 1982, only two years before President Reagan rebounded to win a landslide re-election victory.
Mr. Clinton said part of his problem was that too few Americans knew of his accomplishments, including a four-year low in unemployment announced by the Labor Department today. "The record is a good one," he said, "and there is ample evidence that if people knew the record, they would respond to it."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Recycled Material Is Finding A New and Lucrative Market

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
Recycling is being transformed from a gesture to help the environment into a solid business. Used paper, cardboard and newspaper that had recently languished in warehouses are now hot commodities. The reasons: an economic recovery that has increased demand for raw materials, and a commitment by manufacturers to build the mills that can process recycled products.
The surge in demand has sent prices soaring, and has made it more likely that what is rescued from the trash at home and in the office will find a valuable use somewhere else in this country. In the past, much of the trash collected for recycling was exported because of low domestic prices. 
 Bales of old corrugated boxes that sold for as much as $35 a ton in September 1993 shot up to as much as $110 a ton in the Midwest by last month. Waste paper collected from offices went from less than $15 a ton to more than $85 in the same period. Newspapers jumped from less than $30 a ton to more than $55. There have been similar increases in most other regions.
Prices for steel cans, which are melted and used to make new steel, have increased to a range of $70 to $110 a ton east of the Mississippi, from $30 to $70 a ton two years ago.
Even some plastics, typically the weak sisters among recyclable materials, are in greater demand. A poor cotton harvest in China in recent months has had brokers in Western states scurrying to gather old soda bottles to be transformed into synthetic fibers for the textile industry there.
"The last year represents the beginning of the maturing of the recycling industry," said Ralph Earle, an environmental strategist with Arthur D. Little Inc., the consulting firm. He said investments over the last six to eight years in equipment to collect, transport and process recycled material have created momentum for the industry.
Indeed, recycling is becoming a significant line of business for some other companies, as well. Browning- Ferris Industries, the nation's second-largest trash hauler, expects recycling revenue to approach $400 million this year, or about 10 percent of its total. As recently as 1989, recycling amounted to less than 1 percent of the company's revenue.
"This is the fastest-growing business we have," said Philip Angell, an aide to William D. Ruckelshaus, Browning-Ferris's chairman. "And the margins are in the mid-teens, which produces respectable profits." The company can thus sell the recycled paper for about 15 percent more than it costs to collect and process it.
"Recycling has become a big business," said J. Winston Porter, an environmental consultant who was assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from 1985 to 1989. "Something like one-quarter of the nation's garbage is being handled" this way, he said.
The current situation is in contrast with that in the late 1980's, when very limited capacity spurred fear of a landfill crisis, particularly in the Northeast. This led some cities and states to adopt laws encouraging or requiring families and businesses to separate cans, bottles and paper from other trash so they could be recycled. Such recycling continues in a number of these places.
However, collection is only part of the recycling process. Once collected, the material must go through a factory or mill where it can be processed into a product some one wants to buy.
From 70 to 80 percent, by weight, of all material collected for recycling consists of paper products of some kind, according to people in the industry. But most mills were equipped only to make products using virgin fiber from trees and were not prepared to handle the new flood of used paper.
The result was a sharp drop in prices for the growing supply of waste paper collected. Just a few years ago, the markets were so bad that many paper brokers charged customers a fee to take the paper off their hands.
But there have been other forces at work to halt that trend and turn it around. Recycling programs are popular with voters, and states and cities ratcheted up recycling goals. Big trash-hauling companies like Browning-Ferris and WMX Technologies added recycling programs to their bids for collection contracts, although industry executives grumble that it is hard to make money with curb-side programs because of the costs of collection and sorting.
A year ago, President Clinton issued an executive order requiring Federal agencies and the military to buy printing and writing paper with a minimum of 20 percent recycled fiber.
In addition to household paper, collection companies focused on office buildings and large institutions, where large loads of relatively clean paper could be picked up at one stop. Company officials say the commercial, rather than residential, part of the recycling business is where the money is to be made.
Recycled paper has long been used in products requiring lower grades of paper, like facial tissues, toilet paper and cereal boxes. The makers of higher grades, for use in printing and writing paper, generally insisted on virgin fiber to control the quality of their products. But today, even makers of the highest-grade papers are finding ways to incorporate recycled fiber because of the public demand.
With their customers pressed into demanding recycled paper, paper companies began installing equipment capable of removing ink and preparing the paper fibers for reuse on big paper-forming machines. Unlike aluminum and steel, which can be recycled endlessly, recycling weakens paper fibers, so that only 80 to 85 percent can be used again.
When paper mills install recycling equipment, they want to run it continuously, the way they do their other machinery. That requires an assured supply.
An expanding economy increases demand for most commodities, so demand for aluminum and steel cans is higher than a year ago, as is demand for the polyethylene ter-ephthalate plastic used in big soda bottles and the high-density polyethylene used in milk jugs.
Chinese manufacturers appear to be heavy buyers of the former for use as an alternate fiber in textiles -- the plastic can be manufactured into thread -- and the high-density polyethylene appears to be going into the chemical industry as a raw material, said Chaz Miller, manager of recycling for the Environmental Industries Association, which represents the waste-management industry.
A lot of plant additions capable of processing waste paper, cardboard and newspaper are expected to come on line in the next two years. For example, plant capacity for recycled office paper is expected to rise by nearly four million tons in 1995 and 1996, up from an increase of less than 700,000 tons in 1993 an 1994.
The increases are so great that they raise questions about whether the current collection system will be able to supply them all.
"The question is where we can get new sources of fiber," said John Ruston, an analyst with the Environmental Defense Fund. "The B.F.I.'s of this world," he said of Browning-Ferris, "have pretty much tapped out the big office buildings, so they are going to have to look at new sources like shopping malls and stores. They are also going to have to figure out how to get paper out of smaller cities."
The competition for fiber, he said, will force producers of lower-grade paper products, like tissues, to look at alternatives that until now have not been widely recycled.
"They are going to have to dig deeper into the waste stream and look at things like junk mail," Mr. Ruston said. "A lot of new products will be coming to market."

HEADLINE: CONGRESS WINDS DOWN: THE CONGRESS;
At the Capitol, Much Talk But Hardly Any Action

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Congress praised itself today, denounced itself and complained that the public misunderstood it, while crawling toward adjournment with hardly any votes on anything.
The most decisive action was a Republican victory. The Senate voted not to vote on legislation requiring lobbyists to register and report who pays them and prohibiting members of Congress from accepting gifts and golf junkets. The measure died after the Senate fell 10 votes short of the 66 needed to break a Republican-led filibuster against the bill, which the House passed last week. 
 Then the Senate moved on, wallowing in four more Republican filibusters, one against a bill to protect the California desert and three against Air Force promotions bitterly opposed by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. He accused two of the candidates of mismanagement on military projects and the third of illegally interfering with a promotion board.
Another bill that was dying in the Senate would apply all Federal workplace laws, like those involving discrimination, overtime and occupational safety, to Congress. The House passed it on Aug. 10 but tonight gave up on the Senate. Instead, by a 348-to-3 vote, the House amended its rules to apply most aspects of those laws to itself alone.
All day long, more energy and imagination went into analyzing the results of the 103d Congress than legislating. Indeed, the analyzing began at midday even though no one knew whether the legislative record for this Congress (except for the scheduled post-election session on trade legislation) would be completed tonight, Saturday or even Sunday. The House adjourned a few minutes after midnight, but senators said they would work into the weekend.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said, "We believe the record of the 103d Congress will be one of significant accomplishment, particularly in four areas: economic growth, trade, education and crime." He stressed economic growth, saying the record of Congress and the Administration was "nothing short of spectacular."
Like most Democrats who sounded off today, he accused Republicans of "total obstruction."
Republican leaders in the House also claimed success, but from a very different perspective. "We can be proud of this session," said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the deputy leader. "We were able to stop the big spending last spring. We were able to stop the worst parts of the crime bill.
"It is not obstructionist," Mr. Gingrich said. "It is interpreting the will of the American people."
Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington also claimed great, though misunderstood, accomplishment. "In area after area, this Congress has done extraordinary, even historic work," he said. Asked why the public did not appear to share that perception, he lashed out at the press, saying Congress had been "poorly reported."
"We pass record, historic education bills, they go on page 8" Mr. Foley said. "On the other hand, if something is blocked in the Senate, again, it goes on page 1. And then when a bill is mugged, the mugger is half the time praised for his proficiency in mugging the legislation, and the victim is condemned for having been mugged."
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, was one of the very few to offer a mixed report card. He recalled bipartisan cooperation with Mr. Clinton, from the North American Free Trade Agreement "to the Russian reconstruction program to approving all the appropriations bills before the new fiscal year to rapid approval of the President's Cabinet and Supreme Court nominees -- there were many areas of bipartisan cooperation."
He continued: "It goes without saying that there were also issues of disagreement. The so-called stimulus package. The budget. Health care reform. The crime bill. Campaign finance reform. Republicans make no apologies for trying to protect the American taxpayer from bad legislation in each of these areas."
Senator William S. Cohen of Maine, one of the nine Republicans who voted to bring the lobbying bill to a vote, offered a more general explanation of public doubts about Congress. He said they came from the belief that "laws are being shaped by high-paid lobbyists who don't really reflect the views or needs of the people."
He said the filibuster was thwarting the public's wishes. "People want to know who is being paid how much to lobby whom on what issues," Mr. Cohen said.
Senator Carl M. Levin of Michigan, a Democrat who with Mr. Cohen led the effort for the bill, said current lobbying laws are "permeated with holes, loopholes, promoting disrespect for laws."
On Thursday, a first effort to break the filibuster failed when Republicans contended that the measure would inhibit grass-roots lobbying. So today the bill's sponsors, who said the fears were groundless, offered to take out all sections that dealt with grass-roots lobbying -- lobbying like the campaign that deluged the Capitol with telephone calls against this bill.
But opponents would not accept that change. Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, said he might want to amend the changes. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said the bill would impose unfair burdens on nonprofit organizations.
Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, a Republican who voted against the earlier versions of the bill when 95 senators voted for it, then objected and blocked efforts to change the bill.
So when the second vote on ending debate was taken, it changed little from Thursday's 52-to-46 outcome. The effort now drew 56 votes, from 47 Democrats and 9 Republicans, while 7 Democrats and 34 Republicans voted to continue the filibuster. Because the gifts ban involved Senate rules, ending debate required a two-thirds vote of those present.
A few hours later, Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a Democrat who once asserted that although his vote could not be bought, it could be rented, asked the Senate if it could be changed. Since changing his vote would not alter the outcome, the Senate agreed and made him the 42d vote to keep the filibuster going, at least in the Congressional Record, which will also say that only 55 senators voted to halt debate.
Senator Wallop was also the central figure in the filibuster against the California desert measure. His insistence on delaying a vote led Mr. Mitchell to warn that he would keep the Senate in session all weekend if necessary, but late tonight Senator Mitchell said a vote would be taken at 10 A.M. on Saturday, indicating an agreement had been reached.
The bill would designate about 7.5 million acres as wilderness and expand two national parks. If enacted, it would be the biggest measure involving public lands since the 1980 Alaska Lands Act.
The bill is a major project of Senator Dianne M. Feinstein of California, a Democrat in a tough battle for re-election, and Republicans have acknowledged that denying her the accomplishment is an element of their opposition to the bill.
But most of the day was spent on talk, and most of the talk concerned Democratic complaints, and Republican boasts, about obstructionism.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, said: "Republicans have tried to derail any and every bill that has come along." And Senator Joseph R. Biden of Delaware, a Democrat who commutes by railroad daily from Wilmington, said people at the train station who used to ask him, "Why don't the Democrats have their act together?" were now asking, "Why don't the Republicans want anything to happen?"
Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, had an answer. He criticized Mr. Clinton and the Democrats on health care, the gasoline tax, the 1993 stimulus package and Haiti, and said, "I think, when the American people look at that list of items, that their answer is remarkably similar to the answer that the President accuses Republicans of giving, and that answer is no, no, no, no."

"It is not obstructionist," he said of his party's tactics, contending that his forces had blocked bad legislation. Behind him was Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas.

Chart: "COUNTDOWN: Congress Winds to a Close"
 The 103d Congress crawled toward adjournment yesterday with few votes. Shortly after midnight today, the House adjourned, but the Senate was to keep working. Republican leaders said they had succeeded in killing many bills, but Speaker of the House Thomas S. Foley said, "Congress has done extraordinary, even historic work."
 
LOBBYING: The most decisive action of the day was a vote not to vote on legislation that would have required lobbyists to register and report who pays them and would also have prohibited members of Congress from accepting gifts and golf junkets. The measure died after the Senate fell short of the votes needed to break a Republican-led filibuster against the bill, which the House had already passed.
 
ENVIRONMENT: The House approved a compromise version of a bill to protect millions of acres of desert in California, creating the largest wilderness area outside Alaska. The Senate began to debate the measure, but opponents immediately began to delay a vote using procedural rules, including requiring the Senate's clerk to read the entire 61-page bill aloud. Late last night, the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, said a vote would be taken at 10 A.M. today.
 
DRINKING WATER: A bill that would have revised the Federal standards for the purity of municipal water supplies died when negotiators from the House and Senate failed to agree on a compromise. One difference was over how and when the Environmental Protection Agency should weigh the costs and benefits of its regulations. The House bill would have relaxed the standards for testing water and would have exempted smaller towns from some regulations. The Senate bill contained provisions that the House and environmental groups would not accept. The bill's death means that $1.3 billion in Federal aid to cities and states for water purification will not be available in the coming year.
 
BANKRUPTCY: The Senate approved the first comprehensive overhaul of the nation's bankruptcy laws in 16 years, setting rules that would make it easier for individuals to repay their debts on installment plans and harder for big corporate debtors to avoid their creditors. The House passed the same bill on Wednesday night, so the Senate vote sends the bill to President Clinton. Administration officials said he planned to sign it. The bill was welcomed by banks, savings and loans and other creditors. The new legislation imposes many time limits on various steps in the bankruptcy process to hasten the flow of cases through courts and prevent the dissipation of debtors' assets to legal fees.
 
CONGRESSIONAL EMPLOYEES: The House voted, 348 to 3, to apply Federal workplace laws, like those on discrimination and occupational safety, to itself. The Senate failed to act on a similar proposal.
 
DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS: The House passed a compromise bill that would limit but not forbid health claims on the labels and in the advertising of vitamins and supplements, which are taken by tens of millions of people daily. Early today, the Senate approved the bill as well. The legislation is a compromise that would require a strict standard of proof if the labels or advertisements made disease-prevention or cure claims, but would still permit claims about how vitamins and supplements might help promote good health.
 
OTHER MEASURES: Late Thursday and early yesterday, Congress approved and sent to the President the following legislation:
*A bill that would raise the threshold for the "nanny tax." Household employers, starting this tax year, would have to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on any worker earning at least $1,000 a year, up from $50 a quarter. Teen-aged baby sitters would be exempt.
*A bill that would give schools flexibility in how they meet new requirements to cut fat in school lunches, rather than forcing them to follow a nutrition analysis system mandated by the Agriculture Department.

HEADLINE: South Korea President Lashes Out at U.S.

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 7

 BODY:
After weeks of watching in silent frustration as the United States tries to negotiate a halt to North Korea's nuclear program, President Kim Young Sam of South Korea lashed out at the Clinton Administration today in an interview for what he characterized as a lack of knowledge and an overeagerness to compromise.
Mr. Kim said that he supported the Administration's efforts and that ties between Seoul and Washington were strong. But Mr. Kim directly attacked Washington's basic stance in the discussions with North Korea as naive and overly flexible. He said that the North Korean Government was on the verge of an economic and political crisis that could sweep it from power, and that Washington should therefore stiffen its position in pressing Pyongyang to abandon its suspected nuclear weapons program. 
 Diplomats and senior officials in the Administration have maintained that such pressure might drive North Korea's Communist Government into a corner and bring the two Koreas dangerously close to a war, not a deal. Those fears have grown in the past week, with the talks in Geneva reportedly at an impasse.
But Mr. Kim expressed deep doubts about whether the North Koreans could be trusted to live up to any agreements and whether the American negotiators understood that possibility.
"We should resolve the issue through dialogue," he said. "There is nothing wrong with that. The problem is we think we know North Korea better than anyone. We have spoken with North Korea more than 400 times. It didn't get us anywhere. They are not sincere." He added, "The important thing is that the United States should not be led on by the manipulations of North Korea."
In an hourlong interview, Mr. Kim was clearly unhappy that South Korea had been denied any position in the negotiations in Geneva and yet has been criticized for counseling toughness. This marks the latest turn in South Korea's policy toward the nuclear issue. Earlier this year, some South Korean officials were warning that the United States was taking too hard a line, but since the death of the North's longtime ruler, Kim Il Sung, Seoul is taking an increasingly tough position.
Mr. Kim explained that compromises might prolong the life of the North Korean Government and would send the wrong signal to its leaders. "We should not make more concessions in the future," he declared. "Time is on our side."
He painted a bleak picture of the economic situation in North Korea and questioned whether the negotiations could really achieve anything. More important, he placed his own views in stark contrast to those of the American delegation in Geneva, a rare occasion when discord received more emphasis than the common ground.
"If the United States wants to settle with a half-baked compromise and the media wants to describe it as a good agreement, they can," he said. "But I think it would bring more danger and peril."
Mr. Kim also expressed bitterness over the Administration's failure to raise the issue of human rights with Pyongyang, and its treatment of the Government as a suitable dialogue partner rather than a ruthless and deeply isolated dictatorship.
"Despite the fact that the United States is making an issue of human rights in Haiti and Cuba and China, it is not in North Korea, where the situation is worse," he said. "I can't really understand the logic."
In a separate interview, Lee Hong Koo, the Minister of National Unification, complained about the Administration and its lead negotiator in Geneva, Robert L. Gallucci, an Assistant Secretary of State.
Mr. Lee praised Mr. Gallucci for changing his views recently and becoming tougher, but he argued that the United States was weakening its position by relying not on Korea experts, but experts in nuclear nonproliferation.
He was also critical of Secretary of State Warren Christopher for not having visited South Korea or focused much publicly on the crisis on the Korean peninsula.
Perhaps the sharpest difference between the United States and South Korean Governments, evident in the interviews today, is their view on war, something Washington has sought to avoid at all costs.
"We don't want war," Mr. Lee said. "Nevertheless, the North Koreans must realize war doesn't mean the end of history, not for us anyway. But it does for their system."
The tough comments underscored the extremely sensitive position in which the United States finds itself after months of uncertain nuclear diplomacy. After the countries marched toward a confrontation earlier this year, former President Jimmy Carter went to Pyongyang in June and brokered a deal that led tothe current negotiations.
Kim Il Sung, North Korea's absolute ruler for the last four decades, died suddenly on July 8 after the agreement was reached, but the negotiations took place anyway. In August, a framework for a broader deal was hammered out. Washington agreed to provide modern light-water reactors for generating electricity if North Korea would abandon its existing nuclear facilities, which produce large amounts of weapon-grade plutonium.
The United States also insisted that North Korea agree to open its nuclear sites to international inspections, a means of certifying whether it had already extracted enough plutonium to build one or more bombs.
The deal quickly looked less promising when the North Koreans demanded an interim supply of electrical power, the right to choose the light-water reactor and a payment of some $2 billion in cash. They also rejected the idea of the inspections, bringing the talks to their latest impasse.

HEADLINE: Three Years After Gulf War, Sense of Siege Grips Kuwait

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times; The writer of this article left Kuwait before Iraq began moving troops toward the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border yesterday.

DATELINE: KUWAIT CITY, Oct. 5

 BODY:
With its gleaming high-rises, lavish shopping malls and well-groomed beltways, Kuwait looks as if it has lifted itself out of the destruction and morass of war. But the glitter and affluence mask a country that has lost faith in itself, lives in fear of a resurgent Iraq and sees a future darkened by forces beyond its control.
"There is a scramble to get another passport, to teach children other languages besides Arabic and to keep our money outside the country," a leading businessman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in Kuwait City this week. "There is a feeling that if Iraq to the north does not get us, the fundamentalists, backed by a growing movement in Saudi Arabia, will." 
 Three and a half years after the Persian Gulf war, the sense of insecurity was palpable on a recent visit to the country. It has driven many Kuwaitis into the arms of Islamic fundamentalists, who preach that the country has been punished for its moral laxity and loss of faith. It has also fueled a sense of hopelessness among other young Kuwaitis, who see no future in their country, look to the West and revel in American popular culture and habits.
"The war acted like a volcano," said Dr. Haya al-Mughni, a sociologist. "It spread out and exaggerated extremes that already existed within the society before occupation."
The United Nations sanctions against Iraq, still in place, have done little to change Baghdad's behavior.
Iraq refuses to acknowledge Kuwait's sovereignty, as demanded by the United Nations, and still refers to the emirate as the 19th province. The Kuwait-Iraq border, newly demarcated by the United Nations after the war, has not been recognized by Baghdad. And Iraqi officials deny all knowledge of some 600 missing Kuwaitis, many of whom were arrested by Iraqi security forces during Iraq's seven-month occupation of Kuwait.
Senior Iraqi officials warned the United Nations this week that they would "retaliate" if the Security Council, as expected, decides on Monday to maintain economic sanctions. Their meaning was unclear.
"There has been no change in the Iraqi stance toward Kuwait since the war," said Abbas Habib Mounar al-Mussein, chairman of the Kuwaiti Parliament's Defense and Interior Committee. "As long as Saddam Hussein is in power we are concerned."
Kuwait has budgeted $11 billion for arms over the next decade. The United States has large stockpiles of military equipment in the country and will soon have 100 military advisers training the Kuwaiti Army.
But many diplomats worry that equipment and training may not be enough to either hold off any invading forces for even a few days or restore public confidence.
"Without combat experience and the will to fight," said a Western diplomat who works with the military, "it will all fall apart. All we can do is equip and train. The rest is up to them."
The siege mentality is illustrated along the desert border with Iraq. A huge trench running the 120-mile length of the border separates the countries. The trench, which must be constantly maintained because of blowing sand, is 9 feet deep and 15 feet wide. It is topped on the Kuwaiti side with a 12-foot-high sand hill that is frequently sprayed with tar to show footprints. Kuwaiti police officers in trucks with tinted windows race back and forth on an asphalt road along the hill, watching for infiltrators.
"The Iraqis have tried to send over many assassination teams to carry out missions such as the one designed to murder President Bush during his visit last year," said an Interior Ministry official as he stood looking toward an Iraqi police post. "Nothing has changed."
But Iraq is only one of many troubles besetting Kuwait. The ruling al-Sabah family, discredited in the eyes of many Kuwaitis when some members fled the invading Iraqis, promised to liberalize the political system and the press. Parliament was revived in 1992 elections and political reforms were debated.
"It was the new democratic leadership that many hoped would be able to restore Kuwaitis' faith in the Government and self-confidence," a Western diplomat said, "but the ruling family has only been stalling for time."
Members of Parliament have mounted a fierce campaign to prosecute officials, many from the ruling family, suspected of skimming billions of dollars from the Government or losing it through mismanagement.
The press carries reports on official corruption and ineffective leadership that would be unthinkable in neighboring Saudi Arabia. But power remains in the hands of the ruling family, which failed to prepare the country's defenses. Parliament's inquiries into the behavior of senior officials have so far yielded little. And the political reforms, which would have given women the vote and allowed political parties to form, have sputtered out.
The most powerful political figure is Prime Minister Sheik Saad Abdullah al-Sabah, who is also the Crown Prince. The Prime Minister can only be appointed or removed by the Emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
"As long as the al-Sabah family is able to handle the public finances," said Mubarak al-Adwani, a political analyst, "it will keep tremendous power within its hands."
The frustration with the slow pace of reform has seen many Kuwaitis, and especially those under 21, who make up 60 percent of the population, give up on the political system. An increasing number embrace Islamic fundamentalists, who have the largest single bloc in Parliament. Mosques that were empty before the war are now overflowing during Friday prayers, and the movement has contacts with other militant groups in the region.
"The fundamentalists promise their followers that they are part of a movement that is destined by history to succeed," Dr. Mughni said.
In contrast, many young, Westernized Kuwaitis see their future in the United States and embrace American pop culture with gusto. One recent night dozens of young Kuwaitis, dressed as if for an audition on MTV, crammed into a luxury penthouse overlooking the coast. Rap music pulsated from a powerful stereo system that could be heard blocks away. Couples danced or threw back shot glasses of tequila, although alcohol is banned.
"Kuwait is like West Berlin during the cold war," shouted a young man, who did not want to be identified. "We know at any moment we could be finished off, so we drink and party until they come to get us."

The Economy
 
The nation's unemployment rate fell to a four-year low in September. But the report did not alarm financial markets because the job growth was not strong enough to force the Federal Reserve to move immediately on interest rates. [Page 39.] While job growth was seen in all regions of the country, the unemployment rate in New Jersey rose to 6.7 percent, from 6 percent. In New York State, the rate fell to 6.2 percent, from 6.9 percent. [47.]
An overhaul of the nation's bankruptcy laws was approved by the Senate. The measure would set new rules making it easier for individuals to repay their debts on installment plans and harder for big corporate debtors to avoid their creditors. [39.]
Recycling is becoming a big business as economic recovery and greater mill capacity increase demand for raw material. Old corrugated boxes, waste paper, plastics and steel cans have been finding new and lucrative markets. [1.]
The F.C.C. may let cable operators charge what they want for new channels or services as long as they do not dilute programming protected under current price restrictions. [39.]
 
International
 
U.S. executives remain wary about investing in South Africa, despite their applause for President Nelson Mandela earlier this week. Currency exchange controls, trade barriers and a militant labor force are seen as the chief obstacles. [39.]
 
Companies
 
Shares of Broderbund Software jumped after the company reported higher-than-expected earnings and a stock split . [39.]
The stocks of Kemper and Conseco tumbled after Conseco said it was changing the financing for its acquisition of Kemper. [41.]
A Tenneco subsidiary signed agreements to develop two natural-gas-fired power plants in central Chile. [41.]
Thirteen bidders for F.C.C. licenses defaulted. The licenses for interactive video services will be re-auctioned. [41.]
 
Markets
 
Stocks rallied. Buyers were encouraged by the employment report, which lessened expectations of an immediate increase in interest rates. The Nasdaq composite index rose 5.77 points. [40.]
Treasury prices rose after the Government reported a rise in payrolls that was below market expectations. [47.]
The dollar strengthened, rising above 100 Japanese yen. The dollar was bolstered by gains in stocks and bonds and by a report showing a reduction in Japan's trade surplus. [48.]
Crude oil prices jumped before falling back. Traders bet a move by Iraqi forces toward Kuwait would not lead to an invasion. [48.]
 
Your Money
 
Peter Lynch has kept his investment approach startingly simple. Mr. Lynch, who produced huge gains as manager of Fidelity's Magellan Fund before going into semiretirement four years ago, has made some changes in his own investment portfolio. Now, the renowned stock picker even buys bonds. [37.]
Olde Discount is offering trades without commissions. But there is a catch: the transactions must be in stocks recommended by analysts at the deep discount brokerage firm. [37.]
Citibank customers can buy and sell stocks on cash machines. Citibank, which began offering the service this week, is the first bank in the country to let customers make such trades. [37.]
B'nai B'rith is sending members an offering this month for a group of mutual funds created for them. [38.]

HEADLINE: Denver Celebrates Opening of Its Light Rail Transit System

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DENVER, Oct. 7

 BODY:
With no particular destination in mind, Helen Jackson got on board the train, stepped off 15 blocks later and got right in line for a train going the other way.
"I just came for the ride -- it's just so much fun," said Mrs. Jackson, a retired Government worker, adding with a conspiratorial whisper, "Of course, it helps that it's free." 
 The new light rail system opened in downtown Denver today, a city that has had its share of transportation woes with a still-delayed new airport. Today was given over to civic celebration, as the streets downtown were filled with bands, balloons and clowns, and anyone who cared to stand in line for the train could ride without charge.
Starting Monday, passengers will pay 50 cents or $1, depending on the time of day, to board a train that winds along a 5.3-mile route in downtown Denver and some nearby residential neighborhoods. The cars, powered by electricity, run on street-level tracks.
The $116 million project, financed with bonds, has been promoted as a test to determine whether sufficient demand exists here for a more elaborate light rail system, one that would reach into the suburbs.
Some skeptics of the new transit system say light rail is more aesthetic than practical, an expensive way to prettify the usual screech and grind of workaday downtown Denver.
But besides lending a dash of charm, the light rail system is intended to reduce bus and automobile traffic in Denver, a place that lives with a cover of smog, known here as "the brown cloud."
The system opens at a time when downtown Denver is enjoying a renaissance. The new ball park, Coors Field, which will be home for the Colorado Rockies, is near completion. Old warehouses are being converted to condominiums, and a host of new restaurants and taverns have opened in an area called Lower Downtown. And the venerable Tattered Cover bookstore is opening a new branch downtown.
The city's transit officials predict that 14,000 passengers will ride the trains daily, which will depart every five minutes during rush hour and every 10 minutes at other times.
Given the embarrassment with the troubled airport, light rail officials delighted in crowing a bit today, as the project opened on time and on budget.
Motorists and pedestrians were still getting adjusted to the trains. In the last few weeks, as the rail cars ran tests through the city, there have been nine crashes.
In one accident, a driver was injured when a rail car slammed into the passenger side of an automobile, then dragged it across Speer Boulevard and onto a sidewalk.
Transit officials have embarked on a campaign to remind people not to pull out in front of moving trains. The cars reach speeds of 55 miles an hour. Each rail car weighs about 40 tons, and a car going 25 miles an hour needs about 115 feet to stop.
"If you see one coming toward you," a transit district tip sheet warns, "get out of the way!"
Each rail car is equipped with surveillance cameras to deter graffiti and other crime, and wheelchair ramps are located at each stop.
The transit district plans an 8.7 mile extension that could be ready in 1999. Officials are exploring several other light rail corridors, including a possible link to the new Denver International Airport.
No advertising is allowed on the rail cars, inside or out. To speed the transit, passengers will not be able to buy tickets on board. Each station will be equipped with a ticket vending machine.
For today, most people were riding the trains simply for fun, with transportation as a secondary concern.
"I'm taking this as far south as it goes, and then coming right back," said Ray Stevens, a 36-year-old unemployed computer technician. "It sure beats taking the bus."

HEADLINE: Unemployment Falls to 5.9%, Lowest in 4 Years

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
The economy generated solid job growth in September as the unemployment rate fell to 5.9 percent, the lowest level in four years, the Labor Department reported today.
Hiring was substantial enough to swell payrolls by 239,000 and to indicate that the economy was expanding only a bit less briskly than during the unsustainably robust first half of the year. Payroll gains were revised upward for July and August. 
 Nonetheless, the strong employment report did not spook financial markets because the job growth was not vigorous enough, analysts said, to force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again immediately.
In its effort to slow growth and keep inflation in check, the Fed has raised its target for short-term interest rates five times this year. Inflation now is hovering around 3 percent annually.
In trading today, bond prices initially fell enough to push the interest rate on 30-year bonds up to 8 percent but a rally then began and the yield declined, ending at 7.90 percent, down from 7.95 percent on Thursday. Stock prices also rose. [Pages 40 and 47.]
Susan M. Phillips, a Fed governor, seemed to find little reason in today's report to change policy.
"It seemed to me to be about the same pace on average we've seen recently, so I didn't take much news out of it," she said, referring to the growth in payroll jobs.
The Clinton Administration welcomed the monthly job report, which is considered the most important single gauge of economic performance. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, called the report "additional evidence that the economy remains on a path of healthy expansion with modest inflation."
She expressed little concern that unemployment had dipped to a level that many economists consider low enough to cause accelerated pressure for higher wages. In August, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that that level would be 6 percent unemployment.
Ms. Tyson's own estimate is 5.9 percent to 6.3 percent, but she said in a briefing today that it would be silly to believe "the world has radically changed" at some precise rate regardless of other economic forces or circumstances.
Indeed, analysts have been particularly cautious in interpreting movements in the unemployment rate this year because a change in methodology that took effect in January has made it difficult to compare current rates with those of the past. Still, regarding today's number, the department said that a simulation using the old methodology produced the same rate, 5.9 percent, for September. The last time the rate was this low was in October 1990.
There was no doubt, however, that the job market continued to strengthen last month in all regions of the country. September also saw a decline in unemployment among black workers, to about the lowest rate since the mid-1970's.
Moreover, many more people in the thinning ranks of the unemployed had voluntarily left their last job, indicating confidence about finding a new one, while the number of people who lost their jobs or completed temporary ones fell sharply.
"The economy is still very much in full swing," said Alan M. Gayle, a Richmond-based analyst who currently heads the economic advisory committee of the American Bankers Association.
The department's survey of households, which is separate from the payroll survey that economists watch closely, showed a hefty gain of 462,000 jobs on top of August's 714,000 jump, reflecting what one official said seemed to be a catching up of this series after it had lagged behind earlier in the year. This growth was the main factor pushing the unemployment rate down in September.
The rate for adult men fell three-tenths of a point, to 5.1 percent, while the jobless rate for blacks tumbled eight-tenths of a point, to 10.7 percent, approaching the rate for Hispanic workers, which was unchanged last month at 10.2 percent.
Geographically, the West, where joblessness fell to 7 percent from 7.5 percent, showed the biggest such change, but unemployment also declined in the Northeast, to 6.2 percent from 6.4 percent; in the South, to 5.7 from 5.8, and in the Midwest, to 5 from 5.1 percent.
Among the largest industrial states for which figures were published today, the only change of clear statistical significance was in Florida, where the unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent from 5.6. The rate for New Jersey rose seven-tenths of a point, to 6.7 percent, while the rate for New York fell by that amount, to 6.2 percent.
The California unemployment rate dropped to 8.3 percent last month, compared with 8.9 percent in August. Still, it remains among the highest nationwide.
Job gains as posted by the payroll survey were once again dominated by business and social services, though construction jobs rebounded 19,000 after holding steady in August and government jobs spurted 65,000, mostly temporary election workers and additions to the staff of state universities.
Higher interest rates, however, contributed to further job declines in mortgage banking, and real estate jobs were flat, after a big gain in August.
Factories shed 3,000 jobs, a trivial loss but a suggestion of a slowdown from the substantial advance of 39,000 in August. The length of the factory workweek and factory overtime were both unchanged, though at historically high levels.
The job gain at temporary-help agencies was 28,000, but for the second consecutive month that rise was less than the monthly average during the previous 12 months, the department noted.
"The economy's still growing, but at a more sustainable 2.5 percent rate," said Ben K. Han, an economist at Corestates Financial in Philadelphia.
Average hourly earnings rose three-tenths of 1 percent, to $11.16, today's report showed, while average weekly earnings rose six-tenths of 1 percent, to $386.14. Neither of these seemed unsettling, analysts said.
The number of so-called discouraged workers -- people who say they want jobs but have given up looking because they think it is futile -- was 521,000 last month compared with 489,000 in August. Unlike most other figures in the report, this is not adjusted for recurring seasonal variations.

HEADLINE: Investors Wary, Despite Mandela

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

 BODY:
South Africa's President, Nelson Mandela, seemed to cast a spell over more than 800 business executives at a dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel early this week, winning repeated standing ovations. Yet his main goal -- attracting more American investment to South Africa -- may be harder than wowing the crowd.
Although a growing number of United States companies are tentatively entering South Africa, many executives who listened to Mr. Mandela's appeal for investment say caution is likely to outweigh their initial excitement when it comes to plunking down enough money to open a factory that creates jobs. 
 Currency exchange controls, trade barriers, and a militant labor force are considered hindrances. Perhaps Mr. Mandela's biggest obstacle is competition for foreign capital from vibrant emerging markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America.
"The world is not breathless to invest anywhere," said Anthony J. F. O'Reilly, chief executive of the H. J. Heinz Company, who was host at a breakfast for Mr. Mandela and 30 executives on Tuesday in New York. "There are no magic wands around. South Africa is going to have to fight to make its case."
As a place to invest, South Africa is a hybrid: a first-world financial system with antiquated habits from years of isolation, paired with a population of almost 40 million, many of whom live in third-world conditions. As one economist said, South Africa's economy -- at about $100 billion -- is roughly the size of Maryland's.
In several meetings with executives this week, Mr. Mandela spoke knowledgeably about bringing down inflation, lifting currency controls and abandoning the idea of nationalizing industry -- a major plank in the African National Congress charter until 1991. All that was reassuring to his American listeners.
"There is no longer any basis for reticence," he said at the Waldorf. "South Africans have demonstrated with distinction their ability to manage political and economic change."
By last month, 169 United States companies had employees or direct investment in South Africa, up from 119 only a year ago but shy of the nearly 300 that were there in 1984, according to the Investor Responsibility Research Center.
For each company that is investing, several more are asking questions and visiting South Africa, said Daniel O'Flaherty, executive director of the United States-South Africa Business Council.
Yet executives at large American companies, from Xerox to Eastman Kodak, all in the process of expanding in South Africa, are tentative about making significant investments. Many voice interest in ventures that require only a small down payment, like selling or distributing an American product, rather than manufacturing it there.
"A token investment will be profitable," said Brian C. Henderson, senior vice president of Merrill Lynch & Company, one of several securities firms advising clients, but yet to open an office itself. "But the sizable investment will not really happen until the dual currency system and other problems are solved."
South Africa uses one exchange rate for ordinary commercial transactions and another for foreign financial investments. Many foreign businessmen are uncomfortable with this complex dual system. So far, though, fear of capital flight has deterred the Government from eliminating it.
Political stability is another unavoidable concern, even if the outlook is far brighter than a year ago or five years ago. Mr. Mandela is 76, and although business executives are encouraged by his choice of deputies, the potential for political unrest remains.
If many South Africans expected a quick embrace by American businesses in the euphoria that followed Mr. Mandela's remarkable political transition last spring, others point out that investment does not come in a day or a week or a month. It usually follows trade, sales and small experiments that grow.
"Anybody who expected the floodgates to open was not in touch with reality," said Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, who took a group of senior executives to South Africa last November and set up a business development committee to encourage investment and trade.
"I'm a real optimist about South Africa's future," Mr. Brown said, ticking off the nation's advantages to potential investors. "There's a commitment to a free market, good infrastructure, a stock market and a functioning economy."
Black American executives may be among those who move into the South African market most swiftly.
Chris Morris, president of an investment firm called the Savant Group of Santa Monica, Calif., helped arrange a $20 million partnership of a dozen black American investors with Pepsi-Cola for a bottling plant in South Africa run by black South Africans.
"We believe that the hesitation of others may be an advantage for us," said Mr. Morris, who wants to aim Pepsi sales in South Africa at the township population that has been under-served. "Whoever figures out how to effectively tap into that sector of the market is going to have a great opportunity."
Black South African consumers are likely to respond better to products sold by companies that are owned and run by blacks, Mr. Morris predicts. Echoing an idea voiced by many executives, Mr. Morris said he hoped Pepsi's operations in South Africa would also be used for business in neighboring countries.
"If you're going to make a play in the African continent, this is the place," he said.
Mr. O'Reilly of Heinz, who earlier this year bought a controlling stake in a newspaper group that owns The Star of Johannesburg, is optimistic about South Africa's prospects. Heinz is negotiating with local producers and is expected to begin producing food products next year.
"It won't be easy, and it won't be cheap, but we're determined to do it," Mr. O'Reilly said. "There is long-term opportunity and we want to be there."
Asked about the role of Mr. Mandela's visit in encouraging investment, Mr. O'Reilly said it would bring investors to the table.
"It's a Gandhi-like experience," he said of meeting the South African leader. "People will take a look at South Africa with a special commitment because of Mandela."
Ruth Harkin, president of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which this week announced programs of loan guarantees and other incentives aimed at producing corporate investment in South Africa, said about a dozen executives approached her after Mr. Mandela's speech at the Waldorf. "He spoke to them in their language, in their tone," she said. "Mandela touched them with his directness, his genuineness. I think they're going to be very responsive."
Not everyone was as optimistic. "No company will make an investment based on their enthusiasm for Nelson Mandela," said Mr. O'Flaherty of the business council. "I don't think sentiment is going to drive investment in South Africa."

HEADLINE: CONGRESS WINDS DOWN;
Excerpts From Clinton's News Conference on His Programs

BYLINE: Special to The New York TimesReuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Following are President Clinton's opening statement and excerpts from his news conference at the White House today, as transcribed by the Federal Information Systems Corporation, a private transcription service:
Ladies and gentlemen, 20 months ago I came here to make a start to make America work for ordinary citizens again, to take on some tough issues too long ignored, to get our economic house in order. There have been some tough fights along the way, but I believe they were the right fights for our future.
We came here with an economic strategy that was comprehensive and direct: reduce the deficit, expand trade, increase investment in people and technology and reinvent the Government to do more with less. We pursued this strategy with discipline. Now we have fresh evidence that the national economic program we put into place last year is beginning to work for America. 
 The Department of Labor reported today that the unemployment rate fell to 5.9 percent, a four-year low, and the economy has created about 4.6 million jobs since I took office. More jobs in high-wage industries were created this year alone than in the previous five years combined. It's not enough, of course.
As the Census report makes clear, there are still too many Americans working for low wages, living in poverty. There are places in rural and urban America where the recovery has not yet reached. But since, if you look at the changes since just a few short years ago, when we were exporting jobs and exploding the deficit, there's a great difference. We are getting our economic house in order, jobs are being created at home, we are moving in the right direction.
This Congress, as it concludes a difficult session, showed that it could make a difference for ordinary people when it put people and progress ahead of narrow interests and partisan obstruction. It didn't always happen, so let's begin with a look at the record, what's been done, what hasn't been done, where do we go from here? Let's begin with what was accomplished.
The economic plan passed, putting our house in order. It was historic deficit reduction, led by cutting over $255 billion in spending, cuts in 300 separate Government programs, raising taxes or tax rates on only the top 1.2 percent, cutting taxes for 15 million working families with 50 million Americans in them -- people who work full time but still hover just at the poverty line -- so that people will always be encouraged to choose work over welfare and won't have to raise their children in poverty if they do.
We've broken down trade barriers, eliminated barriers to exports, passed Nafta. Exports to Mexico are up 19 percent; exports of cars and trucks up 600 percent in the last year.
They talked for more than a decade around here about making government smaller, but it never seemed to happen. Well, now it is. Under our legislation, we're shrinking Federal positions and cutting the Federal work force by 272,000, to its smallest size since the Kennedy Administration. And now again I say, private sector jobs are going up; the deficit is going down.
For the first time in a generation, we've taken a serious assault on crime, passing the Brady bill and the crime bill with its 100,000 prison cells, its 20 percent increase in police on the beat, its ban on assault weapons, its "three strikes and you're out" and other penalty laws.
The Government is beginning to work for ordinary citizens in important ways. That's what the family leave law was about. That's what the law which will provide immunizations for all children under 2 by 1996 is about. That's what Head Start for 200,000 more kids is about. That's what the National Standards of Educational Excellence, with more local control, apprenticeships for kids who don't go to college, national service so people can earn money for college and serve their communities, and making college loans more affordable for 20 million people who can now have lower interest rates, lower fees, longer repayment schedules.
It's what the empowerment zones and the community development banks to bring free enterprise to poor communities are about.
All of this was real progress. It's only a beginning, and more could have been done, but too many times an idea for creating jobs, reforming government, educating students or expanding income, fighting crime or cleaning up the environment or reforming the political system was met by someone trying to stop it, slow it, kill it or just talk it to death.
A lot of the same people just recently signed that so-called Contract with America, a commitment to taking us back to the Reagan-Bush years, when we exploded the deficit, cut Medicare, cut taxes for the wealthiest in America, divided our citizens and sent our jobs overseas.
My contract with the American people is for the future. Grow the economy, fight crime, take on the tough problems, make government work for ordinary people. Congress is leaving town without passing GATT, the world's largest trade agreement. It will cut global tariffs, and over the next decade that means a $744 billion tax cut. It will generate hundreds of thousands of new jobs for American workers. It will keep our recovery going and sustain growth all around the world. We must not retreat on GATT. That's why I've asked Congress to return and pass it after the election, and I believe they will do that.
But Congress had a chance to do a lot of other things which it should have done but didn't do. It should have passed significant environmental legislation, much of which has the support of both American people and industry and environmental groups. It should have passed health care reform instead of watching another million Americans lose their coverage, as the new data points out happened just last year, while costs increase faster than inflation and more citizens lose the right to choose their doctor.
And it certainly should have passed political reform. I think the American people were appalled by the spectacle of lobbyists hiding who they work for, what they get paid, and by members of Congress accepting their gifts and then walking away from lobbying reform. There's something wrong when a senator can filibuster this bill and walk off the floor of the Senate, and be cheered by lobbyists. Well, the Congress is the people's Congress. The lobbyists may have been cheering in the filibuster last night, but the American people were not.
So Congress has done well on the economy, on crime, on tax fairness, on education and training, on trade, on loans for the middle class, on family leave, on reinventing government. Congress has not done well on political reform, on environmental legislation, on health care and on an unprecedented record of using the filibuster and other delaying tactics to try to keep anything from being done. We have to now resolve to give the American people a choice as Congress leaves town and we move into the next few weeks before this election. Do they really want this contract, which is a trillion dollars of unfunded promises, a contract which certainly will lead to higher deficits, cuts in medicare and throwing us back to the years of the 80's when we lost jobs and weakened our country? Or do we want to face up to the challenges which were not met in this Congress, and use the next Congress to keep the economic growth going, to pass health care reform, to pass welfare reform, to pass political reform to deal with these environmental issues?
You know countries all over the world want America to succeed and want to follow our lead. We saw it just in the last few days, when the elected democratic presidents of South Africa and Russia were here working with us on their common futures and their aspirations. We see it in the help we've been asked to give to the peace process in Northern Ireland. We see it in the help we've been asked to give to the peace process in the Middle East. We see it in the enthusiastic reception our young men and women in uniform have been given by the people of Haiti who want their democracy back.
I am proud of the work America has done around the world in the cause of democracy. I am proud of what our troops have done in the last three weeks in Haiti. As I said, and I caution you again, their job is still difficult and dangerous, and we still have a lot of work to do, but the violence is down, the Parliament is back, the refugees are returning, the electricity is burning again, and democracy is coming back. This is the direction we ought to be taking at home as well as abroad, fighting for the future, not going back to the past.
 
His Political Standing
 Q. Mr. President, while acknowledging your accomplishments, the Republicans are savoring a big-time victory in November. You also have had some major setbacks in legislation, and some of the pundits are counting you out in '96. How do you account for this very dark picture, political picture, and what are you going to do about it?
A. Well, what I'm going to do is go out and make sure the American people understand what the choice is. If the American people had been told 20 months ago that we would have had a historic first year with the Congress, that we'd have 4.6 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment rate in four years, an unusual number of high-wage jobs coming back into the economy, a serious assault on crime, that I would have presented major reform legislation in all the areas that I have mentioned, plus the welfare reform bill that I sent to Congress and that I expect to pass next year, to end welfare as we know it, I think they would have been well pleased.
And I think when they see what has been done, that we are going in the right direction, and then they see the alternative, the clear alternative -- partisan gridlock by the Republican Congressional leadership.
I know you may say, "Well, some Democrats didn't vote with you, Mr. President, on campaign finance reform and lobby reform," and you would be right. But look at the record. Most Democrats on these filibuster votes voted for campaign finance reform, most Republicans voted against it. Most Democrats voted for political reform, most Republicans voted against lobby reform.
So the American people have to make a choice first about what direction they want. Do they really want this Republican Contract on America? Do they really want somebody to just tell them what they want to hear one more time, instead of someone who will take on the tough problems? Do they really want someone to make a trillion dollars in promises that means higher deficits, cuts in Medicare, the crime bill won't be funded, the economy will be back in the dumps? I don't believe they do want that. They haven't had much of a chance to see the big picture here; they just follow the daily march of events.
In the end, this is a decision for the people to make in '94 and in '96. When I showed up here I knew that there was always a great deal of enthusiasm for change in the beginning, but the process of change is difficult, exacting, it requires discipline and confidence, and you have to stay at it, and there are always dark times. There has never been a time when the organized forces of the status quo haven't been able to drive down the popularity of a President who really fought for change. I am not worried about that. I am not at issue here. The real issue is what is the future the American people wish for themselves? And I am looking forward to having a chance to go out and say what I think the direction should be, and then let the people make their decision.
 
Massing of Iraqi Troops
 Q. Mr. President, what can you tell us about the mobilization of Iraqi troops on the border with Kuwait? Do you think it's just bluster? Or do you think it's a real menace, and what is the United States prepared to do?
A. Well, first let me say that we are watching it very closely, and we are watching the troop movements as well as the threats that the Iraqis have made to the U.N. mission there. I spoke with General Shalikashvili just before I came over here today. We are taking the necessary steps as a precaution to deal with this issue. I don't believe I should discuss them in any greater detail, but let me say I think they are appropriate and necessary, and we are fully in agreement on the course we are taking.
Iraq should not be able to intimidate the United Nations Security Council and the U.N. Mission there. They should not be misled into thinking that they can repeat the mistakes of the past. If Iraq really is trying to say, in some insistent way, that what they want is relief from the U.N. sanctions, there is a clear way for them to achieve that relief. Simply comply with the United Nations resolutions. . . .
 
Responding to Aggression
 Q. Over the past 20 months, Mr. President, some people would say you made very strong threats against the Bosnian aggressors, that you have warned North Korea not to build even one nuclear bomb. Yet now there's acknowledgement that they at least have one, if not more. There have been threats against aggressors in Haiti and compromise, leaving the option for the leaders to stay there. To what extent would you say that it is fair criticism that Saddam Hussein might be testing you, because this country has not been strong enough in responding to aggression and to aggressive threats.
A. Well, first of all, I think if he were testing me based on the facts that you outlined, he would have a very gross misapprehension of the facts. When I ran for President, and when I became President, I never said that the United States would take any unilateral action in Bosnia, and I defy you to find a time when I did say that. I said that we would work with our allies. . . .
Secondly, with regard to Korea, I think that our actions in Korea and our policies to date have been appropriate, they have been firm, they have been deliberate. The implication of your remark was that they had a bomb-making operation going on during this Administration. The evidence that has been cited in some press reports is quite different. It is that before I became President, they may have accumulated enough nuclear material to make a nuclear device or two. That has been the press reports. I fail to see how that shows a lack of resolve on our part since we have been here. I think we have pursued this course quite firmly. We were pushing the sanctions option if there was not a return to serious negotiations. There has been, and I hope those negotiations will succeed.
In the case of Haiti, I think it is absolutely apparent to everybody that it was the literal imminence of the military invasion which is leading to a peaceful transfer of authority there. We have, after all, 19,000-plus troops in Haiti. . . .
So if those are the examples, I would think that Saddam Hussein would draw exactly the reverse conclusion than the one that you outlined.
Secondly, I would remind you that when we had clear evidence that the Iraqis were involved in an attempt to kill former President Bush, United States took decisive and appropriate action.
 
Health Care Legislation
 Q. We hadn't really had a chance to hear from you since last week. Senator Mitchell declared that there just could be not resolution of the health care issue. I wonder if you could give us a sense of how you're regrouping on health care, if you are, and whether or not you now think that you made a mistake by proposing such broad changes and whether you're now willing to accept something more incremental in the next Congress?
A. Well, I haven't had a lot of chance to think about exactly where we should go with this except to say that no sooner had Senator Mitchell issued his statement than the press reports were full of, "Oh, my goodness, we have all these problems." A million-point-two Americans, 1.2 million Americans, lost their health insurance last year, 1993; the cost is still going up at twice the rate of inflation; people are still losing their choice of doctors. So this problem will not go away. I am very proud of the fact that we did get as much broad-based support as we did for comprehensive reform, that the basic elements of this reform were supported for the first time in history, I might add, by a heavy majority of medical providers -- doctors and nurses and others; that for the first time in history we got a bill to the floor of both houses of Congress. . . .
We worked on it for a year and a half. Since I have been here, we have broken gridlock and passed family leave after seven years, motor-voter after five years, the Brady bill after seven years, the crime bill after six years, the banking reform bill after seven years. Those are just five examples of how long fundamental reform took in areas that were more limited and less comprehensive. I think we can do health care. We must do health care in less time than that, but if it takes one more year, I'm not discouraged by that.
Q. Could you accept the incremental----
A. I think in the end we will have to do---- we'll have to address this comprehensively. I think the principles I outlined have to be addressed by the country or we'll never solve the deficit or deal with the problems in the private sector. And I have not had any chance to think about how to approach the Congress with that. I will, but I -- no one came forward with a convincing case that we could control costs, for example, which is imperative, without having a mechanism to cover everybody. But there may be some other way to do it. I have always been open to any kind of new idea.
 
The Coming Election
1
 Q. Mr. President, going back to the upcoming campaign, as you yourself joked, I guess, at a reception earlier today, warm welcomes are increasingly rare. How do analyze your own low approval ratings? And what's your advice and reaction to members of your own party who are running away from the Administration's very record?
A. Well, the record is a good one, and there is ample evidence that if people know the record, they respond to it. . . .
My only concern is that the American people not go out and vote against what they are for and vote for what they are against. I think the American people wanted us to bring this deficit down. I think the American people wanted us to invest more in the education and training of the work force. I think the American people wanted us to make college more affordable for middle class people. I think the American people wanted us to pass the crime bill. I think the American people wanted us to pass campaign finance reform and lobby reform, that's what I think they wanted. . . .
 
Economic Performance
 Q. Mr. President, to go back to domestic matters for a moment, you mentioned looking at the record. I want to ask you about one part of the record that does not look so good. The Census Bureau reported that through the first year of your term, through the end of 1993, median income has gone down; the rich have continued to get richer; the poor have continued to get poorer; income inequality has grown, precisely the trends that you singled out as the reasons you were opposed to what happened in the 80's. Do you believe that you can reverse these trends in the next two years of your term? And if you cannot, how do you think you'll be able to convince the American people that your Presidency has been a success?
A. Well, first of all, let me -- let's put this in context, and that was a fair question, I think properly asked. These trends have been developing for nearly 20 years, as you pointed out. I don't think anyone thought I could turn them around in a year, or that I alone could turn them around. And let me try to be clear about where I think responsibility lies here, because if not---- I don't think it's fair to just say that the previous Administration is completely responsible for these trends. I think their policies aggravated them to some extent, but more importantly did not address them, which I think is the most important thing.
What is happening in America that would lead incomes to go down or be stagnant among people who actually work full-time? And how could it continue even in a period of economic expansion? Indeed, how could it have continued through expansions for 20 years? That is the question. The answer, it seems to me, is to be found in the following facts. No. 1, for about 30 years we have had a problem developing primarily in our urban areas and our very rural areas where there was disinvestment of economic opportunity coupled with the breakdown of traditional family structures and community structures, so that you had a lot of people growing up and living in places where the only jobs available were low-wage jobs or where there were relatively -- there were too few good jobs. No. 2 -- that's been going on for about 30 years -- No. 2, compounding that, for about 20 years American jobs overall, certainly hourly wage jobs, have been set more and more and more in the context of a global economy, so that to whatever extent a person has a job in America that can also be done by somebody somewhere else living on a much, much lower wage, that person will be under great pressure either to lose the job or to have the wage lowered at least never to get a wage increase.
What is the answer to the problem and how might it be fixed? I think there are three answers and we're are pursuing all of them as best we can. First, increase the level of education and training of the work force and make it more permanent for a lifetime. That's why we had that apprenticeship program; that's why we have the college loan program; that's why I'm trying to pass the re-employment system legislation that I introduced this year, but I think it will pass next year. In other words, develop a system to raise the skill level of the work force and the wages will rise.
Secondly, follow policies that will change the job mix in America that will tend to get more high-wage jobs here. That's why I believe so strongly in expanding trade. In the United States, when we expand trade, it drives the wages up, up.
The third thing we have to do is to bring free enterprise to the inner cities and the isolated rural areas. That's what the empowerment zones are about; that's what those community development banks to low-income people are about. Will that all change the income distribution in two years or three years? I don't know. I know we have been going in this direction for 20 years, and we can certainly change it back the other way in less than 20 years, but again I will say we have to stay on this course. . . .
 
Cisneros's Troubles
 Q. Did you know when you nominated Secretary Cisneros, that he was making payments to a former mistress? If you did, did you ask any questions about them? And finally, do you think that the recent controversy about them undermines his effectiveness in your Cabinet?
A. We know what the facts were at the time, and the legal counsel or, excuse me, people who were handling that for me, reviewed it, decided that there was nothing illegal or inappropriate about what was done by Secretary Cisneros, something that was fully known by his family. And no, I don't think it undermines his effectiveness. I mean, what he did in his past that he's dealt with, and he's been pretty forthright -- he's been, in fact, I think, painfully forthright -- and I think he has been an extraordinarily gifted HUD secretary. . . .
 
Middle-Class Tax Cut
 Q. Mr. President, you promised the middle class a tax cut two years ago during the campaign. Will you be able to keep that promise in the next two years?
A. I can't give you an answer today, because it depends upon how well the economy goes and what other considerations there are with the budget. And let me just give you an example of that. In this budget, because we began with a deficit that was bigger than we expected, the middle-class tax cut essentially was capped at 15 million families comprising about 50 million Americans or only about 20 percent of our population. Would I like to do better than that? Yes, I would, but not at the expense of the economic recovery for the same middle class. . . .

HEADLINE: Installment Credit Jumps

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Consumers used their credit cards freely in August, running up installment debts at the strongest pace since May, the Federal Reserve said today.
Total consumer installment debt jumped a seasonally adjusted $11.20 billion, at a 15.7 percent annual rate, up from July's revised $7.70 billion increase when debts were expanding at a rate of 11 percent a year. It was the biggest monthly gain since May, when consumer credit rose $11.46 billion. 
 Consumer credit has grown at a hefty pace over the last year, tracking the pickup in demand for durable manufactured goods, especially new cars and trucks.
But analysts say the rise in consumer spending from the growth in credit use is probably nearly past. Notably in August, the biggest single increase was in credit-card credit, which shot up by $6.88 billion, at a 26 percent annual rate. That compared with July's rise of $4.51 billion, at a 17 percent annual rate.
Auto loans grew by $2.97 billion, at an 11.7 percent annual rate, in August, down from a July increase of $3.73 billion, when they were rising at a 14.8 percent rate.

HEADLINE: Labor Report For Region Is Mixed

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in New York State fell to 6.2 percent in September, a low for the year, from 6.9 percent in August, according to Federal data released yesterday. But in New Jersey, where the rate had fallen to a 1994 low of 6 percent in August, there was an increase, to 6.7 percent, in September.
In New York City, the unemployment rate sank to 7.2 percent in September, a sharp decline from 8.5 percent in August. The improvement occurred in part because many summer job seekers, including large numbers of students, returned to class and removed themselves from the job market in September. 
 The Federal Government adjusts its state employment data to take account of such seasonal shifts, but New York City data are reported without the adjustment.
Connecticut is not on the list of states covered in the initial release of jobs data each month.
Yesterday's batch of data included the national unemployment rate, which fell to 5.9 percent, from 6.1 percent in August.
Although the rates in the New York area remained higher than the national figure, they were still seen as reflecting a continued slow recovery for the region's economy.
"The New York labor market continues on track," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York State has gained 90,000 jobs in the last year, he said, with new jobs spread across a range of businesses, including retailing, construction and finance.
Despite the rise in its unemployment rate in September, New Jersey also shows signs of improvement, he said. The decline in the state's manufacturing employment, which eliminated more than 10,000 jobs during each year of the last 10 years, has slowed markedly this year, largely because of hiring by the pharmaceutical industry.
Mr. Ehrenhalt said New Jersey pharmaceutical makers had increased their employment by 12 percent this year, to 50,000. Over all, manufacturing employment in New Jersey has fallen by 4,000 jobs in the last 12 months, he said.
"I don't see the New Jersey numbers for September as a deterioration," he said. "The state is in a marking-time mode, and hopefully the upturn will resume."

HEADLINE: A Business Gathering Focuses on Crime

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va., Oct. 7

 BODY:
Usually, the annual meeting of the Business Council, a gathering of nearly 300 current and past heads of the country's largest corporations, is devoted to hearing reports on the economy and playing spirited rounds of golf. But this year, amid talk of handicaps and the direction of interest rates, another subject is being highlighted: crime and violence.
"I think most of us feel that violence and crime is a real issue for the country, if not the No. 1 issue," said D. Wayne Calloway, chairman and chief executive of Pepsico, who organized this year's meeting. "This is an attempt to get some understanding and for all of us to get some common basis to talk about the issue." 
 That a group of corporate chieftains should choose crime as the main subject of its meeting is another indication of the high level of anxiety about crime that Americans have, even while the rates of violent crimes have remained stagnant or declined in recent years. And crimes against businesses, with the exception of shoplifting and bank robbery, did not increase significantly between 1980 and 1992, the last year for which the Federal Bureau of Investigation has figures.
The group, gathered here near the popular evocation of 18th-century Colonial America, heard presentations on the causes and trends in crime from Alfred Blumstein, professor of operations research at Carnegie Mellon University, and on law enforcement issues from William J. Bratton, New York City's Police Commissioner. The group also heard a discussion of prevention versus punishment by John DiIulio Jr., a professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton University, and Hugh B. Price, president of the National Urban League.
Unlike the Business Roundtable or the National Association of Manufacturers, which adopt positions on economic and social issues, the Business Council does not take stands on specific issues or legislation. Organizers of the conference said the focus on crime was intended to educate business executives on the trends, causes and possible solutions to the problem.
"This is not a lobbying or policy making group," Mr. Calloway said at a news conference on Thursday night. "This is an attempt for us to communicate with the Government and the Government to communicate to us about concerns of the country and about how we might work together."
For some chief executives, violent crime is becoming a more important issue as Government officials and community groups urge them to stay in the inner cities and put factories, warehouses and stores in poor neighborhoods.
"Business is constantly being encouraged to go into areas where there is high unemployment, and there is some willingness to do that," said Rand V. Araskog, chairman and chief executive of the ITT Corporation. "But walking into a nest of crime makes it difficult."
Several executives interviewed said they were unsure what role they might be able to play in reducing either the public's fear of crime or crime itself. Given the executives' admitted lack of knowledge, some speakers said they hoped to be able to enlist the executives' support for policy initiatives the speakers favor.
For example, Mr. Blumstein argued for a new strategy on drugs, asserting that the use of tough prison sentences for low-level narcotics dealers has merely meant that adult pushers are being replaced by younger dealers who are more likely to be violent. In an interview before the conference, Mr. Blumstein said he was not calling for the legalization of drugs, but for more emphasis on drug treatment.
"My sense is the Business Council is a group who are hard-nosed pragmatists who might represent an opportunity to do some hard-nosed rethinking of a policy that seems not to have had much effect on drug abuse or drug transactions," he said.
Mr. Price, the National Urban League president, said he would encourage the executives to finance training programs in inner cities and to hire qualified applicants who complete them.
"I don't think you can simply proclaim that we can simply stop the violence," Mr. Price said before his talk with the Business Council. "We have to show kids there are legitimate ways to make a living, and we also have to make a commitment to hire them so that kids see there is another path for them."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: QUEENS VOTERS;
Voters Give Cuomo a Struggle on His Home Turf

SERIES: Campaign Stop: Queens -- A periodic report on reaction to the New York gubernatorial race.

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Whenever Gov. Mario M. Cuomo talks about the old neighborhood -- and he does so at almost every campaign stop -- he invariably conjures up a Queens of old-world skeptics, a cranky borough with a reflexive immigrant suspicion of anyone who tries to push things too far.
"Do you know what they'd say to that back in the old neighborhood?" he'll say, deriding the latest Republican campaign proposal. Or at a roadside news conference last week, referring to his opponent's tax-cut plan, "In the old neighborhood in Queens, there's an expression that went something like this: Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me." 
 The Governor had no trouble persuading his borough to send him to Albany once, twice, even three times. But as he requests a fourth term, he is finding that his homely expression about trust and doubt carries a double meaning, for there is no longer much enthusiasm for Mario Cuomo in Queens.
He will probably win the borough again next month, both professional and amateur analysts predict. But he may do so by default, and with a far more slender margin than he has previously enjoyed. Asked why they plan to vote for him, many of his likely supporters said in interviews that they simply couldn't vote for his opponent, State Senator George E. Pataki.
"Cuomo," said June Zuckerman, a Forest Hills homemaker, when asked her preference while sipping coffee last week in Andre's Cafe on 70th Road. "But you know why I'm going to vote for him? Out of force of habit, that's why."
Many Queens residents are unable to define precisely what they want in a governor that Mr. Cuomo isn't giving them. They mention a few touchstone disagreements -- the death penalty, government spending -- but mostly, after 12 years, they seem to have lost touch with a gifted but distant man they believed they once knew.
"Pataki's from upstate," ," said Peter Bournias of Astoria, who was unloading a truck at the Metro Mall in Middle Village. "He doesn't know what goes on in a place like this. But Cuomo's been upstate so long that he's probably forgotten."
The Rev. Roderick R. Caesar, pastor of the 1,500-member Bethel Gospel Tabernacle in Jamaica, said his congregants continue to search for a political leader who can make the kind of broad, sweeping changes in the system necessary to redeem their community. They have not found that leader in Mr. Cuomo, he said, but at least they know he won't change their lives for the worse.
"Of course people want change, but if you're going to make change first you have to know the community," said Mr. Caesar, whose neighborhood is one of the poorest in Queens. "Pataki is a complete unknown here. At least the Governor knows who we are."
Mr. Cuomo may know his way around the borough, but Queens has never been terribly impressed by the fact that he is its native son. Though he has done well in the borough, polling between 61 percent and 71 percent in his first three elections, he has always been more popular in Manhattan and in Brooklyn, winning substantially larger margins there each time out. Middle-class, with a large number of owner-occupied homes and driveways, Queens is more conservative than the city as a whole, and more likely to disagree with elements of Mr. Cuomo's philosophy.
In neighborhoods that are mostly white, like Bayside and Maspeth, many residents have always voted against Mr. Cuomo and are even more fiercely determined to do so this time. In Richmond Hill, one of the few neighborhoods in the city where Mr. Cuomo lost in 1982, Mr. Pataki has built a miniature power base among people who have never seen him and have little idea who he is.
Dennis Coyle, who works in a plumbing supply store on Jamaica Avenue in Richmond Hill and has never voted for Mr. Cuomo, couldn't say what Mr. Pataki's background is, where he lives or what jobs in government he has had. But Mr. Coyle can't wait to vote for the Republican.
"I don't know anything about Pataki except two things: he's for the death penalty and lower taxes," Mr. Coyle said. "That's all I need to know. And he's not Cuomo."
The hard-line anybody-but-Cuomo vote seems to be an exception in Queens. Its residents may be more suburban in orientation than those in Manhattan or Brooklyn, but they are city dwellers, and they share the urban distrust of anyone from upstate who tries to push the city around. When it comes time to enter the voting booth, many believe that Queens residents will once again perform a familiar act, if only by rote.
But even the Democratic political leaders who are supposed to be mustering the troops for the governor sound uncertain in their predictions of ultimate victory. Representative Thomas J. Manton, the county Democratic leader, said the battle was entirely uphill.
"It's a tough time for Mario in Queens," Mr. Manton said. "There's a lot more of an anti-Cuomo vote out there than there was in the past, and we'll have to find a way to deal with that. I think we'll win, but it won't be a cakewalk."
Walter L. McCaffrey, a City Councilman and district leader from Woodside, said he had developed a little strategy for convincing the unconvinced, one that provides an insight into the magnitude of the borough's skepticism.
"Everybody has some gripes with the Governor," Mr. McCaffrey said. "I disagree with him on the death penalty and a few other things. But what I tell them is, O.K., you agree with Pataki on a few things. But you agree with the Governor on 200 other things. It's O.K. to be mad at the Governor, but you have to look at the whole balance of things versus what Pataki's career has been. When you start to put it like that, to get them to step back, then they start to come around."
Queens, of course, is one of only two boroughs that gave a majority vote to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in last year's election (the other was Staten Island). The borough as a whole gave the Mayor a 61 percent majority, but his vote was actually much higher in almost all sections of Queens except the black neighborhoods of southeast Queens and the Hispanic neighborhood of Corona, which supported David N. Dinkins. The magnitude of the vote has lent hope to Republicans that similar support may well up next month.
But much of the vote against Mr. Dinkins, as Mr. Manton noted, was racially motivated, and cannot be as easily directed against the Governor. And Mr. Giuliani, who has engaged in a highly public attempt to put distance between himself and Mr. Pataki, has not exactly sent strong signals of support for his fellow Republican to his followers in Queens. The vote next month, then, is less likely to be along party lines -- which seem to be of diminishing importance to the borough -- and more likely to based on fairly narrow, pragmatic considerations.
Korean-Americans, for example, remain as ambivalent as the rest of Queens in the gubernatorial race, waiting for the candidates to address their major issues. Most of the Koreans in New York live in Queens, and those who voted last year did so overwhelmingly against Mr. Dinkins because of their perception that he supported a boycott of Korean-owned stores by black customers. Sung Soo Kim, director of the Korean-American Small Business Service Center in Flushing, said that because about three-fourths of Korean-Americans here depend on such stores for their income, they will cast their vote for whichever candidate seems more favorable to small businesses.
"We have our interests just like every other group does," Mr. Kim said. "What do they think about these megastores that drive us out of business? Will they encourage industrial development or more big Pathmarks? This is what we will vote on."
At the moment, Mr. Kim suspects the Governor has the edge, because many store owners like a small-business position paper he put out earlier this year. But the momentum could easily shift. There are two competing Korean fund-raising committees, one for each candidate, and like the rest of Queens, they don't much care about favorite sons and old-neighborhood ties. They are waiting in line for their few moments of attention.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Bill Passed By Senate

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
The Senate approved today the first comprehensive overhaul of the nation's bankruptcy laws in 16 years, setting new rules that will make it easier for individuals to repay their debts on installment plans and harder for big corporate debtors to avoid their creditors.
The House passed the same bill on Wednesday night, so the Senate vote in the early hours of this morning sends the bill to President Clinton. Administration officials said that the President planned to sign it into law. 
 Bankruptcy filings have more than doubled since 1985, peaking in 1992 before dipping slightly last year to 918,734 as the nation's economy improved.
The new legislation imposes many time limits on various steps in the bankruptcy process to hasten the flow of cases through courts and prevent the dissipation of debtors' assets to legal fees.
For instance, the bill imposes many restrictions on how long a big corporation can fight off its creditors while remaining in Chapter 11. A succession of major airlines, including Eastern and Braniff, have operated for many months while in bankruptcy, thereby reducing their costs and prices and drawing complaints from their rivals that the entire industry's profitability had been dragged down.
Both the House and Senate passed the bill on voice votes without opposition. The remarkable unanimity reflected a measure that carefully balanced hundreds of changes for debtors against others for creditors, while making it much easier to jail fraudulent debtors, who lack lobbyists to defend them.
"There is a balance in this bill between debtors and creditors, but I would say the dishonest debtor loses from this bill," said Kenneth N. Klee, a Los Angeles bankruptcy lawyer.
Banks, savings and loan institutions and other creditors welcomed today's legislation.
"We have been working on commercial and consumer bankruptcy reform for a little over four years," said Jay W. Harris, a government relations representative at Savings and Community Bankers of America, the savings and loan industry's Washington-based trade association. "I think what people have recognized is that there is a common interest in reform because it preserves more assets in the estate, which benefits debtors, and of course it benefits creditors."
The bill allows individuals with up to $1 million in debts to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 13, which allows repayments under installment plans. The alternative is Chapter 7, which forces an individual to liquidate assets immediately. The previous limit for Chapter 7 cases was $450,000.
Some of the biggest changes in American bankruptcy law appear in the sections of the bill concerning individuals and companies that engage in dishonest or fraudulent maneuvers to pay their debts. For instance, people who borrow money to buy expensive cars and furniture shortly before going bankrupt will have a much harder time persuading courts to eliminate these debts as part of a bankruptcy settlement, Mr. Klee said. Instead, they will be required to repay the debt even after emerging from bankruptcy.
The bill sets a much easier legal test for prosecutors to meet in court in trying to show that various maneuvers were fraudulent. Bankruptcy fraud is punishable with a fine of up to $5,000 and up to five years in prison.
The bill also makes it much harder for individuals to avoid alimony and child support payments by filing for bankruptcy. And it protects condominium associations by requiring debtors to continue paying association fees after filing for bankruptcy if they occupy or rent a condominium.
Senator Howell Heflin, the Alabama Democrat who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee's panel on courts and administrative practice, said that the bankruptcy laws had to be rewritten as Americans have begun filing more and more cases.
"It is this sheer volume of cases running through a system which was designed many decades ago that has partially necessitated the Senate Judiciary Committee to review and make proposed adjustments to the Bankruptcy Code," he said in a statement.
Representative Jack Brooks, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, pushed the bill through the House.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rallies Against Yen, Rising Above the 100 Level

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar surged to a level above 100 yen yesterday after a report showed that Japan's current account surplus narrowed in August. Rallies in United States stocks and bonds also bolstered the dollar.
"The trade number set the stage for today's rally," said Michael Perelstein, managing director at the MacKay Shields Financial Corporation, a money manager with $11 billion of assets. "The Japanese economy is growing faster than people thought." 
 The Japanese Government reported yesterday that the current account surplus -- the broadest measure of the flow of goods, services and interest payments in and out of Japan -- narrowed 15.7 percent, to $6.16 billion in August.
While the decline was within expectations, the report showed imports surging, a sign that the economy is reviving. The dollar is considered more likely to rally if Japan's economy grows fast enough to increase demand for American goods.
Bond and stock prices rose yesterday in the United States after the Labor Department said the economy added a smaller-than-expected 239,000 jobs in September, after an increase of 246,000 in August.
"The dollar is hanging in there" after being battered for many months, said Jim Raphael, assistant vice president at NatWest Bancorp in Jersey City. "People are starting to move back into U.S. assets markets."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 100.65 yen -- its highest since Aug. 25 -- from 99.88 yen on Thursday. The dollar also edged up against the German mark, to 1.5468 marks, from 1.5436 marks on Thursday. After a two-day decline, the dollar gained against the British pound, which fell to $1.5865 from $1.5905.
Concern about troop movements in Iraq also helped the dollar gain. Investors often buy dollars as a haven during times of international conflict.
In other currency trading yesterday, the Italian lira fell against the dollar and other currencies after the police raided the headquarters of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's media company, Fininvest S.p.A., as part of an investigation into tax evasion. In New York trading, the dollar rose to 1,575.50 lire from 1,567.

HEADLINE: Bicyclist Is Arrested in 3 Sidewalk Stabbings

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
A brisk-pedaling man on a mountain bike was arrested early yesterday after he stopped, stabbed a 32-year-old singer walking down a street in midtown Manhattan and then rode off into the night, the police said.
Detectives said that the cyclist was a suspect in two other late-night pedestrian stabbings in the last two weeks and that he had been arrested last year for wheeling up to a City Council member and punching him in the mouth. 
 The suspect, identified as Elie Granger, 32, was charged with three counts of attempted murder in connection with the three stabbing attacks -- the first on Sept. 28, the second the next day.
Mr. Granger, who lives in a small first-floor apartment on East 74th Street, is unemployed and had been under private psychiatric care, a police spokesman, Lieut. Raymond O'Donnell, said. Other police officials said he had been a public-school teacher until a couple of years ago, but the Board of Education said he had only been certified to be a substitute and had never been called for duty.
The victim yesterday, Kevin Hall, was heading home from a piano bar in Greenwich Village shortly after midnight. A musician who moonlights as a proofreader in a law firm, he had taken the A train to Eighth Avenue and 42d Street and was walking down West 45th Street toward his apartment, eating ice cream.
Yesterday, Mr. Hall said, he was heading down the block between Ninth and 10th Avenues, concentrating on watching police officers round up what he believed were prostitutes. Mr. Granger rolled by, braked and struck up a conversation, he said.
"He smiled," Mr. Hall said. "He seemed very friendly. He was very close to me. He motioned with his head and asked what was going on. I said I didn't know. Suddenly, he stabbed me."
Mr. Hall said it happened so fast that he did not see the knife. He said that he and Mr. Granger were only about 30 feet from the police roundup, but the officers there apparently did not realize why he screamed as Mr. Granger fled.
"I had to run to them and tell them what happened," he said.
The chief of detectives, John J. Hill, said that Mr. Hall's first words to the officers were, "I think I've been stabbed." He pulled open his coat, Chief Hill said, and they saw that he was bleeding. Two officers took him to St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center, a few blocks away, and broadcast an alert that the assailant had fled on his black bike.
Officer Timothy Torres, on duty in a police van on West 50th Street at Eighth Avenue, heard the alert and saw a man on a bicycle whiz by. He chased the cyclist, finally wrestling him to the pavement. After the struggle, which left Officer Torres with scratches and bruises, the police said they found a knife with a retractable, four-inch-long blade on the street near the bicycle.
Mr. Granger was also accused of stabbing Oliver Bonvin, 33, of Jersey City, at 47th Street and Eighth Avenue on Sept. 28, and Yehdram Uzieles, 53, of North Ridge, Calif., at 45th Street and Fifth Avenue on Sept. 29. Chief Hill said that Mr. Granger said nothing before assaulting Mr. Bonvin, but he "mumbled something the victim didn't understand" before he stabbed Mr. Uzieles. Neither victim suffered serious injuries.
Mr. Granger was arrested last Oct. 30 after riding down a Manhattan sidewalk and hitting City Councilman Andrew S. Eristoff, a Republican from the East Side of Manhattan. Mr. Eristoff, a co-sponsor of a bill that would let the police seize bicycles ridden on city sidewalks, asked Mr. Granger to move to the street.
Mr. Eristoff received 22 stitches for a gash in his cheek. Mr. Granger pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, was sentenced to five days of community service and was ordered to pay Mr. Eristoff's medical bills.
