HEADLINE: Since Sept. 11, Years of Change For Airlines

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
A LOT of frequent flier miles have been piling up in the 10 years since the terrorist attacks brought the domestic airline industry to its knees in autumn 2001.
Airlines in the United States lost $55 billion and shed 160,000 jobs during that decade. But the industry has worked through the economic tumult. A decade later, the system is smaller in terms of capacity, but it's still in good working order. Last year, for example, 720.4 million people boarded airplanes in the United States, slightly higher even than the 719.1 million passengers in 2000.
Two weeks ago, at the annual convention of the Global Business Travel Association in Denver, Michael W. McCormick, the executive director of the group, hinted at a recovery. 
''We're not seeing record profits, but we're also not seeing the end of airline travel as we know it,'' he said. ''So have things changed for the better?''
Good question. Planes are more crowded than ever, but fares remain near historically low levels. Other than the airport security challenges, however, the one major difference from 10 years ago is all the extra fees airlines have added to base fares, charging for things that used to be part of the ticket price.
Last year, for example, domestic airlines raised $3.4 billion just from charges for checked bags. In 2007, the year before most airlines started charging extra for checking a bag, the comparable figure was $464.2 million.
''Some would argue that you make more money from ancillary fees than you do operating the airplane, and that you'd like to figure out a way to sell us pillows and things while keeping the plane on the ground,'' Peter Greenberg, the CBS News travel editor, joked to airline executives during a panel discussion at the business travel convention.
''It's the right way to price the product,'' replied Doug Parker, the chief executive of US Airways. Like other airline executives, Mr. Parker is adamant that ancillary fees have become a permanent part of the fare structure -- and that they actually make a lot more sense than, say, the fees that many hotels charge customers.
''Last night, I stayed at a hotel down the street and I wanted to get a bottle of water and it cost $6,'' Mr. Parker said as someone on the stage passed him a free bottle of water. Airlines, he noted, do not charge anyone for a drink of water.
Not that the idea hasn't come up.
In 2008, he said, US Airways ''actually instituted charging for all drinks on board, including sodas and water,'' he said. The idea was dropped a few months later because of passenger resistance.
''Six bucks in my hotel room last night for water!'' Mr. Parker repeated as the audience laughed. ''We just wanted to charge a dollar!''
While airplanes that have been flying mostly full for over two years as capacity has been reduced to cut costs, another inconvenience has arisen. To avoid paying to check a bag, more passengers have been lugging more belongings onto already crowded planes. Some industry analysts have estimated that as many as 59 million extra bags are now being carried onto planes each year.
''It's much harder to find space for your bag now on the airplane,'' Mr. Parker said. He said the trend hasn't created actual departure delays, ''but the boarding process takes longer. We're starting the boarding process sooner.''
Among the changes he predicted that all passengers can expect to see is a limit on extra checked bags, by airlines and also by the Transportation Security Administration at its checkpoints. ''It's becoming a huge problem for them. When you stand in line at the T.S.A., you see that the line is because of all those bags going through, not because of the people themselves being processed,'' Mr. Parker said.
Also ahead is even further contraction in the domestic commercial aviation system. Delta Air Lines, for example, recently announced that it would drop service to 24 small and midsize airports, and US Airways said last week it was reducing service in Las Vegas by an additional 40 percent. At the same time, airlines have been mothballing many 50-seat regional jets, long the backbone of service at midsize airports.
Over the last decade, Mr. Parker said, the domestic airline business came to terms with the reality that it ''had gotten way overbuilt, with too many hubs and too many airplanes.''
''We're being much more rational, not trying to chase market share wherever we can but instead doing what we do well and sticking to that,'' he said.
Asked about complaints from travel managers that airlines don't provide enough ''transparency'' in showing optional fees clearly along with base fares, Mr. Parker said that business travelers were well aware of the panoply of extra charges, especially those for checked bags. Alone among the major carriers, Southwest Airlines does not charge for checking a bag.
''To suggest that people don't know about baggage fees is hard to embrace,'' he joked. ''Because if you haven't heard about them, Southwest will run an ad every couple of minutes to make sure you do.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Presidential Hopefuls Are Vying for Tea Party's Support

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting from Columbia and Conway, S.C., and John Eligon from Manchester, N.H.

 BODY:
COLUMBIA, S.C. -- The leading Republican presidential candidates spent Labor Day declaring their fealty to limited government as they sought to demonstrate credibility with a Tea Party movement that has seized the political energy of their party.
The candidates also strongly criticized President Obama's economic policies as they prepared for a televised debate in California on Wednesday and the president's jobs speech to Congress a day later.
Grim economic news has framed the Republican presidential campaign as a referendum on Mr. Obama's fiscal leadership and a contest about which of the Republican rivals is best positioned to turn the country's fortunes around. Mr. Obama made the case for his economic policies Monday at an event with organized labor in Detroit, in which he previewed themes he is expected to present in a speech to a joint session of Congress on Thursday.
But the president's would-be replacements are also preparing for months of political combat among themselves as they seek the Republican nomination. At a wonkish policy forum here on Monday, five of the Republican candidates offered a preview of the intraparty fight for support from evangelical and Tea Party voters. 
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota accused Mr. Obama of ''stealing from generations unborn'' by vastly increasing government spending. She pledged to repeal ''Obamacare,'' end the appointment of powerful government ''czars'' to oversee policy areas like immigration and the environment, and to eliminate or at least shrink the Department of Education.
''My guiding principle will be that the government works best when it acts within the limits of the Constitution,'' Mrs. Bachmann said at the Palmetto Freedom Forum, hosted by Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina and a leading Tea Party figure.
Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, said Americans ''simply have to rein back government to be what it was considered by the founders'' and criticized Mr. Obama's three years in office.
''I don't think I've ever seen an administration that's gone further afield of the Constitution,'' Mr. Romney said, pledging to reverse Mr. Obama's health care law and new regulations of the financial industry.
Asked what he would change about Mr. Obama's foreign policy, he said: ''A lot. First, I'd have one.''
The format of the South Carolina forum felt less like a debate -- each candidate took the stage alone -- and more like individual defenses of conservative dissertations, with each candidate meandering through a vast and bumpy terrain of federal powers, the judiciary and constitutional amendments under the stern questioning of Mr. DeMint and two others.
Candidates were asked whether the Congress should intervene legislatively to make sure states cannot allow abortion. Most pledged instead to work toward a constitutional amendment banning abortion.
Herman Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather Pizza, argued for a radically revamped tax code. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, focused on the theme of American exceptionalism and the limits of government, making reference to the Federalist Papers and the court system. Representative Ron Paul of Texas stuck to the themes that have long defined him, an abhorrence of money printing, making war, corporate subsidies and the role of government beyond the courts and defense. Mr. Romney called union dues a form of political corruption and said that as president he would sign a law to forbid making union membership a prerequisite for some jobs.
But the broad focus of the Republican candidates was clear: to align themselves with the Tea Party.
At a breakfast earlier Monday in New Hampshire, Mr. Romney declared that he ''couldn't agree more'' with the Tea Party's demands for smaller government.
''There's great interest to say, 'Oh, the Tea Party, oh, and the mainstream Republicans, oh, they're fighting and they're different,' '' Mr. Romney said in response to a question from a supporter. ''The Tea Party has at its center core a belief that government is too big. Sound familiar?''
''That's what we've been saying for years and years as a Republican Party, and they're saying it well and loud,'' he said.
On Sunday, a small group of skeptical Tea Party activists had protested what they said was Mr. Romney's lack of commitment to their causes.
Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, appeared at a Tea Party rally in Manchester, N.H., on Monday as she continued to consider whether she would jump into the presidential race.
''It was the Tea Party movement that shifted the entire fiscal debate in Washington, D.C.,'' Ms. Palin said at a rally organized by the Tea Party Express . ''And now we're seeing more and more folks realize the strength of this grass-roots movement, and they're wanting to be involved. I say right on. Better late than never for some of these candidates, especially.''
Ms. Palin did not say whether she would run. But she continued to hammer Mr. Obama's leadership, accusing him of ''continuing to chase industry off our shores'' and of having an agenda that believes ''a centralized government can successfully manipulate and plan our economy for us.''
The Labor Day campaigning set the tone for a split-screen political week in which the country will watch Mr. Obama directly confront the jobs crisis in his speech to Congress and as the Republicans debate in California on a stage that will include Gov. Rick Perry of Texas for the first time.
Mr. Perry spoke in South Carolina on Monday, telling a crowd in Conway that the government overregulates, that taxes are too high, and that, in a jab at the other Republican candidates, ''there is no one that has the record of job creation that I have.''
But Mr. Perry announced shortly after his appearance that he would skip Mr. DeMint's forum to deal with wildfires burning across his state. More than 60 wildfires have ravaged thousands of acres in northeast and Central Texas, destroying hundreds of homes.
Coming at the opening of the fall campaign season, the South Carolina forum had been anticipated for the prospect of clashes between Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney. Instead, that will have to wait until Wednesday's Republican debate. Mr. Perry pledged Monday to ''double'' his time campaigning in South Carolina.
In the middle of the mix is Mr. DeMint, who endorsed Mr. Romney in 2008 but is holding back his nod -- for now. The state's governor, Nikki Haley, is also a Tea Party favorite. She dined Sunday night with Mrs. Bachmann, who later stayed in the Governor's Mansion overnight ahead of the forum.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: A Lot of Paper Clips

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Have you tried limiting the choices you offer your customers?

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
First of all, Justin's fine.Just fine.
The Economy: A New Head Is Named
The president names Alan Krueger the new head of his Council of Economic Advisers. Brian Proffitt says he may be good for small businesses. The American Small Business League writes him an open letter. Jared Bernstein likes him, too (but then again he thinks the stimulus worked). Many expect Mr. Krueger to push for more stimulus.
The Deficit: A National Debt Primer
Brad Plumer say it's not too late to do nothing. Brad DeLong argues for keeping spending low. John Steele Gordon gives us a short primer on the national debt that concludes: "If the country can experience G.D.P. growth equal to what we had in the 1990s, the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio would drop, in just a decade, to 56.7 percent, about where it was in 2000." The Economist Mom wants the "super" committee to raise taxes. Ramesh Ponnuru wants to lower them.
The Data: Too Many Buts, Not Enough Jobs
The unemployment rate stays the same as the government reports no new jobs were created. But A.D.P. says 91,000 jobs were added in August. But small-business hiring slowed in August. And employees worked fewer hours and received less money. Consumer spending and income jumped in July. But consumer confidence fell to a two-year low. Home prices continuedtheir double dip. But bank lending increased. Pending home sales slipped in July but are up sharply from a year ago. Texas manufacturing activity was unchanged in August. Ford's sales rose 11 percent. Hurricane Irene could cost insurers up to $3 billion (and washed up a monster!).
The Economy: A Little Optimism, a Lot of Paper Clips
Brett Arends says American companies are now more leveraged than at any time since the Great Depression - and then gives us 10 reasons to be optimistic. Small businesses may be rebounding, according to one survey. Retail employment rises in two-thirds of metropolitan areas. Brian Wesbury says stocks are undervalued (pdf)by 65 percent. Mark Perry contributes a roundup of positive economic news and reports that three-year inflation is the lowest in 54 years. A study finds small-business bankruptcy numbers are down. The American paper-clip market is huge. And here's the very best newsof all!
Starting Up: Boomers to the Rescue
A new report finds that the No. 1 reason start-ups fail is because they scale prematurely. Baby boomers account for 84 percent of new businesses, and one of them decides to scrap retirementfor the start-up life. Start-up activity among unemployed managers and executives in the first half of 2011 fell to its lowest level on record. More than one million self-employed Americans areno longer in business almost four years after the last recession began. Ryan O'Reilly says the start-up visa could help. A start-up automates the process of starting up. Monica Rogati sequences the DNA of a start-up. Microsoft hosts a mega start-up event.
Red Tape Update: Obama's Ozone
The House majority leader, Eric Cantor, lays out his party's antitax and antiregulation agenda for the fall. Or was that Barack Obama's agenda? Representative Sam Graves says the White House regulatory review is "appreciated, but doesn't go far enough." Hayden Murray says the E.P.A. chokes business. But not all small businesses believe they are over-regulated and over-taxed. Megan McArdle writes about the death of a D.C. tavern: "Punishing a restaurant owner for a liquor license violation with an open-ended maybe-we'll-give-you-a-license-maybe-we-won't delay is equivalent to giving someone the death penalty for a parking violation. Moreover, it punishes the neighbors and the employees right along with the owner." Scammers are posing as FEMA reps. James W. Lucas reminds usthat "the Federal Register for 2010 is over 81,000 pages long, a 19 percent increase in one year." California legislators take aim at baby sitters. The N.L.R.B. issues a union-friendly regulation. A tax expert offers the best way for the owner of a corporation to claim a home-office tax deduction.
Marketing: E-Mail and Daily Deals Decline
E-mail marketing was down 14.3 percent year-over-year and George Bilbrey reports that spam also declined. The Atlantic reports that people seem to be getting sickof daily deals with traffic slipping for both Groupon and LivingSocial. Facebook and Yelp are dumping their daily deals. Laurie McCabe explains how to maximize our Twitter event hashtags. Rene LeMerle offers seven tips forbetter Twittermarketing. Evan Carmichael lists 50 top social media blogs. Lewis Howes explains how to convert Web traffic into customers. Here are four mistakes of the search-engine optimization novice. A cool graphic suggests small businesses must optimize or die. Check out this webinar on how to create engaging content to generate leads. Inthis video, John Jantsch explains how to succeed online. Google announces an effortto help companies do business online. Women click Facebook ads more than men. Eighty percent of consumers report that they have changed their minds about a purchase after reading a thumbs-down report. Scott McKain says that publicity is not the same as marketing.
Management: Why Customer Service Is Important
Inc. releases its list of fast-growing companies. Score shares 10 mistakes that hurt small businesses, including "heavy dependence on just one of anything." Tony Johnson suggests 10 ways to make money from home. A new service lets 7-Eleven customers pay online bills with cash. Startups.com's founder will inspire you. Office Depot announces the finalists for its official small business of Nascar contest. Isabelle Mercier Turcotte lists eight rules guaranteed to increase your sales. Infusionsoft's chief executive says customer service is important to a small business.
Ideas: The $11 Bottle of Water
The world's seven billionth person is on the way. A pedal-equipped school bus is powered by kids. Future Fords may run on the cloud. Eric Ries says ideas are overrated: "We still believe that entrepreneurial success is about being in the right place at the right time with the right idea. But there's no empirical evidence that's true." An online florist announces a name the bouquet contest. A restaurant offers a menu for bottled water.
Your People: Maybe It Rocket Science
An astrophysicist in Illinois figures out how to board an airplane. Doug Davidoff says the most important thing to remember when hiring salespeople is to "stop sounding like every other company that treats salespeople like a commodity." TheEvil HR Lady warns against making someone salaried to avoid overtime payments. A recent survey finds that only 9 percent of corporate travel managers will reimburse for goodies from in-room minibars, (and 4 percent said they reimburse for the costs of in-room movies and other entertainment). Lifehacker's Alan Henry lists the best credit cardsfor travel rewards. The "Catch Me If You Can" guy explains how to avoid check fraud.
Around the States: Amazing Business Owners in Joplin
In Wisconsin, there's a rash of restaurant failures. FEMA's Dan Stoneking meets some amazing business owners in Joplin, Mo. Gov. Jerry Brown reveals a $1 billion tax relief plan for California businesses. Washington's Economic Partnership presents its 2011 Small Business Awards.
Around the World: A Dutch Treat
Michael Pettis predicts, "Chinese growth will begin to slow sharply by 2013-14." Willis Wee reports on the amazing start-up scene in India: "Many of these folks are very technically gifted, showing that there is a reason why Bangalore is called the Silicon Valley of India." The Dutch National Wheelchair Basketball team shows what perseverance is all about.
Technology: Do QR Codes Work?
Hey fellow geeks: you be the judge. A Pittsburgh Marriott bans phones. Skype introduces a new phone adapter for home offices. Growing numbers of small businesses cut costs with server virtualization. Scott Rankin explains how to tell if tablet computers are rightfor your business. Dell offers hosted applications for small businesses. Joan Voight wonders if QR codes work for us.
The Week Ahead: Obama's Speech 
After some bickering, President Obama plans a major speech on jobs and the economy. Congress returns from its August recess. Wall Street will be watching the release of the purchasing managers' Index, weekly unemployment claims, and trade balance data.
This Week's Bests
Way to Find an Edge: Julien Smith argues that the secret to your success may be to act more like you're criminally insane: "If you are looking for an edge and you can't find one, ask yourself what you would do if you were a criminal, or a sociopath, or had delusions of grandeur, didn't think you could fail, or that there would be no negative consequences."
Reason to Watch 'Glee': James Miller describes the entrepreneurship of "Glee": "It is a testament to the entrepreneurial spirit of providing a good or service that is in high demand. For those like myself who have a keen interest in pop music, the producers do a phenomenal job bringing out the best in the songs they cover."
Reason to Keep Things Simple: Joseph Putnam thinks we may be giving our customers too many choices: "Google is the number one visited site on the Internet, yet they're still able to limit their home page to a single action. They don't distract visitors with other options. Once you land on the site, you just have to decide one thing: What am I going to search for today? How's that for not giving customers too many choices?"
This Week's Question: Have you tried limiting the choices you offer your customers?

HEADLINE: A Discussion of 'Let the Great World Spin'

BYLINE: GINIA BELLAFANTE


HIGHLIGHT: Welcome to the first installment of the Big City Book Club with Ginia Bellafante. Join us for a live discussion of the novel "Let the Great World Spin," by Colum McCann.

 BODY:
We begin with "Let the Great World Spin," Colum McCann's award-winning 2009 novel, a portrait of the city in perhaps its most vivid period of decline. Set in the 1970s, the book is a 9/11 narrative by implication, Mr. McCann's idea being that New York is, fundamentally, a place where wondrous things rise from the ashes. We can argue (and I hope we will) about whether or not he is right in his assessment, but I think it is fair to say that above all, "Let the Great World Spin'' is an enormously hopeful book.
What struck me initially was the extent to which Mr. McCann, a native Irishman, shares a certain kind of New Yorker's nostalgia for the blighted New York of the '70s, a period when murder rates soared and arsonists, drug dealers and a general sense of recklessness reigned. Mr. McCann certainly captures the dominant miseries - in his depiction of life in housing projects, in Corrigan's ministrations in the Bronx, in the heedlessness that results in the loss of two crucial lives. 
But he is primarily committed to a characterization of the city as a place animated by mad and glorious subversions: by a feral artistic sensibility, by a radical sense of religious fealty, by a willingness on the part of certain members of the elite to seek and find connection with those far beyond their social order.
Chief among the acts of rebellion rendered is Philippe Petit's high-wire walk across the twin towers in August 1974 (a day before Richard Nixon's resignation) - the novel's haunting, surreal set piece. It is against the backdrop of this episode that disparate lives clash and merge and find solace in one another. Here the World Trade Center stands not only as spectacle but as a profound symbol of unity.
To my mind, the most evocative passage in a book full of evocative passages is the scene in Claire's Park Avenue apartment as she hosts a consortium of mourners from all strata of society, women who have lost their sons in Vietnam. They have gathered on the morning that Mr. Petit is conducting his walk and with an incredibly economical, if nearly silent, sense of juxtaposition, Mr. McCann delivers the devastating effects of one pointless war and then another. (The scene also poses a powerful existential question: Why court death so baroquely, as Mr. Petit did, when it is chasing us so purposefully all the time?)
I am interested in readers' impressions of the book generally - of Mr. McCann's shifts of perspective and voice; of his staccato prose style; of the novel's sense of historical accuracy (municipal judges of the 1970s, please weigh in) and its myriad analogies. 
More urgently, I am compelled by the book's sense of optimism. It ends with a child of terribly grim circumstance, having landed into a good home and the Ivy League. Mr. McCann means this to stand as a testament to the city's resilience. But at the same time it seems to undermine his own message by the inadvertent suggestion that poverty is surmountable only by serendipity and the charitable impulses of private citizens. 
New York in the years since 9/11 has become a place where class divisions seem ever more pronounced, where an outcome like the one Jaslyn experiences in the book feels less possible rather than more. 
So I suppose we can begin with the question: Is McCann's conclusion naïve? Ambivalent? Inspiring? All of the aforementioned? Converse!

HEADLINE: The Peasants Are Revolting

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Yes, aren't they?

 BODY:
OK, I bagged out on the gala dinner because I'm exhausted from travel (it's not the flight, it's the drive to the conference venue), so time for a blog post while I wait for room service.
I see that Atrios has spotted another piece claiming that we're having all this trouble because those pesky voters won't support what the wise men know is good for them. I've written about this before, with comparable disgust.
Look, I don't want to wax all sentimental about the genius of the common man. But the fact is that both the origins of this crisis and its perpetuation overwhelmingly reflect the errors of the very people now lamenting the annoyances of democracy that keep them from imposing their preferred policies. 
As Atrios says, the euro was very much a top-down, elite-imposed project; and it's the ECB and the German finance ministry, not the unwashed masses, that have pushed for the austerity-for-all agenda that is pushing the euro system to the edge as we speak.
Meanwhile, in the United States it was the Very Serious People -- the WaPo editorial page, the Bowleses and Simpsons and those who extolled them, who declared that our top priority must be deficit reduction now now now, and have left us slashing spending to fend off imaginary bond vigilantes at a time of mass unemployment and record low interest rates.
Meanwhile, voters may be confused and not all that well informed, but if anything they are making more sense on job creation than anyone in a real position of influence.
Suppose Trichet and Schaeuble had been free to dictate fiscal policy for all of Europe, never mind the elected governments; suppose Alan Simpson were in a position to dictate US fiscal policy without that legislative nonsense. Do you really think we'd be in better shape?
And more to the point: by blaming democracy, the people who have gotten everything wrong are letting themselves off the hook. The elites on both sides of the Atlantic have messed up catastrophically, and need to face that fact.

HIGHLIGHT: The court ruling dealt a stinging blow to the Securities and Exchange Commission and it has exposed the Dodd-Frank Act to multiple other challenges

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced late Tuesday that it will not dispute a recent court ruling that struck down one of the agency's new rules for corporate America. 
In July, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the S.E.C.'s so-called proxy access rule, which would have made it easier for shareholders to oust company directors and install their own candidates for the board. The rule stemmed from the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory overhaul enacted after the credit crisis. 
The ruling by a three-judge panel dealt a stinging blow to the agency, which is charged with writing nearly 100 new rules under Dodd-Frank. The decision has exposed the law to multiple other challenges, offering a path for Wall Street trade groups to chip away at the new law. Over the last several weeks since the decision was handed down, industry groups like the United State Chamber of Commerce have been examining legal challenges to the S.E.C.'s new corporate whistle-blower program and a provision surrounding the extraction of oil and natural gas from foreign countries, people briefed on the talks said. 
The ruling in the proxy case, filed by the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, was the latest major defeat for the S.E.C.
Altogether, the appeals court has tossed out three S.E.C. regulations in the last six years, including the proxy rule. In each case, the court rebuked the agency for not fully evaluating a rule's economic effects. 
The agency's decision not to challenge the most recent appeals court ruling was somewhat surprising. The S.E.C. had been weighing an appeal to the United States Supreme Court, according to a person briefed on the matter, or a rehearing before the entire appeals court, but it ultimately backed off.
S.E.C. lawyers were up against a famed regulatory lawyer, Eugene Scalia, a partner at the law firm Gibson Dunn and the son of Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court.
"I want to be sure that we carefully consider and learn from the court's objections as we determine the best path forward," Mary L. Schapiro, the agency's chairwoman, said in a statement. 
Still, the S.E.C. is not ready to scrap the proxy rule altogether. 
"I firmly believe that providing a meaningful opportunity for shareholders to exercise their right to nominate directors at their companies is in the best interest of investors and our markets," Ms. Schapiro said. "I remain committed to finding a way to make it easier for shareholders to nominate candidates to corporate boards."

HEADLINE: Coping With a Natural Disaster

BYLINE: YOU'RE THE BOSS EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: Vince Morvillo of Sea Lake Yachts shares his tips for coping with an environmental disaster.

 BODY:
Last September, we published a How I Saved My Company video created by Vince Morvillo, who owns Sea Lake Yacht Sales, a dealership in Houston, that had been hit by a one-two punch. First, Hurricane Ike, a Category 4 storm, struck Texas in 2008, doing terrible damage. And then came the recession. In that video, Mr. Morvillo talked about how his company survived a period when many of his customers had higher priorities than buying a yacht.
Mr. Morvillo, a yachtsman who was born blind, has prepared a new video, above, in which he offers advice to businesses on the East Coast that may have been affected by Hurricane Irene.

HEADLINE: Beyond Refugee Camps, a Better Way

BYLINE: TINA ROSENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Putting millions of fleeing people in refugee camps amounts to victimizing them twice.

 BODY:
In Friday's Fixes column, I wrote about alternatives to keeping refugees in camps for years. The hundreds of thousands of Somalis streaming today into the camps in Dadaab, Kenya, are getting lifesaving food, medical care and shelter. Camps like Dadaab are designed for emergency care and do it well - but most refugee situations are long-term. Camps condemn refugees to years, maybe decades, of dependency. There are people in Dadaab who have not stepped outside the camp since it opened in 1991.
There are millions of refugees, however, who never go to camps. Instead, they settle in cities or in the countryside. Some soldier through on their own. But in many cases, the United Nations refugee agency, U.N.H.C.R., helps. Life outside a camp gives refugees the chance to live a dignified exile, and to acquire cash and skills that can benefit them and their country once they go home again.
In 1951, an international convention set forth the rights of refugees: these include the right to move freely and to work. Camps, however, hold refugees against their will and do not allow them to work in the local economy. Camps are not only routinely violating refugees' rights, the whole camp system is based on their violation.
Lavinia Limon, the president of the United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, compares the arguments for encampment to the debate about ending slavery. "What were the arguments against freeing the slaves in America? They won't be able to find a job. They are better off where they are. It will destroy the southern economy if we let them loose," she said. "And all that stuff happened. It really did. There's going to be some dislocation. There is a price. But how many people think that freeing the slaves was a bad decision?"
The Committee for Refugees and Immigrants denounces the "warehousing" of refugees and promotes alternatives. Limon is right that putting millions of fleeing people in camps is victimizing them twice. She is correct that the alternatives carry a price, but a price worth paying.
The problem with this argument is that this price isn't paid by America. It's paid by Kenya, Pakistan and other countries that take in refugees. Refugees flee to nearby countries, many of which are barely better off than their neighbors. Indeed, often there is no distinction: there are currently Ethiopian refugees in Sudan and Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia. Or there is a difference of perhaps a decade - Ivory Coast hosted refugees from Liberia during that country's civil war, and now Liberia is returning the favor. The United Nations news agency IRIN reports that in the Liberian village of Janzon Axis, on the Ivorian border, the village chief is sheltering on his property the very same Ivorian family that gave him shelter for 14 years.
Including those in Dadaab and other camps, there are well over half a million Somali refugees in Kenya. As a percentage of the population, that would be the equivalent in the United States of 37.5 million people. The United States enjoys economic advantages that Kenya does not. But does anyone think that the U.S. would take in 37.5 million Somali refugees?
This is why refugees are essentially imprisoned and kept dependent on international largesse. Host nations have several reasons for walling off refugees, but there are two that are most important. One is their fear that if refugees are allowed to make lives for themselves, they will not go home again. Legally, they must go home once it is safe, unless their country of asylum lets them stay. But we all know how well that works.
It seems intuitive that letting refugees settle where they wish is an invitation to stay. Camps, on the other hand, seem to make it easy. Everyone is in one place, and everyone is dependent - just lock it down. "It's a lot easier to deal with people when you just take their rights away," said Limon.
But it may not be true that refugees in camps are more likely to leave. Jeff Crisp, who is the head of evaluation and policy at U.N.H.C.R., thinks that whether people are in a camp or self-settled probably does not affect whether they go home. Most people want to go home, but they don't want to go with nothing - they want to come home with cash, skills and confidence. And self-settled refugees are often able to maintain closer ties with home. Those Ivorians in Liberia, for example, often cross back and forth - they slip into Ivory Coast to farm their lands during the day, and back to Liberia to sleep at night. These are people who are going home again. Certainly they will go back better-prepared to contribute to the rebuilding of their country than those who return from camps.
Host governments also require camps because they do not want the economic and political costs of absorbing refugees. One reader, Melanie from Oslo (2), writes: "Kenya's infrastructure, local institutions and social services are inadequate and already strained to a point that many of the country's deeply impoverished citizens are not able to find gainful employment, send their children to school or obtain medical care." She is correct - which makes it all the more laudable that Kenya, while it has a formal policy of encampment, also hosts thousands of refugees outside camps - some 80,000 in Nairobi.
Study after study has shown that immigrants actually contribute far more money and jobs to their new country than they take - even illegal immigrants. The sudden absorption of tens of thousands of people, however, especially when those people have little education or usable skills, is bound to be a burden. But even they can be productive. S.O. from Chicago (8) wrote that from his experience as a refugee resettlement worker, poor Somalis often do better than Iraqis in America - they take the first job they can, work hard and form tight communities. Some middle-class Iraqis, he wrote, turn down jobs, handicapped by expectations that are too high. "Just imagine how much talent is lost languishing in today's large camps," writes Lynn from New York (7).
International help for refugees outside camps is often aimed at both helping them and reducing the strains they can place on the communities where they settle. For example, UNHCR will expand or help to stock a health clinic in a neighborhood with a large refugee population. This is crucial - it reduces political opposition to refugees, helps to right some of the unfair burden they place on poor countries and creates something lasting. But the scope of these projects falls far, far, short of what is fair and what is needed. One of the arguments donors like for settling refugees outside camps is that it's cheaper. Well, it shouldn't be. If it is, neighboring countries are being asked to do too much.
Providing aid to refugees and the communities that host them resembles development work more than it resembles the traditional tasks of feeding and sheltering people in camp. It is not the kind of work the global refugee system is comfortable with. For example, in Janzon Axis, services for refugees - food aid, an expanded health clinic, a new children's playground - also go to the villagers. Yet UNHCR is building camps for the Janzon Axis refugees, arguing that the only road to the village is impassable during the rainy season, which means aid cannot get through. No surprise; building camps has been our answer for more than 50 years. But a better solution would be to instead take some of that money, and hire the villagers and their guests to build a road.

HIGHLIGHT: This week in food links.

 BODY:
Philly continues to be among the most inspiring cities, food-wise: the Food Bucks program now offers a whopping 40% subsidy for foods stamp purchases at Philadelphia farmers' markets, which has skyrocketed SNAP sales at farmers markets. And then there's this afterschool program in Philadelphia that uses food and gardening to inspire kids to write. (My Philly column from last spring.) Meanwhile, the always excellent Union of Concerned Scientists released a report urging public investment in farmers' markets as a means to create jobs and strengthen regional food economies.
An interesting Chipotle ad that's essentially a brief history of animal agriculture, with help from Willie Nelson and Coldplay.
Conagra is being sued for labeling their GMO oils "100% natural." (Kashi is being sued for misleading "natural" claims as well.) Barry Estabrook discusses that getting sued for poisoning consumers is just the cost doing business.
More dads buying groceries means more ads targeting dads. Congrads, dads, it's time for some cereal.
The Iowa Farm Bureau resolves that farmers should not have to comply with conservation programs in order to be eligible to purchase federally subsidized crop insurance. An even bigger game-changer than that: U.S. cotton growers no longer insist on preserving the current system of federal farm subsidies.
If and when the U.S. finally realizes that using a third of its corn for ethanol is a bad idea, it can always turn to the next best - and readily available - option: panda poop.
Congratulations chocoholics: chocolate has been officially linked to heart health.
Here's a fine piece by the British cook and author Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall on the pleasures of eating more vegetables and less meat. On this subject he and I have in common. Fearnley-Whittingstall is likely happy to know that meat sales in Europe and North America slumped between 2005 and 2010 (unfortunately the only category that performed worse was vegetables.) Here the shift is attributed to "flexitarianism." Really this guy is the reason why meat sales are slow.

HEADLINE: Parenting Reading for Back to School

BYLINE: LISA BELKIN


HIGHLIGHT: About C-sections, autism, oil pipelines, sperm donors, and back-to-school

 BODY:
Labor Day has always been my New Year's. A fresh page in a marbled composition book. Sharpened pencils, metaphorical and actual. A fresh start with a sharpened mind.
To begin, some reading. The last few days have brought a trove of good reporting and writing about parenting, in print and around the Web. 
To start, there's this article on the front page of today's New York Times by Jenny Anderson, and it starts with a math problem:
There are 62 kindergarten seats at the Trinity School this fall, and 756 children wanted them. What percentage made the cut?
Not so fast, she continues:
The answer seems straightforward: 8.2 percent. But private-school admissions are hardly straightforward.
Of those 62 spots at Trinity, one of New York's most competitive schools, 33 were taken first by qualified siblings of Trinity students. An additional 11 went to children of alumni, who also get a leg up in the process, and one more belongs to the child of a staff member. That left 17 spaces for families with no ties to Trinity, giving those without connections a 2.4 percent shot at the prize.
Never has getting into Harvard - acceptance rate: 6.2 percent - seemed so easy.
She goes on to explain that the city's private schools are beginning to rethink this kind of math, and re-evaluate the obligation of a school to a student's sibling. The reason? You knew that answer, didn't you? The economy:
Broadly speaking, the schools want to take siblings and legacies, both because it makes life easier for families and because it deepens relationships, which many believe results in long-term generosity. But as schools look to bolster endowments amid the poor economy, some have begun to question that approach.
Earlier in the weekend, also on The Times's front page, there was this by Jacqueline Mroz about some very, umm, productive sperm donors, and how their offspring are using the Internet to find one another.
She writes:
Cynthia Daily and her partner used a sperm donor to conceive a baby seven years ago, and they hoped that one day their son would get to know some of his half siblings - an extended family of sorts for modern times.
So Ms. Daily searched a Web-based registry for other children fathered by the same donor and helped to create an online group to track them. Over the years, she watched the number of children in her son's group grow.
And grow.
Today there are 150 children, all conceived with sperm from one donor, in this group of half siblings, and more are on the way. "It's wild when we see them all together - they all look alike," said Ms. Daily, 48, a social worker in the Washington area who sometimes vacations with other families in her son's group.
Wild, yes. And, some say, a problem:
Now, there is growing concern among parents, donors and medical experts about potential negative consequences of having so many children fathered by the same donors, including the possibility that genes for rare diseases could be spread more widely through the population. Some experts are even calling attention to the increased odds of accidental incest between half sisters and half brothers, who often live close to one another.
"My daughter knows her donor's number for this very reason," said the mother of a teenager conceived via sperm donation in California who asked that her name be withheld to protect her daughter's privacy. "She's been in school with numerous kids who were born through donors. She's had crushes on boys who are donor children. It's become part of sex education" for her.
Critics say that fertility clinics and sperm banks are earning huge profits by allowing too many children to be conceived with sperm from popular donors, and that families should be given more information on the health of donors and the children conceived with their sperm. They are also calling for legal limits on the number of children conceived using the same donor's sperm and a re-examination of the anonymity that cloaks many donors.
"We have more rules that go into place when you buy a used car than when you buy sperm," said Debora L. Spar, president of Barnard College and author of "The Baby Business: How Money, Science and Politics Drive the Commerce of Conception." "It's very clear that the dealer can't sell you a lemon, and there's information about the history of the car. There are no such rules in the fertility industry right now."
The other selections that caught my attention over the past few days were personal essays about parenting.
As part of "The Baby Project" series on NPR, Barrie Hardymon, an editor for "Talk of the Nation" wrote "I Had a C-Section and I Loved It." She offered her view as a counterpoint to most of the birth stories she reads out there. "Birth has become so politicized," she wrote in her introduction, "that it's not OK to even intimate that you had a scheduled C-section."
She goes well beyond intimation, as the title of her piece suggests:
For the most part, when I entered these conversations with the wonderful women who offered me advice and support, I felt gratitude. But rarely did I identify with the birthing choices that were the norm for some of my dearest friends. How, I thought as I tucked my yoga mat in the back of the closet where it still sits, was I going to get this baby out of me? At a party, a woman I'd just met asked me what my "dream delivery" was. I mentioned Mad Men's much maligned "twilight sleep." It seemed perfect to me (minus, maybe, the enema): Go to sleep, wake up not pregnant, baby in arms. I received the same appalled look from her that I'd gotten at the yoga studio.
"Don't you care about your birth experience?"
"Well, no," I said. "I guess not. I care about the baby experience."
She sniffed and told me that both her children were born without intervention. Intervention! I was dying to have someone intervene - as soon as possible - and get this child into the world with a minimum of fuss. I was clearly destined for at least an epidural, and if there was any way I could get Betty Draper's drugs, I'd be thrilled.
As it turns out (pun intended?) her son, Hank, provided that option:
And then, at 33 weeks, my doctor had news for me. The baby was breech. Although I was obviously worried about any risks this might create for him, I had to admit that for me it was occasion for enormous relief. I scheduled my C-section right away.
On my BabyCenter "mommy boards," other women reassured me that the baby might turn, and that there were things I could do to help the process along. "That's OK," I wrote. "I'm OK with cesarean." Others told me to try to have the baby vaginally anyway - women had been doing this for thousands of years without medical intervention. Hmm. You know what I bet those women would have liked, as they clutched at twisted bedsheets and screamed for hour upon hour, only to, in some tragic cases, have a baby get stuck in the birth canal? A C-section.
One woman went so far as to say that I was selfish not to even try to turn the baby. "Some babies are breech because they feel their mother's ambivalence. Motherhood," she wrote, "isn't supposed to be easy." Her signature read, "hippie, feminist, home birthing, working mom!" This was really confusing. You mean, we're supposed to start martyring ourselves even before the baby is born? We're still mad at Eve for eating that apple?
Worse, I thought, we're mad at each other. For every woman that whispered a recipe for ginger tea, there was one ready to tell me I was already failing at motherhood - before the baby was even born. I couldn't even get him into the world properly. How would I ever get him to college?
On a dramatically different topic, Daphne Wysham spent Labor Day weekend purposefully getting arrested, then writing about it. Wysham, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, co-director of the Sustainable Energy and Economy Network, and host of Earthbeat Radio, participated in the protests against the Keystone XL pipeline in front of the White House.
Though she spends her career worrying about the ruination of the planet, she has always tried to shield her 11-year-old son from the worst of her fears. "It's more important to let a child be a child," she writes. "Let them experience the wonder and beauty of nature, not fear it."
What though, to say, when Mom heads off to the White House to be arrested? For that she turned to pop culture:
In the aftermath of Hurricane Irene, my son and watched the movie Avatar on DVD (for the nth time). As it ended, I thought: This might be a good opportunity to explain my plans for that week.
"You know, this movie is very close to what's happening in Canada right now," I explained. "And it's one reason I'll be getting arrested this week."
As my son took in my explanation for my planned act of civil disobedience, he quickly concluded that he, too, wanted to be arrested. But, after some hours of contemplation, I had to reluctantly tell him no.
Why "reluctantly"? Because I felt I was denying my son the right to act, politically, on an issue that would very likely have a much larger impact on his life than on mine. He, far more than the adults who were weighing in, should have a vote on this issue. Yet he, and all our children, have little say on the world they'll inherit, one that may be changed utterly, in ways we can't even comprehend.
It was not her own son, however, whose name she invoked at the actual moment she was handcuffed. It was someone else's children:
... I recalled the day Obama stood before the American people, in those days and months as BP's deepwater well billowed millions of barrels of oil from that horrifying wound in the Gulf of Mexico floor. I remembered him remarking that, yes, he was very concerned about the spill because, while he shaved one morning, his 11-year-old daughter Malia had asked him, "Did you plug the hole yet, Daddy?"
Children have a way of speaking to our hearts. And so, I mused, even if President Obama didn't hear the songs and the chants of the more than 1,000 people who were arrested over the course of two weeks, even if the prayers of religious leaders and Native American elders went unanswered, even if he didn't read the editorial opposing the Keystone XL pipeline in The New York Times, even if he ignored the advice of his very own EPA, perhaps, in this instance, Sasha or Malia might see us outside the White House gates, and ask him, "Did you stop the pipeline yet, Daddy?"
As the police handcuffed my hands behind me and led me off to a white school bus, I shouted: "For Sasha and Malia!"
And, finally, a story of another child, and the small corner of the world that is his inheritance. Tom Fields-Meyer is the author of the wonderful book "Following Ezra: What One Father Learned About Gumby, Otters, Autism, and Love From His Extraordinary Son" and today, on the first day of school, the Wall Street Journal posted an excerpt.
Ezra will be starting 10th grade, and in the essay, his father recalls the day years ago when he first realized his son was different:
I can still picture the knee-high Formica table, still recall the awkward effort to fold my adult body into the toddler-size plastic chair. I remember the drive that morning from work, how I was wondering what the point was of parent-teacher conferences at a preschool. What could the instructor possibly tell us about our son, who wasn't yet 3? How he was interacting with his Play-Doh?
"Let's start with the positives," the teacher told my wife and me haltingly. "Ezra has a lot of energy, and he's a very loving child."
I waited for more positives. None came. Instead, I heard how my son was spending his mornings idly flipping through picture books, oblivious to the other boys and girls. And how when the children lined up to wash their hands before snack, he would stand at the sink, staring blankly into space, frozen. A few adjectives stood out: spacey, inflexible, autonomous.
Eventually there would be other descriptors, including "high-functioning autism," and a journey to "learn to be the right parent for Ezra."
I figured that was just a phase, or a reflection of his quirky personality, until a therapist we consulted-attempting to reassure us by explaining that we were not to blame-mentioned something about his "wiring." Wiring, I thought. That doesn't sound like a phase.
Not long after that, during a session where my wife expressed tearful frustration and we both felt exasperated that our attempts at play therapy seemed so futile, the same counselor made a suggestion: "You need to let yourselves grieve."
"For what?" I asked.
"For the child he didn't turn out to be."
Lying sleepless that night, I realized something: I had no instinct to mourn. I had carried no conscious notion of what my children would be like-boys or girls, tall or short, conventional or a bit odd. I planned only to love them.
Learning to be the best parent a particular child needs; that's a journey each of us embarks on anew this time of year. I wish each of you a smooth and fulfilling one.
Now, go tackle your assigned reading.
There will not be a quiz.

HEADLINE: Study Finds State Unionized at Twice National Rate

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: New York has the highest unionization rate of any state, 24.1 percent, but the rate for older workers is considerably higher than for younger ones.

 BODY:
The percentage of New Yorkers in labor unions is twice as high as the nationwide rate, a new study finds. In a pessimistic sign for New York's unions, though, the unionization rate for older workers is considerably higher than for younger ones. 
The study The State of the Unions 2011: A Profile of Labor in New York City, New York State and the United States (pdf) - notes that New York State has the highest unionization rate of any state, 24.1 percent, compared with 22.9 percent for New York City and 11.9 for the entire nation. 
The study found that just two fields - education and health care - account for nearly half of the 750,000 union members in New York City. 
The report found that 33 percent of New York City workers aged 55 and over are in unions, compared with 22 percent for workers aged 25 to 54. Statewide, 29 percent of workers aged 55 and over are in unions, compared with 25 percent for those aged 25 to 54. 
The study comes on the heels of a February report by the federal Department of Labor that found that in 2010, union membership in New York state fell to its lowest level in at least 15 years.
The new study found that 71 percent of public-sector employees in New York State are unionized, the same percentage as in New York City, compared with a 37 percent rate nationwide for public-sector workers. With regard to private-sector workers, 14 percent are unionized in New York City, compared with 13.6 percent in New York State, while just 6.9 percent of them are in unions nationwide.
The study noted that a considerably smaller percentage of Manhattan residents are in unions compared with people in the four other boroughs. The rate in Manhattan is 15 percent, compared with 30 percent for the Bronx, 23 percent for Brooklyn, 23 percent for Queens and 34 percent for Staten Island.
The study is by Ruth Milkman, a sociology professor at the CUNY Graduate Center and academic director of the Joseph S. Murphy Institute for Worker Education and Labor Studies, and Laura Braslow, a doctoral student in sociology at the CUNY Graduate Center.
The new study is one of the first to take a detailed look at the unionization rates of various industries in New York City and State. The study found that in New York City, 75 percent of bus and urban transit workers are unionized, as are 27 percent of construction workers and 15 of retail grocery workers, even though virtually all the large supermarket chains are unionized. The report also found that the unionization rate was 48 percent for the city's hospital workers; 35 percent for hotel workers; 20.5 percent for radio, television and cable workers; and 9 percent for newspaper, magazine and publishing workers.
According to the report, union members in New York State and City earn more on average than nonunion workers. Statewide, union members earn $27.50 per hour on average, 17 percent more than the $22.87 for nonunion workers. In New York City, union members earn $26.03 an hour on average, a 7 percent premium over the $24.26 for nonunion workers.

HEADLINE: In Jobs Data, 'Surprises' Mean Bad News

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Over the past ten years, there have been 89 jobs forecasts that were too optimistic, versus just 51 that were too pessimistic. 

 BODY:
Friday's jobs report was suggestive of an economy at stall speed. The United States neither added or subtracted jobs in August, according to the initial estimates from government's establishment survey. The numbers hadn't been good before, but this was the first time in ten months that the payrolls figure had failed to be positive.
The report contrasted with the expectations of economists surveyed by organizations like Bloomberg and Reuters, who had forecast about 64,000 jobs to be added. In the shorthand of financial journalists, the result was deemed to be "unexpected."
It seems like when there are these "surprises" in the jobs report, they usually turn out to be negative. Behind two out of three economic doors, it seems, lies a goat, and not the shiny new automobile that will drive us along on the road to recovery.
Then again, it's also my impression that negative economic reports, fairly or not, tend to receive more press attention than positive ones. So I decided to check the record.

This is a pretty simple study. I went through the Google News archive to compile reports of consensus forecasts of payroll growth made immediately prior to the release of the government's monthly employment report. If there were different figures reported in different surveys of economists, I simply averaged them together, although usually the differences didn't amount to much. I then compared the forecasts against the net nonfarm payrolls figure as initially reported by the government.
It turns out that since the start of the recession in December 2007, the consensus forecasts have been too optimistic on 28 occasions, and too pessimistic on 17 occasions. So there have in fact been more negative than positive surprises. On average, economists have overestimated job creation by about 18,000 jobs per month, or about 823,000 jobs total over the entire period.
If you focus only on the most serious misses - those where the Wall Street consensus was off by at least 50,000 jobs in either direction - there have been 18 negative surprises and 10 positive ones.
That sounds pretty bad, and it is - especially since people's livelihoods are at stake. However, the results are only just on the verge of being statistically significant.
So I decided to expand the study to include every jobs report in the new millennium: everything from January 2000 onward. (Because the Google News archive gets spotty as of about mid- 2001, I supplemented the data with reports from CBS MarketWatch for the early years.)
It turns out that this pattern of too-optimistic forecasts also existed prior to the recession. Over the past ten years, there have been 89 jobs forecasts that were too optimistic, versus just 51 that were too pessimistic.
Eliminating the close calls where the report was within 50,000 jobs either way, the tally becomes even more lopsided: 24 positive surprises against 57 negative ones.
With the larger sample size, we can now say almost without question that the jobs creation estimates put forward by economists have been biased upward. Negative surprises have been about twice as common as positive ones over the past 12 years.
What's interesting is that this pattern is fairly persistent across time: the study covers portions of three expansions and two recessions, and the optimism bias is present in all five periods. If anything, it's gotten a little bit milder recently: economists were especially flummoxed when the jobs engine of the 1990s began to screech to a halt at the start of the 2000s.
The more benign explanation for this, I suppose, is that the economists surveyed by organizations like Reuters, Bloomberg and CBS MarketWatch are a bunch of unrepentant bulls, whose voices often tend to be heard more loudly in the financial newswires. The past decade or so has been associated with lots of volatility in stock prices -- but in general, stock prices have remained expensive relative to earnings, and ascompared to longer-term trends, despite a litany of economic problems in the broader economy.
The scarier possibility is that something really has changed in the American economy: since 2000, the average payrolls report has shown the addition of just 17,000 new jobs (or only 4,000 jobs after revisions). If these models are trained on data going back several decades, but there have been structural changes in the U.S. economy since then, that could explain why these forecasts are consistently missing to the high side.
Another potential explanation - or complication - is that there's quite a bit of error in the jobs numbers that the government puts out. So far, I've been focusing on the jobs numbers as initially reported by the government each month. But they are subject to substantial revision, both in the two months after the government releases the initial number and then again at later periods.
Since 2000, slightly more of the revisions have been to the downside, although they can vary significantly from period to period.
Most notably, the government's initial estimates significantly underestimated the magnitude of job losses during the most recent recession. They now total almost 7.4 million jobs, according to the government's latest estimates, versus an aggregate of 5.1 million in job losses as reported originally, a difference of 2.3 million jobs.
Most of these jobs losses - about 1.7 million out of the total discrepancy of 2.3 million - came prior to the design and passage of the stimulus bill in February 2009. (Other economic statistics like G.D.P. have also been subject to significant downward revision over this period.)
I don't know whether seeing the figures as they read now, as opposed to how they printed at the time, would have compelled Barack Obama and the Congress to pass a more substantial stimulus package. But the economy was much worse than originally believed.
On average, the absolute value of monthly revisions since 2000 has been about 70,000 jobs, plus or minus.
The margin of error, or 95 percent confidence interval, is generally about 2.5 times as large as the average error. So in this case, it's about . If the August employment report, which showed no overall change in payrolls, seemed too darned equivocal for you, do not fret: it will probably change. Unfortunately, recent history suggests that these changes will probably be for the worse.
Media reports probably treat the government's initial estimates of job growth with too much credulity. The employment report is based on a pair of surveys, which like any surveys are subject to significant sampling error. Taking survey data and using statistical models to translate them into estimates of job creation introduces more error.
The error in economists' forecasts of the payrolls number, and the error in the figure as originally reported by the government versus the revised number, tend to have a compounding effect. Since 2000, economists' initial estimate of job growth has been off by an of 90,000 jobs as compared with the revised figure. That implies that when you see an economist's forecast of monthly job growth, it has a 95 percent confidence interval of plus or minus 232,000 jobs.

HEADLINE: Should Democrats Play by Republican Rules?

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Democrats are courting electoral defeat by allowing Republicans to set the terms of policy debates, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
It's the nature of complex phenomena to have multiple causes and origins. It's simplistic to say that a war, revolution or economic collapse can be explained by a single factor. It's the job of analysts to sift among potential sources, assign weights to particular ones and thus try to understand the nature of such phenomena. 
For momentous developments like the fall of Rome or the Industrial Revolution, the analysis may literally go on forever, with our understanding continually reshaped by subsequent history and perspective.
However, in real time, we don't have the luxury of waiting until a consensus or even a dominant view has developed. In fact, we often don't have time to do anything except rely on gut instincts derived from experience, theory, conjecture, ideology and a wide variety of other influences. 
For those who lack the time, knowledge or education to think deeply about events as they happen, political parties and movements provide predigested ideas, perspectives and remedies.

Unfortunately, people are sometimes led astray by those they trust for insights, information and solutions to problems. This may result from corruption or mendacity, rigidity of thought, simple error or ignorance. And it's human nature for people and organizations to be reluctant to acknowledge mistakes and to have an almost unlimited capacity to rationalize and force facts and theories to conform to their self-interest.
In the case of the Great Recession or mini-depression that we have been experiencing for almost four years, the best economists in the country are still divided on its cause and cure. It's not an exaggeration to say that they are deeply polarized, with virtually no overlap among the competing camps in terms of analysis or remedies.
At the risk of oversimplification, one side sees government as the cause of all that has gone wrong in the economy and therefore believes that scaling back government intervention is necessary to improve the situation. That means reducing taxes, deregulation and spending cuts. 
The other side thinks that the complex causes for the crisis are not necessarily related to the required response, which can be determined by examining the facts of the situation - high unemployment, nonexistent inflation and extraordinarily low interest rates, among other things. 
This camp believes that the problems created by the crisis can be addressed by monetary and fiscal policy - much the way a doctor may save an ill patient by aggressively treating his symptoms even without knowing the precise cause of the ailment.
In broad terms, these dueling perspectives happen to conform to the basic philosophies of the two major parties. Republicans are predisposed to blame government for every problem regardless of the circumstances, and Democrats tend to view government as necessary to deal with economic and social problems.
One reason people join political parties is to save themselves the time and work of researching and thinking about issues. They are too busy with their jobs, their families and all the other things that occupy the time and attention of average people. 
And even in the Internet age, it is hard to find the information and analysis necessary to make informed decisions about public policy. It's vastly easier to just accept one party's perspective and assume it is correct.
What parties and movements do when an issue comes along that requires them to take a position or presents opportunities to advance their agenda is to sort the possible causes and prospective cures put forward into those that are sympathetic to their program and philosophy and those that are not. Those that are sympathetic are deemed to be correct; those in conflict are deemed incorrect.
Obviously, there are serious problems with this approach, which members of both parties follow. Mistakes are easily made and incorrect positions established that may make matters worse rather than better. These positions may be held so dogmatically that their supporters feel that coercion is justified in forcing people to accept their point of view or that violence is an appropriate response to resist policies whose validity they question. 
Thankfully, elections and democracy offer peaceful methods for resolving political conflict. And historically a sufficiently large number of Americans have been willing to withhold judgment until the facts are determined with some degree of certainty, and to be persuaded by logic and evidence, rather than immediately aligning themselves with a particular ideological or partisan political approach. 
But without correct information and good leadership, it may not be possible for the rational, reality-based community to exercise influence, and control will necessarily default to one of the extremes.
Right now, it is clear that the right side of the political spectrum is dominant. Virtually all policy debate these days is based on the premise that the conservative position is at least valid. For example, we have heard for months from Republicans that government regulation is a major, if not the primary, factor holding back economic expansion and employment growth. 
Just last week, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor of Virginia, posted a memo to House Republicans detailing specific regulations whose repeal would create jobs.
Mr. Cantor offered no analysis or evidence that abolishing these regulations would do anything to raise real growth of the gross domestic product or to reduce unemployment. The Republicans to whom the memo was addressed don't need any evidence, because they are predisposed to believe that government regulation always holds back economic growth and job creation. That's why they became Republicans in the first place.
So overwhelming is the Republican view that on Friday President Obamawithdrew an Environmental Protection Agency regulation, widely supported by scientists as essential to air quality, because its economic burden is deemed to be unaffordable at this time. 
Of course, we can't be sure whether the regulation would have reduced jobs or if its withdrawal will lead to illnesses by people who would have otherwise remained in good health. All we know is that in the cost-benefit calculation, Mr. Obama considered the costs to be decisive.
His supporters will argue that Mr. Obama made the right call based on the facts of the case, but no doubt political factors also weighed on his decision. And those factors have been heavily shaped by the reality that much of the public has been swayed by the oft-repeated Republican charge that government is the enemy of progress.
In a courtroom, justice requires that both sides be equally well represented. If one doesn't do its job properly, the jury cannot be blamed for a wrong result. If Democrats are going to accept Republican premises, they shouldn't be surprised if a majority of people eventually conclude that Republicans ought to be in charge of government policy.

HEADLINE: Carlyle Files for an I.P.O.

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Carlyle Group is latest in a line of private equity giants to decide to enter the public markets.

 BODY:
The Carlyle Group officially wants to join the exclusive club of publicly traded private equity giants.
Carlyle filed for an initial public offering on Tuesday, a long-awaited development that will finally shed light on the investment firm's business.
The securities filing listed a provisional fund-raising target of $100 million, which is likely to change over time. That number is used to calculate the registration fee.
Founded in 1987, Carlyle manages $153 billion in assets across 86 funds and 49 fund of funds, according to the filing. It employs more than 1,100. It has participated in the buyouts of a number of big American companies including Freescale Semiconductor, Hertz and Dunkin' Brands.
The firm, which is based in Washington, reported $2.8 billion in revenue last year and $1.5 billion in net income attributable to Carlyle. Using economic net income, a pro forma accounting figure preferred by private equity firms, Carlyle earned just over $1 billion.
By comparison, the Blackstone Group, one of Carlyle's biggest competitors, reported $3.1 billion in revenue and $485.5 million in economic net income last year.
Like other private equity firms, Carlyle has benefited from improving market conditions and low interest rates. The company reported a 172 percent increase in revenue for the first six months of the year, to $447.2 million.
Its revenue from management fees has grown 16 percent thanks to several fund acquisitions, while its performance fees have jumped 971 percent because the value of its investments has improved.
The firm also confirmed that it has reorganized its corporate structure, to reflect its transition from a private partnership to a public company. Its three co-founders will remain at the top: Daniel A. D'Aniello will become the firm's chairman, while David M. Rubenstein and William E. Conway Jr. will be co-chief executives.
Carlyle's public offering will also allow the firm's current stakeholders to cash out, including its co-founders and senior executives. Mubadala, an investment arm of Abu Dhabi, purchased a 7.5 percent stake in 2007 and made an additional $500 million investment late last year. And the giant California pension fund Calpers has owned at least a 5.5 percent stake in the firm for several years.
 The firm's offering will be led by JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Credit Suisse.

HEADLINE: Turmoil Helped Push Temple-Inland Into Deal With International Paper

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Volatility is usually an enemy of deal-making. But as various troubles roiled Temple-Inland, they left the company more willing to hold merger talks with unwanted suitor International Paper.

 BODY:
Normally, market turmoil inhibits deal-making. But in the case of International Paper and Temple-Inland, it helped.
International Paper announced on Tuesday that it had finally reached an agreement to buy Temple-Inland for $3.7 billion, after a months-long standoff over price. Temple-Inland had repeatedly rebuffed International Paper's takeover bids as insufficient and armored itself with a poison pill and other takeover defenses.
But as bad news mounted for Temple-Inland -- a paper mill chemical discharge that killed fish in Louisiana, a lawsuit over the failure of a bank it helped create -- the company decided that a deal with International Paper looked like a better and better idea.
According to Timothy S. Nicholls, International Paper's chief financial officer, the two companies began talking last week about a potential sale. Discussions quickly ratcheted up in intensity, and the two wrapped up negotiations this weekend.
"We had finally reached a point where we were able to hold talks," he told DealBook in a telephone interview.
Mr. Nicholls emphasized that even at the higher $32-a-share price, the deal promised millions of dollars in cost savings. Much of those are expected to come from combining the two companies' supply chains and mill operations. He added that International Paper expects layoffs as well, though he said that the company hadn't decided on a precise figure.
With the economy relatively stagnant, he added, it made sense to gain scale by meshing the two together.
"We recognize that we're in a slow growth period," he said. "But combining these two businesses makes a lot of sense."
The about-turn by Temple-Inland included warnings that a merger would run into strict scrutiny by antitrust regulators. But Mr. Nicholls said that the review process, which began with International Paper's original unsolicited bid, would continue. He added that the deal is expected to close in the first quarter next year and would add to his company's earnings per share in the first year after closing.
International Paper shareholders appeared pleased by their apparent bargain of a deal, with shares in the company rose nearly 9 percent to $27.77. Shares in Temple-Inland jumped more than 25 percent to $30.85.

HEADLINE: A Banker Explains Why Small Businesses Have Trouble Getting Credit

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: One bank's small-business lending claims hinge on the meaning of small

 BODY:
After a recent post about the bad news embedded in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's second-quarter good news - business lending broadly was up for the first time in three years, but small-business lending continued to fall - The Agenda heard from a representative of Sterling National Bank, a small institution based in New York City that lends exclusively to small and medium-sized businesses. Contrary to what I had reported, loans were way up at Sterling, the representative said. Did I want to find out why?
I did. But what I learned was not as clear-cut as my correspondent had suggested. 
Sterling, as the president, John Millman, tells it, was established in 1929 - "a very difficult year" - by a handful of businessmen who felt that the city's small and mid-size companies "were under-served by larger banks in the marketplace." (Among the founders was an owner of Arnold, Constable & Company, the famed New York department store of the time.) The bank, Mr. Millman said, makes no consumer loans but offers businesses - today's clients are mostly professional services - an unusual range of products for a community bank, including asset-based lending, factoring, trade financing, and until recently leasing.
While the banking industry increased total business lending by less than 3 percent in the second quarter, Sterling bolstered its own by nearly 10 percent. "Most banks have not been seeing growth in the loan portfolio, and they are saying that they're not seeing loan demand," Mr. Millman said. Sterling claimed to see a different picture. For one thing, the bank's existing clients were starting to bite off a little bit more of their available credit line, he said. "But the very big area for growth for us are new relationships. Many traditional lenders to what we call small and mid-size companies have either lost interest for various reasons in the marketplace or they have merged up into much larger institutions and they can't focus on that particular sector.
"We have been able to pick up many really significant client relationships the last several quarters, and they come to us largely from banking relationships that they're unhappy with."
Sterling has received some press coverage about the growth in its small-business lending. And that's fair enough. But the key phrase here may be Mr. Millman's qualification, small and mid-size companies. For Sterling, those are companies with revenues that start at $4 or $5 million and reach as high as $100 million and who borrow as much as $20 million. In the category of what the F.D.I.C. calls small-business loans - financing of $1 million or less - Sterling's portfolio actually dropped 3 percent, a steeper decline than in the banking industry as a whole.
In fact, since 2003, when the F.D.I.C. began collecting small-business loan figures, the small-business share of total commercial and industrial lending at Sterling has fallen, from 26 percent to 19 percent. At the nation's biggest bank, by assets, JPMorgan Chase Bank, the small-business loan portfolio constitutes a slightly larger share of total business lending than at Sterling.
Mr. Millman acknowledged that Sterling now makes fewer small-business loans (or perhaps business loans that are small), "but that had never been a significant part of our lending," he said. "Our core strategy is to work with larger, more established companies that borrow up to $20 million. While we did some very small business lending, we have determined that it makes much more economic sense to us and to our shareholders to focus our resources into larger relationships.
"You can even do the arithmetic," he continued. "The resources required to make a $10 million loan are not a lot different than the resources required to underwrite, administer, and make a $1 million loan. If you're trying to grow your loan portfolio by 10 percent, and you have over a billion-dollar loan portfolio, you're going to make a lot of $400,000 loans and you're not going to get there. But if you're making $20 and $25 million loans, you're more likely to get the loan growth. And that's the strategy we have employed."
We have heard others say that big banks have difficulty making small loans - though it's rare to hear a banker acknowledge it. But Sterling is hardly a big bank - with about $2.5 billion in assets, it ranks 283rd. It is almost an axiom of banking that big banks are interested in transactions and use computer credit models to underwrite their small loans, while small banks are interested in borrower relationships and underwrite their loans manually. Mr. Millman, though, seemed to say that only the smallest banks would be able to treat the smallest businesses like people, rather than numbers. "It's pretty hard for a bank that's bigger than ours, I would think, to make lots of $500,000 loans and to say it's a relationship business," he said. "I don't see how you can have a relationship with that many units."
I asked Mr. Millman why he had wanted to talk to me, given that Sterling's experience wasn't exactly a counter-example to the broader trend I reported on. "We're a $2.5 billion bank in the biggest banking market in the world, and folks at
The New York Times don't normally focus on community banks in a market that's this big," he said. "And to us it's important to speak to as many people as we can to let them know about what we've been doing the last 80 years and who we are."
Where would he recommend people who want $1 million loan go to get one, I asked. Sterling National Bank, he answered: "The experience will be much better at an institution like ours at that dollar level than at any other institution I can think about."
But when asked where borrowers seeking smaller loans -- $500,000, say -- might go, Mr. Millman had no similar advice. "I honestly don't know the answer to that," he said.

HEADLINE: The Week Ahead in Congress: Returning From Recess to a Full Plate

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: There are times when it seems to Americans that Congress is doing nothing of substance. This fall is not going to be one of those times.

 BODY:
There are times when it seems to Americans that Congress is doing nothing of substance. This fall is not going to be one of those times.
Congress returns this week from its August recess with a laundry list of urgent matters to tackle, most of them fiscal in nature and politically divisive. The two biggest highlights of the week will be the official convening of a bipartisan Congressional committee charged with finding $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions, and President Obama's speech concerning jobs before a joint session on Thursday.
But there are myriad other issues on deck, including measures to avoid the furloughing of transportation employees, federal aid requests from scores of towns and cities hit by hurricane Irene and appropriations bills that need immediate action. There are trade bills to fight over and payroll taxes to ponder.
As if that were not enough, on Tuesday the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will hold a hearing titled, ominously, "United States Postal Service in Crisis: Proposals to Prevent a Postal Shutdown." 
While the first half of this year largely centered on two major fiscal battles - a short term spending plan and a bill to raise the debt ceiling -- the dynamic of those bitter partisan brawls appears to have set the template for a series of legislative skirmishes this fall, as each party desperately searches for the political high ground on spending and jobs.
In his speech before a joint session of Congress, Mr. Obama is expected to push both for a payroll tax cut for workers and unemployment compensation for those out of work for six months or more, but also more stimulus-like measures designed to stem unemployment, like proposals for repairing and retrofitting roads, bridges, schools, airports, rails and other public works projects.
Objecting to most of those ideas before they have even been officially proposed, House Republicans have a different agenda in mind - one echoed by almost all of the Republican presidential candidates over Labor Day weekend - which revolves centrally around dismantling regulations, also in the name of job creation.
Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, has already outlined an aggressive agenda that would scale back environmental protection regulations, some components of the Obama health care law, and to challenge the National Labor Relations Board for injecting itself into a labor dispute involving the Boeing Company in South Carolina, a key Republican primary state.
In a parallel universe on Capitol Hill, a committee of 12 members of Congress - six from each chamber and each party - will hold its first organizational meeting on Thursday; the following Tuesday, the committee will hear testimony on "The History and Drivers of Our Nation's Debt and Its Threats." 
As the White House and Congress fight over fiscal policy the joint committee will look at ways to tame the deficit, though program cuts, possible revenue increases and a change to the tax code. Those two conversations will be politically and substantively intertwined, of course, even as the committee labors to appear as its own independent study group, mulling expansive policy shifts over, one imagines, many pizzas. 
At the same time, other worries loom, with the same fundamental disagreements over how the government out to be run underpinning them. If a bill to finance surface transportation bill, which authorizes $52 billion in federal financing for transportation and construction projects, is not renewed by Sept. 30. a partial shut down of that work is in the offing. (The House wants a $230-billion, six-year version that includes a sizable cut to the current budget, while the Democrat-controlled Senate wants a more two-year bill with smaller reductions.)
Fights over the payroll tax and the complexion of the free trade agreements also looms. While Democrats and Republicans agree on the need for agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama to eliminate tariffs on cross-border transactions, they cannot quite seal the deal on how to assist workers displaced by foreign competition.
At least one thing got taken care of before recess! The Senate approved a House bill extending the Federal Aviation Administration's operating authority after a fight over a provision to eliminate $16.5 million in air service subsidies to rural airports led to a temporary furlough of some agency workers. That agreement, alas, expires this month.

HEADLINE: With Bartz Out as Yahoo's Chief, Is a Deal in the Future?

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Now that Carol Bartz is out as Yahoo's chief executive, an already cloudy future for the Internet company has gotten murkier -- and potentially makes the onetime giant a takeover target again.

 BODY:
With the Yahoo board firingCarol A. Bartz as chief executive, the the onetime Internet giant's already clouded future just got murkier -- and might make it a takeover target once more.
Remember that Ms. Bartz was brought into Yahoo in 2009 after the company's tortured negotiations with Microsoft over a possible merger. She replaced a Yahoo co-founder, Jerry Yang, whom some analysts had criticized for rebuffing Microsoft's $44 billion bid.
A well-regarded former head of Autodesk, Ms. Bartz was given the task of finding a new path forward for Yahoo. But she failed to redefine the company, which has since been eclipsed by a host of old and new competitors, including Google and Facebook.
Yahoo has not been much of a deal maker under Ms. Bartz, having purchased just eight companies during her tenure, according to data from Capital IQ. But it has sold a few well-known divisions, including HotJobs.com and the bookmarking site del.icio.us. And it has held talks about shedding its 35 percent stake in Japan's Softbank.
A little over a month ago, Ms. Bartz helped negotiate the settlement of a long-simmering feud between Yahoo and its Chinese partner, the Alibaba Group, over a payments processor.
And Yahoo is widely considered in the mix for Hulu, the online video portal.
With little direction at the moment -- Yahoo's board has installed the company's chief financial officer, Timothy Morse, as interim chief executive -- the company may become deal fodder. 
Months ago, some investors and deal makers had reportedly pondered how to pull off a complicated three-way transaction involving Yahoo; AOL, another troubled Internet company; and possibly some private equity firms.
Kara Swisher of All Things D, who first reported Ms. Bartz's ouster, has said that an array of tech-savvy companies have been contemplating possible plans for Yahoo. Among them: the buyout firms Silver Lake and Providence Equity Partners; the News Corporation; and News Corp.'s former president, Peter Chernin.
A full-fledged buyout, however, would take a very large bite. Yahoo, with cash of just roughly $2.6 billion on its books, has a total enterprise value of $13.8 billion, according to Capital IQ data. No private equity firm has attempted a buyout of $10 billion or more since the financial crisis.
And an acquisition would come with much risk. Yahoo has been viewed by many, in the words of a Citigroup analysts note on Tuesday, as "a deteriorating asset."

HEADLINE: Pro-Perry Group to Spend Big on Campaign

BYLINE: NICHOLAS CONFESSORE


HIGHLIGHT: The plan to spend as much as $55 million to help Gov. Rick Perry is a sign that outside groups are likely to pay a pivotal role in the party's nominating process.

 BODY:
A new Super PAC with close ties to Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is laying plans to spend as much as $55 million to help him win the Republican presidential nomination, a sign that outside groups are likely to play a pivotal role in the party's selection of its presidential candidate. 
The group, Make Us Great Again, was formed in late July by a group of Texas political operatives and major Perry donors. Unlike Mr. Perry's own campaign -- which did not officially kick off until two weeks later -- Make Us Great Again is permitted to accept contributions of unlimited amount to be spent in support of Mr. Perry's presidential ambitions, so long as the group does not coordinate its expenditures with Mr. Perry's campaign.
According to a planning document prepared by the group, Make Us Great Again is preparing for what amounts to a full-service primary campaign, with television advertisements, direct mail and social media outreach. The sheer size of the budget is striking, on par with the total amount of money raised by all the Republican candidates combined during the first six months of the year, though the candidates' own fund-raising is certain to pick up pace as the race unfolds and the Republican field narrows. 
The Make Us Great Again planning document was reported on Tuesday by MSNBC and its authenticity confirmed by Jason Miller, a spokesman for the group, though he cautioned that many of the specific spending and strategic decisions outlined in the document were outdated.
"As the dynamics of this primary have changed, so have our targeting and spending," said Mr. Miller.
Officials at the group said they were expecting their own spending to be matched by that of other Super PACs backing specific candidates, notably Restore Our Future, a group founded by allies of Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. Virtually all of the leading Republican candidates for president are now backed by Super PACs organized by their donors and former aides, as is President Obama, underscoring the central role the groups are likely to play in the battle for votes and campaign dollars.
Brittany Gross, a spokeswoman for Restore Our Future, declined to say whether the group had comparable fund-raising goals.
"We're not commenting specifically on fund-raising or strategy," Ms. Gross said. "Restore our future is solely focused on electing Mitt Romney -- a budget-conscious and field-tested Republican who understands the economy and believes in the power of American workers."
During the entire 2010 election cycle, when Republicans won control of the House of Representatives, Super PACs spent a total of $65.3 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending. Such groups, made possible by federal court rulings last year, are expected to spend far more during the 2012 campaign, rivaling the traditional party and candidate committees through which most campaign money has flowed in the past.

HEADLINE: Polls Show Declining Support for Obama on Economy

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI


HIGHLIGHT: The polls show an increasing number of Americans saying that Mr. Obama's policies are making the economy worse.

 BODY:
Two new polls have found low levels of support for President Obama and his economic stewardship of the country, with an increasing number of Americans saying that Mr. Obama's policies are making the economy worse. The surveys show that Americans have a pessimistic outlook for economic recovery and raise the stakes for the president's speech on Thursday before a joint session of Congress in which he is expected to offer plans for creating jobs and stimulating the economy.
The president's overall approval rating has dipped to record lows in recent surveys conducted by ABC News/The Washington Post and NBC News/The Wall Street Journal, with Americans expressing disapproval of the president's handling of the economy and saying they feel the effects of the lethargic economy personally.
The ABC News/Washington Post survey found that 53 percent of Americans now disapprove of Mr. Obama's handling of his job as president, compared with 43 percent who said they approve. Almost identical approval ratings were found by the NBC News/Journal poll: 51 percent voiced disapproval and 44 percent said they approved of Mr. Obama's job as president.
Perhaps the most significant sign that the president will face a sea of unhappy voters on Thursday evening is the growing number of Americans who think his economic program is having a negative effect on the economy. While almost half of those queried in the ABC/Post poll say the president's efforts are having no effect on the economy, about a third say his program is making it worse, up from about a quarter who thought that earlier this year. 
The NBC/Journal poll asked a similar question about the efforts of the Obama administration on the economy, and found that 37 percent said the president's policies had hurt economic conditions, while 39 percent said they had not made much of a difference. Increasingly, Americans are laying the blame for the economy on the current president, although a majority says the poor economy is a situation Mr. Obama inherited. A third of respondents - 33 percent - now think that Mr. Obama's policies are mostly responsible for the existing economic conditions, up from 8 percent who said so when the question was first asked in early 2009.
Nearly seven in 10 of those polled said they disapproved of the way Republicans in Congress were doing their job.
Americans are almost evenly divided over who they trust more to handle the economy, create jobs and deal with the federal budget deficit. Forty-two percent of those polled by ABC News/The Washington Post said they trusted the president, while 39 percent said they trusted Republicans in Congress to do a better job of handling the economy.
Despondent About the Economy
Both polls showed Americans' sense of doom and gloom about the economy. In the ABC/Washington Post poll, half said they were pessimistic that the job situation in the country would improve in the next year. Thirty-five percent said they were not as well off financially as they were when Mr. Obama became president, the highest percentage since the question was first asked by the poll during the Reagan administration. Americans were divided as to whether the country was headed into another recession in the NBC/Journal poll, but 72 percent said the economy had not hit bottom yet and could fall further. Just 21 percent thought the economy had pretty much hit bottom.
Priorities for the President and Congress
The NBC/Journal poll asked a number of questions about priorities. More than half of those polled -- 56 percent -- said the president and Congress should worry more about keeping the budget deficit down, and 38 percent said they should worry more about boosting the economy even though it might mean larger deficits now and in the future.
When asked about a number of ideas that could be considered for Mr. Obama's job plan, a Georgia Works-type program, which has been lauded by the president in recent speeches, was the most appealing. Sixty-two percent said it was a "good idea" to pay for long-term unemployed workers to train at private companies for eight weeks, and give the companies an option to hire them; just 17 percent said it was a bad idea, and 21 percent said they didn't know enough. Almost half said financing a new road construction bill was a good idea, while a quarter said it was a bad idea and another quarter said they didn't know enough. Extending unemployment benefits was a divisive idea, with 44 percent saying it was a good idea and 39 percent saying it was a bad idea.
The ABC News/Washington Post survey of 1,001 adults nationwide was conducted by telephone Aug. 29 to Sept. 1, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The NBC News/Journal poll of 1,000 adults nationwide was conducted by telephone Aug. 27 to 31 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
Today's Times:

        
Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta is supporting a plan that would keep 3,000 to 4,000 American troops in Iraq after the deadline for their withdrawal, but only to continue training security forces there, The Times's Eric Schmitt and Steven Lee Myers report. Mr. Panetta's recommendation would break a longstanding pledge by President Obama to withdraw all American forces from Iraq by Dec. 31. 

        
The single biggest stimulus measure that President Obama plans to announce on Thursday is likely to be a continuation of temporary payroll tax relief for workers and an extension of such relief to their employers, The Times's Jackie Calmes reports. It is not his first policy choice, but it is the one with the best chance of getting Republicans' support in Congress.

        
Wednesday's Republican presidential debate and Mr. Obama's economic address to Congress on Thursday offer a window into the dueling efforts to present voters a view of the president and his record at a time when polling shows he is politically vulnerable, The Times's Jeff Zeleny reports. While the White House tries to rebrand Mr. Obama as a reasonable man in an era dominated by extreme views, the Republican candidates continue to cast him as a big-government liberal who created uncertainty for business and failed to revive the economy.

        
Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, are urging the president to propose spending on an array of new public works and jobs programs during his televised speech on Thursday. Republicans have vowed to oppose such initiatives, saying similar efforts have failed spectacularly, The Times's Robert Pear .
Around the Web:

        
The secretary of homeland security, Janet Napolitano, told Politico that air travelers may not have to remove their shoes before passing through security in the eventual future.
Happenings in Washington:

        
President Obama will meet with Jimmie Johnson to congratulate him on his victory in the Nascar Sprint Cup Series.

HEADLINE: Ragged Edges at City Hall

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: With his smooth handling of Tropical Storm Irene, Mayor Bloomberg seemed to be getting his groove back, but now he has gone back to foot-shooting. Also, what City Room is reading in other papers and blogs.

 BODY:
 To the best of our knowledge, no senior aide to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was arrested overnight, though with this City Hall you never can tell. It may call itself a model of transparency, but translucence is more like it, at best.
 That translucence (at best) has caused Mr. Bloomberg to shoot himself once again in the foot. Self-inflicted wounds are becoming almost routine as he nears the midpoint of a third term that he simply had to have, and manipulated the political system to get.
 Mayoral inattentiveness bred a scandal over the CityTime payroll system, plagued with corruption and enormous cost overruns. Arrogance led to Mr. Bloomberg's appointment of an unqualified social friend to be schools chancellor. A combination of both forces, inattentiveness and arrogance, resulted in the mayor's cavalier response to last December's blizzard. 
 There are unmistakable signs of raggedness at City Hall, confirmed the other day by a New York Times analysis of the statistics that Mr. Bloomberg holds dear. Police and Fire Department response times in emergencies have begun to slow. Families are staying longer in homeless shelters. Streets are dirtier. More water mains are breaking.
 It is hardly a surprise, then, that the mayor's approval rating has sunk. In a Times/CBS News poll last month, it fell to 45 percent, its lowest level in six years.
 With his smooth handling of Tropical Storm Irene, Mr. Bloomberg seemed to be getting his groove back. But now he has gone back to foot-shooting. Worse, he has lost a large measure of credibility with his unapologetic half-truths about why Stephen Goldsmith left as deputy mayor for operations.
 It took a month for New Yorkers to learn the real reason, by way of The New York Post: Mr. Goldsmith had been arrested in Washington and jailed for the better part of two days on a domestic violence complaint.
 After that story came out, the mayor's instinct was to go into hiding. When he finally showed his face on Sunday, he wrapped himself in a cloak of honor. You see, he didn't want to make matters worse for the Mr. Goldsmith and his wife, Margaret. "We, as a policy, should try to treat each other, particularly those who devote their lives to public service, as humanely as possible," he said.
 On Monday, before the West Indian Day Parade, he said that "we really don't know what happened" between the battling Goldsmiths.
 You can make yourself dizzy trying to track the mayor's inconsistencies.
 He really didn't know what happened. So why, then, was the arrest itself reason enough to require that Mr. Goldsmith pack his bags? And if the deputy had to go, why were New Yorkers, who paid the man's salary, unworthy of being told what happened?
 As for supposedly humane treatment, why did Mr. Goldsmith deserve it but not another city employee in a comparable domestic situation? In mid-August, a school safety agent was arrested and charged with harassing his wife by phone after they had separated. Mr. Bloomberg's Police Department didn't hesitate to announce this man's situation and his identity.
 On Monday, the mayor drew a perplexing distinction between an arrest of a city worker made in New York, where "we know what happens here," and one made in "another jurisdiction," where "we're not familiar with their procedures."
 Got it. Washington has police rules that are totally alien. It might as well be Kandahar.
 Matters would be different, Mr. Bloomberg added, if "somebody does something outside of New York that has to do with their official business in New York." But that wasn't the case with Mr. Goldsmith. He was off-duty when arrested. (So, too, by the way, was the school safety agent.)
 O.K., let's follow this reasoning. What if a deputy mayor on vacation in Washington is caught up in a barroom brawl, and is arrested for punching someone's lights out? By Mr. Bloomberg's logic, New Yorkers are not entitled to learn about the arrest because the deputy was off-duty and, besides, who knows what procedures the Washington police follow.
 But why even bother wading through the inconsistencies? The core reality is simple enough: Mr. Bloomberg plays by separate rules for himself and those close to him. It has always been thus. It is why, for example, his City Hall staff receives large pay raises while other municipal employees are told to tighten their belts and instructed to do more with less. And it is why the telling of half-truths doesn't trouble the unapologetic mayor one bit.
 A half-truth is, of course, also a half-lie. It brings to mind a line from the incomparable "Lawrence of Arabia," in which a double-dealing diplomat accuses Lawrence of telling half-lies. "A man who tells lies, like me, merely hides the truth," this character say. "But a man who tells half-lies has forgotten where he put it."

HEADLINE: Pataki Says He Is Content to Be a Noncandidate

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The former governor said he had no regrets about deciding not to make a run for president, a notion that some people in the political world had mocked.

 BODY:
Eleven days after canceling a planned visit to Iowa and announcing he would not run for president, former Gov. George E. Pataki of New York said on Tuesday that he remained content in private life and was at peace with his decision.
Mr. Pataki appeared outside Grand Central Terminal to endorse Bob Turner, the Republican candidate running to replace former Representative Anthony D. Weiner in a special election on Sept. 13. Mr. Pataki said Mr. Turner would "shake things up" in Washington and send a message that the country's fiscal policies needed to change. 
His appearance came as Mr. Turner and his Democratic opponent, Assemblyman David I. Weprin, began a final push in what appears to be an unexpectedly tight race in the Ninth Congressional District, which includes parts of Queens and Brooklyn. Mr. Weprin planned to campaign in Queens on Tuesday with Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who once represented the district in the House of Representatives. 
Mr. Pataki, who served three terms as governor, from 1995 through 2006, said he had no regrets about not trying to shake things up himself by seeking the Republican presidential nomination. He has flirted with a bid for more than a decade, though hints that he might run this year drew some ridicule from political observers.
Asked about his decision not to run, Mr. Pataki said that he was thoroughly enjoying the private sector - he founded his own consulting firm and also practices law - and added that he was "not someone who feels the need to be in public office."
"I'm still waiting for someone on my side to come out with the vision, the plan and the ideas to move this country in a new direction, and we'll see what happens down the road," Mr. Pataki said. "But at this point, I just said, 'This is not the time for me.' "
Mr. Pataki formed a group earlier this year that favors reducing the federal debt and is critical of President Obama's fiscal policies. On Tuesday, he said that Mr. Obama was perpetuating a "crime against our children" by driving up the national debt, a point he said he hoped a Republican candidate would drive home in the coming months.
"I think the weakest of our candidates would be an improvement over this president," Mr. Pataki said. "I really have never felt this strongly in my life the need to change the direction of this country, and the need to change the leader of this country."
Mr. Pataki also gave a positive review to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination to challenge him in 2002. "I think that balancing the budget this year without raising taxes was the right thing to do," Mr. Pataki said, "and it was a difficult thing to do, so I give him credit for that."

HEADLINE: Introducing David Paterson, Drive-Time Radio Host

BYLINE: DANNY HAKIM


HIGHLIGHT: The former governor's first guest was his former running mate and boss, Eliot Spitzer. "I finally got a job that you didn't have to give me," he said.

 BODY:
Former Gov. David A. Paterson made his debut as a radio host Tuesday afternoon on WOR-AM (710). 
He came on to the strains of Frank Sinatra's version of "New York, New York," yielded to traffic updates and declared: "I am more excited right now, sitting here, than I was even the day I was sworn in as governor of the State of New York on March 17, 2008, and the reason is this time I had time to think about it."
His first guest? His former running mate and boss, Eliot Spitzer. 
"You're going to be Jerry Seinfeld and Dan Rather, all put together in one," Mr. Spitzer said, encouragingly. Then, prompted by Mr. Paterson, Mr. Spitzer launched into a whirlwind analysis of the market's volatility and the economic outlook, the kind of insightful but wonky disquisition that may have contributed to the demise of Mr. Spitzer's short-lived talk show on CNN. 
When the brief chat was over, Mr. Paterson told Mr. Spitzer, "I finally got a job that you didn't have to give me." 
Mr. Spitzer replied: "There's lots of things I could say, but we're on live radio."
Whatever one might think of Mr. Paterson, who had a rocky tenure as governor, his show, which is on from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., was certainly more substantive than typical AM radio fare.
In addition to Mr. Spitzer on the markets, Tuesday's show featured a loose debate between the two candidates to replace Anthony Weiner in the Ninth Congressional District and an interview with former Police Commissioner William J. Bratton on recent crime problems in London and New York City. 
Among the politicos who called in were the former State Senate president, Malcolm Smith, and Assemblyman Francisco Moya. 
There was also a fair amount of Mets banter, and lamentations from Mr. Paterson, a long-suffering Mets fan, as well as an interview with the Mets first baseman Nick Evans. 
Mr. Paterson, who has made many appearances on the radio since leaving office, made a few gaffes, but also employed his most enduring political asset: his wit. After he repeatedly referred to the Ninth Congressional District as the Eighth, he told the two candidates, "the loser can represent the eighth."

HEADLINE: How to Bring the Jobs Back: Invest in Workers

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE F. KATZ. 
LAWRENCE F. KATZ, an economics professor at Harvard and the chief economist at the Labor Department in 1993-4

 BODY:
THE last four years have been difficult for American workers. Employment collapsed in 2008-9 in the wake of the financial crisis. There are no signs of recovery in the labor market. Public-sector employment fell in the last year and private-sector employment growth remains tepid. The employment crisis has exacerbated the longer-term trends of rising inequality and a decline in middle-class jobs. Bold action by the federal government is needed. 
First, a net job-creation tax credit for the next two years could provide a powerful incentive for private-sector employers to speed hiring and create momentum for a jobs recovery. Private employers who increase employment would get a tax credit to cover a substantial share (say 40 percent) of the payroll costs of net new hires; they would get a check even if they didn't owe taxes. Such a tax credit would focus the incentives on expanding businesses, where the new jobs are more likely to persist, even after the subsidy expires.
Second, increased federal spending of at least several hundred billion dollars a year for the next two years is needed to offset weak private-sector demand and crumbling state and local government finances. I would emphasize aid to state and local governments to prevent further layoffs and to increase spending on infrastructure for public schools and community colleges. Recent research shows that investments in public school infrastructure can raise property values and student performance. The most promising transportation, research and development and energy-efficiency investments should also be included.
Third, the work force investment and re-employment system needs to be revamped. Re-employment services can be cost-effective in helping dislocated and disadvantaged workers find employment more rapidly. The economic rewards from community college and other postsecondary education remain high for young workers and some dislocated workers. There is much evidence that well-functioning training and education programs -- like Job Corps, the National Guard Youth Challenge and Career Academies -- help disadvantaged youths.
Existing employment and job-training systems are fragmented and hard to navigate. We need to make sure all workers have the resources and information to invest in high-return training.
Unemployment insurance should be made more flexible so that employers have an incentive to shorten workers' hours instead of laying them off. Jobless workers trying to start new businesses should be eligible for continued unemployment insurance benefits. Wage-loss insurance should be granted to help buffer the earnings losses of displaced workers who take new, lower-paid jobs.
Industry-specific training programs that prepare disadvantaged workers for skilled jobs and help connect them to employers have been shown to raise earnings and should be expanded.
These initiatives could start us down the road to a sustained jobs recovery with more broadly shared prosperity.

HEADLINE: Swiss Bank Moves to Cap Franc's Value Against Euro

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY; Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Alarmed by the threat a soaring currency poses to Switzerland's economy, the country's central bank sought Tuesday to cap the value of the franc against the euro and said it was prepared to spend an unlimited amount to defend it.
The Swiss currency, long considered a haven in crises, has surged against the euro and the dollar this year as investors have fled turmoil in the markets. That has raised fears among Swiss companies that the country's exporters will be priced out of business abroad.
''The current massive overvaluation of the Swiss franc poses an acute threat to the Swiss economy and carries the risk of a deflationary development,'' the Swiss National Bank said in a statement. It said it was ''therefore aiming for a substantial and sustained weakening of the Swiss franc.''
The central bank ''will no longer tolerate'' an exchange rate below 1.20 francs to the euro, and ''will enforce this minimum rate with the utmost determination and is prepared to buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities,'' said the statement, which was unusual for its strong wording. 
The franc fell sharply, with the euro rallying to 1.20527 Swiss francs in afternoon trading Tuesday in New York from 1.1201 francs late Friday. The dollar soared to 0.8624 Swiss franc from 0.7880 franc late Friday.
The central bank's move underscores the particular challenges facing Switzerland amid global economic uncertainty. The bank's chairman, Philipp M. Hildebrand, has been roundly criticized at home for the strength of the franc, though it is mainly a reflection of problems elsewhere.
Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, described the Swiss National Bank as ''probably the best-run central bank in the Western world.'' But with a ''grossly overvalued currency,'' Switzerland risks falling into a deflationary trap as imports become relatively cheaper, he wrote in a note.
Deflation, a generalized decline in prices, increases the burden on debtors and tends to paralyze an economy as consumers guard their money in anticipation of lower prices.
With doubts about the United States economy and as investors fear that European assets could lose much of their value if the euro currency union were to fail, Switzerland has been the unenthusiastic recipient of billions of dollars in investment inflows.
On Aug. 9, the euro traded as low as 1.00749 francs -- near parity -- and the dollar fell as low as 0.7071 franc.
Another traditional haven -- gold -- reached a record of $1,923.70 an ounce in trading Tuesday of contracts for December delivery, before retreating below $1,900. But the price of oil has fallen because of the global slowdown, eliminating another place where investors might be tempted to put cash.
The market mayhem has also bolstered the yen, now trading near a record against the dollar, as Japanese investors unwind risky investments overseas.
Florian Esterer, a fund manager at Swisscanto Asset Management in Zurich, said Switzerland's attraction resulted in part from its reputation for political stability and sound policy.
''The stable economic performance is a result of the institutional setup,'' Mr. Esterer said.
One thing that is clear is what is good for investors is not necessarily good for Swiss business.
''At parity the franc is overvalued by 35 percent or more,'' Rudolf Minsch, chief economist of Economiesuisse, a federation of Swiss business organizations, said. ''It no longer has anything to do with fundamentals at that level.''
Mr. Minsch said the pain among his members was particularly severe in the tourism, textiles, machinery, metals and paper industries.
Switzerland's biggest trading partner is the European Union, but the overvalued franc is also affecting business in the United States and the developing world, he said.
''In places like China, German companies have a cost advantage of as much as 30 percent,'' he said.
This is not the first time the Swiss central bank has resorted to such a strategy to contain the franc. It used a similar operation in the late 1970s to weaken the currency against the Deutsche mark. The central bank's new target commits it to buying euros and selling francs any time the euro falls below 1.20 francs. That amounts to setting a floor for the euro or a ceiling for the franc.
The authorities had considered adopting a currency peg, in which the franc would be defended at a specific rate. In reality, considering the downward pressure on the euro, the 1.20 franc level will probably prove a de facto peg for now.
Currency market intervention, when it is not coordinated among the major central banks, has not had a lasting effect in recent years, as the Bank of Japan learned recently. Last year, the Swiss bank's unsuccessful efforts to check the franc's rise with market intervention led it to a foreign exchange loss of 32.8 billion francs, or $41.6 billion at current exchange rates, and an overall loss for the year of 20.8 billion francs, or $26.4 billion.
Steven Saywell, head of global currency strategy in London for BNP Paribas, said he thought it ''very unlikely'' that the Swiss National Bank's counterparts at the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank would be eager to follow suit in strengthening their currencies against the franc, even though a meeting Friday and Saturday of Group of 7 finance and central bank officials in Marseille, France, would give them a chance to coordinate policy.
''The G-7 has far greater issues to deal with,'' Mr. Saywell said, ''like preventing the U.S. economy from sliding into recession and supporting the ongoing political discussions about addressing Europe's debt problems.''
In fact, the European Central Bank appeared to distance itself from the Swiss move, saying in a two-sentence statement that the Swiss central bank had decided to hold down the value of the franc ''under its own responsibility.''
Mr. Saywell said investors were certain to test Switzerland's resolve, as the authorities there were trying to buck a strong tide.
''In an environment of strong growth and economic stability, the franc might weaken,'' he said. ''But in this climate, we expect the market to challenge the S.N.B. over the next few days.''
Last month, as part of a continuing effort to weaken the franc, the Swiss National Bank cut its main interest rate target to zero from 0.25 percent and said it would significantly increase the supply of liquidity to the Swiss franc money market. It moved twice during the month to increase banks' sight deposits through which banks can withdraw money, to 200 billion francs from 80 billion francs. It also said it would conduct foreign exchange swap transactions to create liquidity in Swiss francs.
Even at a rate of 1.20 francs per euro, the central bank said Tuesday, ''the Swiss franc is still high and should continue to weaken over time.'' It said that ''If the economic outlook and deflationary risks so require, the S.N.B. will take further measures.''

HEADLINE: Newark Deputy Mayor Expected to Be Named Connecticut Education Chief

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Stefan Pryor, a deputy mayor in Newark who was a founder of a well-known New Haven charter school, is expected to become Connecticut's education commissioner.
At its regular meeting on Wednesday, the State Board of Education will recommend to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy that Mr. Pryor be named commissioner, said Mark Linabury, an Education Department spokesman. 
Mr. Pryor, 39, has been one of Mayor Cory A. Booker's closest aides, overseeing Newark's economic development efforts since 2006. Before that, he was president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation following the Sept. 11 terror attacks.
He is widely seen as an ambitious and skilled consensus-builder with a deep interest in education. He was a co-founder of Amistad Academy, a New Haven charter school that has become a model for schools in other cities.
He has longstanding ties to Connecticut, where he attended Yale University and Yale Law School in the 1990s. He was elected to the New Haven Board of Aldermen, and worked in the mid-1990s as a policy analyst on youth and education issues for Mayor John DeStefano Jr. of New Haven.
Mr. DeStefano said Tuesday that Mr. Pryor was an effective leader because he took a persistent, fact-based approach to issues, adding that ''he is not one to default to preconceived notions.''
''In an ideologically charged environment such as public education, a collaborative approach will serve us well,'' the mayor said.
Kathryn S. Wylde, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, said Mr. Pryor worked with Brooklyn schools for her group from 1998 to 2001; she said he successfully persuaded school officials, unions and parents to adopt controversial practices like data-driven management and accountability standards.
''He has been eager to get back to education,'' Ms. Wylde said. ''He is a highly focused, very intense person who is into the substance of the issues. He communicates effectively and he has great patience for diversity of opinions.''
Mr. Pryor did not respond to a request for an interview. If appointed, he would succeed George A. Coleman, who has been acting commissioner since January. Connecticut education officials said further details about Mr. Pryor's appointment would not be available until after the meeting on Wednesday.
News of Mr. Pryor's expected appointment caught some superintendents and education advocates by surprise. Robert J. Rader, executive director of the Connecticut Association of Boards of Education, said he was concerned that Mr. Pryor had never worked as a school superintendent.
''However, we have heard that he can get things done,'' Mr. Rader said, ''and we very much look forward to working with him and the State Department of Education to increase student achievement. I'm hoping he will be an articulate spokesman for public education.''
Mr. Rader said Mr. Pryor's biggest challenges would include raising persistently low test scores in some urban districts and leading a statewide effort to reshape high school requirements. ''And all of this is happening at a time of very tough fiscal conditions in our school districts,'' he said.

HEADLINE: China's New Cultural Revolution: A Surge in Art Collecting

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
As auction houses prepare for their fall sales, Chinese collectors are expected to be a major boost for the market, raising their paddles for big-ticket artworks despite a backdrop of global economic turmoil.
With China's economy booming, art collectors there have become an increasingly powerful force in the market, demonstrating a growing interest in Western as well as Asian art.
At Sotheby's spring sale, a Chinese buyer bought the evening's priciest painting -- Picasso's ''Femme Lisant (Deux Personnages)'' -- for $21.3 million. In March, at the auction house Lebarbe, in Toulouse, France, a Chinese buyer set a new French record for Chinese art with a $31 million bid on a scroll painting from the Imperial Palace in Beijing. Last year an anonymous telephone bidder who was believed to be Chinese paid $106.5 million for Picasso's ''Nude, Green Leaves and Bust'' at Christie's, a record for a work of art at auction.
Chinese auction houses are now selling works at a pace formerly associated with those in London and New York. One company that tracks the fine-art market, Artprice, reported that they were responsible for some $8.3 billion in sales, which would make them the world leader. 
''We have seen exponential growth by mainland Chinese buyers who were brought up during the Cultural Revolution,'' said Henry Howard-Sneyd, Sotheby's vice chairman for Asian art. ''These are successful business people with huge amounts of money at their disposal.''
The auction market is responding to the new demand. Last year Sotheby's held its first exhibition for the private sale of art specifically for the Asian market. It featured Picassos, Monets and Chagalls that sold for $2 million to $25 million.
This year Christie's appointed Chinese representatives in both New York and London to develop new clients in Asia and manage relations with Christie's most important private collectors from mainland China and Asia.
''Chinese buyers are now recognized in the art world and auction world as the most important area of business development,'' said Lawrence Chu, a collector based in Hong Kong who runs BlackPine Private Equity Partners.
The current Chinese influx is fueled by the sort of new wealth that has made the country home to the world's largest number of billionaires, according to the Hurun Rich List 2010, China's version of the Forbes 400. The number of Chinese billionaires is expected to increase 20 percent each year through 2014, according to Artprice.
To some extent, auction experts say, the Chinese regard art not only as a sound way to diversify their portfolios but also as a tested means to project status as they interact with international business executives -- ''the Arnaults and the Pinaults of the world,'' said Francois Curiel, the president of Christie's Asia, referring to the French billionaires Bernard Arnault and Francois Pinault.
''They see works of art on their walls,'' Mr. Curiel said, ''and think, 'If I want to be not just a millionaire but someone who plays with the big boys, I'd better be someone who collects art.' ''
The surge in Chinese collecting is not just a reflection of new wealth, experts say, but also a reaction to the repressive Mao years when the country was denied culture. For the Chinese, who watched art disparaged as a frivolous exercise except when put to didactic use, the freedom to explore simple aesthetic pleasures, to repossess historical works and to show off recent affluence has been liberating.
''They have an interest in reclaiming their culture and their history,'' Mr. Howard-Sneyd said.
The tide of buying is in some ways an effort to make up for lost time. ''In China, for 50 or 60 years, nothing happened,'' said Vishakha N. Desai, the president of Asia Society. ''That's a big break. The last 250 years were years of humiliation. They now feel an obligation to prize art again and bring it back.''
Because of that history, Chinese art buying -- particularly the public display associated with an auction -- is still a nascent phenomenon. Chinese collectors are only beginning to develop an artistic eye and expertise.
''They don't necessarily have the cultural or education background -- they don't have the context,'' said Jehan Chu, an art consultant whose Hong Kong-based company, Vermillion Art Collections, helps buyers build their holdings. ''There were no museums, no galleries until recently and not so much access to information.''
Recently the interest of Chinese collectors has expanded well beyond indigenous works.
''They are present in all our salesrooms now,'' Mr. Curiel said. ''You're beginning to see Chinese collectors in the world of Impressionists and 20th-century decorative art. Possibly with the exception of European old masters, we see China in every center.''
A few Chinese collectors were ahead of the curve, like Joseph Lau, the Hong Kong real estate billionaire who recently spent $:33 million (about $53.3 million) on a six-floor London mansion and in 2006 bought a Warhol portrait of Mao for $17.3 million, then a record for that artist, at Christie's in New York.
Lawrence Chu, the hedge fund manager, said he collected Western artists like Toby Ziegler, Mark Bradford and Dana Schutz -- as well as Asian art -- because ''the artists are more developed.''
''There is a little more substance to what they do,'' he continued.
As the Chinese market builds, leading galleries are opening satellite offices in China, including the Gagosian Gallery, White Cube and Ben Brown Fine Arts.
''They've all set up shop in the past two years, and many just in the past year,'' said Jehan Chu, who previously worked in client development for Sotheby's in Hong Kong.
The Pace Gallery was among the first to venture into China, in 2008. The gallery represents Chinese artists, including Zhang Xiaogang, whose ''Forever Lasting Love'' triptych sold at Sotheby's Hong Kong for more than $10 million in April, and Li Songsong, whose ''China Past'' diptych sold at Sotheby's Hong Kong for more than $500,000 the same month.
Jeffrey Deitch, a longtime New York gallery owner who now directs the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, said that the uptick in collecting in China was not just a fad, but represented a real growing interest in art.
''It's always individuals -- it's not 'the Chinese,' '' he said. ''It's important to understand who you're talking about.''
Indeed, while many liken the latest Chinese wave to the Japanese rush on Impressionist art in the 1980s, others say the Chinese growth is more deep-rooted and lasting.
''Art was part of this whole way of going out and using the economic position of Japan to possess assets from all over the world -- more Picassos, more Monets, more this, more that,'' said Marc Glimcher, the president of the Pace Gallery.
Pace's inaugural show at its Beijing gallery was a group exhibition in which Zhang Huan and Zhang Xiaogang were joined by longtime members of Pace's stable, including Chuck Close and Lucas Samaras.
''It's the same thing whenever you have a catastrophe followed by a boom,'' Mr. Glimcher said. ''The Cultural Revolution was that catastrophe, and this is that boom.''

HEADLINE: U.N. Body Warns of Risks of Global Austerity

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- The global economy faces a decade-long stagnation because governments are pursuing deficit cuts and other austerity measures rather than providing the needed stimulus packages, said a United Nations economic report released Tuesday. 
Instead of new regulation of the financial system to address the problems that helped bring on the recession in 2007-8, governments in the United States and Europe are trying to woo the very speculators who helped cause the problem, said the report by the Geneva-based United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which is known by its acronym, Unctad.
''Those who support fiscal tightening argue that it is indispensable for restoring the confidence of financial markets, which is perceived as key to economic recovery,'' the report said.
''This is despite the almost universal recognition that the crisis was the result of financial market failure in the first place.''
The report criticized the austerity measures as producing results exactly opposite their intended effect.
''Making balanced budgets or low public debt an end in itself,'' the report said, ''can be detrimental to achieving other goals of economic policy, namely high employment and socially acceptable income distribution.''
The report said Western governments should instead be more strictly regulating financial markets, promoting wage increases that will stimulate spending and returning to managed exchange rates and other measures that decrease speculation.
''Domestic consumption remains weak owing to persistently high unemployment and slow or stagnant wage growth,'' said the report.
The report said that the global economy was expected to grow by only 3.1 percent this year, compared with 3.9 percent in 2010, and that developing nations, particularly economically dynamic ones like Brazil, India, South Africa and Turkey, would grow at a far higher rate than the developed Western nations.
''Unemployment depends very much on demand,'' said Heiner Flassbeck, the lead author of the report and the chief of globalization and trade strategies for Unctad.
''If you have no demand, then you need government to step in with a huge program for stimulating the economy,'' Mr. Flassbeck, a former deputy finance minister in Germany, told reporters, according to Reuters.
''This was the U.S. scenario in the past,'' he said. ''Now it's worse because wages are rising less than in the past, so you're going to need a bigger stimulus program.''

HEADLINE: In Euro Zone, Banking Fear Feeds on Itself

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr. and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Remember the collapse of Lehman Brothers? Europeans certainly do.
As Europe struggles to contain its government debt crisis, the greatest fear is that one of the Continent's major banks may fail, setting off a financial panic like the one sparked by Lehman's bankruptcy in September 2008.
European policy makers, determined to avoid such a catastrophe, are prepared to use hundreds of billions of euros of bailout money to prevent any major bank from failing.
But questions continue to mount about the ability of Europe's banks to ride out the crisis, as some are having a harder time securing loans needed for daily operations. 
American financial institutions, seeking to inoculate themselves from the growing risks, are increasingly wary of making new short-term loans in some cases and are pulling back from doing business with their European counterparts -- moves that could exacerbate the funding problems of European banks.
Similar withdrawals, on a much larger scale, forced Lehman into bankruptcy, as banks, hedge funds and others took steps to shield their own interests even though it helped set in motion the broader market crisis.
Turmoil in Europe could quickly spread across the Atlantic because of the intertwined nature of the global financial system. In addition, it could further damage the already struggling economies elsewhere.
''This crisis has the potential to be a lot worse than Lehman Brothers,'' said George Soros, the hedge fund investor, citing the lack of an authoritative pan-European body to handle a banking crisis of this severity. ''That is why the problem is so serious. You need a crisis to create the political will for Europe to create such an authority, but there is still no understanding as to what the authority will do.''
The growing nervousness was reflected in financial markets Tuesday, with stocks in the United States and Europe falling 1 percent and European bank stocks falling 5 percent or more after steep drops in recent weeks.
European bank shares are now at their lowest point since March 2009, when the global banking system was still shaky following Lehman's collapse.
Investors also continued to seek the safety of United States Treasury bonds, as yields on 10-year bonds briefly touched 1.90 percent, the lowest ever, before closing at 1.98 percent.
Adding to the anxiety, several immediate challenges face European officials as they try to calm markets worried about the debt crisis spreading.
In the coming weeks, the 17 countries of the euro currency zone each could agree to a July deal brokered to bail out Greece again and possibly the region's ailing banks. Along with getting unanimity, more immediate obstacles could trip up the agreement.
On Wednesday, Germany's top court upheld the legality of Berlin's rescue packages, but said any future bailouts for debt-stricken euro zone countries must be approved by a parliamentary panel. On Thursday, officials in Finland are to express their conditions for approving the deal, and other countries may follow with their own demands to ensure their loans will be paid back.
Though they have not succeeded in calming the markets, European leaders have taken a series of steps to avert a Lehman-like failure. New credit lines have been opened by the European Central Bank for institutions that need funds, while the proposed Greek bailout would provide loans to countries that need to recapitalize their banks. In addition, the central bank has been buying up bonds from Italy and Spain, among other countries, to keep interest rates from spiking. Many of these have been bought from European banks, effectively allowing them to shed troubled assets for cash.
While the problems in smaller countries like Greece and Ireland are not new, in recent weeks the concerns have spread to banking giants in countries like Germany and France that are crucial to the functioning of the global financial system and are closely linked with their American counterparts. What is more, worries have surfaced about the outlook for Italy, whose debt dwarfs that of other smaller troubled borrowers like Greece.
''It seems like the banking sector globally is being hurt on multiple fronts,'' said Philip Finch, a bank strategist with UBS in London. ''It's definitely getting worse.''
In Europe, the worry is that government bonds owned by European banks could fall sharply in value if economically distressed countries cannot pay back their loans. That would saddle the most exposed banks with huge losses.
As a result, banks are reluctant to lend money to one another and are hoarding cash. ''If sentiment continues to deteriorate, ultimately we'll see a deposit run,'' Mr. Finch said. ''I'm extremely worried about that.''
Mr. Finch said European banks needed to raise at least 150 billion euros in new capital, even if they do not experience large losses on sovereign debt. With stock prices so low, though, that is difficult to do, and any new offerings of company stock would dilute the value of existing shares.
American money market funds, long a reliable financing source for capital starved European banks, have sharply cut back on their exposure -- starting in Spain and Italy but now also France -- making it harder for European banks to loan dollars.
The 10 biggest money market funds in the United States cut their exposure to European banks by a further 9 percent in July, or $30 billion, after a reduction of 20 percent in June, the Institute of International Finance said in a report issued Monday.
''U.S. investors remain very sensitive to the headlines out of Europe,'' said Alex Roever, who tracks short-term credit markets for JPMorgan Chase. ''The sell-off that we've seen in European bank stocks is going to reinforce that and investors are likely to stay hyper-cautious. European banks are not borrowing as much, and they're not borrowing for as long as they could three months ago.''
Nevertheless, American institutions remain vulnerable to problems their French counterparts might encounter. At the end of the second quarter, JPMorgan Chase reported total cross-border exposure of $49 billion to France, while Citigroup had $44 billion and Bank of America had $20 billion.
French banks, which have huge holdings of sovereign debt from countries across Europe, have been among the hardest hit, despite the French government's efforts to protect them. The authorities imposed a temporary ban on short-selling last month after shares in Societe Generale, a bank considered too big to fail, tumbled on rumors it may be insolvent.
But shares of Societe Generale are still sliding amid concern that it, like BNP Paribas and other major French banks, is having trouble raising dollars to finance its American and other dollar-based operations.
Societe Generale officials say that the market's fears are unfounded. The bank's chief executive, Frederic Oudea, has described rumors that Societe Generale was having trouble raising money as ''fantasy.'' The shares closed down 6 percent Tuesday at 18.93 euros. Three months ago the shares were at 40.
What is more, French banks, like other European banks, are able to obtain financing from the European Central Bank if necessary.
Meanwhile, problems in Spain were highlighted on Tuesday when one of Spain's largest savings banks, Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo, reported a startling increase in bad loans to 19 percent of overall lending from 9 percent at the end of last year.
Still, the huge stockpile of euros that banks have stashed away at the European Central Bank at rock-bottom interest rates -- last night it hit a recent high of 166 billion euros -- suggests that no bank is close to a Lehman-like failure.
The risk now is that Europe's resistance to recapitalizing its banks could turn into a broader crisis.
Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels, had a blunt explanation of why European governments have so far refused to recapitalize their banks.
''They don't have the money and they are in the pockets of their bankers,'' Mr. Gros said.
Policy makers in the United States and Britain, where compulsory infusions of new capital played a crucial role in calming the markets in 2008, have long urged Europe to do the same.

HEADLINE: The Whole Truth and Nothing But

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Kishore Mahbubani, a retired Singaporean diplomat, published a provocative essay in The Financial Times on Monday that began like this: ''Dictators are falling. Democracies are failing. A curious coincidence? Or is it, perhaps, a sign that something fundamental has changed in the grain of human history. I believe so. How do dictators survive? They tell lies. Muammar Gaddafi was one of the biggest liars of all time. He claimed that his people loved him. He also controlled the flow of information to his people to prevent any alternative narrative taking hold. Then the simple cellphone enabled people to connect. The truth spread widely to drown out all the lies that the colonel broadcast over the airwaves.
''So why are democracies failing at the same time? The simple answer: democracies have also been telling lies.'' 
Mahbubani noted that ''the eurozone project was created on a big lie'' that countries could have monetary union and fiscal independence -- without pain. Meanwhile, in America, added Mahbubani, now the dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, ''No U.S. leaders dare to tell the truth to the people. All their pronouncements rest on a mythical assumption that 'recovery' is around the corner. Implicitly, they say this is a normal recession. But this is no normal recession. There will be no painless solution. 'Sacrifice' will be needed, and the American people know this. But no American politician dares utter the word 'sacrifice.' Painful truths cannot be told.''
Of course, there is a big difference between America and Libya. We can vote out our liars, unlike certain Arab -- and Asian -- countries. Still, Mahbubani's comparison warrants some reflection this week, which coincides with the 10th anniversary of 9/11 and the president's jobs speech. It is a great week for truth-telling.
Can you remember the last time you felt a national leader looked us in the eye and told us there is no easy solution to our major problems, that we've gotten into this mess by being self-indulgent or ideologically fixated over two decades and that now we need to spend the next five years rolling up our sleeves, possibly accepting a lower living standard and making up for our excesses?
For me, this is the most important thing to say both on the anniversary of 9/11 and on the eve of President Obama's jobs speech. After all, they are intertwined. Why has this been a lost decade? An answer can be found in one simple comparison: How Dwight Eisenhower and his successors used the cold war and how George W. Bush used 9/11. America had to face down the Russians in the cold war. America had to respond to 9/11 and the threat of Al Qaeda. But the critical difference between the two was this: Beginning with Eisenhower and continuing to some degree with every cold war president, we used the cold war and the Russian threat as a reason and motivator to do big, hard things together at home -- to do nation-building in America. We used it to build the interstate highway system, put a man on the moon, push out the boundaries of science, teach new languages, maintain fiscal discipline and, when needed, raise taxes. We won the cold war with collective action.
George W. Bush did the opposite. He used 9/11 as an excuse to lower taxes, to start two wars that -- for the first time in our history -- were not paid for by tax increases, and to create a costly new entitlement in Medicare prescription drugs. Imagine where we'd be today if on the morning of 9/12 Bush had announced (as some of us advocated) a ''Patriot Tax'' of $1 per gallon of gas to pay for education, infrastructure and government research, to help finance our wars and to slash our dependence on Middle East oil. Gasoline in the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, averaged $1.66 a gallon.
But rather than use 9/11 to summon us to nation-building at home, Bush used it as an excuse to party -- to double down on a radical tax-cutting agenda for the rich that not only did not spur rising living standards for most Americans but has now left us with a huge ball and chain around our ankle. And later, rather than asking each of us to contribute something to the war, he outsourced it to one-half of one-percent of the American people. Everyone else -- y'all have fun.
We used the cold war to reach the moon and spawn new industries. We used 9/11 to create better body scanners and more T.S.A. agents. It will be remembered as one of the greatest lost opportunities of any presidency -- ever.
My fervent hope is that on Thursday Mr. Obama will set an example and tell the cold, hard truth -- to parents and kids. I know. Honesty, we are told, is suicidal in politics. But as long as every solution that is hard is off the table, then our slow national decline will remain on the table. The public is ready for more than Michele Bachmann's fairy-dust promise that she can restore $2 a gallon gasoline.
For once, Mr. President, let's start a debate with the truth. Tell us what you really think will be required to get us out of this stagnation, what kind of collective action and shared sacrifice will be needed and why that can lead not just to muddling through, not just to being O.K., but to restoring American greatness.

HEADLINE: Enlisted in the World of Airborne Spying

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
For four years, a doctor commuted between his clinics in Texas in a $5 million turboprop with jazzy metallic stripes and ruby stones embedded on the drink cabinet inside. The plane featured exotic wood veneers and polished chrome, and his daughter's initials were in the tail number.
But after a mysterious buyer snapped up the plane in 2008, it ripped out the fancy appointments, painted it a dull gray and sent it on a more dangerous mission. Unknown to the doctor, his prized King Air 350 had become a spy plane, one of the first of a new military model that is now easing the load on the unmanned drones for the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
For a military that loves to create shiny hardware from scratch, dipping into the used-plane market is a rarity, done only under the most urgent conditions. Remotely piloted drones have been the intelligence stars of the wars, but the Pentagon cannot build them quickly enough to meet the demand.
So the Air Force bought eight used King Airs and equipped them with video cameras and eavesdropping gear as part of a broader effort to supplement the drones with manned aircraft. The Army has also retooled similar planes to track insurgents who plant bombs.
In turning to the King Airs, the Pentagon has appropriated an aircraft that is commonly associated with business executives flying to meetings and wealthy vacationers to weekend ski outings. King Airs have also drawn celebrity pilots like the late actor and comedian Danny Kaye.
The military has used older King Airs to carry V.I.P.'s and conduct other operations in the past. Now, military commanders say the twin-propeller planes, which carry two pilots and two sensor operators, have carved out a niche in working more closely than the unmanned drones with soldiers on hazardous missions.
The crews on the planes, now called MC-12s, are in nearly constant radio contact with convoys and troops in firefights. They can chat more easily with them than the drone crews, which are based in the United States, to position the spy gear and interpret data about enemy movements.
With budget cuts looming, Air Force officials say the rapid fielding of the MC-12s also shows how the military could make greater use of commercial products to reduce costs and contracting delays. In addition to the used planes, the Air Force has fielded 29 new King Airs with the surveillance gear, and the Army would like to buy 36.
''For me, this is a precursor of what we're trying to do across the board,'' said David M. Van Buren, a top Air Force acquisition official, though that could be easier said than done with more complex weapons.
Mr. Van Buren said the Air Force turned to the used planes after Robert M. Gates, then the defense secretary, ordered it to rush more spy planes into the air. Each of the used planes -- some had been owned by law firms and companies -- were outfitted differently.
One had a stereo and high-definition television system. The manufacturer, Hawker Beechcraft, had picked the ruby theme for the doctor's to celebrate the model's 40th anniversary in 2004. And perhaps in a foreshadowing that the plane would eventually be put to a broader use, the words ''Free Enterprise,'' a motto of one of Beechcraft's founders, were emblazoned under the cockpit window.
An Air Force contractor, L-3 Communications, found the eight used planes with the least wear and tear. It then ripped out the plush interiors.
Bubinga wood veneers gave way to computer stations for the surveillance specialists and miles of wiring for three communications networks at different secrecy levels. A camera ball was hung from the belly, and 16 antennas were added.
Meanwhile, the Air Force gave a no-bid contract to Hawker Beechcraft to build 29 extended-range planes at $7.5 million apiece, the average discounted price for commercial customers. An L-3 plant in Texas then worked around the clock to install the spy gear, which cost $13 million a plane.
At least eight corporate plane buyers let the military slip ahead of them in the production schedule. Several more slots opened as the recession forced others to cancel orders. Terry Harrell, a Hawker vice president, said Hawker had risked $35 million to $40 million of its own money to start building the planes before the contract was signed.
''It's been a nice little case study in industry and the Air Force working together to get something done quickly, and at low cost, in a very pragmatic fashion,'' he said.
The first of the converted planes began flying in Iraq in June 2009. It was soon joined by the other used ones, most of which are still flying there.
The planes are popular with many troops, because while armed drones offer protection and can conduct longer stakeouts of enemy compounds, their operators and analysts are half a world away, and they communicate as much through computer chat rooms as by radio. The MC-12s, which are unarmed but have more radio links, tend to be in closer touch with the commanders on the ground.
''If you've got a convoy that you know is going into harm's way, you're going to need a lot of interaction with those ground forces, and generally the MC-12 is going to be the one you'd pick for that,'' said Maj. Gen. James O. Poss, a top Air Force intelligence official.
The Army wants to update its King Airs, and a Senate committee recently suggested that the Air Force could instead transfer its MC-12s to the Army to keep from having too many of the planes when the wars end. But both the Air Force and the Army say the planes could be useful in other hot spots and are resisting the suggestion.
Hawker Beechcraft and L-3 see an export market for the planes, and other contractors are also pitching civilian planes as spycraft. Lockheed Martin has taken a wet bar out of a used Gulfstream III business jet and turned the plane into a laboratory for such conversions. The former owner? The Jack Daniels liquor distillery.

HEADLINE: On Her Stoop for Summer's Last Caress, Until Gunfire Erupts on Violent Weekend

BYLINE: By AL BAKER and TIM STELLOH; Toby Lyles contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Denise Gay had lived her entire life in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and most everyone on the block seemed to know the woman, just as she knew them.
On Monday night, she sat on her stoop on Park Place, west of the elevated tracks for the Franklin Avenue subway shuttle. She waved to passers-by, enjoying what remained of Labor Day but mindful of the violence that sometimes accompanied the West Indian Day Parade, which had just concluded nearby.
But her block was about to witness another act of sudden mayhem, like those that had marred not only the parade and the celebratory night that preceded it, known as J'Ouvert, but also the Labor Day weekend in general, citywide. 
Police data shows that 52 shootings from Friday through Monday claimed 67 victims around the city, resulting in 13 deaths, in a spike of gunplay that has alarmed the Bloomberg administration even though the number of citywide shootings this year, through Sunday, is down 2 percent compared with the same period in 2010.
The police have tied three of the shootings and five victims to the West Indian Day Parade, and say the tally could have been higher had officers not seized 14 illegal guns and arrested 16 people during J'Ouvert.
The parade, however, was unrelated to the gunfire on Park Place, an unusually designed street where black iron fencing separates the sunken roadway from extra-wide sidewalks.
Two doors down from Ms. Gay's home lived Leroy Webster, of 637 Park Place, an ex-convict with a list of arrests dating back at least 15 years. Farther down the street, on the other side of the tracks, lived Eusi Johnson, an ex-convict who was recently indicted on a federal weapons charge.
For reasons that are still not entirely clear, Mr. Webster, 32, fatally shot Mr. Johnson, 29, in the neck after a dispute, and was then critically wounded in a gunfight with eight officers, the police said. The officers fired 73 bullets at Mr. Webster.
When the gunfire ended, Ms. Gay, 56, was dead from a single bullet to her head, slumped over in her daughter's lap on her stoop.
The police said that Ms. Gay's daughter and two others told them they believed it was a slug from Mr. Webster's semiautomatic handgun that hit her. A ballistics analysis had yet to conclude where the bullet came from.
Whoever fired the fatal shot, people close to Ms. Gay said it was not her time to die.
''She shouldn't have gone out this way,'' said a cousin of hers, who would identify herself only as Victoria. ''Out of all the ways to go -- not this way.''
Her relatives recalled Ms. Gay in glowing terms, as a retired home health aide whose approaching birthday would prompt a joyous family celebration. The annual parade, which passed each year along Eastern Parkway, a few blocks south, had come to be a source of fear for Ms. Gay, they said, because of the level of violence they said residents had come to associate with it. Still, summer had reached its unofficial end, and Ms. Gay opted to spend the last of it sitting outside.
''She was well known on this block,'' said Ms. Gay's cousin Victoria. ''You could say her name and people know exactly who she is, what she stood for.''
''She was an awesome person,'' she added, ''with an awesome spirit.''
Whatever the perception of the parade -- and however many headlines it has garnered over the years for associated shootings, crime or death -- a spokeswoman for its organizing entity labeled any attempt to blame the parade for the violence as ''unfair, so unfair.''
The spokeswoman, Jean P. Alexander of the West Indian American Day Carnival Association, said that while she and her colleagues had not independently corroborated the police accounts of violence along the route, along Eastern Parkway between Schenectady Avenue and Grand Army Plaza, any violence in the neighborhood ''is not something that we take lightly.''
She said that the organization has begun ''putting ideas down'' to help stem gun violence, and that it would bring its ideas to local churches and to elected officials, including the mayor's office and the police.
''If this is going to happen, it is going to happen to my child, to my neighbor's child,'' said Ms. Alexander, who noted that the parade, which drew more than two million spectators, helps stimulate the city's economy. ''The parade has to be safe.''
Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said the police analysis of the weekend was not confined to the parade. ''We're looking at anything that may have contributed to the shootings,'' he said. ''And we're certainly concerned with the hours before the parade, when we confiscated 14 illegal guns.''
He said charges against Mr. Webster were pending.
As for Mr. Johnson, the whole fracas with Mr. Webster seemed a misunderstanding, according to Mr. Johnson's sister, Nicole Nicholson. Her account hewed closely to the police's: that a friendly slap fight he was having with a cousin in front of Mr. Webster's residence was misunderstood and Mr. Webster intervened.
Mr. Johnson and his cousin went back to Mr. Webster's home to try to make peace, Mr. Browne said. Instead, Mr. Webster responded by going into his apartment and emerging with a gun, firing in Mr. Johnson's direction, the police said. Mr. Johnson was found dead by the elevated tracks, a bracelet around his ankle, put there by federal authorities to monitor his whereabouts.
It was not immediately clear if his roaming along Park Place would have set off an alert regarding his movements. But, as Mr. Browne said, ''he didn't go too far.''

HEADLINE: The Melting Pot Just Got a Whole Lot Richer

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
AS business-news alerts warn of credit downgrades, jobless recoveries and double-dip recessions, New York City is witnessing a surprisingly robust invasion of new restaurants from abroad, and it seems to have everything to do with Frank Sinatra.
Consider Rita Alexandrian, navigating on a recent afternoon through the din of construction in the future Al Mayass, her $2 million restaurant opening in October at 24 East 21st Street in Manhattan. Since she happens to be a proprietor of a bustling 15-year-old Armenian-accented restaurant of the same name on Wadih Naim Street in Beirut, just why was she there, exactly?
''It's like the Frank Sinatra song,'' she said. ''If you can do it in New York, you can do it anywhere.''
Well, O.K., those weren't the exact lyrics, but she expressed the core concept. So did Niall Howard, the chief executive of Hakkasan in London, as he held forth on his flamboyant new $5 million outpost in an 11,000-square-foot space at 311 West 43rd Street that will open this winter. 
''There certainly is an element of truth to the Frank Sinatra song,'' he said. ''If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.''
These are but two of at least a dozen imports in a city that is unexpectedly abundant with new foreign restaurateurs. Beyond Al Mayass and Hakkasan, the restaurants include La Mar Cebicheria, from Peru; Romera, Spain; Aamanns, Denmark; Fratelli la Bufala, Naples; Jung Sik, South Korea; and Cafe Pushkin, Moscow.
They want to be a part of it, as the crooner sang, at a time when the city's dining scene is still rebalancing, three years after the great economic implosion. The financial picture offers another explanation for the city's sudden appeal to overseas restaurateurs, one that is somewhat less romantic than the Sinatra song.
''Thanks to the sinking dollar, building in Manhattan with a foreign currency suddenly looks cheap,'' said Michael Whiteman, an international restaurant consultant who heads Baum & Whiteman.
Unquestionably, New York has always been a global dining destination, a simmering ethnic-menu melting pot, and international forays have often succeeded in the past, as with the infiltration of Joel Robuchon, Le Relais de Venise L'Entrecote, Bice and Eataly.
Yet there have been foreign flops. Among the shuttered have been the sophisticated Lenotre from Paris in the 1970s, the art-deco Altri Tempi from Italy in the 1980s, and the stylish Eldorado Petit from Barcelona in the 1990s. Restaurants' trademarks don't always have the value of clothing-and-accessory labels like Louis Vuitton and Gucci. Even marquee chefs like Alain Ducasse and Gordon Ramsay have found that Manhattan's natives did not always greet them as liberators.
And so, ''you have to be confident before you go there, because New Yorkers are known for being good food critics,'' Mr. Howard said of the sort-of-Cantonese 240-seat Hakkasan, which plans to offer the metropolitan citizenry ''food theater, a coming together of all the senses in an atmosphere of unique tastes, smells, architecture and music.''
His customers, he said, are ''global residents, people who don't necessarily live in one country anymore.''
He added, ''Our guests like to have a Hakkasan where they go,'' in Miami, Abu Dhabi and Mumbai. ''So we want to go where they go.''
Similarly, Andrei Dellos said that the customers at his over-the-top Cafe Pushkin in Moscow (who, he said, have included Bill Clinton, Condoleezza Rice and Angelina Jolie) kept asking ''one and the same question: Why didn't we launch in the U.S.A.?''
It took a year for Mr. Dellos to find an 8,000-square-foot space to open Cafe Pushkin at 41 West 57th Street; his multimillion-dollar, high-end brasserie is to open in December. Thanks to the recession, ''we managed to get the locations we could hardly find before.''
In Moscow, the dramatic restaurant inhabits a mansion near the Pushkin statue and attracts a business and political elite to $400 meals served by a staff in czarist servant garb. Cafe Pushkin ''is a time machine summoning 19th-century Moscow and its food,'' said Leslie Siben, the real estate broker who placed the multilevel, 150-seat restaurant across the street from Nobu 57.
But in a nod to time and place, the New York decor will be more modern, Mr. Dellos said, and have more of a brasserie feel than the hauteur of the Moscow original.
Some of the newbies are poetic in praising the city.
''New York is a starting point for anything new in science, culture, art and literature,'' said Miguel Sanchez Romera, a 57-year-old chef and clinical neurologist. He closed his Michelin-starred restaurant, L'Esguard, near Barcelona to open the $5 million Romera New York in mid-to-late September at the Dream Downtown Hotel at 355 West 16th Street. ''New York is transcendent,'' he said, ''and I hope our cuisine will be transcendent as well.''
The doctor said he calls his avant-garde cooking ''neurogastronomy'' because ''eating is the first medicine.'' His 46-seat restaurant will offer a set 11-course tasting menu, including toro and hamachi tuna, foie gras, domestic Wagyu and truffles, for $245.
Also a subscriber to Gotham gee-whiz is Lorenzo Aragona, the president of the United States division of Fratelli la Bufala, a Naples-based chain of 160 restaurants that focus on buffalo, both mozzarella and meat, and pizza, with a selection of Neapolitan dishes. It has populated Italy, Madrid, Istanbul, Dubai and Miami. (A Washington, D.C., franchise satellite closed after a few months two years ago.) ''We are here because New York is the center of the world, the most incredible place,'' he said of the 70-seat Fratelli beachhead that will have its debut in November on Broadway at West 76th Street.
Other arrivals see New York as the gateway for their culture to the world.
''In New York, we are trying to build a brand name for Peruvian food,'' said Gaston Acurio, the 43-year-old owner of La Mar Cebicheria Peruana, to open later this month at 11 Madison Avenue, where Tabla once reigned. Mr. Acurio, a global entrepreneur, already has 30 restaurants in 12 countries, focusing on sustainable wild fish and shellfish, a Peruvian cornucopia of complex, assembled ceviches, subtle flavors and surprises like potatoes with quail egg, crab and avocado puree.
''Success in New York could open us to other cities far from our country,'' he said. ''Our mission is to use restaurants to promote what we are, and how we are.''
In accord with Mr. Acurio is Adam Aamann-Christensen, chef and owner of Aamanns in Copenhagen, which in Manhattan will be called Aamanns/Copenhagen. ''I feel that a New York branch can be a better advocate for Danish and Nordic quality food than anywhere else,'' he said.
His 35-seat cafe is scheduled to open in October at 13 Laight Street, and will have a changing menu of smorrebrod, traditionally made Danish open-faced sandwiches.
Other foreign restaurateurs have a more subversive mission: to teach New Yorkers a thing or two about authentic cuisine. ''I visited every Greek restaurant in New York,'' said Maria Loi, an assertive Greek restaurateur, consultant and cookbook author, who is opening Loi Restaurant in late September at 208 West 70th Street. ''There are a few good places, but it all has to be more authentic.''
Most newcomers eschew wowing locals with gaudy new concepts, but wait: there is the eclat of Dans le Noir, fresh from London and Paris. In November it will offer blackout dining in the former Andrews Coffee Shop at 246 West 38th Street, where visually impaired waiters will guide customers to prix-fixe dining in the dark.
To many restaurateurs, New York ''has become an international gold standard, because if you put a restaurant here, you've established a flagship,'' said Steve Zagor, director of management programs at the Institute of Culinary Education in Manhattan. ''So if you make it here, you can make it anywhere.'' Yes, Sinatra. Again.
Another plus for international immigrants is that ''you can source any food you need here, and there is a terrific talent pool here, so you have all the labor you need,'' Mr. Zagor said.
Also not to be overlooked is ''the concentration of media in New York that gives restaurants instant attention,'' said Andrew Rigie, executive vice president of the Greater New York City Chapters of the New York State Restaurant Association.
But the dangers to foreign interlopers are ''that they may not be savvy in the ways of New York,'' Mr. Zagor said, ''and may not know how to keep costs down, and may not understand local eating habits. New Yorkers want to move rapidly.''
Luckily for the greenhorns, he added, ''the first market for many foreign restaurants in New York is the people traveling from those countries to New York, because the city is such a crossroads.''
There is also an abundance of customers from the city's indigenous communities. For example, Ms. Alexandrian estimated that 100,000 Armenians live in the greater New York area, at least a few of whom will presumably occupy some of the 125 seats at Al Mayass. ''Of course, we are hoping for Armenians to come, but we can't bet only on them,'' she said. ''New York is a cosmopolitan city and will be open to us.''
Some of the incoming foreigners say their arrival is a testament to the live pulse of the city's restaurant scene in post-recession New York. Dr. Romera, for instance, does not believe his high-price prix fixe will be untenable. ''There are New York restaurants more expensive than we are,'' he said.
Mr. Acurio, too, thinks his menu is priced to sell. ''We think we will do very well, because we are not expensive -- a $65 check average, with wine,'' he said.
Nevertheless, Malcolm M. Knapp, who heads a New York restaurant consulting firm that bears his name, was less sanguine. Diners ''will be more likely to be very careful with their expenditures, since the natural tendency in such times is to just hunker down.''
And if the credit-rating downgrade affects tourism, said Mr. Rigie of the restaurant association, ''we may see less business at restaurants that attract foreign visitors.''
The aftermath of the credit kerfuffle has been especially unsettling ''because there was a time when everyone said that next year would be difficult, but if we do this and that, and change our price point, and do this deal and that deal, it will all be better,'' said Rick Camac, managing partner of the Fatty Group of restaurants. ''But this continual economic pummeling is making everyone weary now.''
It seems certain that if the new culinary migrants can survive, the city will make them its own. ''In New York, it doesn't matter where you came from,'' said Alex von Bidder, an owner of the Four Seasons restaurant, ''since once you make it here, you're a New Yorker.''
Yikes. Sinatra again. Well, then, what might the golden-voiced one think about the future of these foreign interlopers?
It's up to you, New York, New York.

HEADLINE: Longtime Liberal Advocate to Lead Generic Drug Group

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
Ralph G. Neas, a longtime advocate for liberal causes and the face of some of the biggest Supreme Court nomination fights in recent decades, has been named the new chief executive of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, a Washington-based industry group representing generic drug makers and suppliers. 
Mr. Neas, 65, who begins his new position next Monday, described the generic industry in an interview as a rare success story in the nation's quest to contain its health care costs.
Mr. Neas described his new role as making sure policy makers and the public were better aware of the industry's achievements, arguing that the industry has saved Americans hundreds of billions of dollars in the last decade.
''I'm anxious to tell that story,'' he said.
Mr. Neas, who is perhaps best known for leading the successful fight against President Reagan's nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court, has had a long history of championing civil rights.
In addition to serving as the executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights for more than a dozen years, he has served as president and chief executive for People for The American Way until a few years ago.
About two years ago, Mr. Neas became the chief executive of the National Coalition on Health Care, a group with broad support from business, unions and others. Mr. Neas said he planned to represent the generic drug makers in the efforts of a alliance that was recently formed by the coalition that is meant to address the nation's high health care costs.
Containing the rising cost of medical care is essential to the sustainability of the nation's health care system and the overall economy, Mr. Neas said. ''It's a national security issue,'' he said.
In his new role, Mr. Neas said the association would continue its work in making sure people have access to less expensive generic alternatives for more of the medicines they take, including biologic drugs that are made from living cells. Those drugs are often extremely expensive and have been largely spared competition from the generic makers.
''It's just beginning with respect to the biologics,'' said Mr. Neas.
Mr. Neas succeeds Kathleen Jaeger, who left the association last year.

 BODY:
THE GREAT A&P AND THE STRUGGLE FOR SMALL BUSINESS IN AMERICA
By Marc Levinson
Illustrated. 358 pages. Hill & Wang. $27.95.
In his great poem ''Next Day'' Randall Jarrell describes a woman in an American supermarket moving in the detergent aisle from ''Cheer to Joy, from Joy to All.'' The woman thinks to herself:
Wisdom, said William James,
Is learning what to overlook. And I am wise 
If that is wisdom.
The reader who picks up ''The Great A&P,'' a new history of that supermarket chain by Marc Levinson, will try -- and dismally fail -- to overlook the fact that its author is not a producer of fresh sentences in the English language. This book is as sterile and bland and hard as a Florida tomato in February. No juice will dribble down your chin.
But Mr. Levinson is an omnivorous researcher, and the story he brings to the table is one that more Americans should be familiar with. The rise and fall of A&P is worth attending to, and not merely because its well-stocked stores inspired John Updike to compose one of our literature's best short stories.
During the first decades of the 20th century, A&P's stores replicated so virally and offered goods so cheaply that they put thousands of mom and pop stores out of business, presaging more recent debates about Wal-Mart's oozing retail dominance. Between 1922 and 1925 A&P opened roughly seven new stores every day. By the 1940s it operated at nearly 16,000 locations. This dominance scared people.
''I would rather have thieves and gangsters,'' the populist Huey Long declared in the 1930s, ''than chain stores in Louisiana.''
A&P's story is worth understanding, too, because the chain upended the way Americans ate and the way we continue to eat. A&P transformed, as Mr. Levinson puts it, ''the humble, archaic grocery trade into a modern industry.''
From the vantage point of a 2011-era food snob, A&P's influence can appear to have been dire. The chain tossed family farms aside like so much compost. It never met a preservative, a homogenization process or a prepackaged product it didn't like. It embraced new technology -- tin cans, cellophane wrap, freezers -- that embalmed the makings of our meals. Buy fresh, buy local? Not at the A&P.
Yet Mr. Levinson, whose previous books include ''The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger,'' speaks up for A&P and its legacy. He points out that supermarkets and the industrialization of food allowed less wealthy households to show ''startling improvements in the quality of their diets.'' Because many A&Ps were in urban areas, they were especially important to African-Americans, who faced steep prices at independent stores.
Supermarkets improved women's lives, freeing them from having to trudge from butcher to baker to farm stand to put a family meal on the table. Mr. Levinson zeroes in on what convenience and lower prices meant to women, and notes how, as he puts it, ''the consumer movement arose from the long campaign for woman suffrage.''
The story of A&P is really the story of two childless brothers, George and John Hartford, who transformed their father's small grocery chain into a many-tentacled, vertically integrated business that became, in the 1920s, the first in America to sell $1 billion of merchandise in a year.
Like Flatt and Scruggs, they complemented each other. George was a conservative man, devoted to routine; he wore somber suits, left his house in New Jersey at exactly 9:05 a.m. each morning and resembled, one journalist said, ''a retired Polish general.''
John was a dapper man who lived at the Plaza Hotel, married three times and often appeared in the society pages. Neither brother went to college or even finished high school. Yet they were among the 20th century's most accomplished and visionary businessmen.
In its earliest incarnation, in the mid-19th century, the company that would become the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company and later simply A&P sold leather hides and then also tea in New York City. By 1880 its 150 or so stores were ''elaborate temples of tea and coffee,'' the author writes, with an Asian theme, some with a cockatoo, the company's early mascot, on a perch.
''Each store,'' Mr. Levinson writes, ''had a large red T, lit with gas jets, hanging over the sidewalk.''
The company passed into the hands of the Hartford brothers' father, and then into their own. Opening more modest stores quickly, they took advantage of economies of scale and drove prices down, making money on sheer brute volume.
''We went so fast that hobos hopping off the trains got hired as managers,'' John Hartford later used to say. Mr. Levinson's book is filled with small, interesting eddies and set pieces. He notes how Richard M. Nixon and Lady Bird Johnson grew up in grocers' families; he observes the introduction of S&H green stamps; he explains how unsanitary and unscrupulous many early food purveyors could be.
''Lemon extract often contained no lemon,'' he writes. ''Bottled soft drinks used coal tar, a carcinogen, as a colorant.''
He is good on A&P's meticulous market research. ''Philadelphians, it found, liked their butter lightly salted, with a light straw color, whereas New Englanders preferred more salt and a deeper yellow coloration.'' Count me with the New Englanders.
A&P became, arguably, too good at what it did. Franklin D. Roosevelt's Justice Department pressed criminal charges against A&P for undercutting its competitors, and won. Harry Truman tried to break the company into pieces.
Mr. Levinson mostly argues against A&P's detractors. He writes, ''In A&P's view, its aggressive efforts to cut purchasing costs, narrow its own margins and reduce consumer prices in order to build business were exactly what a company was supposed to do in a competitive economy.''
But in the view of prosecutors, ''A&P's behavior amounted to illegal restraint of trade.'' The author admires the brothers and the fact that they treated their employees well, and his ultimate take is this: ''The Hartfords' real crime was to have endangered mom and pop.''
A&P went downhill after the Hartford brothers died, John in 1951 and then George in 1957. The chain failed to open enough stores in booming states like California; it refused for many years to stock nonfood items like toothpaste; its store brands, like Eight O'Clock Coffee, grew dowdy; its stores tended to be in withering urban neighborhoods. The brand's name lost its glossy sheen.
''The whole store was like a pinball machine,'' Updike wrote in ''A&P,'' his famous story from 1961. The A&P promised abundance, bright colors, modernity, Cheer, Joy and All. For a long time it delivered.

HEADLINE: Growth and Debt Concerns Weigh Down Bank Shares

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; David Jolly and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Bank stocks took a big hit on Tuesday as concerns about the debt crisis in Europe and global economic growth propelled financial markets downward.
Analysts said that Wall Street's drop was also a carryover from last week's disappointing report on United States unemployment and from news that major American banks were facing a federal lawsuit related to their handling of mortgage securities.
While stocks slumped in early trading by about 3 percent, they curbed losses toward the end of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks was down 0.9 percent, or 100.96 points, to 11,139.30. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.7 percent, or 8.73 points, to 1,165.24, The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3 percent, or 6.50 points, to 2,473.83. 
Investors stayed with the security of fixed-income instruments. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 3/32, to 101 9/32. The yield fell to 1.98 percent from 1.99 percent late Friday.
''The whole market is under pressure because of what is going on in Europe,'' said Jason Arnold, a financial analyst with RBC Capital Markets.
The equity losses were reminiscent of those on Friday, when the Labor Department reported zero job growth in the United States economy in August. In addition, the market reacted to reports of impending legal action by federal regulators against 17 financial institutions that sold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac nearly $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that later soured. Investors fled financial shares, and on Tuesday the sector continued to be hit hard, closing 1.7 percent lower.
Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase each declined more than 3 percent. Bank of America fell to $6.99 and Chase to $33.44. Citigroup fell 2.5 percent to $27.70. Morgan Stanley was down nearly 4 percent at $15.33
Bank stocks, which are particularly sensitive to prospects for lending and housing, are seen as being at additional risk because of regulatory and legal issues after the lawsuits were filed on Friday. ''There really has not been particularly good news in the financial space for a while,'' Mr. Arnold said. ''It is just waning optimism for financials.''
But most of the focus in the markets has been on the lack of progress in solving persistent euro zone debt problems, which ''is creating a pocket of selling with no buyers,'' said Alan B. Lancz, the president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates. In addition, investors are concerned about the impact on global growth of weak economic data.
The market turmoil of recent weeks showed no signs of letting up. On Tuesday, gold rose to another nominal high, and Swiss authorities took action to weaken the franc, which has soared because of its role as a haven.
In the United States, economic data was scrutinized for any sign of strength in the country's recovery. The Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that the services sector of the economy expanded in August, the 21st consecutive month it has done so, as reflected in the 53.3 reading of the I.S.M. nonmanufacturing index, although expansion in some sectors, like business activity, was slowing down.
The survey exceeded forecasts assembled by Bloomberg News that pointed to a reading of 51. A reading of 50 is meant to be the dividing line between an expanding economy and a contracting one.
Debt concerns related to the euro zone, particularly over Greece and Italy; the bank lawsuits in the United States; and worries about economic growth were the biggest factors damping prices, Michael A. Mullaney, vice president of the Fiduciary Trust Company, and other analysts said.
''Friday set the tone with the employment report,'' Mr. Mullaney said. ''We are basically hard struck to find out where the growth engines are going to come from.''
The conditions were worryingly similar to those of the sell-off that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, Deutsche Bank's chief executive, Josef Ackermann, said Monday.
In Zurich, the Swiss National Bank said it was setting a minimum value of 1.20 francs per euro and was prepared to spend an ''unlimited'' amount to defend it. The central bank was acting to help the country's exporters, who fear being priced out of foreign markets by the strong franc.
Asian and European markets were lower. Gold futures eased slightly to $1,869.90 an ounce after rising more than 1 percent to more than $1,900 an ounce in Comex trading.

HEADLINE: In Slow Economy, Service Sector Showed Growth in August

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Service companies, which account for about 86 percent of the nation's jobs, expanded at a slightly faster rate in August. But the sector remains too weak to help an economy that is barely growing and struggling to create jobs. 
The Institute for Supply Management, a private trade group, said Tuesday that its index for service companies rose to 53.3 in August from 52.7 in July. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.
The service sector includes businesses like restaurants, hotels, health care companies and financial service companies. It has grown in all but one month over the last two years. The index reached a five-year high of 59.7 in February.
Still, the rate of growth among service businesses has declined in four of the last six months. High gas prices and scant wage gains have left consumers with less money to spend on services.
The private trade group said its gauge of hiring for service companies fell last month to an 11-month low. That reflected Friday's grim government report that showed that the economy added no net jobs in August.
''While the modest August bounce in the I.S.M. index for services is good news, it does not change the overall picture of an economy that is slowly unwinding and losing momentum,'' said Brian A. Bethune, an economics professor at Amherst College.
Retail and wholesale trade, transportation services and hotels all showed strength in August, according to the report. Educational service companies, recreation and entertainment firms, and health care, finance and insurance businesses all reported declines.
Last week, I.S.M. said its manufacturing index fell in August to 50.6, barely above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from growth.
The nation's economy expanded in the first six months of the year at an annual rate of just 0.7 percent -- the slowest growth since the recession officially ended two years ago.
Since then, consumer and business confidence have been hurt by a spate of bad economic news: lawmakers in Washington fought over raising the federal borrowing limit, Standard & Poor's downgraded its rating on long-term United States debt, the debt crisis in Europe worsened and the stock market tumbled in late July and early August. The Dow is nearly 14 percent lower than its close on July 21.
President Obama will offer a plan to increase job growth during an address to a joint session of Congress on Thursday.
Still, the president is unlikely to win support for any stimulus spending from Congressional Republicans, who say the president's economic policies have failed. They say they want further spending cuts and less government regulation.
The economy needs to add 250,000 jobs a month to make a major dent in the unemployment rate, which has been above 9 percent in all but two months since May 2009.
Many economists believe that the economy will grow only 2 percent in the second half of this year, far below the pace needed to generate significant job gains.

HEADLINE: Carlyle Files To Go Public In Next Year

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED; Peter Lattman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
8:48 p.m. Updated
The Carlyle Group took its biggest step Tuesday toward joining an elite club: private equity giants with public stock tickers. But as the stock and debt markets whipsaw, the timing of an initial public offering remains unclear.
Still, the filing propels Carlyle along the path already trod by several of its biggest rivals, including the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. And it marks the latest step in the evolution of the firm, from a private equity shop with deep ties to political figures to a $153 billion investment titan with hedge fund and real estate arms. 
Stocks of private equity firms, to be sure, have generally fared poorly. Blackstone, which priced at $31 in 2007, began tumbling soon after the firm's offering. They closed on Tuesday at $12.50. And Apollo Global Management, which gained a public ticker in April after having traded on a private exchange, closed on Tuesday at $12.19 - well below its $19 initial offering price.
Despite filing for an initial offering on another volatile day in the stock market, Carlyle is not expected to plunge into unfavorable market conditions, having waited years to go public. But it is currently considering going public by the end of the first quarter in 2012, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly.
Once known for its investments in military contracting, Carlyle has since participated in dozens of big name takeovers, including those of Dunkin' Brands and Hertz.
The firm has gone on an acquisition spree over the last year to diversify its business beyond its core private equity funds and make itself more attractive to its investors and public shareholders. Among those deals were taking majority stakes in two big hedge funds and in a European fund of funds.
Carlyle, founded in 1987 in Washington, had made little secret of its desire to go public. As far back as 2007, David M. Rubenstein, one of the firm's co-founders, described it as ''a natural candidate to go public.''
Tuesday's filing, like many initial prospectuses, discloses relatively little about Carlyle's initial offering plans. Its disclosed fund-raising intention, $100 million, is a preliminary figure meant only to calculate the filing fee. And the voluminous document lacks juicy details like the firm's valuation or the compensation of its top executives.
Still, Carlyle opened its books to the public a little, showing how yet another private equity firm had bounced back from the lows of the financial crisis. Last year, the firm reported $2.8 billion in revenue and $1.5 billion in net income, both significantly higher than 2009.
Using economic net income, a nonstandard accounting measure preferred by Blackstone and K.K.R., Carlyle earned just over $1 billion.
By comparison, Blackstone reported $3.1 billion in revenue and $485.5 million in economic net income last year.
Carlyle showed even more improvement during the first six months of this year, reporting nearly $2.1 billion in revenue and $770.2 million in economic net income for the period.
Its revenue from management fees has grown 16 percent thanks to several fund acquisitions, while its performance fees have jumped 971 percent because the value of its investments has improved.
Yet it is not clear whether Carlyle can sustain those gains, as the stock and credit markets come under stress from concern about weakening economic growth. Borrowing costs have been rising in recent weeks, threatening to erode the ability of private equity firms to strike lucrative leveraged buyouts.
Carlyle also confirmed that changes to its management structure that reflect its shift from a private partnership to a publicly traded company. Its three co-founders will remain at the top: Daniel A. D'Aniello will become the firm's chairman, while William E. Conway Jr. and Mr. Rubenstein will be co-chief executives. (Together, the three are known inside the firm as ''D.B.D.'')
Many in the buyout industry see the firm's initial public offering as a way for Carlyle executives to cash out on their holdings eventually, as Blackstone co-founder Peter G. Peterson did in his shop's 2007 I.P.O. That could eventually allow the co-founders to pass the firm's reins onto a new generation of leaders, which includes Glenn Youngkin, Carlyle's chief operating officer.
But initially, major equity holders, including the co-founders and outside investors, will be subject to lock-up agreements. Mubadala, an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government that took a 7.5 percent stake in Carlyle in 2007 and invested an additional $500 million last year, can begin selling down its holdings in stages after a year. Another is the giant California pension fund Calpers, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which took a 5.5 percent stake in 2001.

HEADLINE: With Financing Still Rare, New York Developments Start to Rebound

BYLINE: By JOTHAM SEDERSTROM

 BODY:
When the development firm Hines began exploring plans for a state-of-the-art, ground-up office tower overlooking Bryant Park in April 2009, the notion seemed far-fetched at best, given the economic mood.
After all, Lehman Brothers had collapsed seven months earlier and Bernard L. Madoff had just pleaded guilty to federal felony charges in his vast financial Ponzi scheme. By the end of 2009, construction had frozen at development sites all across Manhattan. 
But in the nearly 30 months since those discussions, Hines's plan to build a 28-story, glass-and-stainless steel tower at 1045 Avenue of the Americas has withstood many of the obstacles that have thwarted other real estate developers.
''In no point in the last 30 years across all the cycle changes have we ever not been active,'' said Tommy Craig, a senior vice president and head of Hines's regional office in New York. ''Resilience is one of the defining virtues of our firm.''
With a search for equity partners and a marketing campaign set to begin this week, the 450,000-square-foot building is one of two Manhattan projects now in the works for Hines. The other, a 72-story mixed-use building at 53 West 53rd Street, is set to rise adjacent to the Museum of Modern Art once an equity source is chosen. The project, designed by Jean Nouvel, was scaled down recently from its original height of 82 stories.
To make way for 1045 Avenue of the Americas, Hines and its partner, Pacolet Milliken Enterprises, had to first raze the white marble building on the site that, since 1954, has been owned by Milliken to house its textile company.
As demolition continued during 2009, the architectural firm Pei Cobb Freed & Partners went to work on a modern hourglass-shaped structure that drew on Bryant Park as a compass. With a 46-foot-wide stainless steel canopy aimed directly at the southwest corner of that park, the tower will serve as something of a gateway to the eight-acre public space.
''It has protected views because of the park,'' Mr. Craig said. ''That's the thing that most New Yorkers value the most. It's something not only residents value but that commercial users value, too.''
With plans for 10-foot-high ceilings on most floors (two penthouse floors will have 11-foot ceilings), terraces at the 10th floor and expansive trading floorplates, the building would be well suited for financial services tenants, brokers marketing the tower say. But as a side-core building without columns, it will also be heavily marketed to law firms that prefer windowed offices.
And brokers say the tower's relatively small size could allow smaller firms to grab the coveted status of anchor tenant -- and with it, perhaps, naming rights.
''In New York, it's always hard to find a building where a 200,000-square-foot tenant could move in and the building could be named for them and it would give them a high-profile presence in Manhattan,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, the chief executive of CB Richard Ellis's regional office, who has been assigned to market the building alongside Howard Fiddle, Benjamin Friedland and Evan Haskell. She added that asking rents at the building would hover above $100 a square foot.
''Typically, to be able to do something like that, you have to be half-a-million square feet or greater,'' she said.
While construction is not expected to begin at 1045 Avenue of the Americas until early next year, it remains one of a small handful of city projects able to qualify for coveted construction loans. Even so, approximately 1.5 million square feet of office construction was completed last year across New York City's five boroughs, up from just 350,000 feet in 2009, according to data provided by Cushman & Wakefield. As of January, an estimated 5.6 million square feet of construction was under way.
Besides 1 World Trade Center and 4 World Trade Center -- probably the best known of the pending projects -- construction has begun or is expected to begin at 250 West 55th Street; 51 Astor Place; Hudson Yards; Brookfield's Manhattan West; and 20 Times Square, among several others.
''It's primarily been a financing issue,'' said Ben Thypin, the director of market analysis at the research company Real Capital Analytics. ''There could have been developers who wanted to build, but they couldn't find a bank or lender to write them a large enough construction loan at the time. A lot of it also has to do with whether they have a tenant or not.''
Among active real estate developers, the Extell Development Company may be one of the busiest. In Manhattan, the company is juggling some two million square feet of ground-up construction at three sites, most significantly the International Gem Tower, a 750,000-square-foot office building intended to be a new hub for Manhattan's diamond and precious stone dealers at 44 West 47th Street. Construction is expected to be finished late next year at the 34-story building in Times Square.
For Gary Barnett, the president of Extell, who predicted that more new construction would begin as underwriting became less conservative, the choice to move ahead with those projects was the only rational decision for his firm.
''We really didn't have a choice in the matter. We had to build,'' Mr. Barnett said, adding that construction had been moving forward despite what he described as extremely conservative underwriting. ''It's what we do. It's what we've done.''

HEADLINE: 4 Die, Including Gunman, In Attack at Nevada IHOP

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT; Jesse McKinley contributed reporting from San Francisco.

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- A man armed with an AK-47 assault rifle opened fire Tuesday morning on a group of uniformed National Guard members as they ate breakfast at an IHOP restaurant in Carson City, Nev. He hit all five Guard members, killing three of them, and killed another woman and wounded five other people before taking his own life.
The gunman, identified by the police as Eduardo Sencion, 32, began his five-minute shooting rampage around 9 a.m. as people flocked to the restaurant for the breakfast rush. 
The Carson City sheriff, Ken Furlong, said the authorities had not yet established a motive. However, he said it appeared that Mr. Sencion did seek out the National Guard members, at least once he was inside the restaurant. Five of the 11 people shot were in uniform, and one of the wounded civilians was caught in the line of fire between Mr. Sencion and the Guardsmen.
''It appears as though his gunfire was primarily focused on those military members,'' Sheriff Furlong said. ''We do not know whether or not the gunman was aware that there were National Guardsmen in the restaurant, but it appears as though he did. He had to travel through the entire restaurant to get to the back where the Guardsmen were having breakfast.''
Mr. Sencion's family has indicated that he had a history of mental illness, according to the Carson City Sheriff's Department. However, Mr. Secion did not have any prior criminal history, nor did he have any known affiliation with the military or with anyone inside the restaurant. But he shot every one of the Guard members inside.
The sheriff's department said Mr. Sencion entered the IHOP and began firing just before 9 a.m., eventually moving his rampage outside to the restaurant's parking lot, where he shot himself. Victims lay both inside and outside the restaurant in the wake of the shooting. Two Guardsmen and one civilian were pronounced dead at the scene, while six others were transported to nearby hospitals. A third member of the National Guard died after surgery.
Mr. Sencion, a Carson City resident, was also transported to a hospital, where he later died.
Mr. Sencion filed for bankruptcy in 2009, when he was living in nearby Stateline, a rough-around-the-edges casino town on the California border.
Ralph Swagler, the owner of a nearby barbecue restaurant, told The A.P. that he saw the gunman pull up outside the restaurant, where he first shot a man on a motorcycle and then headed inside.
''I wish I had shot at him, but he was going in the IHOP,'' Mr. Swagler said. ''But when he came at me -- when somebody is pointing an automatic weapon at you, you can't believe the firepower, the kind of rounds coming out of that weapon.''
The shootings shocked a city just emerging from a long holiday weekend, when many locals and tourists flocked to nearby Lake Tahoe. Carson City has less of the glitz -- and grime -- associated with Las Vegas or Reno, which is 25 miles to the north. It has steadily grown over the years, but it is still sleepier than Reno, which was hit hard by the recession's impact on construction and casino spending.
It was a much different scene Tuesday. Paramedics and law enforcement and fire officials responded within minutes, blocking off the city's main drag while they secured the area and sent victims to the hospital by ground ambulance and helicopter.
The State Capitol and Supreme Court buildings were briefly locked down as the authorities feared more violence. But Mr. Freer said the shooting appeared to be an isolated incident.
Fran Hunter, who works at a nearby pet store, watched the aftermath of the shooting from a casino parking lot across the street, where people had gathered to observe the commotion.
She said others who gathered in the parking lot said the gunman had sprayed bullets into other nearby businesses, breaking windows, before shooting a man on a motorcycle and entering the IHOP, though she did not see it herself.
''It wasn't a pretty scene,'' she said. ''Everyone and their mother's uncle was down there. I didn't see any bodies, thankfully. But it is frightening.''

HEADLINE: Families Feel Sharp Edge of State Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
LANSING, Mich. -- Stretched beyond their limits and searching for new corners of their budgets to find spending cuts, states are now trimming benefits for residents who are in grim financial shape themselves.
Some states, including Florida and Missouri, have decided to shrink the duration of state unemployment benefits paid to laid-off workers, while others, including Arizona and California, are creating new restrictions on cash aid for low-income residents.
Here in Michigan, more than 11,000 families received letters last week notifying them that in October they will lose the cash assistance they have been provided for years. Next year, people who lose their jobs here will receive fewer weeks of state unemployment benefits, and those making little enough to qualify for the state's earned income tax credit will see a far smaller benefit from it.
Some political leaders see these sorts of cuts as unfortunate necessities to help bridge their state's financial gaps. Others see them as overdue limits on out-of-control government handouts -- some lawmakers here fumed, for example, that 30,000 college students, newly dropped from the state's food stamp rolls, should never have been allowed to collect such benefits in the first place. 
Whatever the motive, such policy changes come as the downturn has left a growing number of low-income families in worse financial trouble.
The percentage of children living in poverty rose during the last decade, particularly once the recession hit and unemployment soared.
By 2009, about 2.4 million more children's families lived below the poverty line than in 2000, an increase of 18 percent, according to a recent analysis of Census Bureau data by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a child advocacy group. In states like this, where Republicans took control of the capital this year, the new cuts have helped resolve Michigan's expected budget gap, once estimated at $1.4 billion.
''Michigan can no longer afford to provide lifetime assistance,'' said Sheryl Thompson, an official with the state Department of Human Services, which reported that of those being dropped from the state's cash-assistance rolls, some 1,200 families had been receiving payments for 10 years, more than 700 others for a dozen years, and an additional 400 families had been getting payments for 14 years.
The pattern of new cuts around the nation leads some advocates to fear that the number of low-income families will only grow in the next few years if programs they can lean on shrink or vanish.
''We're O.K. unless something -- anything at all -- goes wrong,'' said Rachel Haifley, who lives here in Lansing and said she works part-time making a little less than $9 an hour and receives child support for her two young sons, 1 and 3.
Ms. Haifley said she has become an expert at seeking out giveaways, thrift shops and bargains -- for clothes, portable cribs, toys for the boys. ''All I want is for them to feel like everyone else,'' she said. ''I don't want them to grow up and ask me why they're poor.''
In Dearborn Heights, Celia Kane-Fecay, another mother of two, said she has given up on the job hunt for now and returned to college -- with help from $597 a month in cash assistance, Medicaid and any other aid she can track down with what she has come to describe unhappily as her daily list of begging phone calls. ''You don't ever want to be here,'' she said.
Signs of new poverty are already evident. A project by the Annie E. Casey Foundation Kids Count Data Book found that by 2010, nearly 11 percent of the nation's children, or 7.8 million children, had at least one parent who was unemployed, when only about half as many were in such circumstances in 2007. And since four years ago, the study found, at least 5.3 million children have been affected by home foreclosures.
Meanwhile, around the nation, lawmakers have weighed new limits to tax credits for low-income people; in Michigan, a proposal to throw out the earned income tax credit entirely was dropped, but lawmakers shrank the benefit -- to an average of $138 a year for a Michigan family, advocates say, from $432 last year.
Six states have approved reductions in the length of state unemployment benefits. The notion appalls people like Jeananne Bishop, who has been desperately searching for a job since July 2010 and found herself washing her hair with laundry detergent at one point because she could not afford shampoo.
Ms. Bishop said her continuing benefits -- now part of a federally financed extension -- are the only thing keeping her afloat. Michigan's shortened unemployment benefit limits will apply starting next year, but Ms. Bishop, 56, of Benton Harbor, seemed skeptical that much will have changed in the job market for them, cautioning, ''No one calls back.''
And while at least three states, including Michigan, shortened the period during which poor residents can receive cash assistance, other states began enforcing stricter limits already on the books.
''We clearly recognize that states have huge deficits they're dealing with, but all of these things add up in certain states to very little safety net protection for children,'' said Patrick McCarthy, president of the Annie E. Casey Foundation.
In Michigan -- where 23 percent of children were living in poverty by 2009 (compared with 14 percent in 2000) and with an unemployment rate, at 10.9 percent, worse than the nation's -- state leaders defended their changes.
Sara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican in his first term, said his efforts had focused on creating an economic climate in the state for more and better jobs, while also protecting and even enhancing core safety-net services like Medicaid, she said.
Ms. Wurfel added that the state had, for instance, hired hundreds of new child welfare workers. And as part of their decision to cut state unemployment benefits next year, Michigan lawmakers had accepted a federal extension of benefits this year for residents.
''In this state, we are losing hard-working families and taxpayers and gaining people who were moving here for our entitlement programs,'' said Ken Horn, a Republican state representative who introduced a bill setting strict limits on cash assistance to those who have had it at least four years. That bill was signed into law on Tuesday, even as state officials were newly carrying out five-year lifetime federal limits on such assistance, which in Michigan averages $415 a month for an eligible family.
''The bill is designed with the simple idea that there should be a safety net but it should not be a lifestyle,'' Mr. Horn added. ''As we looked at it, it turned out to be part of the budget solution.''
Republicans said that even the cuts to those who have been on cash assistance the longest allow some exceptions (for those with disabilities, for instance), and that the rest will get special attention from social workers.
But Fred Durhal Jr., a Democratic state representative from one of Michigan's poorest regions, said that will not be enough. He has begun calling Oct. 1 -- the start of cuts to cash aid -- doomsday.
''Sometimes you've got what's fiscally sound, and you've got what is morally and ethically the right thing to do,'' Mr. Durhal said. ''Those don't always jell well together. You can't take grandmas away and put them on the street, and you can't take milk from babies.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Won't Fight Proxy Ruling

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced late Tuesday that it would not dispute a recent court ruling that struck down one of the agency's new rules for corporate America. 
In July, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the S.E.C.'s so-called proxy access rule, which would have made it easier for shareholders to oust company directors and install their own candidates for the board. The rule stemmed from the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory overhaul enacted after the credit crisis.
The ruling by a three-judge panel dealt a stinging blow to the agency, which is charged with writing nearly 100 new rules under Dodd-Frank. The decision has exposed the law to multiple other challenges, offering a path for Wall Street trade groups to chip away at the new law.
The ruling in the proxy case, filed by the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, was the latest major defeat for the S.E.C.
Altogether, the appeals court has tossed out three S.E.C. regulations in the last six years, including the proxy rule. In each case, the court rebuked the agency for not fully evaluating a rule's economic effects.

HEADLINE: Paper Makers in Merger Deal After Suitor Increases Offer

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and JEFFREY CANE

 BODY:
7:41 p.m. Updated
After a standoff that has lasted for months, International Paper announced on Tuesday that it had reached a agreement to acquire Temple-Inland with an increased offer of $3.7 billion. 
International Paper, the world's biggest paper and forest products company, clinched the deal after raising its offer by 5 percent, to $32 a share in cash from $30.60 in cash.
Timothy S. Nicholls, International Paper's chief financial officer, said in an interview that the two companies began talking last week about a potential sale. Discussions quickly escalated, and the two sides concluded negotiations this weekend.
''We had finally reached a point where we were able to hold talks,'' he said.
The speed of the turnabout took some by surprise. A drawn-out takeover battle had appeared to be in the cards after International Paper announced an unsolicited bid on June 6.
Temple-Inland's board spurned the offer and quickly adopted a shareholders' rights plan, or poison pill, while International Paper took its offer directly to Temple-Inland's shareholders.
Analysts at Citigroup said that while they expected the two companies to come to terms eventually, ''we didn't expect it to happen until late'' in the fourth quarter or early first quarter.
The deal came together even as two clouds emerged over Temple-Inland, a maker of corrugated packaging. Last month, the company acknowledged that a paper mill in Bogalusa, La., had discharged chemicals into the Pearl River, killing a large number of fish.
Days later, Temple-Inland was accused in a lawsuit of helping cause the failure of a Texas bank it had owned before spinning it off in 2007.
In a conference call on Tuesday, John Faraci, the chief executive of International Paper, said the company did due diligence on both issues and ''made accommodations for those in our valuation.''
International Paper said it would also assume $600 million of Temple-Inland's debt as part of the deal.
Mr. Nicholls emphasized that even at the higher $32-a-share price, the deal promised millions of dollars in cost savings. Much of those are expected to come from combining the two companies' supply chains and mill operations. He added that International Paper expects layoffs as well, though he said that the company had not decided on a precise figure.
With the economy relatively stagnant, he added, it made sense to gain scale by meshing the two together.
''We recognize that we're in a slow-growth period,'' he said. ''But combining these two businesses makes a lot of sense.''
International Paper has said that it has committed financing from one of its financial advisers, UBS. It is also receiving advice from Evercore Partners and the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton.
Temple-Inland is being advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Prohibition on Dumping Sewage From Boats Is Being Extended to All of Long Island Sound

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Boats will be prohibited from dumping sewage in New York State waters in Long Island Sound under a ban announced on Tuesday by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The new ban, covering 760 square miles, makes the entire Sound a no-discharge zone; Connecticut secured the same designation for its portion of the Sound in 2007. 
The ban, which goes into effect on Thursday, will require an estimated 12,200 recreational and small commercial vessels to dispose of their sewage, mainly human waste, treated or not, at government-run or privately operated pump-out stations along the coast.
Storm-water runoff and releases from wastewater-treatment plants remain a far larger source of pollution in Long Island Sound than waste from boats, federal officials noted. Still, treated sewage from the boats contains chemicals like formaldehyde and chlorine that harm marine life and pose health risks to swimmers, they said.
''A lot of the sewage is discharged close to where people swim,'' the E.P.A.'s regional administrator, Judith A. Enck, said, adding that the ban was ''long overdue.''
Government officials and environmentalists described the move as a meaningful step to improve water quality in the Sound, a 110-mile-long estuary between densely populated Long Island and Connecticut. New York officials had already restricted discharges in areas with high boat traffic, encompassing about 50 square miles, and had been awaiting the creation of more pump-out stations before petitioning for the federal action.
''It's an important part of an overall strategy,'' said Peter A. Scully, regional director for Long Island for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.
The ban coincides with plans for more coordinated actions by Connecticut and New York to reduce nitrogen pollution in the Sound -- mostly from sewage treatment plants and agricultural runoff -- which stimulates the growth of bacteria and algae and robs the water of oxygen.
Considerable progress has been made since a conservation and management plan for the Sound was developed in 1994, Mr. Scully said, with nitrogen levels down by more than 40 percent. Dolphins returned to Long Island Sound a few years ago.
The new ban, federal officials said, extends to open waters, harbors, bays and navigable tributaries of the Sound and a portion of the East River -- the area between the Hell Gate Bridge connecting Queens to Randalls and Wards Islands in Manhattan in the west and the northern bounds of Block Island Sound in the east.
Chris Squeri, executive director of the New York Marine Trades Association, which represents marine businesses, said convenient access to pump-out stations had been a crucial issue for boaters, who face $250 fines for violations. New York State says there are 68 such stations, and the E.P.A. deemed that number adequate before approving the ban.
''If they say they have ample facilities in the area, I assume they do,'' Mr. Squeri said. ''We swim and fish in these waters, so we want to keep the water quality good.''
Adrienne Esposito, executive director of the environmental group Citizens Campaign for the Environment, said the boat restrictions would help maintain momentum for efforts to upgrade antiquated sewage treatment plants and control storm-water runoff.
The ban ''means cleaner beaches, more edible seafood and a healthier economy by keeping this bacteria out of the water,'' she said.

Adrienne Esposito, executive director of the environmental group Citizens Campaign for the Environment, said the boat restrictions would help maintain momentum for efforts to upgrade antiquated sewage treatment plants and control storm-water runoff.
The ban ''means cleaner beaches, more edible seafood and a healthier economy by keeping this bacteria out of the water,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Nominee to Head Consumer Bureau Says He Will Streamline Regulations

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The nominee to lead the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau told a Senate committee on Tuesday that he would make it a priority ''to streamline and cut back'' a mountain of regulations that has grown up over the last 30 years, which he said excessively burdened some banks and discourages them from lending money to consumers.
The nominee, Richard Cordray, who is currently the bureau's head of enforcement, also told the Senate Banking Committee that if confirmed, he would use the agency's ''bigger and more flexible toolbox'' to police consumer financial laws and would make judicious use of ''needlessly acrimonious'' lawsuits to enforce financial regulations. 
With those statements and others, Mr. Cordray sought to reassure the committee that he, and the bureau, would be accountable to Congress, despite the significant doubts expressed by Republicans and lobbying groups, including the Chamber of Commerce, that the bureau has too much unfettered power.
But committee Republicans were not buying it. They repeated their assertions, made since the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law establishing the bureau was signed last July, that it and its director would wield unchecked authority over banks and other financial institutions.
''Unless the bureau is reformed,'' said Senator Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican who is the committee's ranking minority member, ''it is only a matter of time before this concentration of power is abused or misused to the detriment of American consumers and the economy.''
Mr. Shelby and 43 other Republican senators have vowed not to allow a vote on a nominee for director unless the Obama administration agrees to changes in the bureau's structure. In a letter to Mr. Obama in May, the senators called for a board of directors to replace the position of director, for subjecting the bureau to the Congressional appropriations process, and for putting in place guarantees that enforcement of consumer regulations will not interfere with the financial health of banks.
Senator Robert Corker, Republican of Tennessee, assailed committee Democrats for ''spewing'' what he said were ''half truths, mistruths, untruths'' about the effort to build the consumer agency. ''Almost all of this would go away if the administration would just sit down and put the appropriate checks and balances in place,'' including making it easier to override regulations approved by the bureau, Mr. Corker said.
Such regulations can be overturned by a two-thirds vote of the 10-member Financial Stability Oversight Council, which includes the directors of most federal banking and financial regulatory agencies. But Mr. Shelby and other Republicans have argued that that was too high a hurdle and meant that council's authority rarely be invoked.
Mr. Cordray acknowledged that it was a high hurdle, but one that should not need to be invoked. ''We are required by law to communicate and consult with our fellow banking agencies,'' he said. ''I would hope and expect that concerns that they have about our work and concerns we may have about their work are things we will discuss regularly, that we will work those issues out when we do have disagreements, as I'm sure will occur from time to time, and that it never be necessary to actually invoke some sort of super process to override our rules.''
Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York cited the bureau's independence as its strength, both in enforcing laws and in streamlining financial disclosures so that consumers could better understand the banking products they were buying. Other banking regulators had ignored their responsibilities in those matters, he said.
Mr. Cordray said some regulation of small banks had been overdone, and he promised to roll back unnecessary rules. As the push for disclosure gained ground in the last 30 years, disclosures became ''so long and confusing that they didn't really help consumers, but they certainly posed burdens on lenders,'' Mr. Cordray said. ''There's an opportunity to streamline that and cut that back. That's something that will be a priority for me if I am director of this bureau.''
Democrats on the panel defended the agency against what they said were Republican efforts to weaken it. The agency ''was born out of the failure by prudential regulators to hold financial companies accountable for complying with consumer protection laws,'' said Senator Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat who is chairman of the Banking Committee.

HEADLINE: On Air, Ex-Governor Fulfills a Dream

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
He came in to the strains of Sinatra singing ''New York, New York,'' yielded for traffic updates and plugged Sleepy's mattresses.
Yes, on Tuesday, former Gov. David A. Paterson made his debut as an afternoon drive-time radio host, on WOR-AM (710).
''I am more excited right now, sitting here, than I was even the day I was sworn in as governor of the State of New York on March 17, 2008,'' Mr. Paterson told listeners. ''And the reason is, this time I had time to think about it.'' 
Since leaving office at the end of 2010, Mr. Paterson has been a frequent radio guest and guest host, and has made no secret of his desire to get his own show. His first guest? None other than his predecessor as governor, Eliot Spitzer, whose resignation led to Governor Paterson's swearing-in. Mr. Paterson had been Mr. Spitzer's lieutenant governor.
''You're going to be Jerry Seinfeld and Dan Rather, all put together in one,'' Mr. Spitzer said, encouragingly.
Then, prompted by Mr. Paterson, Mr. Spitzer threw himself into a whirlwind analysis of the stock market's volatility and the economic outlook, the kind of insightful but dry disquisition that may have contributed to the demise of Mr. Spitzer's own short-lived talk show on CNN.
When the brief chat was over, Mr. Paterson told Mr. Spitzer, ''I finally got a job that you didn't have to give me.''
''There's lots of things I could say,'' Mr. Spitzer responded, ''but we're on live radio.''
Mr. Paterson's debut show was certainly more substantive than typical AM radio fare. In addition to Mr. Spitzer on the markets, it featured a loose debate between the two candidates to replace Anthony D. Weiner in the Ninth Congressional District and an interview with William J. Bratton, a former New York police commissioner, on recent crime problems in the city and in London.
Among the politicians who called in to wish Mr. Paterson well were Representative Charles B. Rangel, State Senator Malcolm A. Smith and Assemblyman Francisco P. Moya, all Democrats and longtime acquaintances.
Mr. Paterson's approach on the air - as it was during his rocky tenure in office - was largely unscripted. Hosting the two Congressional candidates - Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Democrat, and Bob Turner, a Republican - he encouraged them to ask each other questions and tried not to get in the way.
After his talk with Mr. Rangel, he joked with a listener about how the interview went: ''He was on so many subjects, I felt like I was trying to stop a train, but it kept jumping on different tracks!''
He also appeared to take a couple of swipes at President Obama, whose administration pressured Mr. Paterson not to seek election to a full term last year. Speaking to Mr. Spitzer, Mr. Paterson said the president ''seems to stay on the message of hope rather than the implementation of policy.'' He also said of the president's forthcoming jobs speech, ''Is this maybe too little, and maybe even too late?''
The show was not all broccoli. There was a fair amount of Mets banter, and lamentations from Mr. Paterson, a long-suffering Met fan, who interviewed Met first baseman Nick Evans.
Mr. Paterson made a few gaffes, but he employed his most enduring political asset: his wit. After he repeatedly referred to the Ninth Congressional District as the Eighth District, he told the two candidates: ''The loser can represent the Eighth.''
As for the Mets, Mr. Paterson, who is legally blind, joked: ''Sometimes I don't see the game as well as everyone else, and it's just the better for it.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: How to Bring the Jobs Back: Not More of the Same

BYLINE: By JOHN B. TAYLOR. 
JOHN B. TAYLOR, an economics professor at Stanford and the Treasury under secretary for international affairs in 2001-5

 BODY:
WHEN he introduced Alan B. Krueger, his new economic adviser, in the Rose Garden last week, President Obama offered a few hints about his new economic plan. So far it sounds much like the old plan, which is too bad because that plan didn't work very well. 
One part of the new plan, the president said, is to ''put more money in the pockets'' of people. That was tried in the 2009 stimulus, when the federal government borrowed money and gave it to people in the form of one-time payments or temporary refundable tax credits. The temporary transfers created little or no increase in aggregate consumption or, in turn, in jobs.
Another part of the new plan would ''put construction crews to work rebuilding our nation's roads and railways and airports.'' That too was tried in the 2009 stimulus. My colleague John F. Cogan and I found that state and local governments put most of the money in their coffers. The federal government also undertook its own construction programs, but, with few shovel-ready projects, it could only increase infrastructure spending by an immaterial 0.05 percent of G.D.P.
In my estimation, those interventions and most others -- cash for clunkers, the first-time homebuyers' tax credit, quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve and the sharp increase in federal spending -- have not only been ineffective but have also lowered investment and consumption demand by increasing concern about the federal debt, another financial crisis and threats of inflation or deflation. Most businesses have plenty of cash to invest and create jobs. They're sitting on it because of those concerns.
Rather than more of such temporary interventions, the American economy needs a new comprehensive economic strategy. A natural starting place is the debt-limit cum spending-control agreement reached this summer. It reduces projected increases in spending over 10 years by $2.1 trillion to $2.4 trillion. The agreement reduces spending growth in a very gradual way, which is appropriate in a weak economy.
But it does not fully deal with the debt and the deficit problem, which is why it needs to be embedded in a broader economic strategy with the goal of closing the rest of the budget gap through pro-growth reforms.
There are of course sharp differences of opinion about the reforms needed to achieve that goal. The biggest differences of opinion will probably have to be hammered out in the 2012 election. Entitlement reform, tax reform, regulatory reform, monetary reform -- indeed, the fundamental role of government in the economy -- should be part of that debate, but with a clear commitment to America's living within its means.
That strategy will take us toward a more stable and predictable economic policy with less uncertainty about the future. It will thereby increase both demand and supply and cause the economy to grow and create jobs again.

HEADLINE: A Campaign Challenge: Defining Obama

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- President Obama may have escaped the burden of a Democratic primary challenger. Yet the battle to define him is rapidly escalating -- not only by Republicans competing to run against him, but also within his own team inside the White House.
A Republican presidential debate on Wednesday, followed by the president's economic address to Congress on Thursday, offers a window into the dueling efforts to provide voters a view of Mr. Obama and his record at a time when polling shows that he is increasingly vulnerable politically and that Americans feel the country is careering down the wrong track.
The White House is in the midst of rebranding the president as a pragmatic problem solver prepared to set aside ideology to address a compelling need (see last week's concession on ozone regulations), a reasonable man in an era dominated by extreme views. But they also emphasize that he is willing to draw distinctions with conservatives, reflecting a central tension that has defined him as a candidate and as president: that in trying to lay claim to a broad swath of the electorate, as he succeeded in doing in 2008, he risks pleasing neither the center nor the left, the story of much of his time in office. 
The Republican candidates, collectively and in distinctive ways, continue to cast him as the foil against whom they ran so successfully in 2010: a big-government liberal who has expanded regulations, created uncertainty for business and failed to revive the economy, with millions more Americans out of work than when he took office. They portray him as an unsteady leader who is unequipped to turn around a country in economic crisis.
The outcome of the presidential race over the next 14 months could well hinge to a large degree on which side prevails in the minds of moderate and independent voters.
While the president will not directly confront the Republican nominee until well into next year, his advisers believe that the next three months are critical to improving his standing and reversing his downward trajectory. He is frustrated -- particularly at Republicans on Capitol Hill, but also at some of his own aides, according to people who have spoken to him recently -- that he has been unable to rise above the morass of Washington and recapture the spirit that helped him win election.
The frustration has led to internal divisions among some advisers over the scope of his economic address to a joint session of Congress on Thursday night. The president intends to offer at least some progressive proposals to help regain a fighting posture that he has not had since the health care debate, but a provision is also being discussed to place a new moratorium on some regulations that affect the economy, excluding health care and financial rules. The proposals are likely to infuriate an already unhappy Democratic base.
''He's erred on the side of trying to reason with unreasonable people, which seems to be the wrong strategy,'' said Andy Stern, the former president of the Service Employees International Union, who has advised the White House and is a senior fellow at Georgetown University. ''There is not a clear understanding in most people's minds of what is his philosophy. In Republicans there is a clear understanding.''
Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, said she ''felt great disappointment'' with the president's decision last week to abandon new air pollution rules, but added that she was heartened by his pledge to protect the Clean Air Act. She wants to see him revive the ''fighting spirit that I know he has.''
Mr. Obama stands at a precarious moment of his term. Public pessimism is at its highest point in nearly three years, and his approval rating has fallen to its lowest, according to the latest Washington Post-ABC News Poll, which also found that more than 60 percent of those surveyed disapprove of how he is handling the economy and jobs.
The White House can no longer take comfort in comparing the approval ratings for Mr. Obama with Ronald Reagan's or Bill Clinton's in the months after their stinging midterm election defeats. By the time their re-election efforts were intensifying after Labor Day, their respective repositioning had helped elevate their approval above 50 percent.
But the mood of the American public is so dour toward Washington -- Congressional Republicans fare even worse than the president -- it remains an open question whether Mr. Obama can present a job-creation agenda that can break through among voters. For that matter, it is not clear that the conservative argument against Mr. Obama's leadership will be enough for the nation to turn the White House over to a Republican.
''If this is just a referendum on economic conditions, then any incumbent is going to struggle with that, but it's not just that. It's a contest about what to do about it,'' said David Axelrod, the chief strategist to the president's re-election campaign. ''I'd be more worried if I saw some compelling new argument for how to lead the country, but these guys are carrying the same old water.''
The Republican candidates are increasingly trying to introduce themselves to primary voters through a sharp critique of Mr. Obama's performance on the economy. The Republican argument will be amplified on Wednesday night during a televised debate in California at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
On the eve of the debate, Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, presented a 59-point economic plan during a speech at a trucking company in Nevada. He proposed a ''Reagan economic zone,'' which would seek to open trade with countries that agreed to offer greater protections to intellectual property.
When Gov. Rick Perry of Texas promotes his job-creation record in Texas, he starts off with a direct criticism of the Obama administration, telling an audience last weekend in New Hampshire: ''He's lost more than a million jobs while he's been president. I've created a million jobs since I've been the governor.''
The president's advisers, and occasionally the president himself, are paying increasing attention to the comments from the leading Republican candidates. An aide said Mr. Obama would not be watching the debate on Wednesday evening, but rather would be preparing to have the last word -- for this week, at least -- the next night in the Capitol.

HEADLINE: Romney Lays Out Plan to Revive Economy, With an Emphasis on Cutting Taxes

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- Mitt Romney unveiled his plan to rejuvenate the American economy here Tuesday, offering a detailed outline that includes repealing President Obama's health care law, cutting the corporate tax rate, placing sanctions on China as a currency manipulator and immediately reducing taxes on savings and investment by the middle class -- and promised to push many of these policies on his first day in the Oval Office.
With his business background, Mr. Romney has portrayed himself as the presidential candidate best prepared to steer the nation at this time of economic distress, and his economic plan is a classic Republican blueprint that relies on tax cuts and reduced regulation -- not stimulus -- to jump-start the economy.
Standing in front of a large banner that read ''Day One, Job One,'' Mr. Romney detailed the 10 actions he would take the first day of his presidency. Five are executive orders, and the other five are pieces of legislation, including the tax changes, he would send to Congress and request action on within 30 days. 
''The right course for America is to believe in growth,'' Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, said at the McCandless International Trucks dealership here. ''Growing our economy is the way to get people to work and to balance our national budget.''
In the plan, whose stated goal is to ''restore America to the path of robust economic growth necessary to create jobs,'' he promised to immediately cut the corporate income tax rate, currently topping out at 35 percent, to 25 percent. Although he did not outline any specific proposals for closing loopholes or otherwise simplifying the tax code, he also promised to make permanent the tax cuts on individuals enacted under President George W. Bush and to eliminate taxes on dividends, interest and capital gains for anyone making less than $200,000 a year.
In an effort to stimulate American exports, Mr. Romney said he would push free-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea as well as officially place sanctions on China for keeping its currency artificially low, a move that makes Chinese imports cheap to American consumers and has led to trade imbalances.
Mr. Romney also vowed to make it easier for American companies to drill for oil in the United States and to cut federal discretionary spending on anything other than security measures by 5 percent -- or $20 billion. He said he would consolidate government training programs and order that any new regulations add no new costs to the economy.
Mr. Romney's speech came the day before a Republican debate -- which will be the first time Mr. Romney will share the stage with Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, whom polls show as leading the pack of presidential hopefuls -- and just two days before Mr. Obama is scheduled to deliver his own jobs plan to a joint session of Congress.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Romney has focused on his business background and two decades in the private sector, and his plan is a stark rebuke of Mr. Obama's economic leadership, criticizing a broad range of policies including restrictions on domestic energy production and the regulatory reach of the government.
Earlier this year in Michigan, Mr. Romney used PowerPoint to outline his own health care plan, but he gave Tuesday's proposals extemporaneously in what he dubbed a ''conversation'' -- though his campaign did hand out a 160-page policy book filled with graphs, charts and proposals. The plan, they emphasized, was geared toward long-term solutions, not short-term fixes.
As he spoke, Mr. Romney held up his iPhone to make an analogy about the changing world. ''President Obama's strategy is a pay-phone strategy,'' he said, ''and we're a smartphone world.'' Likening Mr. Obama to a man jamming quarters into a pay phone and not understanding why it is not working, he added, ''It's not connected anymore, Mr. President.''
Though the Romney plan offers some standard Republican principles, like reducing corporate and individual tax rates and repealing the president's health care and financial legislation, aides said Mr. Romney's distinctive stamp could be seen on the proposal for a ''Reagan Economic Zone,'' which would open up trade with countries that agreed to offer greater protections to intellectual property, as well as for those placing sanctions on China and consolidating federal training programs and giving states authority to design and carry out training programs for unemployed workers.
In a Web video released Tuesday, one of Mr. Romney's opponents, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former Utah governor, sharply criticized Mr. Romney's record for job creation, calling it ''one of the saddest records'' and ''sadly similar to that of Obama's.'' The Democratic National Committee also criticized Mr. Romney on the economy in an e-mail to reporters Tuesday morning, saying, ''He has been following on the issue all year instead of leading.''
Economists who reviewed Mr. Romney's economic plan had different reactions. Steve Blitz, a senior economist for ITG Investment Research, said he doubted that cutting tax rates would stimulate much job creation.
''I think you can go through the history of the U.S. economy and find that tax rates really aren't the paramount reason why people do things or why the economy expands or contracts,'' Mr. Blitz said.
Other economists questioned the wisdom of placing sanctions on China, an important trade partner and the United States' largest government lender.
''I don't think that's the most constructive approach,'' said Michael Spence, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and the author of ''The Next Convergence: The Future of Economic Growth in a Multispeed World.''
Mr. Spence said both the United States and China needed to figure out how to better align their interests and work cooperatively rather than antagonistically.
''China would like nothing more than for us to miraculously recover,'' Mr. Spence said. ''That would be the best thing for their economy.''
With House Republicans singling out regulations as ''job killing,'' Mr. Romney promised to ''cut out any regulation that would ''unduly burden the economy or job creation.''
Mr. Romney made his name as a turnaround expert in private equity at Bain Capital, and he frequently promotes those years at campaign events. But while some of the companies he helped start or fix resulted in job growth, others ended in job losses and the firing of employees, a fact that dogged Mr. Romney when he unsuccessfully tried to defeat Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts in 1994.
On Tuesday, Mr. Romney also announced his economic policy team. Its leader will be R. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of the Columbia Business School and former chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, who wrote a foreword to the economic policy book Mr. Romney released Tuesday.
The group also includes N. Gregory Mankiw, who also headed Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers and is now an economics professor at Harvard; former Senator Jim Talent, Republican of Missouri, who now is a Heritage Foundation fellow; and former Representative Vin Weber, Republican of Minnesota, who was a co-chairman of former Gov. Tim Pawlenty's presidential campaign this year.

HONG KONG OFFICIALS RESIGN
OVER FALSE DEATH REPORT
Two months after Asia Television, a broadcaster based in Hong Kong, carried an apparently false report that the former Chinese president Jiang Zemin had died, two of the broadcaster's top news executives have taken responsibility for the report and resigned. The Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority has said that it is investigating 41 complaints about the report. Page A9

The former head of the armed forces in Serbia was convicted of crimes against humanity and war crimes by an international tribunal at The Hague. The former official, Momcilo Perisic, was charged in connection with attacks on civilians by soldiers under his command in Bosnia and Croatia, including in the cities of Sarajevo and Srebrenica, and was sentenced to 27 years in prison.

PROTEST OVER AUSTERITY PLAN
Thousands of workers took to the streets in Italy in a general strike to protest a package of ever-changing austerity measures, adding to tensions in a crucial week for the future of the euro. The strike placed pressure on the Italian government, which last month proposed the austerity package of 45.5 billion euros, or about $64 billion, in exchange for the European Central Bank buying Italian debt.

MIAMI CHIEF'S SUSPENSION
COULD END IN DISMISSAL
Miami's police chief, Miguel A. Exposito, whose nearly two-year tenure has been marked by numerous clashes with the mayor and a series of police shootings of unarmed African-American men, was suspended from his job in a move that could be the prelude to his dismissal. The fate of the chief now rests with the Miami City Commission. Page A16
SUPPORTERS DONATE FOR PERRY
A new Super PAC with close ties to Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is laying plans to spend as much as $55 million to help him win the Republican presidential nomination, a sign that outside groups are likely to play a pivotal role in the party's selection of its candidate. The group, Make Us Great Again, was formed by a group of Texas political operatives and major Perry donors. Page A22

HOUSE REPUBLICANS DIVIDED
OVER TYING RELIEF TO CUTS
As Congress prepares to tackle the issue of providing aid to areas ravaged by Tropical Storm Irene, a rift has opened among House Republicans over the federal government's role in providing disaster relief. Some Republicans have suggested that any aid the government distributes must be offset by an equal amount in spending cuts. Page A26

HEADLINE: Race Tighter Than Expected, Democrats Aim to Bolster Candidate for Weiner Seat

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
Democratic Party officials, concerned about an unexpectedly tight special election for Congress in Brooklyn and Queens, are rallying to support their party's nominee and prevent the embarrassment of losing a seat in a traditionally Democratic district.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the state's leading Democrat, said on Tuesday that polls suggested a ''tough race'' for the Democrat, Assemblyman David I. Weprin, but he expressed confidence that Mr. Weprin would prevail. ''My people are talking to his campaign about the best way for me to be helpful,'' Mr. Cuomo said.
The Sept. 13 election, in which Mr. Weprin will face a Republican, Bob Turner, will determine a replacement for Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat who resigned amid a scandal. The race is viewed as something of a bellwether, as Mr. Turner has tried to make the contest a referendum on President Obama. 
On Tuesday, the two candidates debated twice, first on a radio program hosted by former Gov. David A. Paterson, and then at a forum hosted by two neighborhood newspapers at a church in Howard Beach, Queens.
At the forum, Mr. Turner wholeheartedly embraced the growing national interest in the race, telling some 200 people that their votes had the potential to rein in how Mr. Obama and Congress behaved in the next year.
''A Democratic loss here will scare the Democratic Party and its policy makers to an extent that they will be pushed further back to Israeli-friendliness and economic sanity,'' Mr. Turner said, referring to two major themes of the campaign.
As in earlier debates, Mr. Turner struck a homespun tone, describing himself as a businessman who was simply fed up with the state of affairs in Washington.
Mr. Weprin cited his long political resume dealing with budgets and portrayed himself as a protector of seniors.
''We need responsible cuts, but cuts with a scalpel, not with a hatchet,'' he said. ''We must preserve Social Security and Medicare.''
Mr. Turner said that financially, it would be impossible in the long term not to make significant changes to social programs that affect new retirees.
The crowd at the forum was boisterous at times, and a security guard roamed the hall to keep order. Both candidates found themselves in potentially awkward positions: Mr. Weprin, whom Mr. Turner has frequently tried to link to Mr. Obama, was asked directly whether he would support Mr. Obama in next year's presidential election. Mr. Weprin approached the lectern and did not hesitate. ''Yes,'' he said.
And Mr. Turner found himself befuddled when he and Mr. Weprin were asked to name one corporate tax loophole they would like to close. After pondering the matter, Mr. Turner smiled widely and pleaded no contest. ''As a Republican, I never met a loophole I didn't like,'' he said. ''I really don't know.'' (Mr. Weprin cited tax breaks for companies that move jobs overseas.)
Also on Tuesday, as part of the intensified party effort to shore up the Weprin campaign, Senator Charles E. Schumer, a fellow Democrat who once represented the Ninth Congressional District, visited a senior center in Flushing, Queens, with Mr. Weprin. Over the last week, Mr. Weprin has received donations from several leading Congressional Democrats, including the chairwoman of the party's national committee, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, and the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Representative Steve Israel of New York.
Mr. Weprin has several key advantages heading into the election, including the backing of the Democratic machines in Brooklyn and Queens, as well as organized labor, which will help him with turnout. He also has a significant financial advantage, having reported last week raising about $450,000 through late August, more than twice what Mr. Turner raised in the same period.
But in recent days, Mr. Turner, a retired cable television executive, has appeared to be running strong, winning two key newspaper endorsements: The New York Post backed him on Tuesday, and The Daily News last Thursday. The New York Times had endorsed Mr. Weprin last Wednesday.
Mr. Turner has also benefited from discomfort among some elements of the district's large Jewish community with Mr. Weprin's support for same-sex marriage, and with Mr. Obama's position that Israel's pre-1967 border should be the basis for a Middle East peace agreement.
On Wednesday, Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a leader in the Orthodox community and a Democrat who has often endorsed Republican candidates, plans to endorse Mr. Turner, who has also been endorsed by former Mayors Edward I. Koch, a Democrat, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican. On Tuesday, former Gov. George E. Pataki endorsed Mr. Turner at a news conference outside Grand Central Terminal.
''If you like what's happening in Washington, send a career politician to rubber-stamp more of the same,'' Mr. Pataki, who is also a Republican, said. ''If you want to change things, if you want to send a message to Washington that what they are doing is wrong, elect Bob Turner.''
On Friday, Mr. Turner received $5,000 contributions from the Republican National Committee and from the political action committee of another Republican, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor of Virginia. On Tuesday, he received $2,000 from the House speaker, John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio.

HEADLINE: White House Seeking to Help Post Office

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE; Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
The Obama administration said on Tuesday that it would seek to save the deficit-plagued Postal Service from an embarrassing default by proposing to give it an extra three months to make a $5.5 billion payment due on Sept. 30 to finance retirees' future health coverage.
Speaking at a Senate hearing, John Berry, director of the federal Office of Personnel Management, also said the administration would soon put forward a plan to stabilize the postal service, which faces a deficit of nearly $10 billion this fiscal year and had warned that it could run out of money entirely this winter. 
''We must act quickly to prevent a Postal Service collapse,'' said Senator Joseph Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, who is chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which held the Tuesday hearing on the Postal Service's financial crisis.
Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe testified that even with a three-month reprieve on the $5.5 billion payment, the post office was likely to run out of cash and face a shutdown next July or August unless Congress passed legislation that provided a long-term solution for the ailing agency.
To help erase the postal service's deficit, Mr. Donahoe has proposed several painful and controversial steps, among them, eliminating Saturday delivery, closing up to 3,700 postal locations and laying off 120,000 workers -- despite union contracts with strict limits on layoffs.
''The Postal Service is on the brink of default,'' Mr. Donahoe testified. ''The Postal Service requires radical change to its business model if is to remain viable in the future.''
Mr. Berry said the Obama administration would push for legislation to allow a three-month delay in the $5.5 billion payment. But he stopped short of endorsing a far-reaching proposal, backed by the postal service, to allow the agency to claw back more than $50 billion that two independent actuaries have said the post office has overpaid into a major federal pension plan. Postal Service officials say such a move would go far to alleviate the agency's financial problems.
Mr. Berry said the administration was studying the proposal, but not endorsing or opposing it at this point.
He said the administration would release a more comprehensive proposal in coming weeks ''to ensure a sustainable future for the postal service,'' one that would be part of the broader $1.5 trillion deficit reduction package that the President Obama has promised to send to Congress.
The post office's financial problems are complex. Mail volume has been steadily declining, and the agency has been unable to cut its labor costs or reduce services quickly enough to match the fall in revenue. At the same time, the post office faces legal constraints that prevent it from diversifying into new lines of business, and it is also barred from raising postage prices faster than the rate of inflation.
Mr. Berry noted that the Obama administration did support the postal service's push to recover $7 billion that officials agree was overpaid into yet another pension fund. But he expressed serious reservations about the postal service's plan to cut costs by moving postal workers into a new, supposedly cheaper health insurance plan.
The two senators most active on postal issues -- Thomas Carper, a Delaware Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee overseeing the post office, and Susan Collins of Maine, who is the ranking Republican on the governmental affairs committee -- criticized the Obama administration for not acting more quickly and decisively to address the post office's problems.
''The proposals put forward by the administration to date have been insufficient,'' Mr. Carper said.
Ms. Collins added, ''I just don't understand why the administration doesn't have a plan to put before us today, given the dire straits that we're in.''
Several senators from rural states attacked the postal service's proposals to close many post offices and to end Saturday delivery, saying it would hurt rural Americans disproportionately and would hurt those who rely on mail delivery of prescriptions and newspapers.
Postal officials say a major reason for the postal service's financial crisis -- it has lost $20 billion over the last four years -- is a 2006 law requiring the post office to pay an average of $5.5 billion a year for 10 years to underwrite 75 years of health coverage for future retirees. The post office hopes to use much of $50 billion in claimed pension overpayments to cover those annual health care payments.
Cliff Guffey, president of the American Postal Workers Union, one of the four postal unions, denounced the post office's proposal to lay off 120,000 workers. The agency has asked Congress to pass a special law overturning no-layoff provisions in its union contracts. Some of those contracts bar the layoff of any workers with more than six years on the job.
''These proposals are outrageous, illegal and despicable,'' Mr. Guffey said.
He said his union had agreed to $3.7 billion in savings in a contract signed in May to help the postal service cut costs. In return, the union preserved its longstanding job-protection provisions. ''To unilaterally abrogate what we gained is totally contrary to the duty to bargain collectively,'' he said.
An overarching trend that has fueled the Postal Service's crisis -- and reduced annual mail volume by 22 percent since 2006 -- is that Americans are e-mailing, paying bills electronically and reading shopping catalogs and news online.
Noting that some great books have been written based on letters sent by the Founding Fathers and by soldiers, Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, urged the postmaster general to run an advertising campaign urging Americans to send more letters to each other.
''There is something special about receiving a piece of first-class mail, knowing that it comes from someone you care about,'' she said. ''I really believe that if someone would begin to market the value of sending a written letter to someone you love, you might be surprised what it will do for your Christmas season.''

HEADLINE: Awaiting Obama's Speech About Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Zero Job Growth Latest Bleak Sign for U.S. Economy'' (front page, Sept. 3):
How should we judge President Obama's speech on Thursday and Congressional reaction? Just a few points:
Stimulus is a good word. The first one produced two million jobs, but we need 10 million. We weren't bold enough. 
When Franklin D. Roosevelt was trapped by a Republican Congress into budget-cutting in 1937, he fought back. F.D.R. created millions of public-sector jobs rebuilding roads, parks and infrastructure for a much smaller population.
We're sliding again toward recession. Bold action is needed. We need to fix schools, bridges, dams and roads and to weatherize millions of homes. Five million jobs will boost consumer demand.
We need a housing bank. Focus tax credits on new jobs in manufacturing, with two-year tax credits for the worker and the company. Release a month's supply of gasoline from the petroleum reserve, free for start-ups: this is a national emergency.
This is not rocket science. If we boost the growth rate to 3 percent, this will do more for the economy than job-killing budget cuts.
We need the president to get behind a bold program and lead from the front. Americans who support 10 million jobs should speak up, in town meetings, e-mail and letters, so that Washington is not surprised in 2012, when people vote for a change.
ED AGUILAR Philadelphia, Sept. 4, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''The Fatal Distraction,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Sept. 5):
I am a small-business owner and will never receive money from big giveaway programs to state and local governments. My profits are not at record levels: whom are you talking to?
I am the foundation of the American Dream. I put my house on the line and worry about making the payroll. There is no support from banks or government. I do not have defined benefits or job security because of seniority.
Certainly, our educational system needs help and support to compete in this global economy, but so does my small business. We have no union, no lobbyists in Congress and no time to rally. We go to work every day. Truly, we are the invisible Americans.
BRENDA BEDRICK East Greenwich, R.I., Sept. 5, 2011
To the Editor:
As a retired dentist who operated a general practice for 45 years, I would like to add a personal small-business observation to the debate about the unemployment crisis in America.
What would persuade me to expand my office, hire a hygienist and bring another dentist into the office? Certainly not a tax break; I would save the extra dollars. Not fewer regulations; it would just make practice a bit easier and make it less likely, not more likely, that I would add to my staffing.
But if the phone started ringing, and my appointment book were full, it would certainly make me think of practice expansion and adding to the work force.
To the decision makers in Washington: I would suggest that you forget the tax breaks, keep the regulations but build demand for my services by putting money into people's pockets.
ARTHUR L. YEAGER Edison, N.J., Sept. 5, 2011
To the Editor:
''The Jobs Crisis'' (editorial, Sept. 4) suggests constructive measures to reduce unemployment. It also stresses the need for long-term plans to deal with the scourge of unemployment.
One way full employment can be assured is to redistribute the aggregate of work in the economy to all workers by reducing the length of the individual workday to create job vacancies.
Eight hours of work a day is not a sacred institution. Congress can by periodic legislation regulate the length of the workday to assure a permanent distribution of work opportunities for all. Such a policy would carry out President Franklin D. Roosevelt's proposal, in the 1944 State of the Union address, to assure to all the right to useful and remunerative jobs.
DAVID G. GIL Lexington, Mass., Sept. 4, 2011
The writer is emeritus professor of social policy at Brandeis University.
To the Editor:
You write of President Obama: ''This is his chance to present a plan big enough to ramp up job growth in the near term, while initiating long-term fixes to improve the economy and sustain employment.''
One thing this country does not need is more government meddling in the economy. And this goes double for the Federal Reserve, which has decimated the savings of retirees.
It is about time that you began to understand that it is the private sector that creates jobs, not the government. Our out-of-control deficit and debt require that 42 cents of every dollar the government spends is borrowed, with half from countries like China. This is no longer sustainable, and I say this as a successful businessman, not an academic.
Building America's infrastructure is all well and good as long as such projects are paid for with reduced government spending in other areas.
Business will hire only when there is increased demand for its products. The first step is to encourage innovation and product development. That means doing away with most government regulations until the unemployment rate is under 7 percent and cutting the corporate tax rate to 25 percent.
PAUL SCHOENBAUM Williamsburg, Va., Sept. 4, 2011
To the Editor:
Why do you, like almost everyone, choose infrastructure repair as a jobs panacea?
About 1.5 million construction workers are unemployed. That's out of 14 million.
What about skilled, unemployed, educated white-collar workers, like teachers, journalists, pharmacists, middle management and so on? Most of us are in our 50s, which essentially removes us from the construction-trades job market.
I am willing to learn welding or carpentry, but who would hire a 60-ish welder with no experience? Millions of people are in the same straits as I, yet we seem invisible.
Who will help us?

HEADLINE: To Bolster Family Tourism, Fields of Play for Young Athletes

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
ELIZABETHTOWN, Ky. -- Since 1937, when the Treasury Department established a bullion repository at nearby Fort Knox, gold has been the principal attraction of this city of 28,531 south of Louisville. Now, travel and tourism executives are counting on a $29 million youth sports complex under construction northwest of town to help fill Elizabethtown's 1,525 hotel rooms and drive development of hundreds more.
The 150-acre Elizabethtown Sports Park, set to open next summer, will have 12 baseball and softball diamonds, 10 natural turf soccer and football fields, 2 full-size synthetic turf fields and a diamond for physically disabled athletes. The sports park also includes powerful lighting, six concession buildings, pavilions to house meeting spaces and locker rooms, four playgrounds, Wi-Fi access so events can be viewed live on the Internet and a three-mile-long running and walking path that circles the complex.
Last year, American families spent an estimated $7 billion traveling with their children to youth sports tournaments, said Don Schumacher, the executive director of the National Association of Sports Commissions, a group based in Cincinnati that represents tournament organizers and hosting facilities. 
The youth sports travel segment, as it is called, is a little less than 10 percent of the national leisure travel industry, estimated at $77 billion, he said -- and it is growing by 3 to 5 percent annually, faster than most other segments. The industry is considered somewhat recession-proof, as families eager to provide their children with tournament-level competition are using the trips as vacations.
Among the first private developers to recognize the trend was the Walt Disney Company, which spent $100 million to turn 220 acres at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., into a youth sports complex that opened in 1997. The park, now named the ESPN Wide World of Sports, includes a 9,500-seat baseball stadium, an arena and fields and facilities for basketball, football, soccer, tennis, volleyball and other sports.
The Elizabethtown Sports Park is publicly financed by a restaurant sales tax that was enacted in 2007. It will be one of the largest such complexes in the country, Mr. Schumacher said, with the ability to host four- and five-day tournaments that will attract hundreds of teams and thousands of spectators from across the Southeast.
''They are going to be able to fill a lot of hotel rooms and restaurants,'' he said. ''Communities that have youth sports complexes understand that visitor spending is an important part of their local economies.''
About 90 miles west of Elizabethtown is Owensboro, Ky., an Ohio River city of 57,265. It was among the first communities in the Southeast to publicly finance fields and facilities to capture the youth sports travel market. In 2001, the city hosted 52 girls softball teams for a tournament in one of its parks that had undergone a $400,000 overhaul to build modern diamonds.
The event attracted hundreds of players, and thousands of parents and siblings who filled Owensboro's hotels, said Jared Bratcher, the sports marketing director for the Owensboro-Daviess County Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''It was the first big travel tournament here,'' Mr. Bratcher said. ''When it ended, the hotel and restaurant owners went to the city and said they wanted more of that.''
Owensboro complied. It spent $2.26 million to build four football/soccer fields at the 52-acre Waymond Morris Park. Daviess County also built 12 soccer fields at Horse Fork Park. There are now a total of 18 baseball and softball diamonds.
The youth sports infrastructure in Owensboro last year attracted 41 travel tournaments, nearly 60,000 visitors, and accounted for $19.9 million in hotel, restaurant and other travel-related spending in the region, according to a report by the convention and visitors bureau.
Elizabethtown's travel industry executives and elected leaders said in interviews that the intention for their new sports park was to mimic Owensboro's success.
From a rise at the dusty construction site, the full expanse of the Elizabethtown Sports Park is visible. Construction workers are building the compact concrete and brick buildings that will house concessions and meeting spaces. Roads and parking lots are being leveled and prepared for paving. Electricians are installing stadium-quality lighting on long poles. Equipment operators are readying 40 acres of playing fields under the direction of James D. Bergdoll, a turf specialist trained at Purdue who worked as a major league baseball groundskeeper.
''We visited a number of facilities in the South to get ideas and to make sure we had what we needed,'' said Janna Clark, the sports and sales director for the Elizabethtown Tourism and Convention Bureau, who will market the park to regional and national tournament promoters.
Among the facilities that Elizabethtown officials toured was Snowden Grove Park, a city-owned baseball park in Southaven, Miss., that has 17 diamonds built by a private developer in 1999 and sold to the city in 2004, said Jared Azzone, Southaven's assistant parks director.
Ms. Clark said Elizabethtown city officials admired how the Snowden Grove designers had arranged the baseball diamonds in a cloverleaf pattern with concessions at the center of each leaf.
The Elizabethtown Sports Park baseball and softball fields are similarly arranged. Ms. Clark also notes the paved walking and running trail that rings the Elizabethtown park and the Wi-Fi equipment that will enable tournament directors to broadcast and update games and post video, audio and data to the Internet in real time.
Wi-Fi also will enable parents and other visitors to use their tablets and laptops. ''We wanted to push the envelope as far as we could within our budget to make sure this facility could compete nationally,'' she said.
''The Elizabethtown facility is a dramatic addition to our industry,'' said Kevin Marie Nuss, the executive director of the Kentucky Sports Authority, a state agency that promotes sports tourism. ''It's a head-turner. When we go to talk to tournament promoters at trade shows, they're paying attention because it is tournament quality and large enough to hold regional and national events. It helps us sell Kentucky.''
Given the enthusiasm that Ms. Nuss and her Kentucky travel industry colleagues express for the Elizabethtown Sports Park, it almost did not happen. In 2007, in the face of fierce antitax sentiments developing in and outside Kentucky, the mayor and six-member Elizabethtown City Council narrowly approved the city's restaurant sales tax. The tax generates $2.2 million in annual revenue. In July 2010, the council authorized the sale of up to $29 million in construction bonds.
Among the three Elizabethtown elected officials who voted against the tax was Tim C. Walker, then a member of the City Council and now the mayor, who took office in January. Mr. Walker's 2007 vote became a central issue last year in his mayoral election campaign.
In an interview, Mr. Walker said he supported the sports park but voted against the tax on a matter of principle that involved the management of the tax revenues, which are overseen and administered by the Elizabethtown Tourism and Convention Bureau. Mr. Walker thought the city should control proceeds from the tax.
Asked why he was prepared, on such a seemingly small matter of principle, to compromise a project that he and other leaders now view as vital to Elizabethtown's economy, Mr. Walker shrugged and said, ''It's a good project. I very much support it. They've done everything they said they would do.''

HEADLINE: Old Tax Relief Seen as Anchor In Obama Plan

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The centerpiece of the job creation package that President Obama plans to announce on Thursday -- payroll tax relief for workers and perhaps their employers -- is neither his first policy choice nor that of many economists. But it is the one that they figure has the best chance of getting Republicans' support.
Mr. Obama has signaled that he will propose to extend for another year a reduction of two percentage points in the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax that employees pay, which means about $1,000 more for the average household. And he is considering a proposal to expand the tax relief to employers' share.
In his prime-time address to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Obama is expected to call for a package totaling several hundred billion dollars that would also extend other business tax cuts, put federal dollars into building and repairing roads, rails, airports, schools and other infrastructure projects, and provide aid to states to avert more layoffs of teachers. 
But the single biggest stimulus measure he will propose is likely to be temporary payroll tax relief. If the current tax cut, due to expire at the end of the year, is expanded next year to employers as well as employees, it would pump roughly $200 billion into the economy, with the aim of stimulating much-needed demand for goods and services from consumers and businesses and, additionally, of giving companies an incentive to hire.
For the White House, its appeal is that it may be the only large stimulus measure that can pass Congress this year given Republicans' preference for tax cuts.
And if Republicans oppose him, the White House figures Mr. Obama has the better of the political argument because he will be trying to block a tax increase that otherwise would apply to virtually all households on Jan. 1.
Republican leaders have said they might support the payroll tax cut's extension if its cost is offset by equal spending cuts, a condition they did not apply for extending the Bush-era tax cuts on high incomes. Mr. Obama has said he will propose long-term deficit savings to offset the short-term costs of his stimulus proposals, though that is not likely to satisfy Republicans.
Mr. Obama previewed his argument on Labor Day in Detroit, at one point addressing a raucous rally of union supporters as if he were speaking to Republicans.
''You say you're the party of tax cuts? Well then, prove you'll fight just as hard for tax cuts for middle-class families as you do for oil companies and the most affluent Americans,'' Mr. Obama said. Interrupted by applause and hoots, he continued: ''Show us what you got. The time for Washington games is over.''
A payroll tax break was not the tax cut that Mr. Obama preferred in December when he and Congress's Republican leaders first agreed to a stimulus package of tax cuts. He wanted to extend the ''Making Work Pay'' tax credit for low- and middle-income households, part of his original two-year stimulus package for 2009 and 2010. But Republicans, newly empowered by their big gains in the 2010 midterm elections, blocked him. Mr. Obama countered with the broad-based and more costly payroll tax cut.
Both the administration and many economists, including those at the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, agree that some spending measures, in particular unemployment compensation and aid to states to avert layoffs, have more ''bang for the buck'' than many tax cuts -- that is, for each dollar of cost to the federal government, more than a dollar is added to the economy's output. Generally, such programs keep money in people's pockets that they quickly spend, whereas high-income taxpayers tend to save.
But Republicans oppose spending measures. In a letter to Mr. Obama on Tuesday, the House Republican leaders -- Speaker John A. Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor -- said that continued high unemployment had vindicated their opposition to his 2009 stimulus package.
''As you know,'' they wrote, ''we argued at the time that a large, deficit-financed government spending bill was not the best way to improve our economic situation or create sustainable growth in employment.''
Nonpartisan analyses have found that the first stimulus package, which was roughly one-third tax cuts, did prevent unemployment from rising higher, and economic growth from being lower. Now many economists and analysts say the recovery needs further assistance, especially given the fallout from global economic problems; some have reduced their projections of economic growth because the earlier stimulus measures have ended or are about to, while Congress and the White House have been cutting spending to reduce deficits.
''We are looking at a substantial fiscal drag on the economy next year as the spending cuts take hold and state and local governments continue to contract,'' said Karen Dynan, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a policy research organization. ''If this tax cut expires, that's going to take a lot of money out of people's pockets and that is going to slow consumption substantially in the first part of next year.''
Letting the payroll tax cut for employees expire would shave a half-percentage point from economic growth in 2012, Moody's Analytics has reported.
''The payroll tax cut is better than nothing, and letting it lapse without putting anything else in its place would certainly worsen our economic problems,'' said Leonard E. Burman, a former Treasury economist now teaching at Syracuse University.
''But it's far from ideal,'' Mr. Burman added. ''A lot of the money goes to higher-income people whose consumption is likely to be unaffected by the additional after-tax income. Even for lower-income people, if they save the money or use it to pay down debt, it doesn't boost the economy in the short run.''
Still, said Donald Marron, director of the Tax Policy Center and a former economics adviser in the George W. Bush administration, ''Relative to other things you could do on the tax side, it's a pretty attractive stimulus.''
Also, Mr. Marron said, broad tax changes generally can mean a much bigger package in dollar terms than a spending initiative.
''It's very hard on the spending side to identify any single lever that gets to that kind of scale, particularly over the period of a year,'' he said. ''So if you want to do something big, you almost inevitably have to do something on the tax side.''
That is especially true, he added, ''when you layer on the political constraints'' of Republicans' opposition to spending.

HEADLINE: How to Bring the Jobs Back: Freeze Public Wages

BYLINE: By BARRY BLUESTONE. 
BARRY BLUESTONE, the dean of the School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs at Northeastern University

 BODY:
IN the face of this economic crisis, the federal government has all but declared unilateral disarmament. The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has vowed to keep real interest rates near zero, but even at that level few are borrowing. Over at the White House and on Capitol Hill, the pursuit of deficit reduction has taken on a religious fervor just when the economy needs a stimulus. 
What can President Obama do? Many are suggesting another try at increasing infrastructure investment, but that would do little to provide a quick boost. Here is a wildly conservative, yet refreshingly liberal, alternative. Mr. Obama should first call together the leaders of all public-sector unions and ask them to pledge to a two-year freeze on federal, state and local public employee wages and benefits in return for a commitment to no government layoffs.
The White House and Congress should then create a two-year, $100 billion program of federal aid to state governments to help them and their municipalities weather this economic storm. All of the money would be spent on keeping services from disappearing and providing new infrastructure and public goods, rather than increasing employee compensation.
To pay for the federal aid program, the White House and Congress should levy a two-year, 5.5 percent ''profits tax'' on corporations operating in the United States that earned more than $1 million in profits in 2010. Profits have rebounded nicely from the Great Recession and now stand at close to $1.8 trillion, but very little of that is going into producing jobs. If half those profits were made at companies with $1 million or more in corporate earnings, this tax would raise the $100 billion we need to pay for the aid to states.
Finally, even with the economy in vast disarray, there are millions of credit-worthy families who might buy a home if they were not so worried about seeing their new homes lose value. So the Department of Housing and Urban Development should create a ''home price insurance'' program that would insure home buyers against catastrophic loss if home prices were to fall. For a $500 processing fee, the two-year program would allow applicants to purchase an insurance plan covering 80 percent of any loss in home value. To benefit from the program, a homeowner would have to keep the home for a minimum of three years and maintain it in good order. The cost to the government is likely to be minimal.
These steps will not bring full employment back by next Labor Day. But at least we'd be putting up a fight.

HEADLINE: Democrats Press Obama for New Works Programs; Republicans Say They've Failed

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House and Senate Democrats are urging President Obama to propose spending on a host of new public works and job programs in his speech to a joint session of Congress on Thursday. But Republicans vowed to resist such initiatives, saying they had been a spectacular failure in the last two and a half years.
Democrats said the top item on the agenda of Congress for the rest of this year, and the top priority for a special bipartisan committee on deficit reduction, must be finding jobs for the 14 million Americans who are unemployed. ''Job creation equals deficit reduction,'' said Representative John B. Larson of Connecticut, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. 
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said the latest report from the Labor Department, showing the unemployment rate stuck at 9.1 percent, ''should be a wake-up call to every Republican who has wasted Congress's time over the last eight months'' with ''obstructionism and stall tactics.'' Nevada has the nation's highest unemployment rate, 12.9 percent in July, and Mr. Reid said many of his constituents were ''still struggling.''
The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, and her lieutenants called on the president to propose a federal ''infrastructure bank'' to help finance construction of roads and bridges and other public works; a federal program to hire construction workers to make homes more energy efficient; and a new program like the Civilian Conservation Corps, to hire young people to work for the Agriculture Department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Representative Xavier Becerra of California, the vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and a member of the new deficit reduction panel, said the president must ''be bold'' in his speech.
But as Congress returned Tuesday from its summer break, partisan differences appeared just as pronounced as when lawmakers left town early last month.
The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, warned against any initiatives that resembled the economic stimulus legislation passed soon after Mr. Obama took office in 2009. He and other Republicans said an overactive federal government was stifling economic growth.
''The problem with our economy is not that Washington is doing too little, but that Washington is doing too much already,'' Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. The stimulus package, he said, has been an ''epic failure.''
''As government continued to grow, the economy sputtered,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''And it's still sputtering. That's the reason so many people are skeptical of this president's economic proposals. They don't work as advertised.''
''In the two and half years since President Obama signed his signature jobs bill, the so-called stimulus,'' Mr. McConnell said, ''there are 1.7 million fewer jobs in this country.'' The Labor Department says that nonfarm payroll employment totaled 131.1 million in August, compared with 132.8 million in February 2009.
If Congress does not pass bills reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration and highway and transit programs, the federal government and states may have to suspend work on dozens of construction projects, forcing furloughs for tens of thousands of workers.
In a letter to Mr. Obama on Tuesday, the top two House Republicans, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, said they saw several areas where they believed they could work with the president to create jobs.
These include giving states more discretion in spending federal money on transportation projects, speeding federal review of such projects and approving trade agreements negotiated with Colombia, Panama and South Korea.
In addition, Senate Republicans said they would work with Democrats to approve a patent overhaul bill. The No. 2 Senate Republican, Jon Kyl of Arizona, said the bill, now on the Senate floor, would ''provide important benefits to U.S. inventors of all sizes, to start-up companies, to domestic manufacturing and to the economy generally.''
The co-chairmen of the deficit reduction committee, which is expected to recommend savings in benefit programs like Medicare and Social Security as well as revenue-raising changes in the tax code, announced Tuesday that they had chosen a Democrat, Sarah Kuehl, as deputy staff director for the 12-member panel. As a senior aide to the Senate Budget Committee, Ms. Kuehl has handled Medicare, health insurance and Social Security. She will work with the staff director for the new bipartisan panel, Mark A. Prater, who is chief tax counsel for Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee.

HEADLINE: In the Land of Denial: Republicans who dismiss science can offer no leadership on global warming

 BODY:
The Republican presidential contenders regard global warming as a hoax or, at best, underplay its importance. The most vocal denier is Rick Perry, the Texas governor and longtime friend of the oil industry, who insists that climate change is an unproven theory created by ''a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects.'' 
Never mind that nearly all the world's scientists regard global warming as a serious threat to the planet, with human activities like the burning of fossil fuels a major cause. Never mind that multiple investigations have found no evidence of scientific manipulation. Never mind that America needs a national policy. Mr. Perry has a big soapbox, and what he says, however fallacious, reaches a bigger audience than any scientist can command.
With one exception -- make that one-and-one-half -- the rest of the Republican presidential field also rejects the scientific consensus. The exception is Jon Huntsman Jr., a former ambassador to China and former governor of Utah, who recently wrote on Twitter: ''I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy.'' The one-half exception is Mitt Romney, who accepted the science when he was governor of Massachusetts and argued for reducing emissions. Lately, he's retreated into mush: ''Do I think the world's getting hotter? Yeah, I don't know that, but I think that it is.'' As for the human contribution: ''It could be a little. It could be a lot.''
The others flatly repudiate the science. Ron Paul of Texas calls global warming ''the greatest hoax I think that has been around for many, many years.'' Michele Bachmann of Minnesota once said that carbon dioxide was nothing to fear because it is a ''natural byproduct of nature'' and has complained of ''manufactured science.'' Rick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, has called climate change ''a beautifully concocted scheme'' that is ''just an excuse for more government control of your life.''
Newt Gingrich's full record on climate change has been a series of epic flip-flops. In 2008, he appeared on television with Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, to say that ''our country must take action to address climate change.'' He now says the appearance was a mistake.
None of the candidates endorse a mandatory limit on emissions or, for that matter, a truly robust clean energy program. This includes Mr. Huntsman. In 2007, as Utah governor, he joined with Arnold Schwarzenegger, then the governor of California, in creating the Western Climate Initiative, a market-based cap-and-trade program aimed at reducing emissions in Western states. Cap-and-trade has since acquired a toxic political reputation, especially among Republicans, and Mr. Huntsman has backed away.
The economic downturn has made addressing climate change less urgent for voters. But the issue is not going away. The nation badly needs a candidate with a coherent, disciplined national strategy. So far, there is no Republican who fits that description.

HEADLINE: A Poetic Mentor Who Minces Few Words

BYLINE: CHADWICK MOORE


HIGHLIGHT: Holding court in the East Village, Larry Fagin, 74 years old, second-generation beat, gives creative-writing lessons and edits and produces small magazines and chapbooks from the work of students and friends.

 BODY:
The woman climbs the stairs in the shabby East Village tenement and enters while Larry Fagin is finishing a call with another poetry student.
"How's Aiden? Is he old enough to go to college yet?" Mr. Fagin asks the man on the phone, making small talk. He motions for the woman to take a seat at the dining table, where her most recent poem is up on his computer screen. "O.K. Send money," he barks and hangs up. 
Mr. Fagin turns his attention to the woman, Jennifer Kietzman, 40, a due-diligence investigator from Borough Park, Brooklyn, with a full head of wild red curls. She leans over his shoulder as he dives into a wham-bam frenzy of changing word tenses, deleting entire lines and replacing words with synonyms. 
He stops at the second line of her lengthy prose poem. "No, horrible. Bad poetry. That's the worst line you've ever written." He highlights the line and slams the delete key. "Goodbye!" 
"I liked it," Ms. Kietzman says in a shrinking voice and leans back in her chair. "Well, that's O.K.," she says. Mr. Fagin is not done. The stuff about Ms. Kietzman's family, he says, "has got to stop. They're cows. They're furniture." Highlight, slam delete key. "Goodbye!" 
Four stories above East 12th Street, down the hall from Allen Ginsberg's old apartment, one of the East Village's last standing bohemians soldiers on. 
Mr. Fagin, 74 years old, second-generation beat, New York School veteran, friend of Ted Berrigan, publisher of Ashbery, lives with his wife, Susan Noel, also a writer, in adjoining rent-controlled apartments in the building near Avenue A.
Although Mr. Fagin -- a handsome, T-shirt-and-jeans kind of guy with a square build, tousled silver hair and a cheerful air of insubordination -- now collects Social Security, his chief source of income for decades has been giving private creative-writing lessons and editing and producing small magazines and chapbooks from the work of students and friends.
He reports that despite former teaching gigs at the New School and St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery, neither he nor his wife have held anything resembling a straight job for any substantial period of time, though he has worked, he says, as a librarian, a reader to the blind and a "black marketer."
"I try to be disaffiliated from bourgeois society," Mr. Fagin said the other day, "like most good people. Because all we have are these very few, precious days." 
Mr. Fagin's precious days typically begin with two hours of writing poetry, breakfast at the Neptune diner around the corner on First Avenue and a quick return to what he calls his "wonderland": the two-bedroom walk-up (bathtub under the kitchen counter) lined with books, art, movies and music that he rented in 1968 for $58.50 a month with an old girlfriend. 
He now pays about $150 a month for his warren in what he calls the "Chelsea Hotel of the East Village." Ginsberg lived there for more than 20 years.
"Allen made the best chicken soup," said Ms. Noel, a platinum blonde with black-rimmed cat-eye glasses, apple red lipstick and a strong residue of punk rock vitriol.
"He really energized the building," Mr. Fagin said.
"Like a battery," Ms. Noel added. 
At any given time, Mr. Fagin has 20 to 30 students as diverse as a middle-aged real estate lawyer in Denver, a Bard undergraduate and a 75-year-old retiree in Florida. He charges $75 an hour, whether in person or on the phone, and has taught students as far away as China. Ms. Kietzman recently paid him $600 to produce 150 copies of a chapbook of her poetry and send them to his mailing list of writers and editors.
Mr. Fagin's teaching approach focuses on paring poems down to their essence.
"Deep down I don't care about the writer; I only care about what's written," he said. "Everyone is a terrible judge of their own abilities, and it takes someone else to say, 'Hey this is great, or this is crap.' And to say ultimately: 'Hey you don't matter. What you're making, the object, is the only thing that matters. Your ego is just an impediment.'" 
Much of Mr. Fagin's own poetry can be brutally economical. His poem "The Skeleton" goes like this:
Mr. Fagin seems to exert a magnetic pull on his students.
"If you have any inclination to get in touch with the arts, to express yourself creatively, and you live in this century, and in this city, and you're struggling to make ends meet -and I fall into this category - you'll be enamored by Larry," said Kate Thompson, 30, a former market researcher from Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, who has studied prose fiction with Mr. Fagin for a year. "You walk into his apartment and it's just filled with all this stuff you recognize and don't fully know but you want to." 
In a classroom setting, Mr. Fagin has had mixed success. For about five years, until 2007, he was an adjunct at the New School, where he rubbed many people the wrong way, said one former student, Kathleen Kyllo.
"By the time the last class rolled around attendance was significantly lower," she said in an e-mail. "Where students had once sat closer to him near the front of the room we were hanging back in a defensive mass." She recalled an incident where Mr. Fagin announced to the class that her poetry was "too vaginal." 
Mr. Fagin acknowledged that he got "really mean" in the classroom. "You walk in and all these faces are staring at you and you want some reaction from them but they really have nothing to offer you. It's like, come on you jack wagons!"
All in all, Mr. Fagin takes a blighted view of the current generation of aspiring artists, whom he likened to "pod people." 
"They are so inundated by information, they have no way to sort all this stuff out -- it's like being perpetually electrocuted but not realizing it," he said. 
Nor does he have much good to say about what has come of his once-beloved downtown art world, which, by his reckoning, ended in February 1975 at a dinner party around the corner hosted by Claes and Patty Oldenburg. 
Mr. Fagin, who went with his friend the critic and poet Peter Schjeldahl, recalled his excitement that the artist Robert Smithson was to be in attendance. "But when we got there, all anyone talked about was real estate," he said. "They'd all just bought lofts in what was later to be called SoHo. We left and I said to Peter, 'Well, that's the end of civilization.'" 
Still, somehow, he perseveres to connect, especially with his students.
 "To teach literature or history is in a way a losing battle because you cannot cross that crevasse," he said. "They can't get to you and you can't get to them. You can just call to each other across the crevasse."

HEADLINE: Mr. Rodgers's Neighborhood

BYLINE: NILE RODGERS


HIGHLIGHT: With the Village as his playground, and his parents off getting high, the producer Nile Rodgers recalls a curious boyhood.

 BODY:
It took me a long time to realize that the things my parents did were not exactly normal. I was about 7 years old, and it was the tail end of the 1950s, when it started to dawn on me that they were . . . well, let's just say they were different. For instance: my friends and I got shots when we went to the doctor and we hated them. But my parents stabbed themselves with needles almost every day, and seemed to enjoy it. Weird.
Most of my friends' parents sounded like the adults in school or on TV when they talked. People understood them. My parents, on the other hand, had their own language, laced with a flowery slang that I picked up the same way the Puerto Rican kids could speak English at school and Spanish at home with their abuelas.
And then there was the matter of how they talked. My parents and their friends spoke this exotic language very slowly. There were other odd things. For instance, they often slept standing up, and this group narcolepsy could strike right in the middle of the most dynamic conversation. Someone would start a sentence: "Those ofay cats bopping out on the stoop are blowin' like Birrr . . . " and suddenly the words would begin to come out slower. And. Slower. Soon they wouldn't be speaking at all. Eventually our living room would be filled with black and white hipsters suspended in time and space, while I ran through the petrified forest of their legs. My favorite game was waiting to see if the ashes from their cigarettes would ever drop. Somehow they almost never did.
I can still remember the day when I finally realized that there was a name for this unusual lifestyle. My parents were junkies! And their slow-motion thing was called nodding out.
Oh well - it was nice to be able to name the thing. This was my life, and as far as I was concerned, there was nothing uncommon or uncomfortable about it at all. In fact, for a while, at least, it was a carefree Shangri-La.
My mother, Beverly, was a beautiful, brilliant black girl whose family descended from southern sharecroppers. She got pregnant with me when she was 13, the very first time she had sex. Bobby, my stepfather, was white, Jewish and central-casting handsome. They were an unusual progressive pair: they smoked pipes, dressed impeccably and read Playboy for the articles. Even in beat-generation Greenwich Village, New York City, circa 1959, interracial couples weren't exactly commonplace.
Mom's maiden name was Goodman. Technically, it was Gooden, but her father, Fredrick, appropriated the name from a huge Goodman's Egg Noodles billboard that hung outside of the Lincoln Tunnel on the New Jersey side. The family story is that Fredrick had been forced to flee the cotton fields of Georgia after he used a tree branch to beat a white man he'd caught raping his sister. Grandpa Fredrick (never one to let a good story go to waste) told me that he saw the sign just after his car exited the tunnel. He thought the name would help people up north think of him as a "good" man. In the end, I guess it sort of worked. Twenty long years later, after the Woolworth C.E.O. he chauffeured passed away, Grandpa got the Cadillac as thanks for his service.
By the time Beverly Goodman was 12, she was already what they used to call a fast girl. She was also hip. She knew things that most civilians didn't. She listened to Nina (Simone) and Monk (Thelonious) and TB (Tony Bennett) and Ahmad Jamal on a regular basis, and was so down she called them by a single name (except Jamal, maybe out of respect for the fact that he'd gone through the trouble of changing his name from Freddy Jones). She spoke with confidence, just a peg down from arrogance, which only big-city intellectuals could get away with, even if they were only 12. She had art, literature and music all around her.
I always called her Beverly instead of Mommy. She never asked me to do otherwise. Even as a very young kid I was utterly convinced that my mother was the most beautiful woman in the world. Her looks were a combination of African-American, Native American and Irish. This was no accident, starting with my great-great-grandmother Mary Ellen, who was the child of a partially African mother and an Irish doctor and slave owner who was, um, intimate with his property. As the daughter of a white man, Mary Ellen was more privileged than the average ex-slave's child, a fact not lost on her. Later, when her own daughters came of age, she passed along some interesting advice: "Protect your children and the benefits you have from my being half white," she told them. "Marry the fairest man you can, so your children will have good hair." Today, those genes are very apparent in my family. Most of us resemble, to varying degrees, Lena Horne, Halle Berry, Cab Calloway or Lenny Kravitz.
Except for me.
I inherited my biological father's genes: I'm dark-skinned, "the only spot in the lot" is what my family called me. As screwed up as it is, my great-great-grandmother knew what she was talking about when advising her daughter to "marry light." It's hard to describe how horribly ugly I felt as a dark-skinned kid in the '50s. Thank God for the '60s, when black was suddenly beautiful, no matter the shade.
Which brings me to my stepdad: Bobby Glanzrock. It's not fair to call Bobby a black man in a white man's body because his style was genuinely his alone. Bobby was a beatnik Ph.D. His observations had angles and perspectives that would make Miles Davis contemplate his own sense of cool. Bobby spoke with a slow, deliberate syncopation that was constantly modulating through the musical scale. This was the preferred style of speaking amongst the hipster class. Think Mitch Hedberg or Jimi Hendrix.
Some of his black friends called him "White Bobby," but my stepdad acted more like the black jazz musicians he idolized than the haberdashers in his lineage. He only dated soul sisters, most of whom could have doubled for Cleopatra Jones, all Afro and attitude. That included my mom, who sported the latest Carnaby Street duds and a towering nimbus of kinky hair. Bobby's uncle Lew, who had no sons, groomed his nephew to take over his clothing business. But Lew disowned him for marrying a black woman, even one with a nice Jewish-sounding name. Bobby threw away the glory of the schmatte business for Beverly. And in return, he became the love of her life. Me, I was their little groupie. I loved them both like crazy.
And crazy may be the operative word. Beverly and Bobby may not have been model parents, but they were a really good fit for each other; art, literature and especially their love of music bonded them together. But as they spiraled deeper and deeper into addiction, they were also increasingly self-centered, not infrequently criminal and less and less interested in the responsibilities of raising a kid. On some level, it was great to be treated like a peer, to be on a first-name basis with my parents, but it wasn't exactly a substitute for the usual parental cocktail of nurturing and discipline. Respect? Yes, there was plenty of that. If I had a problem, we'd "rap on it." Then they'd ask me something like: "Are we copacetic?" If I said, "Yeah, I guess so," the matter would be settled with a five slap or some other affirming gesture.
Bobby always affectionately called me by my nickname, "Pud," short for pudding pie. Once, after I'd accidentally set fire to the apartment while playing with matches, he sat me down. More disappointed than angry, he stared woefully into my eyes for about five minutes or so, then finally broke the uncomfortable silence.
"Pud, dig yourself," he said.
This was the harshest discipline Bobby ever doled out. My mother then asked me if I wouldn't mind walking over to her and lying down on her lap. She gave me a few whacks on the behind and asked me if I understood why.
"Yes."
She looked me in the eyes, and said, "Pud, you really have to start digging yourself."
"O.K., Beverly." I cried more from shock than pain, because she'd never hit me before. Then again, I'd never set the house on fire before, either.
Most of the people in my life back then may have been constantly high, but they were pretty stylish. Coming home from school, it wasn't unusual for me to see berets or tams, jackets with elbow patches, ascots, dickeys, turtlenecks, groovy "slacks," high design cigarette holders and cases, rolling paper from all over the world, shoebox lids to clean pot seeds, magazines of all types, books, albums, various sets of works to wrap around your arms to make the veins pop up. This was the paraphernalia of a junkie pad at the twilight of the '50s. Some visitors were famous, all were friends. Once, Thelonious Monk himself came over to buy my mom's fur coat for his girlfriend. Heroin often turns addicts into gifted salesmen. Some families go to Disneyland for fun; we went to the pawnshop. Most junkies' wallets, where you'd expect to find family photos or business cards, are crammed instead with pawn tickets.
We moved around a lot - Chinatown, the Bronx, Alphabet City - but our lives first started to change when we lived in a two-bedroom apartment on the corner of Greenwich and Bethune Streets, sometime in the summer of 1959. This was the last moment in my parents' lives before junk began dictating everything about how and where they lived. Ironically, this part of New York is now the high-rent West Village, but I still associate it with the sewage-brine of the Hudson River. This was before America learned how to monetize geography by simply renaming it, as my grandfather Goodman would surely applaud.
I can still picture life on Greenwich Street. Our brand-new French Petrol Blue Simca was parked curbside. It looked like a frowning flat-faced barracuda, its body chopped off at its upper dorsal fin. It was the most unusual car in town. Standing in the lobby of my building looking across narrow, Victorian-size Greenwich Street, I'd see slaughtered livestock being moved onto loading docks, the meat swinging from large hooks. Anyone who's seen "Rocky" knows what these huge dangling headless bodies look like, but on celluloid they have no scent. In the winter it wasn't so bad, but during the summer months, the stench was unbelievable - tons of flesh in a race against rot. Today it's still called the meatpacking district, but back then it wasn't an ironic name for an upscale neighborhood, it was a literal description of the foul and bloody business going on. I was 7 years old and almost always alone. I would sing as I explored the streets, adding an appropriate underscore to my solitary wandering.
I was exceptionally weird looking back then. Super-skinny. Thick glasses. And my mother dressed me like my dapper stepfather, which meant I dressed like a blue-blooded, old money, prep-school WASP.
I desperately tried to find friends, but there were no other kids my age in our building. Other than the doorman, who was actually a cool guy, my only friend was a schoolmate named David. David's mom was white and his father was black, an interracial combination that was a little more common than my parents but still stopped traffic in 1959. David lived on the border of Little Italy, which was less than a mile from my place but seemed as far away as Big Italy. Maybe because I looked so silly, with my Jerry Lewis glasses and Tom Wolfe getups, the Italian kids near David's place always wanted to beat the crap out of me. Asthma or not, I was a fast runner.
It was a spring day in 1960, almost summer. I was 7-and-a-half. As I walked west down Bleecker Street, I noticed a large crowd gathered around the Hotel Greenwich, right by the Village Gate. The hotel had recently been converted into a single-room occupancy filled with mental patients who had nowhere else to go once the state hospitals started closing. The S.R.O.'s gave the Village an edge. I remember feeling comfortable around their eccentric tenants. I was used to irrational behavior. As I drew close, I realized everyone was looking up: "Is he going to jump?" cried one man. "Think so," answered another. I craned my head and immediately recognized the naked man raving incoherently on the fire escape: Nile Rodgers Sr.
If destiny is biology, then I was born to be a musician. Nile Rodgers Sr. was a brilliant percussionist who came of age during the Latin music boom of the late '40s. Dances like the mambo and the rumba had a huge influence on the big bands. My father specialized in Afro-Cuban beats and was considered a virtuoso by the time he was a young man.
Paul Whiteman, "The King of Jazz" and a popular big-band leader, was the host of an ABC show called "TV Teen Club" that later became "American Bandstand."
A gig with him was a huge break for my dad because Paul's orchestra was, true to his name, all white. Unfortunately, Paul couldn't hire him full time, and Dad had to supplement his income with a day job in the garment district, where most of my mother's family also worked (as well as Bobby, my stepfather-to-be).
Nile charmed everyone who crossed his path. If he didn't have an instrument with him, he could turn any object into one. He loved music: He lived it, walked it, talked it and played it all the time. He loved music more than anything - except maybe getting high.
By the time he was 16, my father was more or less a daily drinker and pot smoker. Because of his relatively well-paying job running racks in the garment district - "flying Jewish airplanes," they called it - he had extra spending money, just enough cash to develop a taste for heroin.
Nile worked with a guy named Freddy Boy, who had a brainy and very beautiful kid sister named Beverly who Nile took a liking to. He was 16, and she was 13 - and very soon she was pregnant.
For a while, Nile loved Beverly even more than music and drugs, so much so that he was nearly killed defending her honor. A gang member called her a whore, and when Nile spoke up he was knifed in the chest. Beverly, on the other hand, liked Nile, a lot, but was absolutely not in love with him. But once she was pregnant with me, Beverly's father, whom she was deathly afraid of, convinced her she had to get married. And so the wedding was set for June, just three months before I was born. Nile was ecstatic.
But when they reached City Hall, my mother decided she just couldn't do it and caused a big scene. Crushed, Nile slapped my mother across the face. According to her, that was the only time in his life that he'd ever struck another person. But once was all it took to cancel a wedding. And so it was that Nile Sr.'s 14-year-old fiancee humiliated him on what was supposed to be the happiest day of his life. That night he did so much dope he almost died. I would hear about the wedding-day binge that he blamed on Beverly every time I saw him for the rest of his life.
Now on this hot spring day, eight years since he'd last played with Paul Whiteman, my father had a flophouse ledge as his stage. He'd already jumped out of the fourth-story window and fallen onto the landing. A small brigade of cops and firemen were trying to bring him in. I frantically ran into the hotel and told the desk clerk, "The man on the fire escape is my father. I don't think he'll jump if he sees me." I added, "He is a very nice man." The clerk brought me over to the police, who escorted me up to the fourth floor and the window closest to my father.
"Hey, Nile, hey, Nile, it's Little Splash," I said to him.
Splash was my dad's nickname on the street, because he drank a lot of cheap bathtub gin. He needed to. He was always high and it was a simple matter of economics. Over the past few years, he'd become a full-fledged alcoholic and drug addict, lost his job in the garment district and ended up on welfare in an S.R.O. He was on the city's methadone program and made extra money by selling "spit back" to addicts. "Spit back" is resold methadone that junkies literally spit into a hidden receptacle after they swallow just enough to get straight. He liked it when his friends called me Little Splash, and I thought this would get through to him. It did. He recognized me instantly.
I hadn't realized that he lived so close to us. I hadn't seen him for about six months. Beverly didn't allow it because she felt embarrassed for him. But she didn't understand how much I loved him, and that he and I got along great. On our last get-together, we'd gone shopping and seen the sci-fi film "The Blob" in the Bronx. He'd always give me a present, a record or a cool ethnic percussion instrument. But now he looked at me with a sorrowful, nearly empty stare: "Pud, why did she do that to me? I loved her so much."
"I know, Pops, come inside now."
"Hey, son, are you alright? You alright, Pud?"
"Yeah, Pops, I'm fine, but I think you should come inside."
After a little coaxing, my dad climbed back inside. Other than the fact that he was totally naked, we acted like nothing happened. Since his tiny room reeked of piss, I waited in the hall, which also stunk, but not as bad. While he washed and dressed, a female resident tried to make a quick buck for a fix by propositioning me. When I didn't react, she lifted her skirt and repeated the offer.
I'm sure if I were just a few years older, her voice would've reverberated in that stairwell as sexily as Donna Summer's "Love to Love You Baby." But to Little Splash it just sounded funny. All I could do was laugh. Suddenly my father appeared in slightly tattered beatnik clothes, bathed in Zizanie cologne, and we left the building - through the front door. He took his spit-back money and bought me a slice of pizza and a large Orange Julius on Eighth Street. I was happy. We spent the rest of the day browsing through every record store in the Village.
He may have been crazy as hell but my father's gift to me was his kindness, open-mindedness and music. Every chance he got, he'd patiently teach me to read rhythm patterns. Because of robust music programs in the public schools, by the time I was 14 I could play at least a "tune" on almost any instrument. When I was 19, I got my first professional job, but he never saw me turn pro. He died a few days before. After I die, his bloodline will end with me. He is buried anonymously in potter's field.
My father left no manuscripts, compositions or unfinished works. I used to think that was tragic, but not anymore. When I got older, I traced his DNA back to the Benin tribe of what is now the Edo State in Nigeria. The Benins have a rich artistic heritage. I like to believe that the success I've had is a result of my dad - or maybe it's just those Benin genes?

HEADLINE: Why I'm (Still) Reluctant to Hire

BYLINE: JAY GOLTZ


HIGHLIGHT: It comes down to a risk-benefit analysis, and right now the risks are too high.

 BODY:
The August jobs report that came out last week showed no job growth, and now President Obama and lots of other politicians are talking about how to create jobs. But I'm not sure they fully understand what prompts a business owner to hire someone -- and why so many owners are still reluctant to hire, even if they think business might be improving.
Jobs are created when businesses get busy enough to need more workers. Businesses get busier when people buy things. People buy things when they need or want them and have enough money. And this is where the problem lies. Many people do not have enough money right now -- for all kinds of reasons. Some have seen the value of their homes fall precipitously which may keep them from moving or from improving their house. Moving and improving generates business.
Zero job growth last month does not necessarily mean that business activity has slowed. In some cases, even business owners whose businesses have improved have decided not to hire, but to use overtime, build a backlog, or remain understaffed -- even though each of these steps can be painful. Paying overtime costs more money. Delaying shipments or being understaffed can give your competitors an edge. Why would business owners do these things? Because these steps aresafer than adding someone to the payroll, and these days safer feels better.
Right now, given the stock market fluctuations, the constant stream of scary news about the economy, and the even scarier politics we see in Washington, business owners are slow to hire new people unless there's a very strong need. Think about what the owner faces if the business doesn't materialize to justify the hire -- like the horrendous task of laying people off, which scares the staff members who remain and produces a series of other costs. Many of us are just now recovering from our last round of layoffs, both emotionally and financially.
I sell home furnishings, custom picture framing and art. Although all of these industries have been affected, my business has been improving, and I've hired a few people this year. But I'm moving slowly. I can tell you one thing that is going to get me to move faster: a payroll tax break. Why would anyone take on a new employee because of a one-year break on payroll taxes? Some owners might they would do it -- after all, who doesn't want a tax break? -- but the reality is that in most instances the owner would have hired that person anyway. Either you need someone or you don't. If the government is going to spend money on jobs, I'd rather see it fix the streets and bridges, which really does create jobs (and inject money into the economy) -- although whether that's a good idea right now and whether the politics are plausible is another matter.
To make sense of this, you have to understand why even an owner who sees business improving might be hesitant to hire. Consider this situation:
You interview someone who has been out of work for 11 months. Let's say he was in his previous job for 20 years, and now he's regularly being told by job screeners that he is overqualified for the available position. In a good market, this person would not be available. You think it might actually be a good opportunity to bring someone valuable to your company -- even though, because of his experience, you will have to pay him more money than you are accustomed to paying. You think it might be worth the shot, but your company is still in a precarious situation after the last few years. What do you have to lose, beyond the salary? Actually, you have quite a lot to lose. In fact, if it doesn't work out, you could easily end up paying more in unemployment compensation than you do in salary.
If the new hire spends more than 30 working days with you but you have to let him go either because it's not a good fit or because you were overly optimistic about the economy, he is eligible to collect unemployment. That, at least, is how it works in Illinois; the rules vary by state. Many people don't realize that the government is not paying the bill for most of that compensation; companies are. The more people a company lays off, the more it pays in unemployment premiums. (I explained how this works in a previous post.)
In the above example, taking a chance on this person could cost a company $20,000 in increased unemployment premiums over the following three years. It makes sense for an employer to pay that kind of money for an employee who has been there for years. I understand and appreciate that unemployment compensation is an important lifeline for people who lose their jobs. But for 30 days? That's a lot to ask -- and it might even be counterproductive. In this environment, it just might be the difference in a decision not to hire someone. Business is about evaluating risks and rewards.
But that's not all. After you let this employee go, he can go to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and file a complaint that he was fired because of his age. You will have to hire a lawyer. His lawyer will call your lawyer to try to settle. You will think, settle for ? For giving someone a chance? You will probably win, but that could take years and thousands of dollars in legal fees. This is why it's safer -- remember, safer is -- to not hire anyone and to continue working with a short staff. Is this good for the unemployed? The economy? The businesses? Anyone?
So what could the government do to encourage hiring? Here are two small suggestions:
First, stop punishing businesses for giving someone a chance. How about giving employers a six-month window before the company becomes liable for someone's unemployment compensation? How about five months? Or four? But not 30 days. Of course, employees shouldn't be punished either. If they are already collecting unemployment when they take a job, they should be able to resume collecting it if the job doesn't work out -- but not at the expense of the business that gave them another chance.
And second, make the E.E.O.C. dismiss frivolous claims quicker. We all know that there are bad bosses doing things that need to be dealt with, but the example I've given is not uncommon -- and it puts an unnecessary strain on small businesses that don't have a legal department or even a human resources person for that matter.
This is my short list. Will these steps solve the problem and ignite a storm of hiring? No. But they will create a more hiring-friendly atmosphere while we wait for what we really need -- an economy with people ready to spend money.

HEADLINE: Afraid to Quit

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: With so much uncertainty about the economy, Americans appear reluctant to quit their jobs, a new Labor Department report shows.

 BODY:
With so much uncertainty about the economy, Americans appear reluctant to quit their jobs, a new Labor Department report shows.
Each month the Labor Department releases a number called the "quits rate," which is the total number of voluntary separations by employees, as a percent of all employment. When the economy is good, the rate tends to be higher, since workers know they have opportunities elsewhere if they don't like their current jobs.
As you might imagine, the quits rate fell drastically during the recession and even during the early part of the recovery. In December 2007, the month the downturn officially started, the quits rate was 2 percent. By January 2010, it had fallen to about half that, at 1.1 percent.
The rate has risen slightly since then. As of July, it was 1.5 percent, where it's been for several months. But that is still well below healthy levels.
In case there's any doubt, the quits rate hasn't stagnated because employed Americans are happier at their jobs. A recent Gallup survey suggested that, if anything, workers are more dissatisfied with many aspects of their jobs now than they were in August 2008.
People are reluctant to quit because employers aren't hiring. And unfortunately, part of the reason that employers aren't hiring is that their workers aren't leaving and creating new openings.

HEADLINE: A Closer Look at Romney's Economic Plan

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: The assumptions behind a corporate tax cut, the implications of a cut in the federal work force and the unaddressed issue of housing all draw scrutiny.

 BODY:
Now that we've had a day to digest Mitt Romney's economic plan, Matthew Yglesias looks between the lines and finds what he calls an "agenda on social welfare policy that's basically every bit as extreme as anyone else's."
 So although Robert Reich calls the plan "unremarkable" and "way too reasonable for the current G.O.P.," Mr. Yglesias points out that Mr. Romney's commitment to lower taxes will have to come at the expense of something, and that something could very well be Medicare.
 In the plan, Mr. Romney says that "before President Obama exploded the size of the federal government, our existing tax rates were more or less adequate to pay for the government we needed."
 True, in 2006, the Bush-era tax rates were able to finance government spending with a much smaller deficit. But even without a financial crisis, the aging demographics of the United States population mean that in the absence of serious health care cost reform, the government will need more money to pay for Medicare and Medicaid services for the elderly, disabled and poor in coming years.
 "Maintaining America's commitment to health insurance for senior citizens is going to require higher taxes," writes Mr. Yglesias. "When politicians try to say that we can get by with Bush-era levels of taxation indefinitely, they mean we can get by with Bush-era levels of taxation if we scrap Medicare."

 The Romney camp argues that some of the tax cuts - particularly the drop in the corporate tax rate from a high of 35 percent to 25 percent - will be offset by more companies' bringing their operations back to the United States and more investment here by companies, generating more corporate income to be taxed at the lower rate. But many economists and tax experts say that without reforming the tax code and eliminating the many loopholes that already allow companies to pay far less than 35 percent - or less than 25 percent, for that matter - it's hard to imagine such a corporate tax cut being that effective.
 Mr. Romney's campaign officials declined to say just how much they believed the lower rate would be offset by generation of taxable revenues in the United States by more companies. And the plan also specifically "does not promise the immediate creation of some imaginary number of jobs, because government cannot create jobs."
Campaign officials did say that the plan, in its totality, would raise economic growth over all to an average of 4 percent on an annual basis, induce private companies to create 11.5 million jobs and reduce the unemployment rate to 5.9 percent by the end of Mr. Romney's first term in office.
That strikes economists as hugely ambitious. "I think it's a stretch," said Michael Spence, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and the author of "The Next Convergence: The Future of Economic Growth in a Multispeed World." "Nobody knows how well we're going to respond both on the public- and private-sector side and restore competitiveness." Acknowledging that the plan was of course an "opening shot," Mr. Spence, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, said: "Does his set of policies do it? My answer would be no." 
There are several challenges for Mr. Romney, one of which he would create on his own. By calling for a shrinking of government, he is promising to shrink the federal work force. Although the private sector dominates employment, layoffs by government at all levels have weighed heavily on the labor market during the weak recovery. Mr. Romney said he planned to reduce the federal work force by about 10 percent, which works out to about 282,000 workers at current levels.
And one thing Mr. Romney did not address at all in the plan unveiled on Tuesday was housing. The recent crisis was set off by a collapse in the housing market, and millions of owners currently owe more than their homes are worth. Despite record low interest rates, home sales are still sluggish. That's bad news for the more than 1.1 million unemployed construction workers, not to mention the millions of others in banking, real estate, retail and home improvement whose livelihoods depend at least in part on a robust housing market. It's hard to imagine a healthy economy without some fix for housing. Mr. Romney's campaign officials say a plan for that is coming.

HEADLINE: The Challenge of Creating Good Jobs

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: A conversation with Paul Osterman, co-author of "Good Jobs America: Making Work Better for Everyone," who argues that it is good and needed public policy to foster not only more jobs but decent ones.

 BODY:
In their new book, "Good Jobs America: Making Work Better for Everyone," Paul Osterman and Beth Shulman argue that the United States needs to worry about not just creating millions more jobs but also ensuring that the jobs are good ones.
By good jobs, the authors mean jobs that pay enough to support a family and provide decent, safe conditions. The authors voice concern that many middle-class jobs have disappeared or deteriorated into low-wage ones that cause families to fall below the poverty line.
Taking a view contrary to that of many economists and politicians, they argue that government can and should play a vigorous role in encouraging employers to create good jobs - perhaps by providing tax incentives that require employers to pay a living wage.
Mr. Osterman is a professor of human resources and management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Ms. Shulman, who died last year, was a senior fellow at Demos, chairwoman of the National Employment Law Project and co-chairwoman of the Fairness Initiative on Low-Wage Work.
Here are excerpts from an interview with Mr. Osterman.
Q.
A.
I strongly want to argue you should not just talk about creating jobs but the quality of the jobs you create. The general point I would make is there's a shortage of economic demand, and as a result, the government needs to create jobs directly.
The critique of that is, one, that it's wasteful. The image is the government pays you to dig a hole and pays me to fill it up. There is a lot of work that's not like that, whether it's building infrastructure or being day-care teacher or health-care provider, work that provides lasting benefits to society. 
The other critique is this would crowd out private-sector jobs. When the economy has slack resources - and right now we have a high unemployment rate and low interest rates - it's not true that you'd be crowding out jobs.
Q.
A.
The concept of what are good jobs is very broad. We can talk about wages, about benefits, about autonomy at work. In the book we make it simple: we talk about wages. We look at two standards. One standard is two-thirds of the median wage. (The median wage is $17.60 an hour, the book says, and two-thirds of that is $11.73.) That's a standard used internationally and in the states. If you're below that, if you're that far from the average, you're really in difficulty in society.
The other standard is whether wages for a full-time worker are below the poverty line for a family of four. (That's $10.60 an hour.) Nearly 20 percent of American adults work in such poverty-level jobs. That's a remarkably high percentage.
Q.
A.
One objection we hear is that these bad, low-wage jobs are transitory, that people just move through them on their way up. But that's not true. Overwhelmingly adults stay in these jobs for years and years. It's not Horatio Alger. It's not transitory.
Then there's the objection people raise that we can solve our problems through education. I don't want to get in a box and say education is not important. But if you do a thought experiment and say all of a sudden, everyone has a degree from a community college, all these jobs won't suddenly go away. There will still be jobs for janitors, jobs cleaning hotel rooms and chopping lettuce that goes into your salad. The question is, how much are they going to pay?
Then you also hear that the government shouldn't be making employment standards. The book makes the point that you've always had labor market standards and that there's broad support for that ever since the Shirtwaist Fire a century ago.
Another objection you hear is that if you try to raise the floor in the labor market, you'll kill jobs. That's what you hear all the time about the minimum wage, but if you review the research on the minimum wage, the effects are a lot less scary than opponents make you believe. And if you look at France and Germany, which have a far lower percentage of workers in low-wage jobs, the employment to population ratio for adults is much better than we have in the United States.
Q.
A.
The book does not take the stance this is all about evil employers. It's much more sympathetic than what you hear from some people. Employers are under intense competitive pressures. There are bad employers out there, there are employers that violate minimum wage and overtime laws, but they're certainly not a majority. The fact that employers are under intense competitive pressures doesn't mean you let standards be driven downward. You want to push the floor up.
Like all of us, employers look for the path of least resistance. The path of least resistance is not to invest in your work force, not to invest in a career ladder, to squeeze on wages and benefits, to make your work force more contingent and flexible.
At the same time, the human resources departments of most firms have been weakened. In many American companies, human resources is seen as the least prestigious function, a residual function. And labor unions are no longer in as strong a position to push for other behavior, to stop this drift downward in employment standards.
Q.
A.
What you need is a strategy, carrot and stick, in setting standards and positive incentives to raise the floor and assistance to firms in doing so.
Government, historically, in the United States has been very influential in setting employment norms. At the turn of the 20th century, it was civil service reform, and that became a model for private-sector corporations. During World War II, the War Labor Board was influential in shaping the labor market and labor peace.
Government can play an important role in incentivizing and modeling good behavior. It can use its zoning power or community benefit agreements so that if someone wants to build a large project and needs zoning approval, the government can set a wage standard as a condition for approval - for the construction jobs as well as the resulting jobs. Or if you use tax incentives to attract companies to your area, it should be required that those companies pay a living wage. A number of states have done that. Or if government outsources jobs, a living-wage standard should be applied to jobs that get contracted out.
There have been a number of experiments at the state level to provide tax incentives to encourage companies to train front-line workers. With training, workers could go from cleaning hotel rooms to being a line cook or waiter.
In the health-care sector, reimbursement schemes put enormous pressure on nursing homes to pay their certified nursing assistants poorly. That's public policy. That's not the market.
In a variety of ways, governments can play a positive role and do so by walking the talk themselves.

HEADLINE: The Only America They've Ever Known

BYLINE: ROY SCRANTON


HIGHLIGHT: After a decade of extremist politics, division and war, what exactly will we be commemorating on Sept. 11?

 BODY:
When I joined the Army almost 10 years ago, I was already an old man - by the measure of my fellow recruits anyway, most of them only 18 or 19. I was all of 25, but it was enough to make a difference. Even though I got used to how my sergeants and lieutenants were often younger than me, I never got used to how young some of my fellow privates and Pfc.'s seemed. They were hardly more than boys, some of them, with bright ruddy cheeks, and bright eyes that grew hard during our year in Iraq. 
Now we're 10 years older. I'm working on a doctorate, helping a professor put together a course on the literature of war. Some of the students in the course - the same age as my fellow soldiers were back then - have been watching the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since they were 8. The single most important political event in their lives was the attack on the World Trade Center. The only America they know is a nation at war.

This is the legacy we've given them: not a national tragedy that saw Americans rise to their best, but a bitter wound that sent us reeling into wasteful, crooked, decade-long wars. I can't separate out the decade of fighting from my own life, from getting older, serving my time in the Army, moving to New York, going back to school - and growing more and more disgusted with extremist show-politics, and more and more hopeless at our disaffected, alienated, intolerant citizenry, numbing itself with Tea Party grotesqueries on one side and "The Daily Show" on the other. 
Once there was a vision of something else. I grew up poor, in a military family, waiting for nuclear war to break out with the Soviet Union. Yet despite that gloom, and the scandals of Iran-Contra, and the age-old corruption of our government, there was something that stirred in me when I stood before the flag, said the pledge of allegiance and came down on those closing lines about our nation being indivisible, "with liberty and justice for all." Even as a child I knew this wasn't a fact, but a promise. It was a promise to be better, to do better. It was a promise to ourselves - and to the future.
Over the years, whether I was marching in protest or going to war, it was because I believed that we make our world together, and that each and every one of us are obliged to chip in: to dissent, when dissent is needed, to fight, to enact the promise of collective democratic self-determination outlined in our Constitution and Declaration of Independence.
The flag to me was a symbol of that unrealized potential. It meant something bigger than me, bigger than you, something more important than making money or a career, something we could build together - something that we could build together, depending and relying on one another - that might make the world a better place. 
Today, this is what I see: a nation wracked by recession and 10 years of war-debt, bled dry by profiteers, where the rich enrich themselves at the expense of the poor and the demagogues and con artists we've elected squander our commonwealth, our treasury and our lifeblood. And as Sept. 11 approaches, I wonder what we will be commemorating on that grim day. 
Now I think of these kids, who watched people cheering in the streets after an elite assassination team killed Osama bin Laden, and wonder what that flag means to them. 
We faced a choice 10 years ago: to follow the example of the people at ground zero, the firefighters, the police, the regular men and women who risked their lives to help total strangers; or to do what we were told: to keep shopping, keep spending, keep oiling the big wheels of capital. The bad news is, most of us picked shopping. The good news is, we face the same choice again right now. We face it every day. 
Our example is our legacy. Ten years from today, let us not look back in shame.

HEADLINE: Serendipity Books, R.I.P.

BYLINE: DAVID STREITFELD


HIGHLIGHT: A legendary bookstore in Berkeley, Calif., closes, another casualty of the shift to e-commerce. 

 BODY:
Who doesn't love buying online? It offers a bigger selection for less money, ordered from the privacy of your home and delivered there too. But if e-commerce is great for consumers, it is more problematic for citizens. The sales tax that people pay in physical stores helps pay for the upkeep of their communities. The physical stores also provide employment; these workers can afford in turn to buy things and thus keep the economy afloat. Few such benefits flow from e-commerce.
California, with a colossal hole in its budget and 12 percent unemployment, is confronting this quandary as it tries to compel Amazon.com to collect sales tax. Amazon is so confident that bargain-hunting consumers will rally to its side that it is essentially ignoring the law. Maybe they will.
But asthe battle between the state and the retailer was heating up late last week, news came that Serendipity Books in Berkeley was closing. Antiquarian stores like Serendipity were once plentiful. They specialized in winnowing the detritus of the past, plucking the important material for collectors, scholars and institutions. Serendipity was for decades one of the best such shops, and eventually one of the last. In the years to come, people will have a hard time appreciating there were such places, where anyone who wanted to could look and learn and buy, or maybe just while away a rainy afternoon. So let's spend a moment giving Serendipity its due.
The store was founded by Peter B. Howard in the early 1960s with the notion that the best bookshop in the world would have one copy of everything. It sometimes seemed as if Serendipity fulfilled this dream. Potential customers were confronted with a warren of rooms, some two stories high, with good books stuffed absolutely everywhere, including in shopping bags blocking the narrow aisles. Although there was clearly an underlying order, its nature was hard to discern; there were no signs. People would wander in a daze, sometimes asking, "Do you sell books here?" They thought it was a library or perhaps a museum.
The lack of direction was on purpose and in earnest. Mr. Howard wanted people to search for books and find not just what they were looking for but the book next to it, which they might want more if they only realized it existed. "The bookstore is an infinite array of material and knowledge of which you know nothing," he said. "If you're focused, you go to the library."
Or, these days, you go online. Serendipity largely ignored the Web
as a publicity and selling device and the Internet returned the favor.
Mr. Howard might have created a wonder-filled shop, but onYelp the reviews were few and grudging. One reviewer complained that prices were too high. Another said the store offered too little when it was buying your old books. Neither seemed to appreciate that the store could exist only because there was a merchant in the middle of these transactions trying to make a living, and that there was a benefit to the community that it was this way.
Mr. Howard bought and sold collections as well as individual books, including the world's greatest assortment of lost race fiction (a peculiar American fixation in the early years of the 20th century; Tarzan was its most famous exemplar); a 5,000-item gathering of material about baseball dating from 1819; proletarian literature from the 1930s; classic film scripts from all eras; geoscience and paleontology published between 1550 and 1850; pioneering collections of fiction and nonfiction about the oil industry and the Vietnam War. The store featured Carl Sandburg's guitar and Jack London's spears. The poetry sections were a trove of obscure versifiers, unrivaled by any store in the country. There were vast holdings of Canadiana, books in Russian from the early Soviet period, every book in seemingly every edition by John Steinbeck, from $20,000 inscribed copies of The Grapes of Wrath to paperback reprints. Mr. Howard believed in volume and breadth.
You needed to know what you were doing to take advantage of Serendipity, which used to be the way the world worked. Finding the books was only the beginning. After you stumbled on things you wanted to take home - perhaps through persistence, perhaps by serendipity - you would be making a mistake to take your choices to the bookkeeper in her alcove, the closest the store had to a checkout till. Instead, the smart customer would take them up to Mr. Howard, pausing first to see if the Giants had won their most recent game.
The fortunes of the team often affected how much he would charge for books. This quirk was so pronounced it was immortalized in print. In Samuel Gottlieb's "Overbooked in Arizona," the tale of a book collector gone mad, the protagonist is driving from Phoenix to Berkeley to buy books at Serendipity when the Giants lose a game they had been winning. He cuts across the median and heads back home, knowing the trip is now in vain.
If your chosen books were already priced, Mr. Howard almost always lowered the sum demanded for each unless he didn't like you. If they were unpriced, four out of five would be less than you hoped while one would be much more. But you had to take all of them if you wanted a similar deal next time. The books would be written up by hand on an invoice, a tedious process but on Saturdays Mr. Howard nourished all comers with pastries and coffee. When the books finally changed hands, money did not necessarily follow. Like a good bar, which in some ways it resembled, Serendipity allowed customers to run a tab and pay more or less when they wanted. As I write this, I owe $388.
Suppose you took a book home and belatedly decided, for whatever reason, you did not want it? All Serendipity catalogs were emblazoned with the remark, "Any book may be returned for any reason." I returned a book. Once. As Mr. Howard complained about my bad faith, I referred to the guarantee. Mr. Howard's wife, Alison, who was listening, responded sweetly: "We said we'd accept back any book. We didn't say we'd do it happily."
Downloading ebooks was nothing like this. Serendipity was a refuge and an education.
And sometimes a pain. Mr. Howard could be a difficult man. "He always had an instant answer he would throw in your face in the manner of some biblical prophet," the bookseller David Mason wrote. Yet he was also wildly generous, a quality never more on display than in his famous biannual parties when the store would be swept clean and a fabulous all-day feast put on, with suckling pigs and fine wine. It was a way of rooting himself in the community. Customers would walk in with an interesting tale and interesting books, and Mr. Howard would buy them. "Because I own the building, I can have a lot of books, and because I have a lot of books in a visible place, things can happen," he said.
Mr. Howard was too irascible to train a successor but when he developed pancreatic cancer two years ago, he began trying to sell the store. The price would have been about the seven-figure sum that it takes to buy a nice house in Berkeley, a pittance really. There were no takers. Who wants a half-million books in the Internet Age?
The bookseller was 72 when he died on March 31, Opening Day, while watching his beloved Giants. He checked out in the bottom of the sixth, when the score was still 0-0 and before the Giants could lose. The store hung on a couple more months as the Howard family considered its options. Late last week, Nancy Kosenka, Mr. Howard's longtime deputy, posted on her Facebook page that Saturday would be it. Sales were brisk. Late in the afternoon, a first-time customer walked in, scanned the shelves in bewilderment and inevitably asked, "Do you sell books here?" Not anymore.

HEADLINE: Papermaker Owned by Cerberus Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Chapter 11 filing by NewPage punctuates a painful investment for the private equity firm, which borrowed heavily to acquire the MeadWestvaco paper mills business in 2005 for $2.3 billion.

 BODY:
8:40 p.m. | Updated 
The NewPage Corporation, the ailing papermaker owned by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday, blaming a sharp decline in the magazine industry, a spike in the cost of raw material and too much debt.
The company, which is based in Miamisburg, Ohio, and has 6,000 workers, will now operate under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while it restructures its balance sheet and seeks to slash its debt, which exceeds $3 billion.
The long-expected Chapter 11 filing in United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware punctuates a painful investment for Cerberus, which borrowed heavily to acquire the MeadWestvaco paper mill business in 2005 for $2.3 billion and renamed it NewPage.
"The company's current capital structure was put in place during a different time with different assumptions," NewPage said in a statement.
NewPage is one of only several multibillion-dollar buyouts struck in the market boom - a list that includes the retailer Linens 'n Things, the music company EMI Group and the aluminum maker Aleris - that have ended in bankruptcy.
During the depths of the financial crisis, many private-equity watchers expected deep misery for the buyout firms that issued more than $1.5 trillion in debt to finance leveraged buyouts since 2003, according to Dealogic. But the number of bankruptcy filings was limited as the capital markets quickly recovered, allowing firms to shore up their companies by repurchasing debt or issuing new equity.
Still, Wednesday's filing provides fodder for critics of the private equity industry who contend leveraged buyouts like the Cerberus takeover of NewPage destroy companies and jobs.
The NewPage filing is the second recent prominent legal case involving Cerberus, the New York investment firm that had ill-fated investments in GMAC and Chrysler. Last month, Cerberus was sued by Innkeepers USA Trust after it backed out of its $1.1 billion acquisition of the hotel company.
After being battered during the financial crisis, and suffering sizable redemptions in its hedge funds, Cerberus has had vast improvements. Among successful investments, the firm has made a killing buying distressed mortgages at the market bottom.
It has already written off its stake in NewPage, which has been a troubled investment from the start. Under private-equity ownership, NewPage, which specializes in coated paper for magazines, has shut factories and slashed jobs. The company operates 16 paper mills from Duluth, Minn., to Rumford, Me.
Cerberus brought in Robert Nardelli, the former head of Home Depot and Chrysler, last year as chairman to help turn the company around. He did not do so, and resigned in May.
NewPage alluded to another reason for the bankruptcy filing: the iPad. While not mentioning the Apple tablet or similar devices by name, the company's bankruptcy papers cite "increases in the use of electronic data transmission and storage" and "an increased demand for electronic reading material."
Now, several private-equity firms and hedge funds that own NewPage's debt - the Avenue Capital Group, Apollo Global Management and Oaktree Capital Management among them - will fight in court to control the company.

HEADLINE: The Last Women Standing on Wall Street

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: With the departure of Bank of America's Sallie Krawcheck, women -- always a rare breed in the upper echelons of Wall Street -- are looking like an endangered species in the executive suites of big banks.

 BODY:
Women -- always a rare breed in the upper echelons of Wall Street -- are looking like an endangered species in the executive suite of big banks.
On Tuesday, Bank of America reshuffled its management team, culling Sallie Krawcheck from its ranks. With her departure, a handful of women will still report directly to the company's chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, but they largely fill top roles in groups that don't produce revenue. Among them: Anne Finucane, the global strategy and marketing officer; Christine Katziff, the corporate general auditor; Andrea Smith, the head of human resources; and Cathy Bessant, the head of global technology and operations.
It is a long-running theme across Wall Street, with the plum spots in investment banking and brokerages most typically held by men. At Goldman Sachs, women make up little more than 12 percent of the partnership, an elite group that includes the firm's most senior executives and biggest stars.
In many ways, the gender imbalance has only grown more uneven since the financial crisis, with a number of notable women leaving their top spots in recent years.
Erin Callan, the chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers, got the boot just months before the investment bank filed for bankruptcy. Zoe Cruz, the co-president of Morgan Stanley, was ousted in a management shake-up in late 2007. Terri Dial lasted just a year as chief executive of Citigroup's consumer business in North America. And Heidi Miller, the head of JPMorgan Chase's international efforts who was once viewed as a potential successor to the chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is set to depart the company early next year.
That is not to say women do not hold some pretty powerful positions in finance.
Earlier this year, the private equity firm Carlyle Group, which just filed to go public, tapped Adena T. Friedman as its chief financial officer. At JPMorgan, Ina Drew, the bank's chief investment officer, sits on the operating committee. In January, Cece Stewart joined Citigroup to head up its consumer and commercial division in the United States. Edith Cooper runs human resources for Goldman Sachs. Ruth Porat is the chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley.
But their status is more the exception than the rule.
In the United States, women account for 2.7 percent of the chief executives in the financial industry, and 16.8 percent of the executive officers, according to a study by Catalyst.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europeans Unite Against Illegal Fishing

BYLINE: DAVID JOLLY


HIGHLIGHT: The Obama administration puts the global cost of illegal fishing to legal fishermen and coastal communities at up to $23 billion of seafood and seafood products annually.

 BODY:
The United States and the European Union announced a bilateral agreement on Wednesday on combating illegal fishing, saying that the practice deprives legitimate fishermen and coastal communities of billions of dollars of revenue each year.
Jane Lubchenco, the administrator of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, and Maria Damanaki, the European Union's commissioner for maritime affairs and fisheries, announced the deal in Washington. The pact calls for cooperation on adopting effective management measures in regional and international organizations to combat illegal fishing and promoting tools that prevent illegal fishing operators from benefiting economically from their activities. The United States and the European Union will also share information on illegal fisheries and "promote the sustainable use of fisheries resources while preserving marine biodiversity,'' the two sides said.
Policymakers argue that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing - known as "I.U.U." fishing or pirate fishing - makes a mockery of national and international laws meant to ensure fish stocks are managed in a sustainable manner.

''Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is one of the most serious threats to American fishing jobs and fishing communities, as well as to the health of the world's oceans,'' Dr. Lubchenco said in a statement. ''International cooperation across oceans will help us maintain a level playing field for our fishermen by strengthening enforcement and preventing illegal fishing.''
According to NOAA, the European Union and the United States rank first and third as the world's top seafood importers, with Japan ranked second. The Obama administration puts the global cost of illegal fishing to legal fishermen and coastal communities at up to $23 billion of seafood and seafood products annually. 
Such numbers are but guesses. As the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization notes, no one knows exactly how much illegal fishing there is because of its very nature. 
''We do know,'' the F.A.O. says, ''that for some important fisheries, I.U.U. fishing accounts for a large percentage of total catches. Even more troubling is that the amount of I.U.U. fishing worldwide appears to be increasing, as I.U.U. fishers try to avoid stricter fishing rules that are being created to deal with downturns (that is, declining catches) in a growing number of fish stocks.''
Environmentalists welcomed the news. Joshua S. Reichert, managing director of the Pew Environment Group, said in a statement that it ''could represent a major turning point for the health of the oceans, communities that depend on fish and the majority of fishermen who play by the rules.''
''Because closing the net on pirate fishing in one area often results in criminals simply moving to another, we look forward to working with the EU and the U.S. to build a global fisheries enforcement system - the only way to truly stop these crimes on a broad scale,'' he said. 
One particularly well-documented example of an out-of-control fishery was described in a 2010 report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. It said that a $4 billion black market in bluefin tuna has able to function partly because of official neglect in European fishing countries.
The United States and the European Union have already taken various measures measures against illegal fishing, the two sides noted, including the former's High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act and European Union rules that block illegal seafood imports without the required certifications. 
Education is also considered a major tool in fighting illegal fishing. Groups like the Friends of the Sea offer information about the problem at their Web sites, and the Marine Stewardship Council tries to help reduce illegal fishing by certifying legitimate fisheries and educating consumers about the most sustainably caught seafood.

HEADLINE: Live Blog: Perry Makes His Debate Debut

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Perry, the Texas governor, is joining seven other Republican presidential candidates for a high-stakes exchange that will kick off the fall campaign season.

 BODY:
10:21 P.M. | That's a Wrap
The debate is over, and this live blog is drawing to a close. Thanks for following the debate tonight with us. We'll be back for the next several debates - two more in September and two in early October. Hope you'll join us again. 
10:20 P.M. | Fact-Check: Who Pays Taxes?
Mr. Romney was asked about the fact that 47 percent of American households pay no federal income taxes, and he replied by complaining that many people do not support "our troops" or roads and schools. The actual figure is 46 percent for 2011, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute think tanks; about 70 percent are households with low-income workers, and the rest are higher-income households whose tax breaks erase their liability.
But those households do pay federal taxes, including payroll taxes and the excise taxes on gasoline and other products that support the federal roads system. And many pay local taxes, including property taxes, that support public schools. 
10:17 P.M. | An Issue That Unites the Field
A pledge to oppose any tax increase, even if accompanied by spending cuts, is one that all of the current Republican candidates - and even some past candidates - can apparently get behind.
At the last debate in Ames, Iowa, when candidates were asked who would reject a deal to raise taxes by $1 for every $10 in cuts, all raised their hands in support, and tonight's debate moderators put the question to Mr. Perry.
"I join my fellow participants," Mr. Perry said.
And Mrs. Bachmann was quick to note that another Republican not currently onstage would have probably joined in the pledge as well - Ronald Reagan. 
10:03 P.M. | Fact-Check: Climate Change
The difference of opinion on climate change and the human contribution to it continued at the debate, with Mr. Huntsman repeating his assertion that 98 percent of scientists believe that the Earth is growing warmer and that human activity is at least partly responsible, a belief that the other candidates do not share.
Mr. Perry repeated his claim that "the science is not settled," despite an overwhelming scientific consensus that global warming is occuring and that human activity - chiefly the burning of fossil fuels and cutting down of tropical forests - is likely to blame. He added that proposed steps to reduce heat-trapping emissions were jeopardizing the economy, even though there are no such regulations in place except two major deals negotiated with the auto industry to produce cleaner and more fuel-efficient vehicles.
Mrs. Bachmann, who has previously asserted that global warming is "manufactured science" and a hoax, again questioned whether human activity was affecting the global climate. She then shifted to an attack on the Environmental Protection Agency, which she claimed was "pursuing a political agenda instead of a scientific agenda." Somewhat incongruously, she also said the president had to suspend an E.P.A. rule that would result in the closure of "potentially" 20 percent of the nation's coal-fired power plants. 
In fact, on Friday, President Obama abandoned a proposed rule that would have reduced permissible ozone levels nationwide. He said the rule would create regulatory uncertainty and economic hardship in some parts of the country, and noted that the ozone standard was due for review in 2013 in any case. No credible study has found that the proposed ozone standard would force the closing of a large number of power plants, although some pending rules governing power plant emissions would probably cause some plants to be retired early. But utilities are planning to close dozens of older plants over the next few years whether the rules are implemented or not, because they are inefficient and cannot meet older environmental rules already on the books.
9:52 P.M. | Perry on Death Penalty Draws Enthusiastic Response
A question to Mr. Perry on his execution record in Texas actually drew applause from the audience. 
Mr. Perry said he had not struggled with the executions that have taken place on his watch. During nearly 11 years in office, Mr. Perry has overseen 234 executions, by far the most of any recent governor in the United States, and has rarely used his power to grant clemency. He has granted 31 death row commutations; most of those - 28 - were the result of a 2005 United States Supreme Court decision banning capital punishment for minors. 
"The state of Texas has a very thoughtful, a very clear process in place," he said. 
Brian Williams of NBC noted the audience's enthusiastic response to the death penalty, and asked Mr. Perry what he made of that.
"I think Americans understand justice," he said.
9:47 P.M. | Gingrich Takes Aim ...
Newt Gingrich wants to fire him. He calls him "inflammatory." And "dangerous." And "antithetical to a free society."
Who? President Obama? 
No. Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
9:44 P.M. | Perry and Global Warming 
On the campaign trail, Mr. Perry has made headlines when he says he does not believe that climate change is man-made, and that the scientific verdict is still out on global warming.
When debate moderators pressed him on the issue, he again stood his ground. And he invoked an unlikely ally - Galileo.
"Galileo got outvoted for a spell," Mr. Perry said.
9:38 P.M. | Santorum Responds
Quick update: Not everyone on the Republican stage stood by quietly after Mr. Huntsman's Afghanistan comments.
Rick Santorum objected, accusing some of his Republican colleagues of favoring isolationism.
"Are we going to go to the isolationist view that some in this party are advocating?" he asked.
9:36 P.M. | Bring Troops Home, Huntsman Says
How times have changed.
Jon M. Huntsman Jr. just said during the Republican debate that the United States should bring all of its troops home from Afghanistan.
That prompted the following response from the other Republican presidential candidates on the stage and the hundreds of Republicans in the audience: the sound of crickets.
Four years ago, such a statement during the Republican debate would have - and did - prompt outrage from Senator John McCain and others.
But now, after the surge in Afghanistan and an economic decline in the United States that has deepened in the last two years, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are clearly taking a back seat.
That's not to say that everyone agrees with Mr. Huntsman. Only Ron Paul would probably agree that an immediate withdrawal was necessary.
But the fact that none of them jumped to condemn the comment was telling.
9:28 P.M. | Perry Versus Rove and Cheney 
It's no secret that Rick Perry and his people don't get along so well with those in the orbit of former President (and Perry predecessor) George W. Bush.
And comments from Mr. Perry may not do anything to heal those political wounds.
Asked about comments by Karl Rove, a top adviser to Mr. Bush, Mr. Perry dismissed Mr. Rove as "over the top for a long time in some of his remarks."
"You know, I'm not responsible for Karl anymore," Mr. Perry said, laughing.
Then, a few moments later, Mr. Perry was asked about remarks from former Vice President Dick Cheney, who disputed Mr. Perry's claim that Social Security is a "Ponzi scheme."
Did Mr. Perry show any deference to the former vice president? Nope.
"If Vice President Cheney or anyone else says that the program that we have in place today, and young people who are paying into that expect that program to be sound and for them to receive benefits when they reach retirement age, that is just a lie," Mr. Perry said. "And I don't care what anyone says."
Apparently not.
9:27 P.M. | Candidates on Immigration
The issue of illegal immigration has been popping up at public events along the campaign trail, and this debate is no exception. 
Noting that Reagan was the last president to sign immigration reform legislation in 1986, Jose Diaz-Balart of Telemundo pressed the candidates on their immigration views.
Mr. Perry, who is the governor of a border state, called for "boots on the ground."
"You can secure the border, but it requires a commitment of the federal government of putting those boots on the ground," he said.
Mr. Romney, meanwhile, called for a trio of solutions - a fence, agents to secure the fence, and turning off what he likes to call "the magnet," referring to the employers that hire illegal immigrants.
"The reason they come in such great numbers is because we've left the magnet on," he said. "Turn the magnet off."
Mr. Gingrich earned applause from the audience when he said, "We should make English the official language" of the United States, and he also suggested that all immigrants be required to learn American history.
Mr. Huntsman, meanwhile, took a slightly more personal tone with the answer, mentioning two of his daughters, who he said came to the United States from India and China.
"I see this issue through their eyes," he said, urging the audience to "remember that we're dealing with human beings."
9:22 P.M. | 'An Abject Liar' 
Mr. Perry just used some of the toughest language of the night in attacking Mr. Obama's immigration policies.
He objected to Mr. Obama's recent comment that the border between Mexico and the United States was more secure than it had ever been.
Mr. Perry said that either the president has "some of the poorest intelligence in the history of America or he was an abject liar."
9:21 P.M. | Fact-Check: Paul on Perry and Clinton Health Care Plan
Turning his fire on a fellow Texan, Mr. Paul criticized Mr. Perry for once writing what he described as "a really fancy letter supporting Hillarycare," referring to the health care legislation that was the top domestic priority of the Clinton administration when it arrived in Washington in 1993.
Mr. Perry did write to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who then headed the Clinton administration task force on overhauling health care, in April 1993. But Mr. Paul's characterization exaggerates what Mr. Perry said and wrongly implies that Mr. Perry, then the agricultural commissioner of Texas, supported the particulars of a health care proposal that did not emerge in full until months later.
In the letter, Mr. Perry writes, "I think your efforts in trying to reform the nation's health care system are most commendable." But his main purpose in writing was to ask Mrs. Clinton and the task force to consider the needs "of the nation's farmers, ranchers, agriculture workers and other members of rural communities."
Such communities, Mr. Perry wrote, "have a high proportion of uninsured people, rising health care costs, and often experience lack of services."
He closed by describing Mrs. Clinton's efforts as "worthy" and encouraging her to contact him. But Mr. Perry did not recommend or endorse any particular proposal, including Mrs. Clinton's.
9:19 P.M. | Fact-Check: Job Creation 
Jobs, jobs, jobs: That is what the first phase of tonight's debate focused on, dominated by the barbs traded by Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney over each other's record of job creation.
Mr. Perry noted that Texas had created a million jobs in the last decade - which is true. According to data payroll survey data collected by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, Texas has added 1,081,900 jobs between December 2000, the month he took office, and July 2011, an 11.62 percent increase for the state.
Mr. Perry also dinged Mr. Romney directly, saying, "We created more jobs in the last three months in Texas than he created in four years in Massachusetts." Assuming Mr. Perry meant May, June, and July of 2011, that part is correct: Texas added 63,200 jobs during those months, while Massachusetts added 45,800 during his four years in office.
But as Mr. Romney pointed out in reply, Texas is not only far larger than Massachusetts, it also has a very different economy, one where growth has been aided by a rising population and an oil and gas boom. 
Mr. Romney also said the unemployment rate in Massachusetts was 4.7 percent at the end of his term in 2006. According to FactCheck.org, unemployment in Massachusetts was 5.3 percent in 2002 when he won office in a recession, lower than the national average, and 5 percent when he left office after 2006, higher than the national average. In his last year as governor, the number of jobs in Massachusetts remained below the state's pre-recession peak, The Boston Globe reported that year. 
And Mr. Romney contrasted his record with President Obama's, noting that Massachusetts had created more jobs while he was governor than the entire country had under Mr. Obama. Since Mr. Obama became president in January 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the country has lost 1,705,000 jobs, versus Massachusetts' 45,800 new jobs from 2003 to 2007. However, the economy has added a total of 2.4 million private-sector jobs over the past 18 months.
9:17 P.M. | Bachmann Overshadowed 
Michele Bachmann has been demoted.
After completely dominating the stage during the June 13 debate in New Hampshire, Mrs. Bachmann seemed to struggle tonight to break through.
Mrs. Bachmann, the representative from Minnesota, has managed to get in a few answers during the debate. But the moderators were clearly focused on Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry - to the detriment of Mrs. Bachmann and the other candidates.
For Mrs. Bachmann, being sidelined during the debate will only add to her campaign's problems. Since winning the Ames Straw Poll in Iowa in August, her campaign has sagged under the weight of Mr. Perry's entrance into the race.
The debate tonight was an opportunity for her to remind Republican activists why they liked her. She tried to do that with her stock answer about "Obamacare," saying that it would take real leadership to get the health care law overturned.
But otherwise, she seemed no more of a presence than the other non-Perry or non-Romney candidates.
That may prove to be a problem going forward.
9:13 P.M. | Fact-Check: Romney on Energy
Mr. Romney said the federal government could bring energy prices down and create jobs by lifting some federal regulations on oil drilling, coal mining and nuclear energy. "We are an energy-rich nation and we're living like an energy-poor nation, and that can't go on," he said.
He said President Obama had halted offshore drilling, blocked construction of new coal plants, slowed development of nuclear plants and failed to develop natural gas trapped in shale formations. These claims are largely untrue.
Mr. Obama declared a moratorium on deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico after the BP accident in 2010, but the government began granting permits again earlier this year and activity is approaching pre-spill levels. In addition, the administration recently announced a major lease sale in the western Gulf of Mexico and gave provisional approval to a Shell project in the Arctic off the coast of Alaska. A number of utilities have canceled plans to build new coal plants, but largely because demand for electricity has slowed, not because of any new federal regulations. Similarly, Mr. Obama has encouraged expansion of nuclear power, but utilities have found it uneconomic. And the government is allowing oil companies to move aggressively to exploit shale gas through hydraulic fracturing.
9:11 P.M. | Perry on Cuts to Texas Schools
Mr. Perry, speaking about state budget cuts, said, "The reductions we put in place were absorbed by our schools." 
The schools might say otherwise. Texas cut $4 billion in state funding and an additional $1.4 billion in discretionary grants to public schools during the latest legislative session - a big hit. 
9:08 P.M. | On the Issues: Energy Policy
Mrs. Bachmann, who has promised to reduce gasoline prices to $2 a gallon, said that unleashing the domestic oil and gas industry from some federal regulations could create 1.2 million jobs, increase oil and gas protection by 50 percent and increase government revenue by $800 billion.
Those figures come directly from a study released earlier Wednesday by the American Petroleum Institute, the main lobby for the oil and gas industry. (In fact, the A.P.I. study said that loosening regulations on where and under what conditions companies can drill would create 1.4 million, not 1.2 million, new jobs over the next 7 years.) The study was conducted by the Scottish consulting firm Wood McKenzie and was paid for by the petroleum institute. 
The study presumes that the federal government would return leasing in the Gulf of Mexico to levels seen before the Deepwater Horizon explosion and spill, allow significantly expanded drilling in the Arctic Ocean and approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline from oil sands in Canada to refineries in Oklahoma and Texas. The study also presumes that federal regulations on use of the technique known as hydraulic fracturing to drill for natural gas would be eased. The Obama administration has taken steps toward all approving all these measures but has not moved quickly enough to satisfy the oil lobby.
9:05 P.M. | Fact-Check: Is Social Security a 'Ponzi Scheme'?
Mr. Perry stood by his characterization of Social Security, saying, "You cannot keep the status quo in place and call it anything other than a Ponzi scheme." 
The metaphor is a false one, because Ponzi schemes leave nothing to the investors. Current government projections have Social Security exhausting its reserves by 2037, absent any changes, but show that the payroll tax revenues coming in would cover more than three-quarters of benefits to recipients then.
9:00 P.M. | Romney Attacks Perry on Social Security
One of the most critical questions for Mr. Perry going into this debate was how he would handle his past comments about Social Security, which he has called a "failure" and a "Ponzi scheme."
His decision? Double down on the criticism in the face of questioning.
Mr. Perry said he did not want to "go back and change 70 years" of the program. But he repeated his claim that it was a "monstrous lie" to tell young people that the program will be there for them when they retire.
But if Mr. Perry thought that he could explain his comments away that way, Mr. Romney was having none of it. In one of the most direct attacks yet, Mr. Romney accused Mr. Perry of telling "tens of millions of Americans" that Social Security is a failure.
"Our nominee has to be someone who isn't committed to abolish Social Security but is committed to saving Social Security," Mr. Romney said. "I will never say by any measure it is a failure."
8:57 P.M. | Reagan Watch Revisited
No sooner had we begun to worry about the frequency and caliber of Reagan shout-outs at his namesake library than we realized that the Gipper would be all right after all.
His name began to pop up as the debate wore on, and the hosts also played a tribute video in his honor. When the video was over, the cameras cut to Nancy Reagan sitting in the audience, regal in a red blazer, and the audience applauded. 
8:54 P.M. | Perry Doesn't Hold Fire on Social Security
Mr. Perry doesn't balk at using the term "Ponzi scheme" to describe Social Security - before the debate, there had been questions about how tough he'd be on the entitlement program, since his campaign has in recent weeks seemed to back away from that term. 
But the Texas governor came out swinging with it tonight: "Maybe it's time to have some provocative language in this country." He also took a jab at Karl Rove, the Republican strategist who earlier today criticized Mr. Perry's views on Social Security as "toxic." Mr. Perry said Mr. Rove had "been over the top for a long time in some of his remarks. I'm not responsible for Karl anymore." 
8:50 P.M. | Fact-Check: Bachmann on Health Care Law 
In her critique of President Obama's health care law, Representative Michele Bachmann said the measure was eliminating jobs, citing a study from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
But the claim, which Mrs. Bachmann made in more specific terms at the last Republican debate, significantly overstates the conclusions of the study, which said the law would have a "small" impact on the
overall labor force because it might cause some workers to reduce their hours or retire earlier.
According to an analysis from Politifact.org, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that the expansion of government-subsidized health care
would cause some low-wage workers who are eligible for Medicaid to pull back from the labor market. In addition, some workers might retire earlier than normal because the law provides more protections, like limiting how much companies can charge older people for health insurance and requiring coverage of pre-existing conditions.
But those actions would be voluntary; they do not represent jobs that were "killed" by employers responding to higher health care costs, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
8:48 P.M. | Perry Versus Paul
Tension in Texas?
It may not end up being the final face-off of the 2012 campaign, but there's clearly not a lot of love between Mr. Perry and Mr. Paul.
Mr. Paul has aired an ad noting Mr. Perry's support for a young Al Gore. Mr. Perry has cited a letter, written by a frustrated Mr. Paul in the 1980s, in which he quit the Republican Party, citing the failures of Reagan's agenda.
That animosity spilled over into the debate, with both men repeating their charges. Mr. Paul, in particular, sought to explain himself, because the debate was taking place in a library dedicated to Reagan (and Mrs. Reagan was sitting in the front room.)
"In the 1980s, we spent too much, we taxed too much, and we built up our deficits and it was a bad scene," Mr. Paul explained. 
8:45 P.M. | Reagan Watch
Conspicuously absent at tonight's debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Library: references to Reagan himself.
Normally, any debate at the Reagan Library is full of obligatory allusions to and appreciations of Reagan, an icon of the Republican Party whose name and principles are already being trotted out on the campaign trail by the presidential hopefuls. But tonight, the debate got off to such a lively start - with the candidates turning on each other (much to Mr. Gingrich's chagrin) and on the president - that Reagan largely fell by the wayside. So far, his name has hardly been mentioned.
Still, that didn't stop some of the candidates from linking themselves to Reagan in the run-up to the debate.
Representative Ron Paul of Texas released a commercial scheduled to run twice nationally during the debate, which touted Mr. Paul's support for Reagan while attacking Mr. Perry for supporting Al Gore, a Democrat, during his 1988 campaign for president. 
"Now, America must decide who to trust - Al Gore's Texas cheerleader, or the one who stood with Reagan," the spot concludes. 
And Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for Mr. Perry, made sure to tell MSNBC that the Texas governor had voted for Reagan in both 1980 and 1984 - even when Mr. Perry was running as a Democrat for state representative in 1984.
Reagan's presence was certainly felt in other ways at the debate in Simi Valley. The soda machine at the library features a bucolic scene of horses from Reagan's ranch with a banner reading "Reagan Country," condiments in Reagan's Country Cafe sit under the watchful eye of Reagan rowing a straw-hatted Nancy Reagan in a canoe, and the museum shop is filled with Reagan paraphernalia - including, of course, fistfuls upon fistfuls of jellybeans. 
8:37 P.M. | Nothing Unites Like Blaming the Media
Newt Gingrich is running for president. But he's also running against the media.
Mr. Gingrich, the former House speaker, has found a successful attack line at these debates, accusing the news media of trying to foment disagreement among the Republican contenders.
He seized on the theme tonight when John Harris of Politico asked him about the apparent disagreement among the candidates on health policy.
"I'm frankly not interested in your effort to get Republicans fighting with each other," said Mr. Gingrich, adding later that he would "repudiate every effort of the news media" to foster disagreement.
"The fact is every person up here understands that Obamacare is a disaster," he said, his voice rising.
Is that a winning strategy? Mr. Gingrich gets big applause every time he uses the line. But it's not a particularly effective way to draw distinctions with his rivals.
8:36 P.M. | A Two-Man Debate?
If there was any question as to who Mr. Perry thinks his opponent is, it's pretty clear after just 22 minutes: Mr. Romney wins the prize.
The Texas governor went after Mr. Romney directly on jobs, and when the subject turned to health care, he was the only one to take a direct shot atMr. Romney's record in Massachusetts.
"I think it was a great opportunity to see what will not work, which is an individual mandate," Mr. Perry said of Mr. Romney's health care plan. Later, he added: "They don't want a health care plan like Mr. Romney put in place in Massachusetts."
The back and forth helps cement the idea that the race is heading toward a two-man contest.
8:34 P.M. | Perry Slams Romney on Health Care
Mr. Perry got the opportunity to slam Mr. Romney's health care plan, which he has compared, to the chagrin of the former Massachusetts governor, to the federal health care law. (Incidentally, Mr. Romney likes to distance his plan from Mr. Obama's, even though the state plan is largely seen as the model for the federal law.) Mr. Perry talked about his plan to try to turn over the purse strings of Medicaid to the states, but he carefully avoided using the word "Medicare," which he also has proposed handing to the states, which could have the potential to alarm older voters. 
Mr. Perry skirted a question about why Texas has the highest rate of uninsured people. The state has consistently slashed budgets and reduced Medicaid rates, and has steered clear of a public insurance marketplace. It has one of the lowest Medicaid eligibility rates for very poor adults nationally. 
8:25 P.M. | Prepared for the Attacks
That didn't take long.
Thanks to NBC's Brian Williams, it took only moments for Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry to clash over their job creation records while serving as governors.
The task before both men: find a memorable way to get their campaign message across. And boy, were they prepared. Within moments, the retorts were flying. 
Mr. Romney noted that Texas has economic advantages, like no income tax and a right-to-work law. "Governor Perry doesn't believe that he created those things," Mr. Romney said. "If he did, it would be like Al Gore saying he created the Internet."
Mr. Perry quickly shot back: "Michael Dukakis created created jobs three times faster than you did." 
The lines are memorable, and could help both men underline their arguments. Mr. Romney wants to put the focus on his experience in the private sector. Mr. Perry wants to undercut Mr. Romney's experience as a Massachusetts governor.
Mr. Williams said, "Nice to see everyone came prepared for tonight's conversation."
8:23 P.M. | Gingrich on Perry
Despite his comments to the contrary, Mr. Gingrich wrote a foreword to Mr. Perry's federalism book, "Fed Up," that was largely glowing about Texas' economic record. 
8:17 P.M. | It's the Romney and Perry Show!
Mr. Romney has come out swinging, referring to Mr. Perry as a career politician. Mr. Perry fired back, criticizing Mr. Romney's job-creating record in Massachusetts. 
It also appears that there have been a lot of job creation conversations going on in the candidates' debate prep, with references to former Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts and former President George W. Bush. Mr. Romney's Al Gore Internet reference was a loaded one; in his Democratic years, Mr. Perry was a big backer of Mr. Gore's 1988 presidential bid. 
8:10 P.M. | Perry Finesses Answer on Texas Job Growth Numbers
Mr. Perry's response to the first question was pretty predictable - he sought to impress with Texas' job growth numbers, but didn't answer the second half of the question - about staggeringly low high school completion rates, and staggering numbers of people living or working below minimum wage. 
Texas ranks last or next to last in many of those categories. 
8:08 P.M. | Debate Time, Everyone
Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, will make his debate debut tonight, joining seven other Republican presidential candidates for a high-stakes exchange that will kick off the fall campaign season.
The debate begins at 8 p.m. Eastern time on MSNBC and can be viewed here on The Caucus. (We previewed the debate this morning and offered a sense of what we'll be watching for.)
It will be Mr. Perry's first presidential debate after joining the race three weeks ago. But his quick leap to the top of the polls has made him the likely target for rhetorical attacks by rivals eager for attention.
For Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, the debate could be a chance to reclaim the top spot in the nomination battle. But to do that, Mr. Romney will have to sharpen the contrast with Mr. Perry while keeping the focus on President Obama and the country's unemployment crisis.
And for the other candidates, the debate provides a much-needed opening to break through the Internet-fueled clutter of news in front of a national audience. But to do that, the candidates - Michele Bachmann, Ron Paul, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., Rick Santorum, Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich- will have to say or do something significant.
We will be live-blogging the debate, looking for those moments. Come back here at the start of the debate for two hours of rapid-fire politics.

HEADLINE: Republican Debate: Five Things to Watch

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: What to watch for during the Republican presidential debate on Wednesday night.

 BODY:
The Republican presidential debates of 2011 have served as high-stakes introductions for several of the party's Oval Office hopefuls as the Republican field slowly expanded this summer. 
Now it's Rick Perry's turn. 
On Wednesday evening, the Texas governor will face off against seven other candidates - Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman, Ron Paul, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum - during a debate at the Reagan library in Simi Valley, California.
But none of his rivals will be under the microscope - or wearing as large a target - as Mr. Perry. In three short weeks since becoming a candidate, Mr. Perry has become the new front-runner and the media focus on his record and his comments has robbed the other candidates of political oxygen.
That could spell a more spirited debate on Wednesday as the candidates elbow for attention. Here are five things to watch for during the two-hour show.
1. How Does Perry Perform?. A veteran politician, Mr. Perry's stump speech is polished and his manner is easygoing after just weeks on the campaign trail. That has raised expectations for the governor's debating performance on Wednesday night, and has led the governor's aides to downplay his skill behind a lectern.
But beyond style, Mr. Perry is likely to be confronted with a series of substantive questions that could affect the public's early perception of his candidacy. His writings about Social Security, gays, guns, religion and abortion are likely to be prime targets for the NBC and Politico journalists who are hosting the forum.
And his rivals may decide that the best way to get the camera to swing in their direction is to attack Mr. Perry. That could come from Mrs. Bachmann, whose struggling campaign has lost momentum - and a campaign manager - since Mr. Perry entered the race. Or it could come from Mr. Huntsman, whose poll numbers are in the basement.
2. Romney-Perry Smackdown. The most watched-for clash, however, is the one that might materialize between Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney. With Mrs. Bachmann fading in the polls (and with Sarah Palin still on the sidelines), attention is increasingly focused on the possibility of a two-person race between the two men.
After weeks of completely ignoring his rivals, Mr. Romney has altered his stump speech to question Mr. Perry's qualifications. His new line attacks Mr. Perry's decade as governor of Texas by saying that "career politicians got us into this mess. Career politicians aren't going to get us out."
That line is almost sure to escape Mr. Romney's lips, perhaps during an opening statement. But will he get tougher than that and attack Mr. Perry directly? That may depend on how Mr. Perry acts. The brash, Texas politician has shown less hesitance to focus his commentary directly at Mr. Romney, saying that "while he was the governor of Massachusetts he didn't create many jobs." 
3. Jobs, jobs, jobs. The president's looming jobs speech all but ensures that topic will play a central role in Wednesday's debate, even though the speech was moved to Thursday night.
The moderators of the debate are sure to ask all of the candidates for their plans to create jobs and turn the economy around. That will give each one an opportunity to spell out what they are for, and another opportunity to bash Mr. Obama's economic policies.
Mr. Romney on Tuesday announced a 59-point plan that he said would generate jobs and help the economy recover. It is almost a certainty that he will try to mention at least some of the 59 on Wednesday. (Mr. Romney is a fan of PowerPoint presentations, but the rules of the debate probably do not allow any multimedia props.)
All of the candidates recognize that confronting the jobs crisis is an opportunity for the Republicans as anger and frustration over the issue has helped drive down Mr. Obama's poll numbers in recent months.
But the issue is not one that provides much contrast between the candidates. One exception is Ron Paul, whose libertarian views on the best economic path forward often make him the outlier on the stage.
4. Reagan's legacy. It has almost become a cliche for leading Republican politicians to claim his mantle. But it is especially true at a debate hosted at a library dedicated to Mr. Reagan's presidency. And Nancy Reagan, his wife, is expected to be at the debate, probably in the front row.
But even Mr. Reagan is not a subject that is free from division, as was proved on Tuesday by a spat between the two Texans, Mr. Paul and Mr. Perry.
Mr. Paul ran a television ad in Iowa and New Hampshire that compares himself to Mr. Reagan, saying both men were considered unelectable. He notes his own support for Mr. Reagan's campaign and accuses Mr. Perry of supporting the early campaigns of Al Gore. 
"Al Gore found a cheerleader in Texas named Rick Perry. Rick Perry helped lead Al Gore's campaign to undo the Reagan revolution," Mr. Paul's ad says.
Mr. Perry's campaign shot back quickly, unearthing a letter that Mr. Paul wrote in 1987 in which he resigns from the Republican party. "Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party have given us skyrocketing deficits, and astoundingly a doubled national debt," Mr. Paul wrote in 1987. A spokesman for Mr. Perry said that "Rep. Paul's letter is a broadside attack on every element of President Reagan's record and philosophy."
With that as a backdrop, expect a bit of talk about Mr. Reagan at the debate.
5. Tea Party. If the Labor Day weekend proved anything, it is that the Republican candidates for president are still eager to woo the Tea Party movement that proved to be a force in politics during the 2010 midterm elections.
Mr. Romney, who had not embraced the movement as openly as many of his rivals, spent the weekend at a New Hampshire rally for a Tea Party group and attended a forum in South Carolina sponsored by the state's leading Tea Party politicians. Ms. Palin also spoke to Tea Party rallies in Iowa and New Hampshire over the weekend. 
The question may be how much the candidates put that effort on hold Wednesday night in front of an audience on MSNBC that might not have much in common with the Tea Party members. (Just a few days later, in Florida, CNN is co-hosting another debate with a national Tea Party group.)
QUESTION FOR READERS: What part of Mr. Perry's record do you think needs exploration by the journalists and his rivals on Wednesday night?

HEADLINE: U.S. Slips to Fifth Place On Competitiveness List

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
LONDON -- The United States is slipping and emerging markets are improving, but European economies still dominate the list of the most competitive economies in the world, according to a World Economic Forumreport released Wednesday. 
For the third consecutive year, Switzerland ranked first in the forum's annual competitiveness survey, which assesses countries based on 12 categories including innovation, infrastructure and the macroeconomic environment.
The United States, which topped the list in 2008, continued its decline, also for the third year in a row, falling one place to fifth. The weaker performance was attributed to economic vulnerabilities as well as ''some aspects of the United States' institutional environment,'' notably low public trust in politicians and concerns about government inefficiency.
Singapore overtook Sweden to claim the second position. But perhaps surprisingly, given the crisis of confidence that continues to plague the European financial system, Western European countries dominated the survey's top 10 economies.
Behind Sweden, Finland ranked fourth and Germany was sixth, followed by the Netherlands and Denmark. Britain was 10th; France was 18th and indebted Greece slid to 90th.
The results show that while competitiveness in advanced economies has stagnated over recent years, it has improved in many emerging markets, the Geneva-based forum said.
''Much of the developing world is still seeing relatively strong growth, despite some risk of overheating, while most advanced economies continue to experience sluggish recovery, persistent unemployment and financial vulnerability, with no clear horizon for improvement,'' Klaus Schwab, founder and chairman of the forum, said in a statement.
China, ranked 26th and up one place from a year earlier, was the highest placed of the large developing economies. Among the other major emerging economies, South Africa was 50th, Brazil 53rd, India 56th and Russia 66th.
Among major Asian economies, Japan ranked ninth and Hong Kong 11th. Qatar was the highest ranked country in the Middle East, at 14th, followed by Saudi Arabia at 17th. The United Arab Emirates stood at 27th.
The rankings are calculated from both publicly available data and a survey of more than 14,000 executives in 142 economies. Together they form an index, which was introduced in 2004. The index takes account of 12 categories: institutions; infrastructure; economic environment; health and primary education; higher education and training; goods market efficiency; labor market efficiency; financial market development; technological readiness; market size; business sophistication; and innovation.
''For the recovery to be put on a more stable footing, emerging and developing economies must ensure that growth is based on productivity enhancements,'' said Xavier Sala-i-Martin, a professor of economics at Columbia and co-author of the report. ''Advanced economies, many of which struggle with fiscal challenges and anemic growth, need to focus on competitiveness-enhancing measures in order to create a virtuous cycle of growth and ensure solid economic recovery.''

HEADLINE: Job Program for the Supercommittee: The Congressional deficit panel would be far more useful if it expanded its vision to job growth

 BODY:
Just in time to be irrelevant to the nation's most pressing task, the Congressional ''supercommittee'' officially starts work on Thursday to come up with a plan to cut $1.5 trillion from the deficit. Fortunately, a few Democrats are trying to steer the committee toward the far more practical goal of creating jobs and stimulating the down-bound economy. If they succeed, there may still be a chance for the group to play a useful role. 
The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was the misbegotten product of the debt-ceiling crisis. The intent was to take the responsibility for vast spending decisions out of the normal Congressional process and place it into the hands of 12 members, evenly divided by party and chamber. The group can reduce the deficit any way it likes: cutting domestic or social-insurance programs, raising taxes, slashing the military budget. Congress then gets an up-or-down vote on the group's recommendation, and if the answer is no, or the committee fails to come up with at least $1.2 trillion in cuts, there will be an automatic, equal cut, a prospect abhorred by both parties.
But the committee is confined to reducing the deficit, and nothing more -- a mandate that the White House wanted Americans to believe was a compromise to ward off Republican demands to cut spending by far more than $1.2 trillion. Actually, it is a product of the wrongheaded view that all the country's economic problems are caused by government debt and spending.
Since that bad deal was struck, darkening economic news has pushed the public conversation back where it belongs: on jobs. And yet the committee is preparing to drain a huge amount of Congressional energy and focus in the wrong direction, on whether to preserve fundamental government programs, stifling the hopes for new efforts to put people back to work.
To correct that, Representative John Larson of Connecticut, the Democratic caucus chairman, has introduced legislation that would require the committee to produce a job creation plan alongside its deficit blueprint. He has suggested adding four members to the committee to take on the extra work, or alternatively creating a parallel committee with similar powers that would focus solely on jobs.
Mr. Larson's legislation would require the committee to come up with plans that would ideally reduce the jobless level to around 5.5 percent, and would give the plans the same expedited Congressional procedure that will be used to cut the deficit. If a single plan won a majority vote on the committee, it would go to the House and the Senate for an up-or-down vote; if not, all jobs plans considered by the panel would be presented to Congress for votes.
Adding jobs to the committee's mandate has already been rejected by the Republicans who run the House. They refuse to veer from their single-minded goal of cutting spending, blind to any plan that might improve the economy, because that might improve President Obama's re-election chances. Democrats are right to present the public with the kind of contrast that Mr. Obama would do well to emulate. The best way to reduce the deficit is to do everything possible to increase employment.

HEADLINE: The Endless Runway

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
THIS summer, one of the hottest attractions in Paris was the Madame Gres exhibition at the Musee Bourdelle. Gres was an inscrutable genie of haute couture whose weird demise in 1993 (her only child kept the news of her death secret for more than a year) capped one of the strangest, most productive lives in fashion. I know of several American designers who went out of their way to catch the show before it closed in late July.
Gres was obsessed with craft, but in contrast to the methods of designers of the last 15 years, she did not create gimmick-ridden clothes. For all the fabric that went into her pleated dresses, there was a sublime economy to the form, a point reinforced by the bare-bones style of the exhibition. The curator, Olivier Saillard, the director of the Musee Galliera, said the cost was about 10,000 euros, or less than $15,000. That's a pittance. He could have found big-name sponsors, but he didn't want them. Corporate money has stultified fashion, pushing extravagance and disregarding ethics. 
No wonder the clothes grabbed people. Because, whatever their other qualities -- great technique, rigor -- they were clothes that women could imagine wearing. ''With Madame Gres, we discover that clothes are stronger than fashion,'' Mr. Saillard said.
Many designers are coming to that conclusion. It's not simply that they lack the heart and imagination of Alexander McQueen, or the plodding all-night patience of Azzedine Alaia. Nor can it be said that Mr. McQueen's suicide or the flameout of John Galliano at Dior marked the defeat of runway theatrics and the romance of a few hard-edged English boys.
The fact is, some forms just become worn out. With one or two exceptions -- namely, the tight staging of Marc Jacobs and Miuccia Prada -- the spectacle has become a habit that audiences are ready to quit. And though he is not a showman, there is a growing impatience with Nicolas Ghesquiere. His experimental treatment of materials at Balenciaga has been exciting to behold, and necessary, but more and more the effect is like jumping on a spring-shot mattress. What happened to the cool street chic of Mr. Ghesquiere of a decade ago, when you actually saw women wearing his clothes?
People who followed his career from the start probably appreciate his technical leaps and are willing to indulge him for the sake of creative freedom and the sheer hope of being knocked off their chairs. That's why Rei Kawakubo is still such a force. but I suspect that our extremely materialistic culture, with the grab-and-go mentality fostered by the Web, just makes new fans itch for something to wear.
Though Mr. McQueen, with the zeal of a brat, grounded some of his best ideas (the bumsters, for example) in the dirtiness of the street, designers in the last decade have generally lost contact with that primal force. They also stopped designing with a specific female body in mind, any female body, and instead came out with cloying art pieces (Haider Ackermann) or flat-looking abstractions of the country-club type or rock babe.
There are signs, though, that the situation is changing. For one, designers like Raf Simons of Jil Sander and Phoebe Philo of Celine have modestly narrowed their vision to a clean, dynamic tailoring, and as such have had a major influence on the industry.
There might be a feel-good hint of nostalgia in their collections -- in Mr. Simons's classy, late '50s ski looks for fall, in Ms. Philo's occasional hippie-chick ponchos -- but they are not taking us on a time-killing ride. Though I sometimes suspect that behind Ms. Philo's cool English exterior is a crazy lady besieged by too many choices, she manages to be incredibly precise on the runway. Mr. Simons also has that economy.
In each city there are must-see collections. (Years ago, Karl Lagerfeld, addressing the chronic lament that couture was dying, said that in every era fashion has relied on a few good designers to keep it interesting. He was probably including himself, but he was right.)
In New York, the list includes Mr. Jacobs, because even if there is a certain predictability to his shows -- the novel set, the monotonous march of the supermodels, the top-to-toe styling -- his collections remain a remarkably personal take on the moment. You want to know what's going on in his head.
I also like New York designers who don't fit comfortably in a genre, like Narciso Rodriguez and Francisco Costa, neither of whom is strictly a minimalist, or Sophie Theallet, who knows the difference between something being well made and too polished, and at least in terms of her work ethic would probably prefer to share Madame Gres's cloak of anonymity. Also on the must-see list are the Proenza Schouler designers, Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, whose collections over the last three or four seasons have become deeper and more sophisticated.
But more and more, New York represents a shift toward young, muscular talent with a street feel: Alexander Wang, Joseph Altuzarra, Prabal Gurung.
In Milan, the two shows that get everybody's attention, hands down, are Prada and Jil Sander. Ms. Prada's collections tend to pick their way through an odd bunch of references, with the designer smoothly telling the huddled reporters backstage that, really, she was just interested in exploring female beauty. We still love her anyway. And though I am personally allergic to Marni, I'm always curious to see what Consuelo Castiglioni will do.
London talent is so varied and unpredictable that it can't really be pinned down. Christopher Kane and Burberry's Christopher Bailey? Of course they count. But, again, what interests me now is an economy of form -- clear choices, no faked references -- and so I'm eager to see the clothes of Marios Schwab and Thomas Tait.
Aside from Celine, the other top shows in Paris are Stella McCartney (she was an early advocate of the brisk sportswear look), Balenciaga, Givenchy, Chanel, Lanvin, Yves Saint Laurent (despite the jumpiness of the designer Stefano Pilati), Comme des Garcons and McQueen. I am a huge fan of Sarah Burton, the creative director of McQueen. In a way, she represents the divide between the near past and the present. She has McQueen's respect for craft, but the aesthetic of a big visionary show is dead, and Ms. Burton now has the opportunity to move closer to the human form and design honestly beautiful clothes.

HEADLINE: Rising Fears Of Recession

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
If history is a guide, the odds that the American economy is falling into a double-dip recession have risen sharply in recent weeks and may even have reached 50 percent.
Economies have a strong self-reinforcing nature. When people are optimistic, they spend, which begets hiring and then more spending. When people are anxious, they pull back, which leads to a cycle of hiring freezes and further anxiety that often lasts for months.
The United States appears to have entered some version of the vicious cycle. Most ominously, job growth has slowed to a pace that typically signals the start of a recession. 
Over the last 50 years, every time that job growth has been as meager as it has been over the last four months, the economy has been headed toward recession, in a recession or in the immediate aftermath of one. From early 2010 through this spring, by contrast, employment was growing fast enough to make the economy look as if it were in a recovery, albeit a modest one.
''The chances that we are in something that is going to feel like a recession are close to 100 percent,'' said Joshua Shapiro of MFR Inc. in New York, who has diagnosed the economy more accurately than many other forecasters lately. ''Whether we reach the technical definition'' -- which is determined by a committee of academic economists and based on gross domestic product, employment and other factors -- ''I think is probably close to 50-50.''
A double dip would present obvious political problems for President Obama, whose approval ratings have already fallen below 50 percent and who is scheduled to give a speech to Congress on Thursday outlining a new jobs plan. A weak economy also could threaten incumbents of both parties in Congress, whose approval rating has hovered around 15 percent in recent polls.
More immediately, the main significance of the recent slowdown is that the economy may not merely be going through a weak phase that will soon pass, as many policy makers hope. Instead, history seems to suggest that the situation will probably get worse before it gets better.
In a recent research paper, Jeremy J. Nalewaik, a Federal Reserve economist, described this concept as ''stall speed'': once the economy slows markedly, it often continues to do so. (He did not make a forecast.) In the other two severe downturns of the last 80 years -- in the 1930s and the early 1980s -- the economy suffered just such a stall and fell into a second recession not long after the first.
Today, Europe's troubles continue to weigh on banks and financial markets. Consumers remain indebted, and the housing market remains depressed. State and local governments continue to cut jobs, aggravating the problems in the private sector. Congress is unlikely to pass a major jobs bill.
The economy could, of course, defy history and turn around soon. Eventually, consumers will begin spending more on houses, cars, appliances and services, and employers will begin hiring in large numbers. A further decline in gas prices, which have generally been falling, would particularly help households.
But the latest indicators suggest that even if the economy does not continue to worsen, it appears to be too weak to add enough jobs each month -- roughly 125,000 -- even to keep pace with population growth. Anything less, and the share of the population that is employed will continue to fall.
Over the last four months, job creation has slowed to an average of just 40,000 jobs, or 0.1 percent, according to the Labor Department's survey of employers. The last time such a meager increase did not coincide with a recession came in the 1950s.
The department's survey of households presents a somewhat sunnier picture, but it is a smaller and noisier survey. And even it shows an unemployment rate of 9.1 percent last month, up from 8.8 percent in March. In the past, an increase of three-tenths of a percentage point has typically coincided with a recession.
James D. Hamilton, an economist at the University of California, San Diego, who has studied forecasting, said he believed the most likely case was still that the economy would avoid a double-dip recession. He also noted that the recent job growth numbers were estimates still subject to revision, although the unemployment rate is not.
''It's extremely hard to predict recessions,'' Mr. Hamilton said. The more important point, he added, was that the economy remained very weak, and weaker than people had expected.
Perhaps the best sign of how difficult it is to know the economy's direction is that, as a group, the nation's professional forecasters have failed to predict all the recessions since the 1970s, according to data kept by the Philadelphia Fed. In the last 30 years, the average probability they put on the economy lapsing into recession has never risen above 50 percent -- until the economy was already in a recession.
The forecasters, on Wall Street and elsewhere, are not blind to economic change; they just tend to underestimate its severity. When the economy is on the verge of recession, the average recession odds from forecasters tend to rise to about 30 percent. There has been only one occasion, in 1988, when the chances rose above 30 percent and a recession did not follow.
And what do many forecasters say are the prospects of a double-dip recession now? Somewhere between 25 and 40 percent.

HEADLINE: In the East Village, a Poetic Mentor Minces Few Words

BYLINE: By CHADWICK MOORE

 BODY:
The woman climbs the stairs in the shabby East Village tenement and enters while Larry Fagin is finishing a call with another poetry student.
''How's Aiden? Is he old enough to go to college yet?'' Mr. Fagin asks the man on the phone, making small talk. He motions for the woman to take a seat at the dining table, where her most recent poem is up on his computer screen. ''O.K. Send money,'' he barks and hangs up.
Mr. Fagin turns his attention to the woman, Jennifer Kietzman, 40, a due-diligence investigator from Borough Park, Brooklyn, with a full head of wild red curls. She leans over his shoulder as he dives into a wham-bam frenzy of changing word tenses, deleting entire lines and replacing words with synonyms.
He stops at the second line of her lengthy prose poem. ''No, horrible. Bad poetry. That's the worst line you've ever written.'' He highlights the line and slams the delete key. ''Goodbye!'' 
''I liked it,'' Ms. Kietzman says in a shrinking voice and leans back in her chair. ''Well, that's O.K.,'' she says. Mr. Fagin is not done. The stuff about Ms. Kietzman's family, he says, ''has got to stop. They're cows. They're furniture.'' Highlight, slam delete key. ''Goodbye!''
Four stories above East 12th Street, down the hall from Allen Ginsberg's old apartment, one of the East Village's last standing bohemians soldiers on.
Mr. Fagin, 74 years old, second-generation beat, New York School veteran, friend of Ted Berrigan, publisher of Ashbery, lives with his wife, Susan Noel, also a writer, in adjoining rent-controlled apartments in the building near Avenue A.
Although Mr. Fagin -- a handsome, T-shirt-and-jeans kind of guy with a square build, tousled silver hair and a cheerful air of insubordination -- now collects Social Security, his chief source of income for decades has been giving private creative-writing lessons and editing and producing small magazines and chapbooks from the work of students and friends.
He reports that despite former teaching gigs at the New School and St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery, neither he nor his wife have held anything resembling a straight job for any substantial period of time, though he has worked, he says, as a librarian, a reader to the blind and a ''black marketer.''
''I try to be disaffiliated from bourgeois society,'' Mr. Fagin said the other day, ''like most good people. Because all we have are these very few, precious days.''
Mr. Fagin's precious days typically begin with two hours of writing poetry, breakfast at the Neptune diner around the corner on First Avenue and a quick return to what he calls his ''wonderland'': the two-bedroom walk-up (bathtub under the kitchen counter) lined with books, art, movies and music that he rented in 1968 for $58.50 a month with an old girlfriend.
He now pays about $150 a month for his warren in what he calls the ''Chelsea Hotel of the East Village.'' Ginsberg lived there for more than 20 years.
''Allen made the best chicken soup,'' said Ms. Noel, a platinum blonde with black-rimmed cat-eye glasses, apple red lipstick and a strong residue of punk rock vitriol.
''He really energized the building,'' Mr. Fagin said.
''Like a battery,'' Ms. Noel added.
At any given time, Mr. Fagin has 20 to 30 students as diverse as a middle-aged real estate lawyer in Denver, a Bard undergraduate and a 75-year-old retiree in Florida. He charges $75 an hour, whether in person or on the phone, and has taught students as far away as China. Ms. Kietzman recently paid him $600 to produce 150 copies of a chapbook of her poetry and send them to his mailing list of writers and editors.
Mr. Fagin's teaching approach focuses on paring poems down to their essence.
''Deep down I don't care about the writer; I only care about what's written,'' he said. ''Everyone is a terrible judge of their own abilities, and it takes someone else to say, 'Hey this is great, or this is crap.' And to say ultimately: 'Hey you don't matter. What you're making, the object, is the only thing that matters. Your ego is just an impediment.'''
Much of Mr. Fagin's own poetry can be brutally economical. His poem ''The Skeleton'' goes like this:
The skeleton has his own bathing suit
He enjoys swimming and being in the world
The xylophones are playing peacefully
The skeleton is dancing on the beach
We respect his frugality, neatness patience, tact
He's not just another skinny person Mr. Fagin seems to exert a magnetic pull on his students.
''If you have any inclination to get in touch with the arts, to express yourself creatively, and you live in this century, and in this city, and you're struggling to make ends meet -and I fall into this category - you'll be enamored by Larry,'' said Kate Thompson, 30, a former market researcher from Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, who has studied prose fiction with Mr. Fagin for a year. ''You walk into his apartment and it's just filled with all this stuff you recognize and don't fully know but you want to.''
In a classroom setting, Mr. Fagin has had mixed success. For about five years, until 2007, he was an adjunct at the New School, where he rubbed many people the wrong way, said one former student, Kathleen Kyllo.
''By the time the last class rolled around attendance was significantly lower,'' she said in an e-mail. ''Where students had once sat closer to him near the front of the room we were hanging back in a defensive mass.'' She recalled an incident where Mr. Fagin announced to the class that her poetry was ''too vaginal.''
Mr. Fagin acknowledged that he got ''really mean'' in the classroom. ''You walk in and all these faces are staring at you and you want some reaction from them but they really have nothing to offer you. It's like, come on you jack wagons!''
All in all, Mr. Fagin takes a blighted view of the current generation of aspiring artists, whom he likened to ''pod people.''
''They are so inundated by information, they have no way to sort all this stuff out -- it's like being perpetually electrocuted but not realizing it,'' he said.
Nor does he have much good to say about what has come of his once-beloved downtown art world, which, by his reckoning, ended in February 1975 at a dinner party around the corner hosted by Claes and Patty Oldenburg.
Mr. Fagin, who went with his friend the critic and poet Peter Schjeldahl, recalled his excitement that the artist Robert Smithson was to be in attendance. ''But when we got there, all anyone talked about was real estate,'' he said. ''They'd all just bought lofts in what was later to be called SoHo. We left and I said to Peter, 'Well, that's the end of civilization.'''
Still, somehow, he perseveres to connect, especially with his students.
''To teach literature or history is in a way a losing battle because you cannot cross that crevasse,'' he said. ''They can't get to you and you can't get to them. You can just call to each other across the crevasse.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Gentler Touch Atop the Schools, After Years of a Hard Push for Reform

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS; Anna M. Phillips contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As he begins his first full year leading the city's public school system, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott is trying to move away from the place that a predecessor, Joel I. Klein, so comfortably occupied: the spotlight.
With the country deeply divided over the best way to improve education, Mr. Walcott plans to reposition New York City on the reform spectrum -- from the standard-bearer that it was during Mr. Klein's tenure to a quiet executor of the initiatives he started.
Describing himself as ''the cheerleader of our education system,'' Mr. Walcott, 60, said in an interview last week that civility was his foremost goal for this school year. What he wants, he said, is ''to have both theoretical as well as practical discussions around what we need to do in our schools without the anger and acrimony that's occurred in the past.'' 
He expressed commitment to several key planks of Mr. Klein's platform, pledging to judge schools by their results (''You've got to perform or we'll do something to you'') and questioning the value of tenure (''I don't believe in lifetime guarantees'').
But he also expressed some concern with one controversial project: the public release of performance ratings for individual teachers -- known as teacher data reports -- even as the city has been fighting the teachers' union in court for the right to publish them.
''I don't want our teachers stereotyped,'' he said. ''I don't have a problem with names being out there, because we should be transparent. But on the other hand I have a responsibility to make sure that we protect our work force as well, and not to have newspaper stories denigrate my work force, because they're working their butts off to do their job.''
Mr. Walcott, the former deputy mayor in charge of education, took over as chancellor in April after the disastrous three-month tenure of Cathleen P. Black, a magazine executive with no experience in education. According to a poll taken in August by The New York Times, he has yet to make a strong impression: 53 percent of respondents said they had no opinion of his performance.
In the interview, he indicated that this would be a year focused on public relations, not policy shifts.
In contrast to Mr. Klein, a central character in Steven Brill's recent book, ''Class Warfare: Inside the Fight to Fix America's Schools,'' Mr. Walcott said he would seek to sell his vision not to national audiences and philanthropies, but to principals, parent associations and church groups. To help achieve that, he plans to transform his deputies from faceless bureaucrats to public messengers -- or, as he put it, turn ''them loose to do their thing.''
He said he would push these officials to go on the offensive, and appear frequently on the radio, television and at public meetings, ''letting people see them, letting people interact with them, having them define their role, define their vision and their mission.'' But he was short on specifics.
For example, he said he wanted to get information to parents, but when asked how, he said he was still ''researching a variety of new mechanisms.'' While he stressed that the quality of the teacher was more important than the size of the class, Mr. Walcott did not talk about taking more aggressive measures to remove weak teachers from the system.
He is embarking on a charm offensive in a tough environment. Schools are reeling from the effect of five consecutive years of budget cuts, and many are starting the year with fewer teachers, fewer aides, slimmer after-school programs and more students in the classroom.
Principals, who are evaluated largely by their schools' overall performance on standardized tests, worry about the effects of these cuts on instruction. Teachers, who were spared from layoffs this year in a last-minute deal, know that the relief is most likely to be temporary, given the city's difficult economic forecast.
''Just knowing that we're going to go through the same budget fight again this spring, knowing that we've lost 2,000 teachers through attrition, knowing that class sizes will go up, that really hurts us,'' said Sam Coleman, 37, a third-grade teacher at Public School 24 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.
Mr. Walcott is aware of the challenges, but said all sides had to make the effort.
Parents, he said, ''have to take a look at their role in making sure they are participants one way or another in what's happening educationally for their child or children, plain and simple.'' Principals and teachers must understand that ''we're living in an environment where there isn't as much money as there was before, so we have a responsibility as a system to make sure we plan with the dollars that we have,'' he said.
That means forging partnerships with other city agencies, he said, like the Department of Youth and Community Development, which already offers after-school programs in 400 city schools. It also means focusing the response to one of the system's most intractable problems, overcrowding, in neighborhoods where it is at its worst.
He is, however, less inclined to invest time and money trying to cut class sizes.
''If I have a great principal there and if I have great teachers there,'' he said, ''that, to me, benefits the students no matter how large the class size is.''
He dismissed the notion that there might be a morale problem among teachers -- ''no matter whether you have a three-person work force or a 135,000-person work force, there are people who will be unhappy,'' he noted -- and said it all boiled down to commitment.
''I can set the tone, I can set the aspirational level, I can deal with the budget issues to the best of my ability,'' he said. ''But at the end of the day, I know most of our teachers are there for our children, for our students, and that's what I expect.''

HEADLINE: In a New Libya, Racing to Shed Ties to Qaddafi

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
TRIPOLI, Libya -- Khalid Saad worked for years as a loyal cog in Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's propaganda machine, arranging transportation to ferry foreign journalists to staged rallies, ensuring that they never left their hotels without official escorts and raising his own voice to cheer the Libyan leader.
The day that rebels took Tripoli, Mr. Saad immediately switched sides.
Now he works for the rebels' provisional government, coordinating transportation for its officials and insisting that his previous support for Colonel Qaddafi was just business. ''My uncle and my son were soldiers for the revolution,'' he said in an interview. ''Everyone will be happy now. Everything is changed now. Everyone is free.'' 
As the curtain falls on Colonel Qaddafi's Tripoli, many of its supporting actors are rushing to pick up new roles with the rebels, the very same people they were obliged not long ago to refer to as ''the rats.'' Many Libyans say the ease with which former Qaddafi supporters have switched sides is a testament to the pervasive cynicism of the Qaddafi era, when dissent meant jail or death, job opportunities depended on political connections, and almost everyone learned to wear two faces to survive within the system.
That cynicism may now prove to be Tripoli's saving grace. After months of a brutal crackdown and a bitter civil war, in a country with little history of unity where autonomous brigades of fighters still roam the capital, citizens have been unexpectedly willing to set aside their grievances against functionaries of the Qaddafi government. Everyone knows that almost everyone who stayed out of jail during four decades of Colonel Qaddafi's rule was to some extent complicit.
Indeed, the thin veneer of support helps explain why the loyalist forces who had terrorized the city crumbled so swiftly when it became clear that the end was near, averting the expected blood bath. Though loyalists still hold out in pockets around the country, and there have been episodes of retaliatory violence and looting, Tripoli, the capital, changed hands and returned to peace in a matter of days.
''The way the system worked, everyone had to be part of it -- all of us,'' said Adel Sennosi, a former official of Colonel Qaddafi's Foreign Ministry who is now working for the provisional government's Foreign Ministry. ''If we say, 'Get rid of whoever was part of the system,' we would have to get rid of the whole population,'' he said.
Now, he said, many of those former loyalists ''are more revolutionary than anyone else!''
Rebel officials have said for months that they would try to avoid the mistakes made in Iraq after Saddam Hussein was overthrown, when United States officials disbanded the military and barred all former members of the ruling Baath Party -- many of Iraq's most experienced professionals -- from working in any public-sector job.
Instead, the Libyan rebels said, they will seek retribution, in a courtroom, against only the most notorious Qaddafi government officials, those who oversaw torture or killings, egregiously enriched themselves or, in the case of the captured television host Hala Misrati, led the propaganda war on state television.
The rebel leaders pledged to welcome back most of the bureaucrats and other midlevel functionaries, and so far, former senior officials of Colonel Qaddafi's government say the provisional government appears to be keeping its word. To underscore that point, the rebel leadership held a ceremony on Tuesday to hand control of a major natural gas plant to the same manager who was responsible for its security under Colonel Qaddafi.
''There are very few instances of revenge,'' said Abdulmajeed el-Dursi, the former chief of the Qaddafi-era foreign media operation, sipping coffee at a cafe full of rebels and talking about opening a media services company.
''It is legitimate, all these things they are doing -- freedom of the press, the rule of law,'' Mr. Dursi added. ''We always thought it was the right thing to do.''
Officials at the rebels' detention centers around the city say they have sent scores of Colonel Qaddafi's former soldiers and supporters back to their homes after they have turned in their weapons, and even some of the former soldiers now insist that they are revolutionaries at heart.
Ahmed el-Naeli was a soldier from Tripoli captured and jailed weeks ago by rebels in the Nafusah Mountains, where a reporter for The New York Times gave him a business card. On Tuesday, he called to say that he, too, had changed sides. After his capture, Mr. Naeli said, ''I turned around and joined the revolution.''
Officials at local police stations say hundreds of officers are returning to work, usually in their home neighborhoods without incident.
They are ''well accepted'' because local residents understand they were only part of the system, said Abdou Shafi Hassan, 34, a former officer who began working with the rebels months ago, smuggling weapons and plastic explosives for them until he was caught and sent to jail.
Now he is an acting police chief in his neighborhood, Tajura, where he is recruiting dozens of former officers back to work. ''They are the ones who are bringing the security to the city,'' he said.
A top associate of the Qaddafi government's spokesman, Moussa Ibrahim, cast aside any pretense of loyalty when he offered to sell a Western journalist a series of secret tape recordings he had made of his former boss trying to bribe journalists for favorable coverage.
The most famous turncoat was Gen. Albarrani Shkal, a senior officer who was in charge of a large army unit that fought the rebels. About a month before Tripoli fell, officials of the new provisional government said, General Shkal began secretly collaborating with the rebels. The rebels instructed him to stay in his job so that when their troops entered Tripoli he could order his own soldiers to disperse. ''He saved a lot of lives,'' Mr. Sennosi of the Foreign Ministry said.
More than 50 Libyan ambassadors serving abroad abandoned Colonel Qaddafi as soon as the uprising began, and Mr. Sennosi said that many others sought to defect in the following months. The rebel leaders told them they could do more for the cause if they stayed in their jobs, he said.
''So many people had turned, that it really ended up a true popular revolution,'' Mr. Sennosi said.
Youssef M. Sherif, one of Libya's most prominent writers, said he tracked the waning days of Colonel Qaddafi's government by the wages it paid young people to cheer in front of the state television cameras. At first, he said, they were paid about $360, then $140, then $35 and then the money ran out.
When the money ran out, so did the crowds.
Mr. Sherif said he asked people why they accepted such money from a tyrant. '' 'Better I spend it than him!' '' they would say.
Salem el-Ajelli, 39, an unemployed resident of the Abu Salim neighborhood where rebels fought a fierce firefight to eradicate the last bastion of support for Colonel Qaddafi in the city, said that he and his neighbors would sometimes be paid $30 a day to cheer for the colonel.
''Most of us are just regular people who did not really care about Qaddafi or not Qaddafi,'' Mr. Ajelli said. ''We just worrying about getting by day by day.''

HEADLINE: A Romanian Passes Happily On the Road to a Team Victory

BYLINE: By PHILLIP ALDER

 BODY:
There were 12 players representing the United States at the second World Youth Congress in Croatia two weeks ago.
However, a 13th member of the American Contract Bridge League was competing. Marius Agica was playing for his home country, Romania, although he is currently studying computer science and economics at Pace University in New York City. It is possible that he will remain in the States after graduating in, he hopes, December. 
Agica and his Romanian partner, Radu Nistor, were third in the Junior Pairs. They combined with a Dutch pair, Bob Drijver and Ernst Wackwitz, to come in third in the Knockout Teams.
Agica was involved in the diagramed deal, one of the most bizarre of the tournament. It occurred during Round 8 of the qualifying stage of the Knockout Teams.
After two passes, Agica (East) opened two clubs: strong, artificial and forcing; Gerbrand Hop (South for Netherlands Juniors, the eventual winners) traded on the favorable vulnerability to overcall three hearts; Nistor (West) doubled to show 0 to 5 points (pass would have been stronger); and Agica passed, content with this contract.
West led the club jack and continued with a club to his partner's king. East tried to cash the club ace, but South ruffed. He led the diamond queen, East taking his ace, cashing his two spade winners and returning a diamond. Declarer won with dummy's jack and played a heart to his king. Now South needed to lead the diamond king to ''escape'' for down five. But he played another trump, so the defenders took the remainder with East's four hearts and West's club ten.
Down six was minus 1,400 the hard way (nonvulnerable).
At the other table Drijver (North) opened two spades, weak -- very weak. Berend van den Bos (East), painted into a corner, made a takeout double. Joris van Lankveld (West) advanced with two no-trump, which typically meant that he had a very weak hand. Then East went with his five-card suit, jumping to four hearts. (Three no-trump would have been safer, as it turned out.)
Wackwitz (South) led the spade nine. East won with his ace, cashed the heart ace and continued with the heart queen. How should South have defended after taking his king?
With this layout South had to shift to a diamond to defeat the contract. East could have won, overtaken his spade queen with dummy's king and picked up the clubs, but South would have ruffed the third club and tapped declarer in diamonds to generate a third trump trick.
South led his second spade however.
Declarer won with dummy's king, ran the club jack, played a club to his ace, drew three rounds of trumps and led the club king.
East claimed, saying that after South ruffed and led a diamond, declarer would win with his ace and cash his last club.
Plus 1,400 and minus 620 gave the combined Netherlands-Romania team 13 international match points on the board.
When one team plays in the same strain at both tables, usually something is amiss, and this deal was no exception.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Rose In Most Areas, Fed Says

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the turmoil that shook the financial markets last month, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday that its 12 bank regions grew this summer because consumers in many parts of the country spent more. 
The Fed said five of its regions, Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, San Francisco and St. Louis. reported modest or slight growth in late July and August. The seven other regions described growth as subdued, slow or sluggish.
The survey, known as the beige book, offers mostly anecdotal information on economic conditions. Its findings were a slight improvement from the previous survey, which said growth slowed in eight of the 12 regions in June and early July.
Consumer spending increased in most regions from the previous survey. But the gains were mostly a result of stronger auto sales. Demand for other products was flat or fell in several regions during late July and August.
The report offered little guidance about future hiring. It noted that several districts had said the volatile stock market and economic uncertainty had led many businesses to lower expectations for the near future. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1,962 points, or roughly 15 percent, from July 22 through Aug. 10.
Although far from upbeat, the overall tone from the anecdotal evidence ''wasn't all doom and gloom,'' said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
The regional outlook will help shape the discussion at the central bank's next meeting on Sept. 20-21.
The economy barely grew in the first half of the year, and the government said last week that employers stopped adding jobs in August.
Consumers and businesses are feeling less confident after a turbulent summer. Lawmakers fought over raising the federal borrowing limit, Standard & Poor's downgraded long-term United States debt, and stocks have fluctuated wildly after plunging in late-July and early August.
Manufacturing slowed in many parts of the country, including New York, Philadelphia and Richmond, the survey noted. Textile makers in Richmond said that their markets had grown weaker because of declines in consumer confidence.
Home sales slowed in many districts, although Atlanta, Boston, Dallas and Minneapolis said sales had improved slightly compared to last summer's weak levels.
Some economists say the Fed must act to help the economy avoid another recession.
On Aug. 9, the Federal Reserve said it planned to keep interest rates very low until at least mid-2013, assuming the economy remained weak. Minutes from that meeting showed some Fed officials had pushed for more aggressive steps.
One possibility is the Fed could increase the percentage of long-term Treasury securities it keeps in its mix of holdings. That approach would have the advantage of exerting downward pressure on long-term interest rates without adding to the Fed's already record-level of securities.
Still, three regional bank presidents dissented from the Aug. 9 decision. They expressed concerns that the Fed's policies were contributing to higher inflation.
The worsening jobs outlook has also put pressure on President Obama. He is expected on Thursday to introduce a $300 billion jobs package before a joint session of Congress. The plan is likely to include extensions of the payroll tax cut and long-term unemployment benefits, tax incentives for businesses that hire and money for public works projects.
The effort faces strong opposition from Republicans in Congress, who say Mr. Obama's previous stimulus program failed.

HEADLINE: China's Rise Isn't Our Demise

BYLINE: By JOSEPH R. BIDEN Jr.. 
Joseph R. Biden Jr. is the vice president of the United States.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
I FIRST visited China in 1979, a few months after our countries normalized relations. China was just beginning to remake its economy, and I was in the first Senate delegation to witness this evolution. Traveling through the country last month, I could see how much China had changed in 32 years -- and yet the debate about its remarkable rise remains familiar.
Then, as now, there were concerns about what a growing China meant to America and the world. Some here and in the region see China's growth as a threat, entertaining visions of a cold-war-style rivalry or great-power confrontation. Some Chinese worry that our aim in the Asia-Pacific is to contain China's rise. 
I reject these views. We are clear-eyed about concerns like China's growing military abilities and intentions; that is why we are engaging with the Chinese military to understand and shape their thinking. It is why the president has directed the United States, with our allies, to keep a strong presence in the region. As I told China's leaders and people, America is a Pacific power and will remain one.
But, I remain convinced that a successful China can make our country more prosperous, not less.
As trade and investment bind us together, we have a stake in each other's success. On issues from global security to global economic growth, we share common challenges and responsibilities -- and we have incentives to work together. That is why our administration has worked to put our relationship on a stable footing. I am convinced, from nearly a dozen hours spent with Vice President Xi Jinping, that China's leadership agrees.
We often focus on Chinese exports to America, but last year American companies exported more than $100 billion worth of goods and services to China, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs here. In fact, our exports to China have been growing much faster than our exports to the rest of the world.
The Chinese leaders I met with know their country must shift from an economy driven by exports, investment and heavy industry to one driven more by consumption and services. This includes continued steps to revalue their currency and to provide fair access to their markets. As Americans save more and Chinese buy more, this transition will accelerate, opening opportunities for us.
Even as the United States and China cooperate, we also compete. I strongly believe that the United States can and will flourish from this competition.
First, we need to keep China's rising economic power in perspective. According to the International Monetary Fund, America's gross domestic product, almost $15 trillion, is still more than twice as large as China's; our per-capita G.D.P., above $47,000, is 11 times China's.
And while there is a lot of talk about China's ''owning'' America's debt, the truth is that Americans own America's debt. China holds just 8 percent of outstanding Treasury securities. By comparison, Americans hold nearly 70 percent. Our unshakable commitment to honoring our financial obligations is for the sake of Americans, as well as for those overseas. It is why the United States has never defaulted on its obligations and never will.
Maybe more important, the nature of 21st-century competition favors the United States. In the 20th century, we measured a nation's wealth primarily by its natural resources, its land mass, its population and its army. In the 21st century, the true wealth of a nation is found in the creative minds of its people and their ability to innovate.
As I told students in Chengdu, the United States is hard-wired for innovation. Competition is in the very fabric of our society. It has enabled each generation of Americans to give life to world-changing ideas -- from the cotton gin to the airplane, the microchip, the Internet.
We owe our strength to our political and economic system and to the way we educate our children -- not merely to accept established orthodoxy but to challenge and improve it. We not only tolerate but celebrate free expression and vigorous debate. The rule of law protects private property, lends predictability to investments, and ensures accountability for poor and wealthy alike. Our universities remain the ultimate destination for the world's students and scholars. And we welcome immigrants with skill, ambition and the desire to better their lives.
America's strengths are, for now, China's weaknesses. In China, I argued that for it to make the transition to an innovation economy, it will have to open its system, not least to human rights. Fundamental rights are universal, and China's people aspire to them. Liberty unlocks a people's full potential, while its absence breeds unrest. Open and free societies are best at promoting long-term growth, stability, prosperity and innovation.
We have our own work to do. We need to ensure that any American willing to work can find a good job. We need to keep attracting the world's top talent. We must continue to invest in the fundamental sources of our strength: education, infrastructure and innovation. But our future is in our own hands. If we take bold steps, there is no reason America won't emerge stronger than ever.
As vice president, I've traveled half a million miles around the world. I always come home feeling the same confidence in our future. Some may warn of America's demise, but I'm not among them. And let me reassure you: based on my time in China, neither are the Chinese.

HEADLINE: The Open's Missing Piece

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

 BODY:
If the Romans could put a roof on the ancient Colosseum, why can't the United States Tennis Association add a roof to one of its show courts at the United States Open? The question has, well, hung over the premier domestic tennis event for 20 years, since the U.S.T.A. opted for the sensational over the sensible in constructing Arthur Ashe Stadium, the tournament's marquee court.
The question gathers more steam with each major storm that blows through the New York area and grinds play to a halt at the final Grand Slam event on the tennis calendar. In each of the last three years, the Open has been extended a day because of weather disruptions, and this year's tournament appears headed for a fourth straight Monday finish -- if then.
''Is there an incremental expense to it? Absolutely,'' Jim Curley, the tournament director, said of the possibility of a Monday finish. ''It's not ideal for the players, the tournament or television.'' 
In the city that never sleeps, some of the best players in the world were reduced on Wednesday to dozing on couches in the lounge as they waited a second straight day for match calls that never came because of rain that was no more than a mist. It was the first time since 1971 that the Open lost two consecutive days of tennis.
''Is it necessary? Maybe not,'' Roger Federer, a five-time champion, said at the Open two years ago when asked about a roofed stadium. ''But with a roof you can make it more predictable for fans, sponsors, TV, players. That's why I'm obviously for it. In America, we have so many wonderful stadiums, you figure it's normal they would be taking the lead with something like this.''
It is not as if a retractable roof is a pied-a-terre-in-the-sky idea. The Australian Open, which has had a roofed stadium since 1989, now has two covered courts and plans for a third. Wimbledon, considered the most staid of the majors, unveiled its high-tech roof over Centre Court in 2009. And at the French Open, where weather is seldom a factor, a retractable roof is in the works as part of the renovations planned for Philippe Chatrier Court.
''We were just saying it's strange that there's no roof here when all the other major venues have a roof,'' said Richard Young, who had plenty of time on his hands to ponder the imponderable. He and his son Roman were waiting out the rain at Louis Armstrong Stadium.
The Youngs were in town from Utah on a tennis vacation, so the U.S.T.A.'s promise of tickets to next year's event if the day session was canceled (as it was) provided little consolation.
''In these times of recession,'' the elder Young said, ''a roof is a shovel-ready project.''
The plans the U.S.T.A. made public in November include expanding the capacity of its second show court, Armstrong stadium, by more than 3,000 seats, to 14,000. The grandstand court, considered the drawing room of the National Tennis Center because of its intimacy, could grow to 7,000 seats, from 6,100.
With 23,771 seats, Ashe Stadium is the largest tennis arena in the world. Its sheer size makes covering it a conundrum for reasons having to do with structural integrity and the bottom line.
To planes on approach at nearby La Guardia, Ashe looks like a marooned U.F.O. The top of the stadium is so high and wide that it would require architectural ingenuity to cover it, and even then it would be larger and more obtrusive.
The stadium, which opened in 1997, was built for $254 million, and it has been estimated that a retractable roof would cost at least another $150 million.
When considering whether to cover Ashe, the price tag is only part of the consideration. The stadium is the only show court with suites; there are 90 that are leased for roughly $250,000 each.
If the U.S.T.A. were to include a roof as part of the Armstrong or grandstand renovations, it would have to contend with fallout from premium ticket holders and suite occupants reduced on rainy days to watching the action much like the average fans at home, on the televisions in their suites or the giant screen on the court.
''All of a sudden you're going to tell them they can't see live tennis,'' said Andy Roddick, the 2003 men's champion. He added, in perhaps a bit of hyperbole, ''There's a reason why the U.S. Open does more dollars in two weeks than the Yankees do in half a season of baseball.''
John McEnroe, the Hall of Fame player and homegrown product, has said he lobbied U.S.T.A. officials to put a roof over Ashe when it was being built to replace Armstrong as the National Tennis Center's showpiece.
''It seemed like a no-brainer, but people at the U.S.T.A. decided they wanted to build the biggest,'' he told Reuters during the 2009 tournament, when rain washed out a day of matches. ''But at the same price they could've had a slightly smaller stadium and had a roof.''
The ESPN commentator Pam Shriver, a 1978 Open singles finalist and a five-time doubles champion, spent most of Wednesday afternoon outside the locker rooms corralling players for interviews to fill the cable network's airtime.
''Once they didn't engineer a roof into this stadium, that's when they lost the opportunity,'' she said.
Shriver, who has served three two-year terms on the U.S.T.A. board beginning in 1997, pointed out that the Grand Slam tournaments were not all equal in their missions or their money streams. The Australian Open received government financing for its roof projects, she noted.
And unlike the All England Club, which hosts Wimbledon, the U.S.T.A. has the task of growing and promoting the sport in its country and not just with putting on a fabulous fortnight of tennis.
The question, Shriver said, becomes: Is it worth the cost of a roof when the payoff comes only two weeks out of the year?
''Even though on a rainy week it seems so obvious, when you look at a not-for-profit and all the U.S.T.A. tries to do, it's a really tough call,'' she said, adding: ''It's not based on three days of bad weather. It's based on a much bigger picture, one which is concerned with the grassroots level and elite-player development and senior tennis. I'm not saying they shouldn't have a roof, but it's a complicated issue with a lot of moving parts.''
Shriver said she believed there would eventually be a covered stadium on the grounds.
''To have it come to a grinding halt for days because of a tropical system is poor business,'' she said.
Flavia Pennetta, who was scheduled to play the third match on the grandstand court Wednesday, heard the word ''roof'' in a question and did not wait for the rest of the sentence to voice her opinion. ''Yes, absolutely, I wish there was one,'' she said. ''I think it's tradition is why there is not. It's always been like this.''
So that's what it has come to. A city that boldly pushed the envelope on its skyline is considered, in the tennis world, a hidebound host.

HEADLINE: Going Green but Getting Nowhere

BYLINE: By GERNOT WAGNER. 
Gernot Wagner is an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund and the author of the forthcoming ''But Will the Planet Notice?''

 BODY:
YOU reduce, reuse and recycle. You turn down plastic and paper. You avoid out-of-season grapes. You do all the right things.
Good.
Just know that it won't save the tuna, protect the rain forest or stop global warming. The changes necessary are so large and profound that they are beyond the reach of individual action.
You refuse the plastic bag at the register, believing this one gesture somehow makes a difference, and then carry your takeout meal back to your car for a carbon-emitting trip home. 
Say you're willing to make real sacrifices. Sell your car. Forsake your air-conditioner in the summer, turn down the heat in the winter. Try to become no-impact man. You would, in fact, have no impact on the planet. Americans would continue to emit an average of 20 tons of carbon dioxide a year; Europeans, about 10 tons.
What about going bigger? You are the pope with a billion followers, and let's say all of them take your advice to heart. If all Catholics decreased their emissions to zero overnight, the planet would surely notice, but pollution would still be rising. Of course, a billion people, whether they're Catholic or adherents of any other religion or creed, will do no such thing. Two weeks of silence in a Buddhist yoga retreat in the Himalayas with your BlackBerry checked at the door? Sure. An entire life voluntarily lived off the grid? No thanks.
And that focuses only on those who can decrease their emissions. When your average is 20 tons per year, going down to 18 tons is as easy as taking a staycation. But if you are among the four billion on the planet who each emit one ton a year, you have nowhere to go but up.
Leading scientific groups and most climate scientists say we need to decrease global annual greenhouse gas emissions by at least half of current levels by 2050 and much further by the end of the century. And that will still mean rising temperatures and sea levels for generations.
So why bother recycling or riding your bike to the store? Because we all want to do something, anything. Call it ''action bias.'' But, sadly, individual action does not work. It distracts us from the need for collective action, and it doesn't add up to enough. Self-interest, not self-sacrifice, is what induces noticeable change. Only the right economic policies will enable us as individuals to be guided by self-interest and still do the right thing for the planet.
Every ton of carbon dioxide pollution causes around $20 of damage to economies, ecosystems and human health. That sum times 20 implies $400 worth of damage per American per year. That's not damage you're going to do in the distant future; that's damage each of us is doing right now. Who pays for it?
We pay as a society. My cross-country flight adds fractions of a penny to everyone else's cost. That knowledge leads some of us to voluntarily chip in a few bucks to ''offset'' our emissions. But none of these payments motivate anyone to fly less. It doesn't lead airlines to switch to more fuel-efficient planes or routes. If anything, airlines by now use voluntary offsets as a marketing ploy to make green-conscious passengers feel better. The result is planetary socialism at its worst: we all pay the price because individuals don't.
It won't change until a regulatory system compels us to pay our fair share to limit pollution accordingly. Limit, of course, is code for ''cap and trade,'' the system that helped phase out lead in gasoline in the 1980s, slashed acid rain pollution in the 1990s and is now bringing entire fisheries back from the brink. ''Cap and trade'' for carbon is beginning to decrease carbon pollution in Europe, and similar models are slated to do the same from California to China.
Alas, this approach has been declared dead in Washington, ironically by self-styled free-marketers. Another solution, a carbon tax, is also off the table because, well, it's a tax.
Never mind that markets are truly free only when everyone pays the full price for his or her actions. Anything else is socialism. The reality is that we cannot overcome the global threats posed by greenhouse gases without speaking the ultimate inconvenient truth: getting people excited about making individual environmental sacrifices is doomed to fail.
High school science tells us that global warming is real. And economics teaches us that humanity must have the right incentives if it is to stop this terrible trend.
Don't stop recycling. Don't stop buying local. But add mastering some basic economics to your to-do list. Our future will be largely determined by our ability to admit the need to end planetary socialism. That's the most fundamental of economics lessons and one any serious environmentalist ought to heed.

HEADLINE: Seaport Museum Takeover Planned

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The Museum of the City of New York will take over the beleaguered Seaport Museum New York using a $2 million grant from the corporation in charge of developing Lower Manhattan, according to state, city and museum officials who made the deal public on Wednesday.
The takeover, which requires final approval from the City Museum board, will rescue the Seaport Museum from its financial problems and install new leaders for an institution that has been struggling. Over the past decade the Seaport Museum has been in arrears to the New York City Economic Development Corporation for rent and utilities. 
''We assume full responsibility for its management and its budget,'' said Susan Henshaw Jones, the City Museum's director. ''We have complementary missions and complementary collections.''
The Seaport Museum, at 12 Fulton Street and formerly named the South Street Seaport Museum because of the district where it stands, was founded in 1967 and explores the maritime history of New York through artifacts, historic ships and service boats. It has always been a modest operation, catering to tourists and nautical buffs.
The City Museum, on Fifth Avenue between 103rd and 104th Streets, explores the city's history through exhibitions and public programs. It is in a strong financial position for the takeover with a budget that has been in balance since 2003 and with a $90 million renovation that is about 70 percent complete.
Under the proposal the City Museum would operate the Seaport Museum's signature fleet of 11 deteriorating vessels. In recent years the Seaport Museum had considered turning its ships over to other maritime centers to save money, but that plan never materialized.
''The early ideal of the Seaport Museum and the entire district, '' Ms. Jones said, ''was to combine the ships and the buildings in a way that educated people about New York's great seafaring past. We are committed to that combination.''
She added: ''I think we can find our legs regarding the ships in fairly short order. It's true we've never managed anything other than buildings, but we understand management.''
The $2 million that helped make the takeover deal possible was provided by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, part of $20 million in grants to 38 nonprofit community and cultural organizations.
The financial problems of the Seaport Museum were evident this year when 7 of its 21 trustees resigned from the board, and 32 employees, half its staff, were furloughed. Exhibitions were suspended, and the museum effectively eliminated its curatorial and development departments. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg became involved, meeting with the museum's chairman, Frank J. Sciame.
Mr. Sciame has lent the museum $3 million since last year to cover operating expenses like payroll. On Thursday he welcomed the City Museum's rescue. ''These are two institutions with a synergy and similar collections,'' he said. ''I feel good about it. We really felt it was the right thing to do in terms of the future of the museum.''
The City Museum's board will vote on the proposal Thursday. The grant provides for an interim period of up to 18 months during which the City Museum can evaluate whether it can make a go of the Seaport Museum's troubled operations.
''I can't say we know 100 percent it makes sense for us,'' said James G. Dinan, chairman of the City Museum and chief executive of York Capital Management. ''We believe the maritime story of New York can be told there. But as to how it all plays out, your guess is as good as mine.''
New York City Cultural Affairs Commissioner Kate D. Levin, who helped broker the agreement -- with Robert K. Steel, deputy mayor for economic development, and Seth W. Pinsky, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation -- said a reinvigorated maritime museum downtown would benefit the city. ''The East Side of Lower Manhattan really needs a major cultural anchor,'' she added.
Re-energizing the Seaport Museum is part of the city's larger economic development effort in the area. ''The Seaport Museum has always been the cultural heart of the South Street Seaport district,'' Mr. Pinsky said.
Taking over the Seaport Museum would let the City Museum expand its geographical turf and its programming. ''There is clearly a different market down there than the folks who come uptown to see us,'' Ms. Jones said. ''We have to take a look at that audience.''
Ms. Jones said that her museum was planning to mount an exhibition by December, start school programming, reorganize the Seaport Museum library and draft a strategic plan. She expected the Seaport Museum budget to be less than $3 million, down from about $5 million in 2008 and 2009. The City Museum's annual budget is about $16 million.
The $2 million allotted to a rejuvenated museum at the Seaport will go toward operating expenses, not toward the museum's debt. That debt has been eliminated partly through write-downs by its creditors, Mr. Pinsky said.
Still unresolved is whether the Seaport Museum will dissolve as a nonprofit or merge with the City Museum; what the new museum will be called; and whether any of the Seaport Museum staff will remain.
But Ms. Jones said she believed the City Museum could effectively steward a new future for the Seaport Museum while preserving what is best about its past. ''I know we can run it,'' she said. ''I think we have a good shot at this.''

HEADLINE: A Bond Forged in Tragedy

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
''IT started out as the most exciting morning of my life,'' said the maternity designer Liz Lange, who, long before the date, had circled Sept. 11, 2001, on her calendar. Her first fashion show, under the tents of Bryant Park, was scheduled for 9 a.m. that day.
''It was crazy,'' she said. ''Everything was happening at once. We were using pregnant models, and instead of water, we had Krispy Kreme doughnuts and bagels backstage. There was so much coverage and excitement about the show that it really was a media circus. I had a lot of celebrities there. I remember Billy Baldwin, who was married to Chynna Phillips, who was pregnant at the time, and a lot of socialites: Marina Rust, Elizabeth Saltzman. It was the first maternity show at Fashion Week, and 'Good Morning America' and the 'Today' show were both so anxious to cover it live that they almost battled it out. 
''We were in our own little bubble,'' she said. ''And then, I'd say 10 minutes into the show, I looked around and all of these camera crews were just bolting out the door. I was wondering: 'Have we done something wrong? How did we go from being the center of the universe to everyone's leaving? What's happening?' ''
It is but a small footnote to history that the 9/11 terrorist attacks happened on what was to have been the fourth day of New York Fashion Week for the spring 2002 season. Fifty-two collections had been shown since the preceding Saturday at events around the city, which was caught up, as usual, in an array of glamorous festivities.
The previous night, with the ground soaked after a daylong rainstorm, Marc Jacobs had held an extravagant runway show on a Hudson River pier near the West Village that culminated in an enormous outdoor party celebrating his latest fragrance. On Tuesday morning, Ms. Lange's show was the 53rd, and last, to take place before Fashion Week was called off, the tents evacuated and the 73 remaining events canceled.
In the days that followed, many designers, as they struggled to make sense of their world and resume the daily business of fashion, arranged simple presentations in their showrooms. Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein and Donna Karan were among them. Mr. Lauren, in one of his offices on Seventh Avenue, wore a sweater with the American flag in intarsia, and told his audience: ''I have always been inspired by America. I have always been inspired by its heroes.''
But for the younger designers, for those with limited financial resources and little work space, there was no viable way to show their collections to the buyers or press. It seemed unlikely that many of their businesses would survive, as retailers began cutting back, especially on untested labels, amid the ensuing climate of fear and economic uncertainty. Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, had encouraged the designers to carry on, but she was surprised when she learned that few of them could afford to do so.
''I had all my editors telling me they've lost their deposits, they have no more money, and what should they do?'' Ms. Wintour said. ''That seemed to me a great opportunity for us to help.''
ON Sept. 21, in the showroom of Carolina Herrera, Vogue and Style.com presented a group show called An American View, for 11 of those labels. Most of the designers were just starting their own companies: Behnaz Sarafpour, who previously designed a house collection for Barneys New York, had been planning her first runway show. Tony Smith, who had designed a label called the Smiths and was working with Billy Reid at the time as a creative director, was showing his own collection for the first time.
The others represented a mix of rising stars and promising newcomers: Rebecca Taylor, Christine Gano, Pierre Carrilero of Pierrot, Peter Som, Elisa Jimenez, Benjamin Cho, Maria Cornejo, Michael Soheil plus Bryan Bradley and Josh Patner of Tuleh. Each showed between three and eight outfits on a cast of top models that included Maggie Rizer, Erin O'Connor, May Andersen and Karen Elson, who volunteered their services, as did the hair and makeup artists Tina Turnbow and Danilo and the production team.
Though it was a small event, scarcely covered beyond the trades, An American View, in retrospect, came to represent something far more meaningful in New York fashion. It marked the moment when an industry collectively gathered its strength in support of new talent, in what turned out to be the forerunner of multiple initiatives coordinated by the Council of Fashion Designers of America on behalf of young designers.
Those programs, like the CFDA/Vogue Fashion fund and the CFDA Fashion Incubator, have, in turn, created an environment in which new designers have thrived. As evidence of that change, the Fashion Week that begins today will have more than 250 shows, twice as many as in 2001.
What follows is an oral history of the development of An American View, its impact and its aftermath. Each of the participants here was interviewed separately and comments have been edited and condensed.
PETER SOM (designer): My business was really new. I was still working out of my apartment. There had been a real momentum for me because I was new, and everyone was looking for the newest thing, but I hadn't gotten a lot of the bigger accounts at that point. I was 31, but I was like a toddler. When you start your own thing, you just sort of leap off a diving board and just have faith that you will land on one or two feet and not on your head.
All I remember about that morning was that I was sitting in my apartment in the West Village, steaming my clothes for the show, and getting a call from my intern who told me to turn on the TV.
REBECCA TAYLOR (designer): My show was supposed to be that morning. I had been up most of the night. It was really bizarre, because everyone was saying a plane has flown into the World Trade Center, but we kept working. In your mind, you had a picture of the small plane that hit the Empire State Building in the 1940s. It wasn't until an hour later that everyone began to realize what had happened, and we were already at the tents with the clothes. I remember the models arriving, some of them from the tunnels, with soot on their faces, but still arriving for the show and asking, ''Am I late?'' I was talking to someone from Women's Wear Daily about makeup and what colors we were using, and we were both crying. And then Fern Mallis, who ran the shows, came out and said they were shutting down and to go home.
DOUGLAS HANNANT (designer, who was scheduled to show at 10 a.m. that day): We were showing in the big tent that day, and we had been there for hours. I was already backstage doing interviews, and I couldn't understand why so many of the models weren't showing up on time. I had just done a live segment with one of the morning shows when Audrey Marnay, who was in the show, grabbed my hand, and she looked really scared. She took me out to the lobby of the tents where there were televisions set up, and my jaw dropped. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It wasn't much longer before they were clearing the tents, and later we found out there had been a bomb threat in Bryant Park, so everything got thrown into these big hampers to wheel back to the showroom. My whole staff and I were walking back, and as we crossed Sixth Avenue, we actually saw the first tower fall.
Later that day, I walked, for blocks and blocks and blocks, just to think, and I remember looking at everyone's faces, and everyone looked different.
BEHNAZ SARAFPOUR (designer): We were all in shock. We didn't know what to do. That was actually supposed to be my first show, that Wednesday. We had rented a venue for the first time, booked the models, hired production people and everything.
I had done a capsule collection for fall that had gotten a lot of attention. We had called a few market editors from the major magazines and they came to my small studio apartment. I literally had 14 pieces of clothing on one rack. We had already started getting a lot of press, just from that. They gave me a two-and-a-half page story in Vogue, which was kind of scary.
When 9/11 happened, we canceled the first show we were going to have. We got a call from Vogue, and they said they were trying to organize a group fashion show for the designers they thought were really promising, and they would like us to be one of them.
ANNA WINTOUR (editor in chief, Vogue): We had maybe 10 or 12 designers who the editors suggested really needed the most help, and Carolina Herrera was so generous and gave us her showroom. We got the models. We did the hair and the makeup. The designers all came to our offices to bring their collections. It was a lovely, emotional feeling.
At the same time, it was a bit of an eye opener for me to realize how hand-to-mouth their existence really was. We thought designers just popped up, and sometimes they do, but they also need support and counseling.
MS. TAYLOR: I was surprised that they did contact us, but I was very flattered and pleased because I had all my outfits lined up, bagged and numbered, and ready to go. I remember Anna Wintour looking at it and saying, ''You're very organized.'' I was going to have a show at the tents. I should be organized, but I guess a lot of the other kids were like ''scraps on hangers.''
We've never had a lot of money. We started our business on $40,000 and have just grown bit by bit. My partner, Beth Bugdaycay, is very strict with money, like buying two-for-one pizzas and knowing where all the bargains are. She had ordered Pax for lunch, which was a real extravagance, and I remember, after we realized what had happened, her calling them and trying to cancel it. ''Cancel the lox and bagels, we don't need it! We're not paying for it!'' And then it arrived anyway, and I remember going across the road to the factories to offer it to anyone, and people were asking what we were doing. We're like, ''We don't need this food.'' It's weird, you know, you manifest your anxieties in things that, looking back, don't add up.
MARIA CORNEJO (designer of the label Zero + Maria Cornejo): My very first show for Zero was supposed to be on the morning of Sept. 11. The store had been open for three years, but I had only just started wholesaling the collection, and this was to be the first season with a show. You can imagine that this was a very emotional time for many reasons.
CHRISTINE GANO (designer, whose label, Christine Ganeaux, took its spelling from her family name prior to its Americanization): I had shown my collection right before 9/11, but obviously no one was writing about anything to do with fashion after that. Somehow, making clothes, it all felt so frivolous.
PIERRE CARRILERO (designer, Pierrot): I was known for knitwear, but my spring show would have been, should have been, the pivotal show in my career because it would have elevated my brand to other things than sweaters. It was going to have 167 people for what was my vision of Broadway. I was going to sing and dance at Webster Hall. I had dancers, singers and Paris Hilton. It was really awesome.
So when that didn't happen, and I got the call about this show, I thought it was too much. They went to my studio and took everything. I was like, Ms. Wintour was there? I didn't want to answer the phone. Basically, I was so trashed. So was three-quarters of the city of New York.
MS. SARAFPOUR: There are some times when you feel like fashion isn't that big in the broader scheme of the world. CNN wasn't announcing that Fashion Week was canceled. I honestly thought it was really amazing of Vogue to try to pull this together for us.
It was a little bit crazy. You had a group of young designers who weren't used to showing, and everyone was trying to get involved and zhuzhing up their models. I had made these pieces that were actually recycled with antique linens from the 1920s that I had collected and made into ready-to-wear. I remember meeting Carolina Herrera for the first time and she said, ''Oh, I have these tablecloths.''
DEBORAH HUGHES (show producer): We put it together in probably five or six days. We had no music. I don't remember why. Maybe we didn't feel it was appropriate. But I don't think anyone realized until the models came out and all you heard was their footsteps and the clicks of the cameras. There was a long hallway and Mrs. Herrera put a huge American flag at the end of it.
MR. CARRILERO: We were all in a trance. There was just so little time after the trauma. It was a weird moment, and there was Ms. Wintour. I just saw her with her entourage, and I said ''Thank you so much,'' and gave her a big hug. I didn't know she didn't like to be touched. But thank you, it's awesome. Erin O'Connor was in the look that was like Gloria Swanson, ''I am ready for my close-up,'' with the turban. Oh, she just played it up. And Anouck Lepere was in the little black dress from ''Breakfast at Tiffany's.''
BENJAMIN CHO (designer): I remember when Anna walked in, Pierre was standing next to me and she looked so frightened. At first, I thought it was me.
MR. SOM: I had all these lacing things on the sides of the outfits. All I remember was trying to make sure Alek Wek's side tie was tied right. All I could focus on were the practical things I could get done. It was somewhat of a daze.
MS. TAYLOR: I think it was important for all of us to feel like we were part of something bigger, part of a community, at a time when everyone was feeling so fragile and vulnerable.
MS. CORNEJO: I think doing this show was a way to unify people and work together.
MS. WINTOUR: It was adorable. It was about the industry helping each other. It was a very small thing, but it felt good. We're not going to be defeated.
For some of them, it was a nightmare time. Nobody was shopping. I can't pretend businesses were changed overnight. It was more of a symbolic event for the industry.
CAROLINA HERRERA (designer): Before, there was a great opulence in fashion and then this terrible thing happened and everybody went back to the roots: clothes that we have to sell because we have to survive. And we did. Fashion always survives. It is for your everyday life. It's not only frivolous, as people think, to talk about fashion and clothes and all of that. It's for your everyday life. You project yourself when you get dressed. Fashion has always been important.
A DECADE later, most of the designers from An American View continue to work in the industry in some way, though only four -- Ms. Sarafpour, Ms. Taylor, Mr. Som and Ms. Cornejo -- have maintained their signature labels.
Mr. Smith, after working with Isaac Mizrahi and Liz Claiborne, now consults for other labels. Ms. Gano has a store in Amagansett, N.Y. Mr. Carrilero resumed his Pierrot collection for private clients, and Mr. Soheil, after closing his label in 2006, moved to Dallas.
Ms. Jimenez, who also continues to design, has appeared on ''Project Runway'' and will compete in its all-star edition. Tuleh closed last year, and Mr. Bradley declined to comment other than to say, in an e-mail message, ''I'm mostly catching up on my reading: a lifetime's pursuit.'' (Mr. Patner, who left Tuleh in 2002, is now a style writer and consultant to designers.) Mr. Cho, also an artist and D.J., shows his collections sporadically.
While some of the designers carried on, and others faced bitter disappointment, their diverging paths illustrate how much each of them, and their industry, have changed.
MS. GANO: Things had started tanking. Bloomingdale's said they wanted to buy the line, and then the order wasn't going to be as big as they said. I called my factor, and they said they couldn't give me the money, so I'd have to take out a huge personal loan to make this order. I felt a lot of pressure. There were also some people who wanted to buy into my business, but I wasn't sure I wanted to work for someone else.
I also had a young son at the time, and every day I would drop him off at school and then I would drop down and sit there on the sidewalk and sob. I was wearing Manolo Blahniks and had a pair of sneakers in my bag, because I never knew what I would do if something happened. Would I have to run? Then one day I got a note that a child at the school had been exposed to anthrax. Did I want to continue to design? Or did I want to leave the city?
I just hightailed it out of there.
TONY SMITH: Just a few months later, in December, that's when Billy Reid had to close. I basically finished what I had to do, too. I sent the clothes to the stores and I closed it. Billy tried to come back again. He's amazing. It's like he's had nine lives.
Since then I've done a number of things. I worked for Club Monaco for a while. I worked in licensing. I've been trying to find where I belong. Somewhere there's a home out there, but I haven't found it yet. I still have my passion. I still love it. Opportunities present themselves to you in different ways. Sometimes you make things happen or you search for them. Other times, you want them to find you.
LIZ LANGE (now the designer of Liz Lange for Target and Completely Me by Liz Lange, a ready-to-wear collection for HSN): There was a feeling of money being thrown around in the late '90s that hasn't really existed since, even in 2006 or 2007, which were really great times. You couldn't pay me now to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a fashion show in Bryant Park. I'm not knocking it, but that seems like a crazy frivolity to me in relation to my brand, whereas it seemed like everything to me in 2001.
Today, everything is sponsored or licensed. In 2001, you had to pay for your show. It wasn't like Pampers was knocking down my door to pay for my show, even though there was a lot of synergy.
MR. CHO: I'm friends with Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez from Proenza Schouler, and we joke around that if I had started just a little bit later, I could have gotten a lot of support. The amount of money I spend on a show is shocking to people. When I tell Jack and Lazaro, they're like, ''That's less than our lighting.''
MS. JIMENEZ: Everybody wanted to be as safe as possible, and economically I think that had very burdensome effects. All of a sudden, it was very hard for the independents. My fashion is part of a larger artwork. Everything is unfinished. Some things are raw and undone, and that is intentional. But instantly, the aesthetic went much more structured. It was a more romanticized time, like the '40s or '50s.
It was difficult to keep up with, but I had these hand-drawn T-shirts that I was turning into a line of silk screens, and I had just been picked up by Urban Outfitters in London. On Aug. 25, 2004, I was walking with my daughter to have high tea, and we got hit by a 19-year-old girl in a Porsche. I was in a coma for five days. It took two or three years to heal from that. Now I really do live the artist, patron and one-third retail lifestyle. I'd like to be more retail, but I don't know if I agree with some of the choices the industry makes.
MS. GANO: I met a business partner in Amagansett, and we decided to open a store out here called Rube. We support a lot of young designers. I feel like we are able to give them the freedom to design, while I have the liberty to make things when I want to. I am actually starting to make my line again. I was thinking after 10 years that it was time.
I understand both sides of the coin. I'm the retailer dealing with young designers so I understand their frustrations. I'm just doing pieces for the store right now. I don't want to get back into the mentality that you've got to show it by such and such a date. The things it takes to run a fashion business in general tend to stifle your creative license.
When I look back, I was forced to make tough decisions, and in a lot of ways, I have a much more meaningful life for it. In that business, you're always living in the now and living for the next deadline and the next collection.
MS. SARAFPOUR: My fall runway show the next year was sponsored by Style.com. After the photos came out, The Washington Post had this big full-page story with a picture from my show and a look from Prada's show. It was absurd, but it kind of relayed the sentiment that people were so excited about seeing some new faces in the fashion industry. It was a period when big corporate-name fashion wasn't cool. Buying something from a designer whose name you couldn't pronounce was cool.
As a designer, you have moments in your career that are really outstanding. Last year, I came in second for the National Design Awards. At the White House, they had invited a bunch of students to meet some of the designers and asked us to bring a portfolio so they could see what our work was about. These high school students who wanted to become fashion designers were flipping through my book, and one of the guys said, ''So you did all this, this year?''
These were press clippings from an almost nine-year period. I said: ''No, you don't understand. You make like 50 pieces in a season and maybe 2 end up in Vogue. This is a small fraction of what we do.''
He actually said: ''This is too much for me. I don't want to do it anymore.''
I felt terrible. But unless people have worked in the industry, they don't know how much work is involved.
MS. TAYLOR: I do think young people do need an awful lot of education about what running a business is. It's not just making clothes. It's making a lot of clothes and often and for a long time. These designers come out with a great collection, and that's awesome, but do it 8 times a year for 20 years and then we'll talk. I think that the mentoring programs today are as important as the money. Money you spend quickly, but good advice you keep forever.
MR. CARRILERO: I don't drink anymore. I straightened out my life. I had gone upstate to a cabin in the woods and I was knitting my sweaters with bears and coyotes all around me. I came back two years after. And still I am doing sweaters, still selling clothes, but all of a sudden I discovered I wanted to keep everything tighter around me. I have factories in Brooklyn, but that's basically a living room with five Russian knitters.
The world is not a lovely world for the moment, and it is hard to keep faith. Before, fashion people used to stab you in the back. That's fine. You know that's how it is. Now, they stab you in the front, and on whatever side they can. The situation is so wrong. They would push their own mother down the stairs just to sell a dress. I'm annoyed by the mass consumption. If for two years, every brand would stop producing the mass crap and just revamp what is already in their warehouses, like 300 million T-shirts from Kmart, Wal-Mart, all those brands, then that would definitely be a breath of fresh air. But, of course, it is impossible.
MR. SOM: I'm still doing my own collection. I'm consulting with Tommy Hilfiger now. My career has definitely improved. In this industry, there are challenges every step of the way. But the ability to react, to bounce back, is something I think we are good at because fashion is so fast-paced anyway, that you have to keep moving.
MRS. HERRERA: Some of them are still in business, some of them are not. It was exciting to see all of these young people full of hope. Why not help? If they are talented, why are they not going to arrive? Some of them did. Some of them didn't. But you have to give a hand to all of them, because you don't know which one is going to arrive.
MS. WINTOUR: Out of that, we created the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund. I had no idea that it would grow in the way that it has. In a way, of all the initiatives that we work on, it is one that came out of such an emotional place. With young designers there is that naivete and that charm and that sense that anything is possible that is very enchanting. And at the same time you just really want to help them to structure a business plan, and understand merchandising and all of the things you need to have to make a viable business. It was through that American View show way back 10 years ago that we realized in more depth that this was what was needed.
If you look at the schedule today, and I know we all moan and groan that we've got so many collections, but look how vibrant and interesting it is.
I do think it's important to make the point that as awful as adversity is, it is important to be positive and think about how you can help and what you can do. It can have results. It is so easy to moan and to complain a lot, but being positive and proactive is by far the most rewarding way to be. Do I sound too Pollyanna? I really believe that.

HEADLINE: Heat-Seeking Missiles Are Missing From Libyan Arms Stockpile

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND and C. J. CHIVERS; Rod Nordland reported from Tripoli, Libya, and C. J. Chivers from the United States. Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
TRIPOLI, Libya -- The sign on the wall reads ''Schoolbook Printing and Storage Warehouse,'' but the fact that the double gates in the wall have been crudely ripped off suggests that something more interesting might be inside.
It turns out that the only books to be found in any of the three large buildings in the walled compound are manuals -- how to fire rocket launchers and wire-guided missiles, among others. The buildings are actually disguised warehouses full of munitions -- mortar shells, artillery rounds, anti-tank missiles and more -- thousands of pieces of military ordnance that are completely unguarded more than two weeks after the fall of the capital.
Perhaps most interesting of all is what is no longer there, but until recent days apparently was: shoulder-fired heat-seeking missiles of the type that could be used by terrorists to shoot down civilian airliners. American authorities have long been concerned that Libyan missiles could easily find their way onto the black market. 
These missiles, mostly SA-7b Grails, as NATO refers to them, have been spotted in Libya before and are well known to have been sold to the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi by former Eastern bloc countries. The evidence at the schoolbook warehouse confirms just how large those quantities were. It also raises questions about how many of them may have been purloined by rebels, criminals or smugglers.
Matthew Schroeder, who researches heat-seeking antiaircraft missiles and their proliferation for the Federation of American Scientists in Washington, said the discovery of yet another looted arms depot in Libya was cause for concern, especially depots that contained what security specialists call Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems, or Manpads.
Western governments and nongovernment organizations have repeatedly asked and prodded the rebel government, the Transitional National Council, to take steps to secure the vast stockpiles of arms that it has inherited, apparently to little avail.
''Claims that depots holding Manpads and other dangerous weapons are still not being properly secured are very worrisome and should be thoroughly investigated,'' Mr. Schroeder said. ''In cases where stockpile security is found to be lacking, immediate steps should be taken to correct any deficiencies.''
In Washington, President Obama's top counterterrorism official, John O. Brennan, said that the spread of shoulder-fired missiles and other weapons from Libya's arsenal posed ''a lot of concerns,'' and that the United States had pressed the rebel government to secure weapons stockpiles. ''Obviously, there are a lot of parts of that country right now that are ungoverned,'' he said at a security conference.
A senior American military officer who follows Libya closely said it was puzzling that there had been so few documented instances in which Libyan loyalist troops launched shoulder-fired missiles at NATO aircraft. ''I'm not sure what that means,'' the officer said. ''Fewer systems than we thought? Systems are inoperable? Few in Libya know how to operate them?''
The officer said it was also unclear whether Al Qaeda or other extremist groups had acquired the missiles, though he said intelligence analysts were assuming they had. ''But if they do, why haven't they used or threatened to use?'' the officer said. ''It's all very murky right now.''
On Wednesday, a reporter for The New York Times, as well as a researcher for Human Rights Watch and other reporters who visited the scene, found 10 crates that had held two missiles each lying opened and empty. The crates were clearly labeled as coming from Russia.
''Other countries know these weapons are on the loose, and they will be trying to get their hands on them,'' said a researcher for Human Rights Watch, Peter Bouckaert.
He was particularly concerned with one crate, labeled ''9M342,'' the Russian designation for the SA-24 heat-seeking missile.
''These were some of the most advanced weaponry the Russians made,'' Mr. Bouckaert said. Referring to the rebels who have taken control of Tripoli and to the international community, he added, ''They need to get people here to secure some of this.''
The SA-24 can be mounted on vehicle-based launchers or fired from a person's shoulder via a much smaller launcher known as a grip stock. The latter configuration, of the same class of weapon as the American-made Stinger, is considered the gravest potential danger to civilian aircraft because the weapon is readily portable and relatively simple to conceal and use.
No grip stocks for SA-24s have yet been found in Libya, and the Russian manufacturer of the SA-24 has previously said that it did not sell any grip stocks to Colonel Qaddafi's military. The SA-24s, it said, were sold only with vehicle-mounted launchers.
The SA-7, however, is a shoulder-fired missile. A Soviet-era weapon dating to the 1960s that remains in wide use and circulation, it has been implicated in several attacks on airliners over the years, including a failed attack on an Israeli charter plane.
Former Eastern bloc nations call it a Strela, for the Russian word for arrow. Nine of the freshly emptied crates found Wednesday were marked with the Eastern bloc designation for the Strela: 9M32M.
Libyan rebels have occasionally been spotted carrying SA-7s, though the weapon has no evident practical use to them, given that the Qaddafi air force was grounded by NATO months ago and that the only military aircraft confirmed in the Libyan skies have been the NATO planes supporting the rebels' advances.
Although only nine crates holding two SA-7s each were found in the schoolbook warehouse, those crates were a part of what evidently were nine different consignments.
In all, those consignments added up to a total of 2,445 crates delivered from Russia to Tripoli, containing 4,890 missiles, according to markings on the crates. But there was no way to ascertain whether the other crates in those consignments had previously been in this warehouse, or in some other part of the country. Many of the other missiles may have been issued to the Qaddafi forces in the field, which for months had a need to defend against aerial attack.
The Times has previously documented that 5,270 SA-7b missiles had been delivered to Libya. Some of those shipments were part of the same consignments found Wednesday. But according to the stenciled markings on the newly found crates, at least 2,322 of the missiles appear to be from previously undiscovered consignments, meaning that at least 7,592 of the missiles had been sent to Libya. Estimates of the true total run as high as 20,000 such missiles.
A spokesman for the Libyan rebel military, Abdulrahman Busin, said the rebel authorities were aware of the schoolbook warehouse, which is only about a quarter-mile from the headquarters of the Khamis Brigade, an elite loyalist military unit headed by a son of Colonel Qaddafi. Mr. Busin said the rebel ''military police'' had probably removed the missiles.
''The military police were aware of this and they took charge of it; they're the ones who secured it,'' Mr. Busin said.
But if that was the case, he was unable to explain why the facility remained unguarded on Wednesday. And efforts were unsuccessful in contacting the head of the military police to confirm if his forces indeed had the missing missiles.

HEADLINE: Tents, but No Circus

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
ELEPHANTS used to walk through the streets every year when the circus came to New York City, trunks swinging, leg chains scraping, lumbering through Midtown as mist rose off their leathery flanks. Anachronistic and enchanting, the vision of these exotic beasts being herded through the concrete canyons never failed to produce a shiver of excitement in even the most jaded bystander. It made you feel part of the circus, the great urban one, even if you never made it to the Big Top.
Fashion Week was once like that, too, an annual influx of exotic creatures that descended on the city, come here to enact their strange rituals and perform crazy stunts for crowds of passionate devotees gathered under big tents. Shy, long-limbed young models, heads cocked tentatively like baby impala, could be spotted in clusters all over Manhattan, darting and leaping the curbs on their way to the shows.
The actual circus, as we all know -- with its sword swallowers, high fliers and alcoholic clowns -- was outflanked long ago by packaged corporate entertainments. The likelihood is dim that you'll spot the salaried Cirque du Soleil types who have sold out the entire holiday season at Radio City Music Hall high-stepping through Midtown anytime soon. 
And, like that other well-managed machine, the Fashion Week bulldozer now lumbers along. Yet it's radically different from earlier and loopy incarnations, more efficient than ever, and big (though oddly not as big as it once was, even at 250 scheduled shows); media-noisy (blanket coverage on TV and in the dailies, including the one you are holding; reality-show gargoyles making 140 character pronouncements on ''Insta chic''; tween bloggers who already seem so ubiquitous and familiar they're like modern Erma Bombecks); and hectic enough (see above) to keep hardcore types entertained.
But what the increasingly industrialized Fashion Week now signally lacks is a certain giddy excitement, the fanfare and promise of genius that were common in the days when you could still get close enough to it all to see the greasepaint and smell the sweat.
''The food world is much more interesting now than fashion,'' said Kim Hastreiter, an editor of Paper magazine, where she has spent more than two decades sniffing out what's next.
Carine Roitfeld, the former editor of French Vogue, is another inveterate spotter of trends, and in an interview for a new photo-biography of her produced by Olivier Zahm, the editor and publisher of Purple, Ms. Roitfeld claimed flatly that fashion is not much fun anymore. ''It's less light-hearted, less spontaneous,'' Ms. Roitfeld said. ''Fashion has become an industry, one that increasingly stifles creation.''
Whether that last assertion is true, there is no arguing with Ms. Roitfeld's observation that sometimes these days runway shows feel about as thrilling as corporate seminars. What's missing from fashion, the influential French editor added, is ''amazement'' and the ''madness you could experience even a few years back.''
Wasn't inspired madness what drew 661,509 visitors to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in recent months, and what made people line up for hours to see ''Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty,'' turning it into the eighth-biggest attendance draw in that institution's history?
You didn't hear it said at the time, but when the epic McQueen show finally closed in August, a curtain quietly came down on contemporary fashion's great decade of experiment and expansion.
The dramatic loss of Mr. McQueen to suicide, along with John Galliano's disgraced exit from Dior last year, underscored a reality little noted in the industry. For 10 years -- and as it happens largely financed by the same multinationals that ultimately robbed fashion of its endearing mom-and-pop elements -- a great cultural theater was inaugurated, one that featured epic showmen like Mr. McQueen, Mr. Galliano and Tom Ford at Gucci, and that introduced large segments of the general public to the previously obscure customs of a small tribal world, thus transforming fashion from an insular business and pursuit of the cognoscenti into an irresistible and, some would argue, dominant cultural force.
No spectator lucky enough to have had a front-row seat on the transgressive theater of fashion over the last decade was left in any doubt that these were unusual and vivid times: smoke and fireworks in tented firetraps (Mr. Galliano); fur-lined catwalks (Gucci); caged wolves at the medieval Conciergerie in Paris (Mr. McQueen); elaborate Kabuki scenarios enacted in the Espace Ephemere set up twice yearly in the Jardins des Tuileries (Dior) near the Louvre; bondage and Jack the Ripper scenarios played out in warehouses skirting the gloomy canals in Milan (McQueen men's wear.)
Fueled by booming Western economies and a hunger to tap the riches of emerging markets -- particularly in the so-called BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) -- big corporations were happy to underwrite the costly flights of imagination proposed by designers like Mr. McQueen, Mr. Ford and Mr. Galliano. It was clear to the men who ran companies like Pinault-Printemps-Redoute or Richemont or LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (among them controlling more than 500 of the most familiar luxury goods labels) that, more than designers, they needed great showmen to help forge brand identities as they recast old labels and took new ones out into the world.
Now that there is a Vuitton store in Ulan Bator, that task can be considered completed.
As one looks forward to a month of new fashions displayed on the catwalks of New York, London, Milan and Paris, perhaps only Marc Jacobs in New York, Karl Lagerfeld in Paris and Miuccia Prada in Milan offer much promise of fascinating spectacle or challenging aesthetics or even a little goofball fun. The trouble is that even Mr. Jacobs's ability to generate buzz, Ms. Prada's sly subversions, Mr. Lagerfeld's well-financed (by the Wertheimer family that controls Chanel) coups de theatre can do only so much to offset an overall drift toward aesthetic complacency and boredom.
True, Mr. Lagerfeld may thrill everybody for an hour with another stage set like the one in 2010 that featured small mountains of ice hacked off a glacier in Sweden and then trucked across the continent to the Grand Palais in Paris. Yet even a stunt like that can't alter the fact that in a borderline bear market hardly any designer can justify a line item for live wolves.
So it should not surprise us, as another Fashion Week gets under way on the anniversary of 9/11, and also on the precipice of a recession, that we've entered a less colorful phase in the long fashion cycle, one in which competence supplants genius, sound business strategies take precedence over risk taking and the tasteful safety of collections pitched toward mass-market ''Maxxinistas'' are unlikely to lift fashion out of its commercial origins and into the realms of art. It says something about the season to come that among the most tantalizing and sprightly prospects are Missoni's partnership with Target and Jil Sanders' final collection for Uniqlo.
''I respect this business, and I understand the risks involved, but I also want to preserve a degree of spontaneity,'' Ms. Roitfeld said in the interview, voicing a hankering many in the business share for the days when designers sent models out catwalks wearing kelp or dressed like Martian princesses, when the editor and muse Isabella Blow was still stalking the streets wearing wimples and armor and the other outrageous forms of raiment that Barneys New York hung in its windows after her death.
Fashion, as Ms. Roitfeld noted, ''is nothing without its carefree side.''
McQueen is dead, in other words. Long live McQueen.

HEADLINE: Are the 'RepliKates' Ready to March?

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
AS he lounged near a pool in Southampton, N.Y., last month, Wes Gordon had an epiphany. A group of young women gathered nearby were poring over an issue of People, its pages teeming with images of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Sheathed in trim-fitting dresses, her slender arms covered almost to the wrist, the duchess impressed them as a model of regal aplomb.
They could not seem to get enough of her, Mr. Gordon recalled. Not her slim dresses, nor her pumps, her J Brand jeans or see-through hose. But mostly they chattered about her sleeves. Those long sleeves were a touch, said the designer (who will show his spring line at the Hosfelt Gallery on Thursday) ''that six months ago not one of those girls would have commented on.''
Catherine's style -- streamlined and seemly almost to a fault -- resonates as well with scores of young women who aspire to a classically patrician look but who have, until recently, had few credible role models. To court them, Mr. Gordon said, designers must ask themselves, ''How do I make elegance relevant to someone who's young? 
''To some degree,'' he said, ''Kate supplies the answer.''
Indeed, Kate's influence will be felt on the runways on Thursday when New York Fashion Week begins, if not in any literal sense, then surely as a state of mind. ''We are in a Kate moment,'' said Ed Burstell, the managing director for Liberty of London. Mr. Burstell, who expects to see a pronounced ''Kate effect'' in New York this week, added that since her recent tours abroad, ''everyone wants to look like her, to act like her, to be her.''
Or maybe just to dress her. Less impressed by her wardrobe than by her infectious mix of ebullience and propriety, Seventh Avenue designers as diverse as Vera Wang, Tory Burch, Peter Som and Tommy Hilfiger have acknowledged her widening influence.
''We are definitely returning to a time when we want things that are more timeless and polished, not looking a mess,'' said Rachel Zoe, the Hollywood stylist turned fashion designer, whose fame once rested on her luxuriously disheveled approach to dress. The duchess represents a return to classicism, said Ms. Zoe, who will offer ''Savile Row-style'' tailoring and herringbone tweeds in her show next week, in a nod, however oblique, to American notions of British taste and refinement.
Jason Wu's current concept of chic will entail ''an old-school silhouette,'' he said, shapely and controlled but voluminous at times, reminiscent of a princess in a fairy tale. A couple of years ago, the deliberately dissolute look of a model off duty was a strong inspiration, he said. ''Now people are interested in looking ladylike.''
Mr. Wu, who first gained recognition when he dressed American royalty in the person of Michelle Obama, sees fashion becoming more refined and less aggressive, he said, as slashed jeans and biker jackets give way to demure dresses and blazers. ''The duchess is part of that,'' he said.
Mr. Hilfiger will make a subtle detour from his signature preppy style, introducing a more restrained and worldly look for spring. ''We like our woman to be dressed up from head to toe,'' said Mr. Hilfiger, who will parade Macintosh fabrics and Prince of Wales plaids on his catwalk. In a departure from his willfully incongruous pattern mix of last season, ''we will be really very studied about how we're putting our outfits together,'' he said, to the point of offering matching shoes and bags -- an apparent homage to Britain's future queen.
Kate's impact, he predicted, will be all but inescapable: ''She will influence all markets.''
Indeed there is plenty to suggest that her influence is already widely felt in the mainstream, as moderate chains like Zara, Reiss, Talbots and Topshop cater to a taste for replicKates, as bloggers have called them: pert shirtwaists, lace sheaths and primly tailored coatdresses.
Nor are the affluent immune to her charms. ''We are not necessarily going to see exact adaptations of what she is wearing,'' said Ken Downing, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, but she wields an impact just the same. ''Dressing up is the new cool, and dressing down is old school,'' he continued. ''I attribute much of that to Kate.''
Despite her popularity, the duchess has detractors. Invoking her name to describe a collection can signal disdain. That seemed to be the case when, following a Valentino couture show in July, Giancarlo Giammetti, a former owner of the brand, pronounced the collection ''very Kate Middleton,'' a casually blistering reference to a line replete with discreetly scooped necklines and long sleeves, traditional touches that act like catnip on trend-averse socialites.
Kate's advent is timely nonetheless. Her unflagging graciousness, guileless manner and nonthreatening good looks are viewed by admirers as a tonic, the sparkling antidote to excess. ''There's nothing trashy or vulgar about her,'' said Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, which has featured the duchess several times. ''She dresses her age and never looks out of place.''
Catherine is, in Mr. Burstell's term, ''the anti-Kardashian,'' a bracing antithesis to the strident style and manner of many Hollywood celebrities, who ''look so phony by comparison,'' he said, ''with their paid endorsements and brand-ambassador deals.'' Diane Von Furstenberg, whose dresses the duchess has worn, said that she represents a craving for a proper alternative to the ''housewives,'' a reference to the popular television reality series.
Few would call Catherine adventurous, or even especially chic. ''She is no Daphne Guinness,'' Ms. Wintour allowed. As a standard-bearer of the status quo, she speaks to a conservative mind-set conspicuous on the runways of late. Particularly in a sluggish economy, ''designers feel they have to be reactive, to provide consumers with less risk,'' said Marshal Cohen, chief analyst with the NPD group, the consumer research firm. ''When they see an influence like Kate, some of them will jump all over it, if only to validate what they are already doing.''
Still, there is something in the tale of a commoner who finally weds her prince that appeals to people's inner Cinderella. And there are plenty of designers who will cater to their fantasies, parading frocks with princess seaming, billowing gowns and maybe even a saucy hat or two. ''That fairy tale aspect of fashion is what appeals to Americans,'' Ms. Zoe said. ''Who doesn't want to see the storybook come alive?''

HEADLINE: Police See IHOP Shooting In Nevada as Random

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY; Ian Lovett contributed reporting from Los Angeles, and Malia Wollan from San Francisco.

 BODY:
CARSON CITY, Nev. -- Officials here offered new details Wednesday about a shooting rampage in an IHOP restaurant, a seemingly random attack on Tuesday morning that left five people -- including three National Guard members -- dead and several others clinging to life.
Despite the identities of the victims and the proximity to the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, the Carson City sheriff, Ken Furlong, seemed to back away from early theories that the gunman, identified as Eduardo Sencion, 32, had specifically targeted members of the military when he entered the restaurant and began shooting along an aisle leading to the table where five National Guard members were eating breakfast.
''Along that path, equal members of military and civilians were shot,'' Sheriff Furlong said.
All told, 12 people were killed or injured, including Mr. Sencion, who shot himself in the parking lot after leaving the restaurant. He died later at a hospital. Sheriff Furlong identified the three dead Guard members as Maj. Heath Kelly, 35, of Reno, Nev.; Sgt. First Class Christian Riege, 38, of Carson City; and Sgt. First Class Miranda McElhiney, 31, of Reno. The remaining two Guard members were still in the hospital, but have ''non-life threatening injuries,'' said Maj. April Conway, a National Guard spokeswoman. 
The dead also included a 67-year-woman -- Florence Donovan-Gunderson, of South Lake Tahoe, Calif., about 30 miles to the southwest -- who was dining with her husband, who was also shot but survived.
The shooting was the first homicide in the state capital in three years, said Sheriff Furlong, who called it ''the most devastating attack in Carson City's history.''
The question of who Mr. Sencion was and what exactly drove him to murder continued to perplex the authorities, though they said that he had struggled with mental problems. The Nevada Appeal reported on Wednesday that Mr. Sencion had been committed to a South Lake Tahoe mental facility in 2000, something Sheriff Furlong said his office was investigating.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, meanwhile, was also trying to determine how Mr. Sencion -- a naturalized American who was born in Mexico -- had obtained three weapons: two assault-style rifles and a pistol, all of three of which were found at the scene. The bureau was looking into whether the guns had been converted from semi-automatic to fully automatic, Sheriff Furlong said. But only one of the three weapons found by the authorities-- a rifle -- was used in the attack, which started just before 9 a.m. at an IHOP on the south side of town and ended just minutes later.
The scene of the shooting was still locked down on Wednesday morning, as the police and sheriff's officials continued to look for evidence. The restaurant's south window showed two bullet holes -- small spider webs of shattered glass where bullets had struck.
Sheriff Furlong described a chaotic scene as Mr. Sencion appeared in the parking lot of the restaurant -- apparently chosen at random, as he had no personal or professional ties there -- and began shooting. The bullets hit several nearby businesses including the Fandango casino across Highway 395, the city's six-lane central thoroughfare.
After entering the restaurant from the west -- in shadow, as the sun rose over hills to the east -- Mr. Sencion took a sharp right into the seating area, and aimed his weapon. Ms. Donovan-Gunderson and her husband -- a retired military veteran himself -- were hit by one of the early volleys, which were accompanied by screams by Mr. Sencion, who apparently shouted at victims as he shot.
The five Guard members had started a 10-hour shift at 6:30 a.m., even as Carson City -- a sleepy seat of state government and casinos stuffed with slot machines -- shook off the Labor Day weekend. It was common for members of the Guard -- which has about 300 full-time members based here -- to retreat to places like IHOP to escape ''the tyranny of the in-box,'' as the base's commander, Brig. Gen. Bill Burks of the Nevada National Guard, put it.
Mr. Sencion shot all five Guard members at the table, none of whom were armed. He killed Major Kelly and Sergeant Riege at the scene -- Sergeant McElhiney died at a hospital Tuesday night. Mr. Sencion then left the restaurant, even as customers and IHOP workers frantically tried to escape, some rushing children out of back doors.
''There were many acts of heroism from many persons,'' Sheriff Furlong said.
Calls to 911 released Wednesday by the sheriff indicate a frenzied scene outside the restaurant, as well. In one call, a woman screams to an operator: ''There's a man with a machine gun at the IHOP!,'' adding, ''He's shooting people!'' Then another call -- and another and another.
Mr. Sencion did not have any prior criminal history, nor did he have any involvement with gangs or methamphetamine, issues that Carson City's police force has had to confront in the past.
But he had struggled financially. Joe Laub, a lawyer in Reno, said he had represented Mr. Sencion in a 2009 bankruptcy case after he ran up about $45,000 in credit card debt. Mr. Laub said Mr. Sencion never spoke to him about the military, nor did he display signs of mental illness.
''He was a very kind, friendly person, who did not display irrational behavior and seemed to be very helpful to friends and family,'' Mr. Laub said on Wednesday. ''He would bring different people into the office to get legal advice or guidance, and seemed sincerely concerned about their problems and helping them.''
Mr. Laub said that he had spoken to Mr. Sencion's brother, Gilberto, since the attack and that the family was grieving, something Sheriff Furlong echoed. ''The family did not take part in this,'' he said.
The mourning process was also under way at the National Guard base here, located in a small compound near the edge of town, where about 300 people work. General Burks said that two of the three Guard victims had survived tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan.
''It hit real hard,'' said General Burks, who had asked National Guard members on Tuesday not to wear their uniforms in public as a precaution.
General Burks offered a few details about the lives of the victims. Sergeant Riege, for example, was described as a fitness fan with three children who had served with the 221st Calvary in Afghanistan in 2010. Major Kelly, who was married with two children, had served with the Army in Iraq and had been decorated. Sergeant McElhiney, who was single, was a ''fast riser,'' who worked in various medical and administrative roles and made cupcakes for special National Guard events.
''It's pretty quiet on the base,'' Major Conway said. ''I think people are still in a reflective mood and just keeping to themselves. Certainly there is not the normal boisterous joviality that usually goes on in the halls. Everyone is still a little numb.''
On Wednesday, local residents also expressed shock at the attack. Joycelyn Salmon, a 72-year-old cab driver, said she had intended to go to IHOP that morning but decided on another restaurant nearby. ''I was strictly appalled,'' she said. ''There were kids in there. And the armed corps people. And there're protecting us.''
Ms. Salmon added that Carson City -- which, like the rest of Nevada, has double-digit unemployment -- had few mental health services available and that guns were common, both for hunting and protection. ''There's a lot of rattlesnakes out there,'' she said. Indeed, north of the IHOP, a gun shop advertised its opening with a large banner.
For all that, Sheriff Furlong said that the town's violent crimes were way down from several years ago and that 60 percent of the calls his office received were ''small thefts'' or simple assaults. ''We have violence against people,'' he said. ''But it's been on a decline since about 2005.''
All of which made the attack all the more painful for residents here. That included Sheriff Furlong, a straightforward lawman for more than three decades who has deep roots here: his father was the under-sheriff and he grew up around the police station. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, he likened the rampage to Sept. 11 and said his city of 55,000 would recover just as New York had.
''We're a resilient society,'' he said. ''We rebuild. But we don't forget.''

HEADLINE: A Rebound in Europe Is Felt on Wall Street

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Matthew Saltmarsh reported from London and David Jolly from Paris. Bettina Wassener contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
Stocks in the United States surged on Wednesday, snapping a three-day losing streak as the broader market rose almost 3 percent on momentum from a court ruling in Germany backing euro zone bailouts.
Wall Street picked up the momentum from higher markets in Europe and Asia. Bank stocks gained nearly 5 percent, a welcome reversal of a recent trend in the last few weeks, when they struggled amid uncertainty about euro zone debt; fluctuations in key economic data that reflect the challenges for housing and lending; and recently, a federal lawsuit that revisits problems with the way mortgages were handled.
Analysts said investors were encouraged by a ruling by the German Constitutional Court that rejected challenges that try to block German participation in bailouts for other countries in the euro area. Still, the court said future financial rescues would need the approval of Parliament's budget committee. 
The development, as well as European economic data released on Wednesday, went to the heart of a number of the issues facing investors, including how to gauge the euro zone's approach to its debt crisis and the pace of global economic growth.
The three main indexes in the United States were all more than 2 percent higher. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 2.5 percent, or 275.56 points, to 11,414.86. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.9 percent, or 33.38 points, to 1,198.62, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 3.0 percent, or 75.11 points to 2,548.94.
''It is a bit of a relief rally,'' said Paul Zemsky, the chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies for ING Investment Management.
Given the volatility in the markets recently, he and other analysts were cautious about the prospects for the broad gains to stick.
There was ''a favorable outcome'' to the German court ruling and the market was responding, Mr. Zemsky said, ''but we need to see follow-through.''
In addition to the German court ruling, the Italian Senate approved austerity measures -- after the markets closed -- intended to fend off the country's sovereign debt crisis.
''The Italian Senate passing the austerity bill is a boost and besides that I think it is going to help relieve some of the sovereign debt concerns, especially those that were intensifying in the past week or so regarding Italy and Spain,'' said Peter Cardillo, the chief market economist for Rockwell Global Capital.
At the same time, some analysts said that the banking sector might have hit its lows.
In a research report, analysts from Deutsche Bank noted that bank stocks have declined by 24 percent since July 21, the date to which the most recent sell-off period is often traced, while the broader market as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down by 13 percent.
''While numerous macro concerns remain, we believe the sell-off is overdone'' if gross domestic product growth is more than 1 percent, the analysts said about bank stocks over all.
Of the 10 most actively traded bank stocks on Wednesday, Regions Financial was up the most, more than 12 percent, at $4.37. The Deutsche Bank analysts upgraded the stock, which shed the most during the sell-off, as a buy after noting its management was cutting costs and for its outlook on the economy.
Bank of America rose more than 7 percent to $7.48. The bank shook up its top management team on Tuesday as it contended with a flagging share price and mounting legal liabilities. Citigroup was up 4.6 percent at $28.98.
Economists have been recalculating their outlook for the economy in the light of softer economic data and, to some extent, recent stock market volatility has increased the uncertainty for businesses. On Wednesday, a Federal Reserve survey of its 12 districts reported that many businesses in the United States had downgraded or become more cautious about their near-term outlooks.
Mr. Cardillo said the Fed's description in the survey, known as the beige book, that economic activity continued to expand at a modest pace in some districts also helped trading.
''I think this rally probably will extend itself,'' he said.
But the markets in the United States are also intertwined with global economies, and Mr. Zemsky noted that new data from Germany provided some support on Wednesday; the country's industrial production was reported to have surged 4 percent in July, above expectations and reversing a decline in June, despite slack demand.
''It looks like the economies around the world are slowing, not stopping,'' Mr. Zemsky said.
Corporate news propelled trading in critical sectors.
The technology sector rose solidly, led by Yahoo, which was up more than 5 percent at $13.61. The company's chief executive, Carol A. Bartz, was fired Tuesday, ending a rocky two-year tenure in which she tried to revitalize the online media company.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 17/32 to 100 24/32 and the yield rose to 2.04 percent from 1.98 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Waiting for a New Blueprint From Bank of America

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Brian T. Moynihan takes the stage at a Midtown Manhattan hotel on Monday to tell investors what is in store for Bank of America, but already the chief executive's plans are generating the kind of buzz reserved for the opening of a Broadway show down the street.
Will he break up the company and spin off Merrill Lynch? Cut tens of thousands of jobs? Put its subprime mortgage albatross, Countrywide, into bankruptcy? If not such a bold move, how does Mr. Moynihan plan to reverse the company's painful slide?
The earliest clues could come Thursday, when the top executives of the country's largest bank gather at its Charlotte, N.C., headquarters to review recommendations of a 44-member internal team that has been preparing restructuring plans since March.
Company officials say a split-up is out of the question for now, as is imminent bankruptcy for Countrywide. But 30,000 jobs, roughly 10 percent of the company's work force, could be eliminated over the next three years as a result of the restructuring initiative known as Project New BAC. 
There has been plenty of drama already this week, with the abrupt exit Tuesday of two top executives, Sallie Krawcheck and Joe Price, and the splitting of the bank into two basic units, one dealing with individual customers, the other focusing on businesses and institutions.
While company officials say the reorganization would actually make it harder to break up the company, it has not stilled the speculation.
''At some point, it gets too big to manage,'' said Brian Wenzinger, a principal at Aronson Johnson Ortiz, a Philadelphia money management firm. ''Smaller works better, and the less complicated it is, the better it can work.''
Bank of America shares rallied sharply Wednesday on a broader market jump, rising 7 percent to close at $7.48. They are still off 50 percent since January, weighed down largely by fears that the company could have to pay out tens of billions of dollars more to settle claims stemming from the subprime mortgage meltdown.
Those losses set off worries the company might need to raise fresh capital, but the $8.3 billion sale of its stake in China Construction Bank and a $5 billion investment by Warren Buffett last month have eased those fears for now.
Despite the cold water from executives, some big investors would like to see the Merrill brokerage and investment banking unit spun off.
''As a stockholder in Bank of America, I feel like Merrill Lynch would be worth $7 a share on its own, at least,'' said Buzzy Geduld, who sold his brokerage firm -- Herzog, Heine, Geduld -- to Merrill in 2000, and now owns more than 2.5 million shares in Bank of America. ''I think the upside is terrific.''
No one disputes the idea that Bank of America has become too complex. In some ways, the company resembles a crazy quilt assembled through acquisitions pursued by Mr. Moynihan's predecessor, Kenneth D. Lewis, whose deal-making culminated in 2008 with the purchase of both Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial, the subprime mortgage giant at the root of many of Bank of America's problems today.
Mr. Moynihan has spent much of his 18 months at the helm undoing Mr. Lewis's legacy. In fact, company officials say the need to turn what was a sprawling empire into a leaner, more focused enterprise is what is driving both Project New BAC, which takes its name from the company's ticker symbol, and Tuesday's reshuffling.
''We've simplified the company in the aftermath of the financial crisis and regulatory reform,'' said Anne M. Finucane, Bank of America's top global strategy and marketing officer. ''And we're reducing risk to both the company and the financial system by evaluating businesses that are not core to the strategy or were bolted on.''
She added that the new structure follows the blueprint Mr. Moynihan presented to the board shortly before he was tapped to become chief executive in December 2009.
Looking ahead, executives say the reorganization actually makes it harder to split off Merrill Lynch, because it will be more integrated into the overall company and will not remain under one main leader. Its famous ''thundering herd'' of 16,000 financial advisers will be under David Darnell, who will also head up Bank of America's more traditional consumer businesses. The institutional business will still be under Tom Montag, a Goldman Sachs veteran who joined Merrill shortly before Bank of America acquired it in 2008.
The first of what will be many more job cuts began Tuesday morning in Charlotte, when Mr. Moynihan met with Mr. Price and told him of the reorganization in person. Mr. Price, a 19-year veteran of the company, oversaw the consumer banking division.
Then he flew to New York to deliver the news personally to Ms. Krawcheck on Tuesday afternoon. In both cases, Mr. Moynihan told them they would not be offered positions in the new management team.
The cuts that will be laid out Thursday and Friday in Charlotte will be the deepest announced by any major bank in the United States since the industry began to recover from the financial crisis in 2009.
The job reductions will fall mostly on the consumer banking, home loan, and technology and support operations of the company, which account for more than 70 percent of its 288,000 employees. Some additional reductions could hit the former Merrill Lynch unit, despite strong profits in recent quarters.
More than anything else, say shareholders like Mr. Geduld, Mr. Moynihan needs to convince investors that the losses the company is facing on mortgage claims are manageable. Along with write-downs on bad loans, mortgage-related losses have caused Bank of America to lose $9 billion over the last 18 months.
On Friday, the federal agency overseeing the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac filed suit against 17 institutions, including Bank of America, to recover losses on mortgage-backed securities that collapsed after the housing bubble burst in 2007.
The issue is almost certain to come up at Monday's conference, and Mr. Moynihan will likely reiterate the company's contention that losses in mortgage-backed securities were not caused by how the loans were originated or packaged, but by the broader economic downturn and the housing bubble's collapse.
Bankruptcy for Countrywide is not being contemplated for now, with executives preferring to fight the suits in court, rather than risk alarming investors and creditors with news that one of the bank's units had filed for Chapter 11.
Moreover, Mr. Moynihan will contend that Fannie and Freddie were sophisticated investors who knew the securities were not without risk. ''We have very strong defenses,'' said Gary Lynch, the company's chief legal officer. ''These cases are eminently defensible. We're confident at the end of the day we are going to prevail.''

HEADLINE: Report Outlines Rewards and Risks of Upstate Natural Gas Drilling

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Natural gas drilling using a controversial technique known as hydraulic fracturing could create up to 37,000 jobs and generate from $31 million to $185 million a year in added state income taxes for New York at the peak level of well development, according to analyses in a report commissioned by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation that was released on Wednesday.
But communities in south-central and southwestern New York, on or near the Marcellus Shale, where most new drilling is expected, would pay a price for the local economic bonanza. 
Included among the negative impacts the report outlines are large-scale industrial activity, heavy truck traffic, more spending on police and fire protection and higher housing prices due to the expected influx of workers.
The report was contracted to Ecology and Environment, a New York environmental engineering consulting firm that counts among its clients both the state government and private oil and gas companies. The report now becomes part of the broader draft document by which New York environmental regulators identify risks and propose rules to allow hydraulic fracturing with horizontal drilling, for the first time in the state.
This drilling method, often called hydrofracking, uses high volumes of water, sand and chemicals to release natural gas from dense rock. Opponents argue that the method cannot be used without a high risk of water contamination and other environmental hazards.
The state, which released its draft document in July, is proposing to ban hydrofracking in watersheds and aquifers supplying drinking water to most New Yorkers and in other sensitive areas. But it would allow tens of thousands of wells in more than a dozen counties that sit on the rich natural gas field known as the Marcellus Shale.
By releasing the complete draft environmental document on Wednesday, the conservation department started the clock on the public comment period on fracking, which will run until Dec. 12. The agency will schedule four public hearings in November, including one in New York City.
But the department seemed to be fast-tracking hydrofracking by saying on Wednesday that it would also issue proposed rules based on its draft environmental study by October, so that those rules can undergo public comment as well.
Some environmental groups said those rules would normally undergo a separate review, after the agency's final environmental impact statement was issued.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has said he supports drilling in the Marcellus Shale if it is ''environmentally sensitive and safe.''
''The proposed environmental mitigation measures and the regulations that codify those measures go hand in hand,'' Joseph Martens, the environmental conservation commissioner, said in a written statement. ''It makes sense to move forward with them together and hold simultaneous public comment periods and hearings.''
But New Yorkers are deeply divided over whether the state should allow hydrofracking, and the new report on impacts is likely to intensify the debate.
Those who fear a profound change in the state's landscapes and the character of rural areas say the tradeoffs are not worth the benefits.
''Our economy depends on tourism, agriculture and education,'' said Ken Zeserson, the Planning Board chairman for the town of Ulysses, in Tompkins County. ''We can't do what we do if we have poisoned water and an industrialized network of pipelines.''
The state's draft environmental document proposes measures to mitigate the risk of water contamination and other adverse impacts. One is to limit simultaneous construction of well pads and wells near one another to reduce noise and traffic, department officials said.
The Ecology and Environment portion of the report said the size of future natural gas production in New York was largely unknown and would depend in part on market fluctuations. But it identified the region bordering Pennsylvania, which is already exploiting the Marcellus, and Broome, Chemung and Tioga Counties as the epicenter of the expected hydrofracking activity over the next 30 years.
The number of wells developed per year could range from 413 to 2,462, the report said, and could generate from 4,408 to 26,316 full-time construction jobs. The report predicts another 1,790 to 10,673 new jobs in production, along with added employment in retail and other economic areas.
Thomas Santulli, the Chemung County executive, said communities could prepare for drilling-related activity so that it did not ''overwhelm'' them. ''Everything has positives and negatives and you try to make the best out of it,'' Mr. Santulli said.
He said he supported hydrofracking largely because ''upstate New York has been starving for jobs for years.''

HEADLINE: Intervening in Libya

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''U.S. Tactics in Libya May Be a Model for Other Efforts'' (news analysis, Aug. 29): 
There is a lawless interventionism afoot. It is redefining America. The pretext in Libya: a massacre ''could'' occur. A United Nations resolution to protect the people became a vehicle to overthrow the government. Civilian casualties in Libya mounted after the United States and NATO attacked.
The United States, through NATO, ignored the Constitution and violated international law with impunity. Capitalizing on the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people, the United States and NATO (with cooperating oil interests) prevaricated to gain access to Libya's wealth. Isn't this what we did in Iraq?
To please the West, Libya cooperated with the Central Intelligence Agency, got rid of its weapons of mass destruction in 2004 and privatized its economy, causing widespread unemployment.
What message does this interventionist model send to Iran: cooperate and be destroyed?
What have we become if we permit predatory interventionism to go unchallenged? This isn't about Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. It is about us. Who are we?

HEADLINE: Fair Lending and Accountability

 BODY:
The banking industry is complaining loudly in Washington about the growing number of fair-lending investigations started by the Obama administration. Given the discriminatory policies used by lenders before the housing meltdown, the banks and mortgage companies deserve the scrutiny. Borrowers need more protection. 
Pricing discrimination -- illegally charging minority customers more for loans and other services than similarly qualified whites are charged -- is a longstanding problem. It grew to outrageous proportions during the bubble years. Studies by consumer advocates found that large numbers of minority borrowers who were eligible for affordable, traditional loans were routinely steered toward ruinously priced subprime loans that they would never be able to repay.
Many of these lenders did not care if the loans went bad; by then, they had packaged them into securities and sold them to Wall Street. Minority neighborhoods were disproportionately wiped out when the loans crashed and these homes were foreclosed. The Justice Department says discriminatory practices continue, making it difficult for communities to recover from the crisis.
In 2010, the Obama Justice Department created a much needed fair-lending unit. Those officials have worked with the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and bank regulators to ensure that credible complaints against consumer lenders reach the Justice Department in a timely fashion. The system seems to be working. Last year, the department received 49 referrals from federal regulators who suspected ''a pattern and practice of discrimination.'' The fair-lending unit has resolved eight cases through settlements and is still fighting one case in court. It has decided to sue a half dozen other lenders.
In the cases that have been settled, lenders have agreed to end illegal practices, pay individuals who were harmed, or open branches and lend to qualified borrowers in communities they have previously refused to serve.
Bankers are predictably accusing the federal government of forcing them to lend to unqualified borrowers -- which is implausible. Discrimination cases are based on evidence that qualified borrowers have been ill-treated because of race, sex or national origin. The real problem here is that illegal lending discrimination has done huge damage to minority communities. It's time the federal government started doing something about it.

HEADLINE: Papermaker Owned by Cerberus Files for Bankruptcy Protection

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
8:40 p.m. Updated
The NewPage Corporation, the ailing papermaker owned by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday, blaming a sharp decline in the magazine industry, a spike in the cost of raw material and too much debt. 
The company, which is based in Miamisburg, Ohio, and has 6,000 workers, will now operate under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while it restructures its balance sheet and seeks to slash its debt, which exceeds $3 billion.
The long-expected Chapter 11 filing in United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware punctuates a painful investment for Cerberus, which borrowed heavily to acquire the MeadWestvaco paper mill business in 2005 for $2.3 billion and renamed it NewPage.
''The company's current capital structure was put in place during a different time with different assumptions,'' NewPage said in a statement.
NewPage is one of only several multibillion-dollar buyouts struck in the market boom - a list that includes the retailer Linens 'n Things, the music company EMI Group and the aluminum maker Aleris - that have ended in bankruptcy.
During the depths of the financial crisis, many private-equity watchers expected deep misery for the buyout firms that issued more than $1.5 trillion in debt to finance leveraged buyouts since 2003, according to Dealogic. But the number of bankruptcy filings was limited as the capital markets quickly recovered, allowing firms to shore up their companies by repurchasing debt or issuing new equity.
Still, Wednesday's filing provides fodder for critics of the private equity industry who contend leveraged buyouts like the Cerberus takeover of NewPage destroy companies and jobs.
The NewPage filing is the second recent prominent legal case involving Cerberus, the New York investment firm that had ill-fated investments in GMAC and Chrysler. Last month, Cerberus was sued by Innkeepers USA Trust after it backed out of its $1.1 billion acquisition of the hotel company.
After being battered during the financial crisis, and suffering sizable redemptions in its hedge funds, Cerberus has had vast improvements. Among successful investments, the firm has made a killing buying distressed mortgages at the market bottom.
It has already written off its stake in NewPage, which has been a troubled investment from the start. Under private-equity ownership, NewPage, which specializes in coated paper for magazines, has shut factories and slashed jobs. The company operates 16 paper mills from Duluth, Minn., to Rumford, Me.
Cerberus brought in Robert Nardelli, the former head of Home Depot and Chrysler, last year as chairman to help turn the company around. He did not do so, and resigned in May.
NewPage alluded to another reason for the bankruptcy filing: the iPad. While not mentioning the Apple tablet or similar devices by name, the company's bankruptcy papers cite ''increases in the use of electronic data transmission and storage'' and ''an increased demand for electronic reading material.''
Now, several private-equity firms and hedge funds that own NewPage's debt - the Avenue Capital Group, Apollo Global Management and Oaktree Capital Management among them - will fight in court to control the company.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Stressing Both Vigilance And 9/11 Remembrance

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and ERIC SCHMITT; Elisabeth Bumiller contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For President Obama, the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks is a rare opportunity to change the subject from the embattled economy to his formidable record in capturing and killing terrorists.
But Mr. Obama is walking a delicate line, his advisers say, seeking to honor the victims of a national tragedy and their families while underscoring how much progress his administration has made in the fight against Al Qaeda, most notably the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
The White House has tried to strike a balance by sending out a phalanx of senior officials this week to talk about its counterterrorism gains while keeping the president's public role to a minimum. It has also taken extensive security precautions for the weekend, even in the absence of any specific threats. 
The Pentagon said Wednesday that it was tightening security at military bases around the world, while the State Department warned Americans traveling abroad to be vigilant about potential attacks. The Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have also issued cautionary notices.
''Out of an abundance of caution and prudence, we have instituted a number of things this week and over the weekend,'' the president's counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, told a conference in Washington.
Mr. Brennan reiterated that the administration did not have credible evidence of an attack planned to coincide with the commemoration of the 2001 attacks. But he said caution was warranted because Bin Laden had expressed a desire to exploit the anniversary with some kind of follow-up attack.
In announcing the decision to raise its force-protection level, the Pentagon spokesman, George Little, said, ''As you have all seen, the 10th anniversary was mentioned in the documents seized at the Abbottabad compound.''
That evidence, which came from a trove of notebooks, computer disks and other materials seized by a Navy Seal team in the Pakistan raid, has focused the minds of American officials on the potential for the anniversary to be used, either by Al Qaeda, its spinoff groups or a lone-wolf terrorist.
''It seemed more aspirational than real, and given the pressure on the Al Qaeda's network, maybe not even feasible,'' said a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly. ''But what it did was affirm for us that Bin Laden had put some emphasis on this anniversary.''
Mr. Brennan sought to distinguish the precautionary measures this weekend from the steps the United States used last fall to address ''specific and credible'' information about plots against targets in Europe. That information prompted a specific State Department warning to Americans traveling in Europe.
Senior American counterterrorism and law enforcement officials said the heightened defenses could cause Al Qaeda to delay any attack until after the anniversary when, presumably, the alerts ease somewhat.
But several officials said they fear that so-called homegrown terrorists, or lone wolves, pose a greater threat because they might try to use the anniversary to make a dramatic statement and because they are much harder to detect than terrorist cells.
''I'm worried about the people who wake up and say, 'Hey it's 9/11, I have a gun, I'm ticked off at whatever, I'm going to go out and kill a few people in honor of 9/11,' '' one senior intelligence official said.
A senior F.B.I. official said the authorities had increased surveillance on potential terrorism suspects inside the United States in recent weeks and remained on increased alert.
''We will be up in force for the weekend,'' he said.
On Tuesday, Mr. Obama convened his national security team to review the security preparations, especially for the aviation system. The president, one of his advisers said, pressed the group to discuss the full range of potential threats, even those they viewed as extremely unlikely.
With Mr. Obama being pummeled on the economy, the White House is eager to talk about counterterrorism. Officials from Mr. Brennan to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano are fanning out to give speeches or make public appearances. Mr. Brennan said the United States had dealt Al Qaeda a ''body blow'' in its core network in the frontier region of Pakistan.
Over the weekend, Pakistani intelligence agents, in a joint operation with the C.I.A., captured three men they identified as key Qaeda operatives. Pakistani and American officials said the operation went a way toward repairing the rift over the Bin Laden raid.
''It's undeniable that there's been tremendous progress in the war on terrorism,'' said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University. ''But the collective sigh of relief that we'd like to breathe is less clear.''
The administration's persistent focus on South Asia, Mr. Hoffman said, had allowed spinoffs of Al Qaeda in Yemen and North Africa to put down roots. The chaotic transition in Libya, he said, raised the danger that huge amounts of weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists.
While Mr. Obama will take part in ceremonies in New York, Washington and Shanksville, Pa., he plans to deliver a speech only at a concert on Sunday night at the National Cathedral. And that speech will touch on far more than Bin Laden.
''There are a broader set of issues that will be important to commemorate that go beyond simply Al Qaeda,'' said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser. ''In some respects, we don't need to be overly aggressive in making that case because the Bin Laden operation was so well known.''

HEADLINE: Obama Blocks an Air Pollution Rule

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Obama Abandons a Stricter Limit on Air Pollution'' (front page, Sept. 3):
How terribly shortsighted and reckless of President Obama to reverse a regulation that protects against the scourge of polluted air.
As the author of a book about the late Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, the principal founder of Earth Day, I am aware of how tirelessly he and others worked to secure legislation that would protect our air, water and land. The Clean Air Act is a prime example. 
To reverse a regulation intended to cut down toxic emissions is to tamper with the health, safety and quality of life of present and future generations.
To quote Senator Nelson, ''As we think about the richness of the world in which we live -- its forests, its clear blue waters and all of its varied life forms -- we must understand how our actions affect all of them.''
SHEILA T. COHEN Madison, Wis., Sept. 6, 2011
To the Editor:
I am heartbroken and horrified by President Obama's refusal to update smog standards. Updating the standards is long overdue, and such updates would have a highly beneficial effect on health care costs as well as pushing corporations to invest in the kind of essential technology and infrastructure needed to reduce pollution and create jobs.
Perhaps the most distressing aspect of the president's action is that he appears to believe, and act on, the lies disseminated by the right, particularly members of the Tea Party, about the prohibitive cost of environmental protection, rather than acknowledging the truth: that the cost of not protecting the environment is overwhelming and irreversible.
What has happened to the passionate, committed man we elected?
EDWINA TRENTHAM Moodus, Conn., Sept. 5, 2011
To the Editor:
''A Debate Arises on Job Creation vs. Environmental Regulation'' (Business Day, Sept. 5) led with the recently withdrawn smog standard and then suggested that regulating now could be problematic in light of the economy's weakness.
The withdrawn standard, however, would establish a goal for state air pollution programs and therefore produces no immediate costs at all.
Companies will incur costs only many years from now after states translate these goals into specific requirements for polluters. And if history is any guide, those costs will have a vanishingly small effect on employment, and some of that effect may be positive.
Environmental regulations account for less than one-tenth of 1 percent of mass layoffs. An administration seriously concerned about unemployment, rather than appeasing polluters and their allies, would focus its attention elsewhere.
The recession does not justify sacrificing thousands of lives by suspending a crucial health-protective standard being carried out many years hence.
DAVID M. DRIESEN Syracuse, Sept. 5, 2011
The writer teaches environmental law at Syracuse University.
To the Editor:
Re ''Stung by the President on Air Quality, Environmentalists Weigh Their Options'' (news article, Sept. 4):
I want to express my support for President Obama's sound decision. Environmental issues are often played as trump cards when they should instead be weighed against other concerns.
Our air has become very clean over the last few decades (thanks to great work by environmentalists), so air quality issues no longer have the urgency they once had. This is not the time to be imposing expensive solutions to minor problems.
I'm an independent who voted for Barack Obama in 2008.
MICHAEL SHERMAN Mountain View, Calif., Sept. 4, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''A Bad Call on Ozone'' (editorial, Sept. 3):
Those of us in ''the reality-based community'' can only shake our heads in disgust as President Obama betrays one more of his principles.
Perhaps he can save all of us a lot of grief by simply announcing the principles he will abandon in his quest for re-election.
Better to be disgusted all at once than to have to suffer through this numbing drip, drip, drip of disheartening news as he abandons all that we thought he stood for.

HEADLINE: Obama Is President, but Football Is King

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Like a coverage team racing downfield for a kickoff, here comes King Football. This day was always going to happen, come hell or high water or labor issues.
The opening game -- Saints at Packers, the past two Super Bowl champions, Thursday night -- was engraved in the minds of fans. Nothing could get in its way. Nothing.
The lockout of midsummer is long gone. The players got an extra day or two out of the brutal sun of training camp. These people, the players and the owners, generate too much money to shut down a sport over a percentage point here or there. 
The seasonal return of the king even loomed over what one would like to think are more important issues, like a presidential talk. A week ago the White House tried to arrange a speech by President Obama about the pressing issue of the day, jobs and the economy, but Representative John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House, balked because of the Republican candidates' debate that night.
All of a sudden, this became more than party politics and good manners and jockeying for 2012. When the president's speech was moved to Thursday, the White House found the need to address the massive shadow of King Football. ''I can assure all you football fans that he will be completed before kickoff,'' the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said on Thursday.
Obama is scheduled to speak at 7 p.m. Eastern, and the Saints-Packers game is set for 8:30 p.m. But that was not enough.
For the people out there who fret that Obama is not a football-loving manly man real American, Carney reassured the multitudes that he had the same priorities as everybody else in this great land of ours.
''It means he will have the opportunity to watch the game, like millions of other Americans,'' Carney said.
Notice the press secretary said ''opportunity.'' Personally, I'd like to think the president will rush home, shuck the business suit, get into his jeans, and read a bedtime story to his daughters rather than watch large people give each other concussions. And later maybe he could slip into the gym to shoot baskets to work off the brutal load of stress.
Even the reassurance that Obama has the right priorities was not enough. Everybody in petulant America wants the man to do more, something else, better, right now, get mad, get even, solve the problem with a catchphrase or a snap of his fingers. But at the same time, some football fans on the Web have been brooding that the speech on jobs will somehow force television to skimp on pregame videos of brain-rattling tackles from last season.
Fear not. The show will go on, from now until the Super Bowl. The N.F.L. has a 10-year labor contract. The average franchise is worth $1.022 billion, according to Forbes. All is right with the world, despite rising medical evidence that a frightening proportion of players are developing dementia and dying young, from brain damage. The N.F.L. tinkers with the rules, while King Football rumbles onward.
The fans have the right to anticipate the new season, with dramas and loyalties varying from city to city. The N.F.L., with its national network contracts, has the fabulous karma of a tiny city in northern Wisconsin winning the Super Bowl. There is nothing comparable in any other American team sport. The survival of Green Bay is as much fun to ponder as a muddy game on the tube. Los Angeles still does not have a football team. (Or a baseball team, some would say.) The Colts may have to do without Peyton Manning. Like him or loathe him, Michael Vick has made one of the great comebacks in American sport.
And in New York, we get two plots from two very different teams.
The Giants, with a huge swath of fans in the region, have won one Super Bowl with Tom Coughlin and stuck with him through some disappointing seasons. With a third generation of Maras and a second generation of Tisches, the Giants take the long view.
The Jets have forced New Yorkers to drop the stereotype of the goofy, vaguely cursed franchise that, between sporadic moments of glory, would find a way to self-destruct. In the era of Woody Johnson, Mike Tannenbaum and Rex Ryan, the Jets have become, dare one say this, consistent.
Ryan ensures they will always play with swagger, and sometimes act in bad taste, but give them their due, they back it up, with a locker full of characters allowed to be themselves. In the first two seasons of Ryan and Mark Sanchez, the Jets have a 20-12 record and have played in two conference championship games.
All over this football-loving nation, a new season begins Thursday night. The real world has given its solemn promise not to intrude.

HEADLINE: Aiming Economic Plans At Elusive Independents

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; Mark Landler contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- By proposing a jobs package filled with items that Republicans have supported in the past, President Obama is betting that moderate and independent voters he so desperately needs in next year's elections will flock to his camp.
The trouble is, Mr. Obama has been pursuing those voters for much of the past two years, and they have continued to drift away. His approval rating among independents plunged to 39 percent in August from 52 percent in May in a Pew Research Center poll broadly in line with other polls. Absent an improvement in the economy, there is little sign yet that Mr. Obama is gaining traction with independents. 
For the president, it is the ultimate vexation: How much do moderate voters care about the specific positions a candidate takes?
Mr. Obama has managed, the pollsters say, to come out of this summer with slightly less blame among voters for the debt ceiling and budget fights than have his Congressional Republican adversaries. But his attempts to appear willing to compromise have not cut any slack with moderates and independents so far because not only has the economic picture worsened, so, too, has public confidence in Washington's ability to fix it.
''I'm not as dissatisfied with him as I am with Congress,'' said Susan Jean London, a retired teacher in Palmyra, Me., who said she was not registered as either Republican or Democrat. ''I don't know if I want to give Obama another chance.''
With two children who are looking for work, Mrs. London said in a telephone interview that she was disheartened by a culture in Washington in which Congress rejects everything that Mr. Obama proposes.
Mr. Obama's backers argue that the picture will begin to change once he is running against an actual opponent, rather than a hypothetical one. Once a Republican nominee emerges, the Obama campaign can try to tie the nominee to some unpopular stands that Congressional Republicans have taken, like blocking tax increases on the affluent and focusing on entitlement programs for budget cutting.
The final details of the jobs plan Mr. Obama is to announce Thursday evening before a joint session of Congress remain to be seen. But the package is expected to focus on items that have previously drawn bipartisan support. ''It is my intention,'' the president wrote in his letter to the House speaker, John A. Boehner, last week requesting the joint session, ''to lay out a series of bipartisan proposals that the Congress can take immediately to continue to rebuild the American economy by strengthening small businesses, helping Americans get back to work and putting more money in the paychecks of the middle class and working Americans, while still reducing our deficit and getting our fiscal house in order.''
The centerpiece of the package will be a proposal for payroll tax relief for workers and perhaps their employers. Mr. Obama has signaled that he will propose to extend for another year a reduction of two percentage points in the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax that employees pay, which means about $1,000 more for the average household. He is also expected to call for an extension of business tax cuts and the infusion of federal dollars into building and repairing roads, rails, airports, schools and other infrastructure projects.
After the midterm elections, Mr. Obama's political advisers drew the lesson that the public -- and independent voters in particular -- believed that government spending had spun out of control. The president himself believes that cutting the deficit is important, officials said, but that it must come after job creation.
''The president has always felt the sequence was important,'' said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ''You focus on jobs now and plot a path to deficit reduction later.''
Mr. Obama's plan is expected to fall short of the major spending initiatives many Democrats would like to see to bolster job creation. Even so, administration officials privately acknowledge that, with the exception of the payroll tax extension and expansion, there is no assurance that the other proposals will get past the Republican-controlled House.
The president's advisers indicate they will seek to blame the Republicans for any failure to pass the proposals. Mr. Obama will be ramping up his travel schedule this fall, with several trips to battleground states, to make his case to American voters. ''There's nothing in what he's asking for that can be called a radical left agenda item,'' one administration official said. ''There has been bipartisan support for all this in the past.''
But will that tactic convince moderates and independents that the president is the lesser of two evils? ''The primary factor for moderates and independents is the economy, and the extent to which the economy is growing,'' said John Sides, a George Washington University political scientist. ''The best case for Obama is to preside over some economic growth in the election year.''
But the economic forecasts have not been positive, and in the case of continued slow or stagnant economic growth, Professor Sides said, Mr. Obama's best hope then lies in changing the frame of the election, so that it is not a referendum on the economy, but a choice between a president viewed as moderate and an opponent viewed as too extreme.
In June, independents prioritized deficit reduction over spending to bolster the economy, 54 percent to 39 percent, according to Pew. But in a poll taken Sept. 1-4 and released Wednesday, that number had dropped to 46 percent of independents favoring deficit reduction.
''When we look at it by party, what you see is that independents don't stand out as supporting any particular strategy to a great degree,'' said the director of the Pew Research Center poll, Andrew Kohut. ''So there's no one thing he can say that's going to set off a light bulb among independents.'' Rather, Mr. Kohut suggests, what Mr. Obama must do is try many proposals, ''and if he gets blocked, go negative.''

HEADLINE: Perry and Romney Joust Over Direction of G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and ADAM NAGOURNEY; Ashley Parker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- The fight for the Republican presidential nomination began narrowing into an intense and ideological battle at a debate here Wednesday night, with Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Mitt Romney sharply clashing over Social Security, health care and each other's long-term prospect against President Obama.
A series of spirited exchanges between the two men, which revealed differences in substance and style, offered the first extensive look into the months-long contest ahead. They traded attacks on each other's job creation records and qualifications to be president, overshadowing their opponents in the crowded Republican field.
Mr. Perry doubled down on his view of Social Security, assailing it as a ''monstrous lie,'' and he questioned scientists' assertions that climate change has been caused by human activity. Mr. Romney said that Social Security should be protected and suggested that Mr. Perry's positions would make it difficult for the Republican Party to appeal to a broad base of voters needed to win the White House. 
''Maybe it's time to have some provocative language in this country,'' said Mr. Perry, who spent much of his time in his first presidential debate defending his Texas record and a litany of positions in his book, ''Fed Up!''
On the eve of the president's economic speech to a joint session of Congress, the debate here at the Ronald Reagan Museum and Library focused far more on the distinctions among the Republican candidates than on Mr. Obama's handling of the economy. The entire Republican field united around the notion of limiting Mr. Obama to a single term, but differed in proposing solutions to the ailing economy.
Mr. Perry attacked Mr. Romney's record of creating jobs in Massachusetts and his championing of health care legislation when he was governor. Mr. Romney, in turn, cast Mr. Perry as a career politician.
''Michael Dukakis created jobs three times faster than you did, Mitt,'' Mr. Perry said, referring to the former Democratic governor who ran for president in 1988.
''Well, as a matter of fact,'' Mr. Romney replied, ''George Bush and his predecessor created jobs at a faster rate than you did, Governor.''
The crowd of Republicans burst into laughter.
But as the exchanges intensified, one of the candidates, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, chastised the moderators of the debate, from NBC and Politico, and said they were trying to stoke divisions among Republicans in a way he said would help Mr. Obama.
That said, neither Mr. Romney nor Mr. Perry seemed to need much prompting.
Mr. Romney argued that Mr. Perry, who has spent much of his life in government, lacked the experience in private industry needed to turn the economy around. And seeking to undercut what has been Mr. Perry's main claim in advancing his candidacy -- his record as governor -- Mr. Romney argued that Mr. Perry had benefited from institutional advantages, ranging from a Republican state legislature and state Supreme Court to the economic benefits of having vast deposits of gas and oil.
''Those are wonderful things, but Governor Perry doesn't believe that he created those things,'' Mr. Romney said. ''If he tried to say that, well, it would be like Al Gore saying he invented the Internet.''
The exchanges quickly moved from the economy to health care. The candidates were asked to register their opinions on the health care plan that Mr. Romney signed into law in Massachusetts.
Mr. Perry chimed in first, declaring, ''It was a great opportunity for us as a people to see what will not work, and that is an individual mandate in this country.''
Mr. Romney sought to defend the health care law, which was a precursor to the federal plan signed into law by Mr. Obama, but said it was intended for his state only. If elected, he said, he will move to repeal the Obama administration's law as soon as he takes office.
Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former governor of Utah who stepped down as the ambassador to China in the Obama administration, sought to insert himself into the exchange and pointed out that Utah under his stewardship led all states across the country in creating new jobs. Mr. Huntsman assailed the hard-line posture Mr. Romney has taken toward China.
''Mitt,'' he said, ''now is not the time, in a recession, to enter a trade war.''
The debate here at the Reagan Library revolved to a large degree around Mr. Perry, whose candidacy has dramatically changed the contour of the race.
Mr. Perry defended his record of overseeing the execution of 234 inmates in Texas. When asked by one of the moderators, Brian Williams of NBC News, if he had lost sleep over the decision, Mr. Perry replied, ''No, sir, I've never struggled with that at all.''
The invited audience, made up of supporters of the candidates and patrons of the library, broke out into applause when Mr. Williams noted again that 234 people had been executed.
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who had hoped that her victory in the Iowa straw poll last month would place her among the top tier of candidates, struggled to break through during the exchanges. She, along with former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Herman Cain, a businessman, were asked far fewer questions than Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry.
Mr. Huntsman, apparently alone on the stage, argued that Republicans were endangering their prospects in the general election by attacking the theory of global warming.
''In order for the Republican Party to win,'' Mr. Huntsman said, ''we can't run from science.''
Mr. Perry, one of the strongest skeptics of global warming on the stage, strongly stood by his views and said it was a mistake to adopt policies to deal with a problem that he said was not proven. He invoked the skepticism that was directed at Galileo. ''Galileo got outvoted for a spell,'' he said.
''The science is not settled on this,'' Mr. Perry said. ''The idea that we would put Americans' economy at jeopardy based on scientific theory that's not settled yet, to me, is just nonsense.''
Representative Ron Paul of Texas aggressively challenged Mr. Perry on several fronts, including for pushing through an executive order requiring young girls to have an inoculation against a sexually transmitted disease, HPV, before reversing course.
''This is not good medicine, I do not believe,'' he said. ''It's not good social policy. And therefore, I think this is very bad to do this. But one of the worst parts about that was the way it was done.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the spirited exchanges between Mitt Romney and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas during a Republican presidential debate on Wednesday night quoted incorrectly in some editions from comments Mr. Romney made about jobs. Responding to Mr. Perry's criticism that he had a poor record of creating jobs while he was governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney said, ''George Bush and his predecessor created jobs at a faster rate than you did, Governor.'' He did not say ''three times faster.''

HEADLINE: Doctor Fees Major Factor In Health Costs, Study Says

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Doctors are paid higher fees in the United States than in several other countries, and this is a major factor in the nation's higher overall cost of health care, says a new study by two Columbia University professors, one of whom is now a top health official in the Obama administration.
''American primary care and orthopedic physicians are paid more for each service than are their counterparts in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom,'' said the study, by Sherry A. Glied, an assistant secretary of health and human services, and Miriam J. Laugesen, an assistant professor of health policy at Columbia. 
The study, being published Thursday in the journal Health Affairs, found that the incomes of primary care doctors and orthopedic surgeons were substantially higher in the United States than in other countries. Moreover, it said, the difference results mainly from higher fees, not from higher costs of the doctors' medical practice, a larger number or volume of services or higher medical school tuition.
Such higher fees are driving the higher spending on doctors' services, the study concluded.
Ms. Glied, an economist, was a Columbia professor before President Obama named her assistant health secretary for planning and evaluation in June 2010. She said the paper, based on academic research, did not reflect the official views of the administration or the White House.
But the journal said the findings suggested that, as policymakers struggle to find ways to restrain health spending, they might consider doctors' fees. Doctors have generally been excluded from recent cost-cutting proposals because under existing law, Medicare, the federal insurance program for older people, will reduce their fees by 29.5 percent on Jan. 1. In addition, many states have frozen or reduced fees paid to doctors treating poor people under Medicaid.
The study examined fees paid by public programs and private insurers for basic office visits and for hip replacement surgery, and found that Americans were ''very low users of office visits and relatively high users of hip replacement surgery.''
''Fees paid by public payers to orthopedic surgeons for hip replacements in the United States are considerably higher than comparable fees for hip replacements in other countries,'' the authors found, ''and fees paid by private insurers in the United States for this service are double the fees paid in the private sector elsewhere.''
For primary care office visits, the gap between fees paid by Medicare and by public programs in other countries was smaller. But the study found that private insurers paid more for such services here than in other countries.
''U.S. primary care physicians earn about one-third more than do their counterparts elsewhere,'' mainly ''because a much larger share of their incomes is derived from private insurance,'' the study said.
Ms. Laugesen and Ms. Glied said that among primary care doctors, those in the United States had the highest annual pretax earnings after expenses -- an average of $186,582 in 2008 -- while those in Australia and France had the lowest earnings, $92,844 and $95,585.
''Among orthopedic surgeons, those who had the highest annual pretax incomes, net of expenses, were in the United States,'' with an average of $442,450, the study said. In Britain, which ranked second, the comparable figure was $324,138. Annual pretax earnings of orthopedic surgeons in the other countries were less than $210,000.
Medical students often cite higher pay as a reason for choosing to become specialists, and the researchers said the income gap between primary care doctors and orthopedic surgeons was larger here than elsewhere.
''In the United States, primary care doctors earned only about 42 percent as much as orthopedic surgeons earned,'' the study said. ''In Canada, France and Germany, in contrast, primary care doctors earned at least 60 percent as much as orthopedic surgeons earned.''
''High physician fees in the United States may reflect the cost of attracting skilled candidates to medicine in a society with a relatively more skewed income distribution,'' the study said.

HEADLINE: Humanitarian Aid for Rape Victims: The White House should end a policy that bans abortion aid to victims in war zones

 BODY:
On his third day in office, President Obama issued an executive order lifting the odious ''global gag rule'' that denied federal money for family planning work abroad to any group that performed abortions or counseled about the procedure, even with its own money. But he left standing another policy that imposes similar speech restrictions and bans using foreign aid money for abortions -- even to save a woman's life or in cases of rape in war zones like Congo, Sudan and Burma. 
The policy is not mandated by any law. Rather, it is an overly restrictive interpretation of the Helms amendment, which was originally enacted in 1973 and bars using foreign aid money to ''pay for the performance of abortion as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.''
Providing abortions for women and girls who have been subjected to the use of rape as a weapon in armed conflict is clearly not ''a method of family planning.'' And informing rape victims and governments about the right to proper medical treatment, which would include abortion, under the laws of war does not amount to lobbying or coercion. Yet the misinterpretation of the Helms amendment was formalized in a policy directive in 2008 by the United States Agency for International Development and continues to be enforced by other aid programs as well.
A coalition of human rights groups and legal and medical experts led by the Global Justice Center, along with Norway, has issued a call to lift the policy as applied to rape victims. As these groups point out, beyond being cruel and unnecessary, the current interpretation of the Helms amendment violates Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, which entitles all victims of armed conflict -- including those brutalized by rape -- to complete and non-discriminatory medical treatment. That includes access to abortions and necessary information about the procedure.
Mr. Obama may fear that changing the policy would anger antiabortion extremists in Congress. But that is no excuse for breaking his pledge to abide by the Geneva Conventions. Besides, even the most radical antiabortion bill to pass the Republican House this year -- a proposal to restrict abortion services, for example by discouraging employers from offering insurance plans covering abortion -- contains exceptions for saving the woman's life, incest, and, yes, rape.

HEADLINE: From a Summer Focused on the Debt, Congress Now Pivots to Jobs

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A mere six weeks ago, the animating word on Capitol Hill was debt. Republicans and Democrats obsessed about it, campaigned against it, fought over how to tame it and deployed it as a tool of mutual embarrassment. This fall, same template, new word: Jobs.
Federal spending, tax reform, deficit reduction and tax cuts are all nominally on each side's fiscal agenda. But there is a tacit understanding now among members of both parties that those items -- which fueled the partisan disagreements that nearly led to a government shutdown and default earlier this year -- are the purview of the Congressional deficit reduction committee. 
The 12-member committee will hold its first meeting Thursday, the day President Obama addresses a joint session of Congress on jobs.
With debt off their plate for the moment, members of Congress, informed by the anxieties they encountered among voters back home, have returned from their recess and immediately snapped into battle over how to quell the problem of 14 million unemployed Americans.
From the locution of news releases -- ''Hatch urges president to send job-creating trade pacts to Congress!'' ''Repatriation Could Add Nearly 3 Million Jobs!'' -- to a spate of pending legislation -- everything now seems framed around this issue as the parties try to outdo each other to show anxious Americans that Congress is doing something about the lack of employment.
''The focus now is jobs,'' said Representative Eric Cantor, the Virginia Republican and House majority leader, in a meeting with reporters Wednesday. He added, ''The past eight months we've been all about cuts.''
House Republicans are pursuing an aggressive anti-regulation agenda, aimed largely at environmental and financial requirements. Democrats said they would focus on things like infrastructure investment, job training for veterans and pushing American manufacturing.
All day Wednesday, Republicans moved to get ahead of the president on the issue.
Five Republican senators announced that they would hold a news conference before Mr. Obama's speech Thursday to promote their own jobs agenda, which includes free trade agreements and tax code changes. Mr. Cantor, who has already released a legislative agenda for House Republicans, said his party would not be timid about pursuing approaches different from those of the president and Congressional Democrats.
''I appreciate the president's renewed focus on jobs, but the truth of the matter is we have very different opinions as to how to grow this economy and to produce some sustainable job growth,'' Mr. Cantor said.
Senator David Vitter of Louisiana became the latest Republican to say he would not attend the president's speech, adding that he would attend a football game back home instead, though he presented the news in a jobs wrapper. ''Will listen to President's speech tomorrow carefully ...from my priority area for job creation,'' he said on Twitter, adding the hash tag of ''#WhoDat nation'' to show his allegiance to the New Orleans Saints, who will open the N.F.L. season after the speech.
Some Democrats also sought to promote their own jobs initiatives. The No. 2 House Democrat, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, told reporters that President Obama would explicitly endorse the Democrats' ''Make It in America'' agenda, which seeks to revive manufacturing in this country. Representative John B. Larson, a member of the Democratic leadership from Connecticut, introduced legislation that would amend the mission of the bipartisan committee charged with finding $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions to include a job creation plan.
But for all the change in focus, this is not so much a new movie as a sequel.
Republicans say this shift is the natural second step to spending cuts, while Democrats contend that they can now focus on jobs after months of trying to fend off too many of those cuts. Both sides see getting public backing for their proposed policies -- even if they do not become legislation -- as a key to victory in 2012.
Next week, the House will take up legislation aimed at the National Labor Relations Board, which has accused Boeing of setting up a nonunion production line in South Carolina to retaliate against unionized workers in Washington State. The House will also focus on blocking certain regulations on coal ash, greenhouse gases and farm dust, and others pertaining to the health care law.
Democrats are waiting to see what they can convert from Mr. Obama's speech into legislation, but are focused on things like a payroll tax cut, which they may offer outside the forum of the bipartisan Congressional committee, and perhaps an infrastructure bank that would turn seed money into investments for new projects. Democrats would also like to see tax credits for clean manufacturers renewed.
Mr. Cantor said there were areas both sides agreed upon, as he and Speaker John A. Boehner outlined in a letter to Mr. Obama. ''We believe in infrastructure spending,'' he said. ''We know that our roads and bridges and highway networks are in need of repair and we know that there are certain areas of the country that need additional roads.''
Mr. Cantor also said that he believed Americans were looking for the end of rancor in Congressional policy debates. ''I don't question the president's motives or his commitment to country now,'' he said, adding, ''Plain and simple, my point is that good people can disagree.''

HEADLINE: Court Backs German Plan For Bailouts In Europe

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Reporting was contributed by Alan Cowell from Paris, Judy Dempsey and Victor Homola from Berlin, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
KARLSRUHE, Germany -- Germany's ability to come to the rescue of troubled European partners won crucial backing from the country's constitutional court on Wednesday, a victory for Chancellor Angela Merkel that also provided at least a temporary reprieve for markets that had begun to worry that Europe's common currency could collapse.
The ruling, which defied some expectations that the court would hamstring Mrs. Merkel, removed one obstacle to German leadership of Europe at a time when Germans are being relied on more than ever to figure out a solution to the debt crisis that has ensnared weaker members of the euro zone, including Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Stock markets in Europe and the United States recovered sharply on news of the court's action.
Europe has swung from gloom to cautious optimism repeatedly during its financial crisis, and few analysts considered the ruling a decisive turning point. While the court did not require full parliamentary approval for future bailouts, it did mandate approval by a smaller panel. 
But analysts say that confirmation of Germany's leadership role could push Greece and Italy to make pledges of austerity in return for European help, and could also put pressure on Finland and Slovakia, two euro-zone members that have introduced obstacles to their participation in bailouts, to support the rescues.
''The ship is full-steam ahead on its determined course,'' said Jurgen Matthes, who studies international economic policy at the Cologne Institute for Economic Research. ''It will exert force on the other countries, not least Slovakia and Finland, when Germany can move ahead without obstacles.''
Italy also took steps on Wednesday to reassure markets, as the Senate approved the government's multibillion-euro package of budget cuts and tax increases. That eased fears that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi would backtrack on promised budget measures to manage Italy's towering debt.
Mrs. Merkel struck a confident note in speaking before Parliament, saying the ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court had ''absolutely confirmed'' her government's ''transparent'' handling of Europe's debt crisis in close consultation with Parliament. ''That is exactly the path we have followed,'' she said.
Had the court declared the bailouts unconstitutional, the repercussions for the euro and the fragile European banking system would almost certainly have been devastating. ''If the euro collapses, so does Europe,'' Mrs. Merkel said, adding that ''Germany's future is inseparable from Europe's future.''
The court rejected three appeals against the legality of earlier bailouts, which have stirred a furious political debate among Germans. The suits had been brought by a coalition of German lawmakers, economists and business executives who argued that Germany's participation in loans and support funds for Greece undermined Parliament and infringed on provisions underpinning the country's democracy.
The court's president, Andreas Vosskuhle, warned that the ruling did not represent a ''constitutional blank check for additional rescue packages.'' The court required the government to seek the approval of Parliament's budget committee before making money available for future bailouts of European countries struggling under mounting debt.
That requirement could still hamper Mrs. Merkel's ability to take quick measures, but it represented much less of a political hurdle than if the court had required approval by the full Parliament for each decision, which many analysts had predicted.
For now the chancellor seems more concerned with winning passage of the deal reached between European leaders in July to expand the bailout funds. Mrs. Merkel is hoping that the approval of the court, with its high public standing in the eyes of Germans, helps her put down a rebellion in her own coalition over the measure. The vote is expected on Sept. 29, and numerous legislators from her party have threatened not to support the increase, which would raise Germany's share to about $297 billion.
The constitutional court, despite its distance from the capital, or perhaps because of it, is consistently found to be the most respected player in German government. Analysts say that Germans have a deep respect for judges and the judiciary, and the court has not been shy in wielding its power. It declared in a 2009 ruling on the Lisbon Treaty that it had jurisdiction to overturn European policies, rules and decisions it found unconstitutional.
''In Europe, there is no constitutional court stronger or more visible in the public sphere and political landscape than the German constitutional court,'' said Matthias Herdegen, director of the Institute for Public Law at the University of Bonn. ''Even those opposed to certain steps feel it is an organ that responds to their concerns and that's an enormous contribution to the legitimacy of the German political process.''
Yet the very fact that the fate of the euro rested on the shoulders of eight judges in red robes in this southwestern German city served as a stark reminder of the splintered nature of decision-making within Europe that has allowed the crisis to fester and spread -- and therefore why strong leadership is so desperately needed. Although decision-making is often viewed as a simple matter of coordination between Paris and Berlin, agreements can be derailed by even the smallest states.
Finland has thrown the Greek bailout into confusion by demanding collateral from Athens in exchange for new aid, forcing a flurry of negotiations. The speaker of Parliament in Slovakia has said that he would not bring the European bailout fund to a vote this month as planned, raising questions in the process over why a small, poor country like his should pay for the free-spending ways of the better-off Greeks.
At the same time the ability, and indeed the willingness of states like Greece and even Italy to rein in spending and get their deficits under control has been viewed with increased skepticism. That in turn reduces the appetite of rich states to guarantee more of their debts, even if the refusal jeopardizes the euro.
While the court may have signed off on the constitutional questions, other political hurdles remain in Germany. Voters in Europe's largest economy do not want to pay to haul other countries out of their deficit woes.
''The court ruling removes a substantive obstacle, but there's no doubt that the situation still looks pretty grave,'' said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London. The underlying problems of heavily indebted states and weak, undercapitalized banks still have to be addressed to find a long-term solution, Mr. Tilford said.
In Parliament, Mrs. Merkel renewed her opposition to the idea of jointly issuing debt in the form of ''euro bonds'' as a means of solving the debt crisis. ''Euro bonds are the way to a union of debtors,'' she said, calling the idea ''the wrong answer.''
''That is why we will not go down this route,'' she added.
Jessica Koch, an analyst at the Center for European Policy in Freiburg, Germany, said the decision was consistent with previous court rulings, requiring that ''certain decisions on revenue and expenditure must remain in the hands of Parliament.''
''That is fundamental for the democratic state,'' Ms. Koch said. ''You can transfer competencies to a certain extent. You can't transfer them completely.''

HEADLINE: As Financial Gloom Deepens, Reform of British Bank Rules May Wait

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER; Eric Dash contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Seesaw markets, growing concerns about the stability of Europe's banks and a faltering economic recovery are dimming prospects that Britain will enact stricter banking regulation anytime soon.
On Monday, a government-appointed banking commission is expected to present its final recommendations on how to protect taxpayers from bearing the costs of any future bank collapses. The plan aims to separate a bank's deposit-taking business from the riskier trading and investment banking operations, which would be allowed to fail should they run into trouble.
But at a time of heightened economic uncertainty, the government of Prime Minister David Cameron has grown nervous about the proposed changes, said two government officials who declined to be identified because no final decision has been made.
Mr. Cameron is concerned that the changes will drive up banks' financing costs and in turn limit their ability to lend to British businesses, which would threaten an already weak economy, the officials said. 
So even if the Independent Commission on Banking proposes far-reaching changes, London is likely to delay their implementation until after the next election, planned for 2015, the officials said.
''This is a political and not a financial thing now,'' said Simon Gleeson, a partner at the law firm Clifford Chance. ''What everybody hoped was that by the time we got to reforming banking regulation we'd have a more stable economy. But we don't and that's the biggest challenge.''
The British economy grew just 0.2 percent in the second quarter, and the Bank of England has cut its growth forecast for this year to 1.5 percent from 1.9 percent.
The British proposal would make it considerably more expensive to raise capital for investment banking and would be much more painful for Britain's banks than the so-called Volcker Rule in the United States.
Under the United States approach, originally advocated in a stronger form by Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who served as an adviser to President Obama, banks' freedom to trade with their own capital and manage hedge funds would be limited. But they would still be able to borrow money economically because their balance sheets would remain unified.
British banking executives, nervous that the new rules would increase their financing costs and threaten their credit ratings, have stepped up lobbying efforts in recent weeks.
Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland would be the most affected by the new rules because they have large investment banking businesses and could see profit drop by a third, according to a research note by JPMorgan Chase.
The chief executive of Barclays, Robert E. Diamond Jr., and his counterpart at R.B.S., Stephen Hester, have held lengthy discussions with the government, arguing in favor of the universal banking model, that is, leaving consumer and investment banking linked. They claimed this had helped their banks to withstand risks, according to a Treasury official who declined to be identified because the talks were private.
In a preliminary report in April, the Independent Commission on Banking suggested limiting the use of consumer deposits to finance the investment banking operation by setting up a so-called ring fence around the consumer operations. On Monday, the commission is expected to give more detail on exactly which businesses should be ''ring-fenced'' and how strict the separation should be. As an example, banks could be restricted to using deposits only for personal loans and the purchase of government bonds.
Angela Knight, the head of the British Bankers Association, an industry group, said the commission's proposals would weaken rather than strengthen the financial sector. ''Ring-fencing becomes unattractive to investors of all types as it reduces the benefits of diversification, gives borrowers a worse deal, and is inefficient from a capital, funding and operational perspective,'' she said.
Among the biggest fears for banking executives is that the new rules would increase the financing costs of investment banking by implying the business would be allowed to fail. Interbank lenders, the executives argue, would demand higher rates in return for the higher risk. The banks' total financing costs could rise by about $:2 billion a year, according to a report by Citigroup analysts.
Credit rating agencies are watching the moves closely. Moody's Investors Service said last month that the ratings of the biggest British banks were on review for a downgrade pending the commission's proposals.
Markets, too, have taken notice. British banking stocks have lagged behind European rivals this year because of uncertainty about regulatory issues. Leigh Goodwin, an analyst at Citigroup, estimated that much of the $:20 billion to $:25 billion, or about $32 billion to $40 billion, in lost market value of the three largest banks over the past year was due to ''perceived regulatory risk.''
The British financial services industry accounts for about 10 percent of Britain's economic activity and 4 percent of total employment, according to Ernst & Young. The relative importance of the sector adds a pointed political dimension to the debate over banking regulation.
The issue has already caused tensions within Britain's coalition government, pitting Mr. Cameron, who is willing to postpone or water down any new rules, against his business secretary, Vince Cable, who favors immediate changes.
A member of the Liberal Democrats, the junior coalition partner, Mr. Cable last month accused banks of being ''disingenuous in the extreme to use the current context to argue against reform.''
''Banks are in a way trying to create a panic around something which they know has got to happen,'' he added.
But Mr. Cameron appears concerned that introducing stricter regulation now would only further threaten jobs and recovery, according to the officials.
These concerns are backed by an Ernst & Young report that estimated that tougher bank regulation could indirectly reduce economic growth by 0.3 percent, as higher financing costs for banks could limit their desire to lend.
''There's definitely been a change of tone from the Treasury that they need to balance growth and financial stability,'' said Jon Pain, a partner at KPMG and a former managing director of the Financial Services Authority, Britain's financial regulator. ''In that sense you would not want to do something really radical and you're unlikely to do something rapidly.''
But Mr. Pain added that ''politically it would be unacceptable to do nothing.''
George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, has already said that he supports the banking commission's interim proposals in principle, but that questions remain on how and when the government would carry out the recommendations.
''It appears that Cameron decided that this will be kicked into the long grass,'' said Andrew Hilton, director of the Center for the Study of Financial Innovation.
The prime minister would ''postpone it until the next election and that would give everyone a lot of time to change the proposals,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Debating With The Stars

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
It was a dark and stormy night.
Except in those parts of the country where it was dry and fire-prone. But what did America care about the weather when it had the chance to forget about its troubles on Wednesday night and curl up with eight candidates for the Republican presidential nomination?
The voters have a lot to figure out. What would it be like to have a president who continually tells the country he's going to get the working class workin'? And is there something going on with Mitt Romney's hair? The dark part is looking darker and those little white tufts around the ears are getting whiter. It makes his forehead look as if it's levitating. 
The Republican nominating campaign has thus far been one long primal scream from party members desperate to avoid making Romney their nominee. Really, they will look at anybody. Remember the Donald Trump moment? Michele Bachmann, Front-Runner? Who knows where their glazed eyes will turn next? Rudy Giuliani is now running around saying that he might get in the race ''if I think we are truly desperate.''
Which they would really, really, really have to be.
The current front-running Mitt Alternative is Rick Perry, possibly the first major presidential candidate opposed to the direct election of U.S. senators since the advent of the Bull Moose Party. He did not do anything superweird at his maiden presidential debate, unless you count bouncing up and down and cocking his head a lot. Or claiming that the reason a quarter of the Texas population has no health insurance is because of government interference.
And Romney cleaned Perry's clock on Social Security. Young Americans, if you dream of someday running for president, try not to write any books calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme.
''We're not trying to pick fights here,'' protested Perry, inaccurately. Attempting to change the subject, the Texas governor suggested: ''Maybe it's time to have some provocative language in this country and say things like: 'Let's get America working again and do whatever it takes to make that happen.' ''
If you dare, candidates.
Perry and Romney had an interesting dust-up over who did the better job of creating employment. This is a fight that is going to go on for the next several months. Statistics will be cited, and by the time it is over you will come to understand why young people don't dream of running away from home to become an economist.
''Michael Dukakis created jobs three times faster than you did, Mitt,'' Perry said at one point.
''George Bush and his predecessors created jobs at a faster rate than you did,'' retorted Romney. Score. Republicans, do you want to trust your nomination to a guy who makes Mitt Romney look clever? Just think about it.
I was sorry that no one asked Perry more of the really critical questions. For instance, is it true that he saved his daughter's puppy from being eaten by a coyote? This allegedly happened when Perry went jogging ''packing a Ruger .380 with laser sights and loaded with hollow-point bullets.'' Because, as he says, he is ''that kind of guy.'' His puppy-rescue is a stirring picture, especially considering that Perry's chief competitor is the man who drove to Canada with the family dog Seamus strapped to the roof of the car.
But the more I think about it, the more I wonder. Where were his bodyguards? How did the puppy keep up with him if he was running? And where exactly was he carrying the Ruger? Many joggers I know have trouble hanging on to a water bottle.
Perry and Romney were not the only debaters. There was Jon (I Believe in Evolution) Huntsman Jr., hoping to be next in the Not-Mitt Sweepstakes. Rick Santorum, Bachmann and Ron Paul ganged up on Perry for trying to get Texas girls inoculated against cervical cancer. This is a big deal for some social conservatives, but it's still interesting to think that we have presidential candidates who believe that they could score a stunning upset victory on an anti-cancer-prevention platform.
Santorum, ever hopeful, has been telling people that the competition is ''like an episode of 'Survivor,' '' but I am thinking you need a more depressing image -- maybe like an episode of ''Dog the Bounty Hunter'' or one of the several current television shows about people who bid on abandoned storage bin lockers.
The debate was at the Reagan library, and no matter what you think of Ronald Reagan, this crew makes him look good. It is the genius of the Republican Party in recent decades that it continually selects candidates who make the ones who went before appear better. Remember how great George H.W. Bush seemed once we'd lived with his son for a while? And I have a strong suspicion that whoever the nominee is this time will make us yearn for the magic that was W.

HEADLINE: Attacking the Democrats, but Not Always Getting It Right

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER, NICHOLAS CONFESSORE, and JACKIE CALMES; Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.

 BODY:
During more than an hour and 45 minutes of intense debate on Wednesday night, the Republican presidential candidates did not shy away from exchanging blows with each other. But some of the toughest criticism -- and some of the most factually problematic -- was reserved for the policies, programs, and principles traditionally associated with Democrats, from tackling climate change to broadening access to health care to providing retirement insurance for the elderly.
Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, assailed the federal government and President Obama in particular for what he said were overbearing regulations on oil drilling, coal mining and nuclear energy. 
''We are an energy-rich nation and we're living like an energy-poor nation,'' he said, asserting that Mr. Obama had halted offshore drilling, blocked construction of new coal plants, slowed development of nuclear plants and failed to develop natural gas trapped in shale formations.
But those claims are largely untrue. While Mr. Obama declared a moratorium on deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico after the BP spill in 2010, the government began granting permits again earlier this year and activity is approaching pre-spill levels. The administration recently announced a major lease sale in the western Gulf of Mexico and gave provisional approval to a Shell project in the Arctic off the coast of Alaska. And while a number of utilities have canceled plans to build new coal plants, that is largely because demand for electricity has slowed, not because of new federal regulations.
The science of climate change, a topic of skepticism among many conservatives, also came up during the debate. Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor, said that 98 percent of scientists believe that the climate is growing warmer and human activity is at least partly responsible, while Gov. Rick Perry of Texas repeated his claim that ''the science is not settled.'' Representative Michele Bachmann, who has previously asserted that global warming is ''manufactured science'' and a hoax, again questioned whether human activity was affecting the global climate.
The overwhelming scientific consensus is that global warming is occurring and that human activity -- chiefly the burning of fossil fuels and cutting down of tropical forests -- is likely to blame.
Some of the sharpest language of the night came when Mr. Perry laid into Social Security, saying, ''You cannot keep the status quo in place and call it anything other than a Ponzi scheme.'' But that metaphor is misleading. Government projections have Social Security exhausting its reserves by 2037, absent any changes, but show that the payroll tax revenues coming in would cover more than three-quarters of benefits to recipients then.
Criticizing Mr. Obama's health care law, Mrs. Bachmann said the measure was eliminating jobs, citing a study from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. But the claim, which Mrs. Bachmann made in more specific terms at the last Republican debate, overstates the conclusions of the study, which said the law would have a ''small'' impact on the overall labor force because it might cause some workers to reduce their hours or retire earlier.
Mr. Perry noted that Texas had created a million jobs in the last decade, which is true. Mr. Perry also contrasted his job-creation record with that of Mr. Romney, saying, ''We created more jobs in the last three months in Texas than he created in four years in Massachusetts.'' Assuming Mr. Perry meant May, June, and July of 2011, that part is correct: Texas added 63,200 jobs during those months, while Massachusetts added 45,800 during his four years in office.
But as Mr. Romney pointed out in reply, Texas is not only far larger than Massachusetts, it also has a very different economy, one in which growth has been aided by a rising population and an oil and gas boom.
Representative Ron Paul criticized Mr. Perry for once writing what he described as ''a really fancy letter supporting Hillarycare,'' referring to the health care legislation that was the top domestic priority of the Clinton administration and Hillary Rodham Clinton when she and Bill Clinton arrived in Washington in 1993.
Mr. Perry did write to Mrs. Clinton, who then led the administration's task force on overhauling health care, in April 1993. But Mr. Paul's characterization exaggerates what Mr. Perry said and wrongly implies that Mr. Perry, then the agricultural commissioner of Texas, supported the particulars of a health care proposal that did not emerge in full until months later. In the letter, Mr. Perry wrote: ''I think your efforts in trying to reform the nation's health care system are most commendable.'' But his main purpose in writing was to ask Mrs. Clinton and the task force to consider the needs ''of the nation's farmers, ranchers, agriculture workers, and other members of rural communities.''
Such communities, Mr. Perry wrote, ''have a high proportion of uninsured people, rising health care costs, and often experience lack of services.'' He closed by describing Mrs. Clinton's efforts as ''worthy'' and encouraging her to contact him. But Mr. Perry did not recommend or endorse any particular proposal.

HEADLINE: Regulator Further Delays Derivatives Rules

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, announced plans to wrap up the agency's rule-writing in the first few months of 2012.

 BODY:
A top federal regulator will further delay a flood of new rules for the $600 trillion derivatives market, another setback for the sweeping overhaul passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis. 
Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, announced on Thursday plans to wrap up the agency's rule-writing in the first few months of 2012. The agency said in June that it would miss deadlines to finalize dozens of new derivatives rules, though the holdup was only supposed to last until the end of this year, a roughly six-month delay. 
"We are focused on considering these rules thoughtfully - not against a clock," Mr. Gensler said at a public meeting in Washington on Thursday. 
 The agency has finalized 12 new rules so far, a small dent in its duty under the Dodd-Frank Act, which cracked down on the murky derivatives industry. Some 40 rules remain on hold, including the most contentious proposals that will spell out which companies would be exempt from the rules.
Mr. Gensler, for the first time, outlined a formal timeline for many rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act. He cautioned, however, that the timing was tentative. 
"No doubt, as this is a human endeavor, there will likely be changes to this outline down the road," Mr. Gensler said. 
The agency's Republican commissioners, who have long called for Mr. Gensler to both slow down and disclose a rule-making timetable, praised the announcement. 
"This is a helpful first step," said Jill Sommers, a Republican member of the commission. 
Next up on the agenda are final rules for derivatives clearinghouses and limits on speculative commodity trading. Bart Chilton, a Democratic commissioner and a leading proponent of so-called position limits, responded with an elated "boo-yah."
The agency is drafting a formal order that would exempt the derivatives industry from complying with Dodd-Frank until the rules are finalized, Mr. Gensler said. 
The agency on Thursday also proposed a plan to phase in compliance. Under the proposal, advanced in a 4-to-1 vote, Wall Street banks will have a three-month grace period before they must run derivatives deals through clearinghouses, which act as a backstop in case one party defaults. Hedge funds, pensions and other private funds will have six months to comply once the agency finalizes the clearing requirement. 
"Recognizing that some market participants may require more time than others to comply, these proposed rules are part of our effort to help ensure they can adequately plan," Mr. Gensler said. 
Still, Mr. Gensler warned that some delays could keep the financial system at risk. 
"Until the C.F.T.C. completes its rule-writing process and implements and enforces these new rules, the public remains unprotected," he said.

HEADLINE: The Price We Pay for Medical Care

BYLINE: REED ABELSON


HIGHLIGHT: New studies examine how much families are shouldering as health care costs rise.

 BODY:
 Americans seem to be paying the price for the unrelenting rise in health care costs in this country, according to several studies being published on Thursday in Health Affairs, an academic journal.
 The higher cost of coverage has taken a huge cut in the increase in income earned by the average family, says one study, and lower-income families are particularly hard hit, according to another. Meanwhile, the numbers of people who cannot afford insurance or do not have enough coverage have significantly increased, according to a third study.
 In an analysis of just how much of a family's paycheck is being gobbled up, analysts from Rand looked at how much of the average increase in a family's gross annual income over the past decade has gone to pay for health care. 
While the family saw an increase in income from $76,000 a year in 1999 to $99,000 a year in 2009, the researchers then deducted what they estimated would go to pay for insurance premiums, deductibles and co-payments and taxes to support Medicare and Medicaid. By the Rand calculation, if the cost of health care had been in line with overall inflation, the average family would have had nearly $5,400 in additional income a year that they could have spent. 
 The bottom line: Americans have less and less money to spend "on everything else" because they are forced to devote so much of their income to health care.
 The authors conclude: "Given the perilous state of the US economy, the fiscal burdens imposed on ally payers by steadily rising health care costs can no longer be ignored." 
 In a second study, researchers make the case that lower-income families are even more burdened by the high cost of medical care than those who are better off. Patricia Ketsche, a researcher from Georgia State University, and others calculated that low-income families pay more than 20 percent of family income toward health care, looking at both private spending and taxes, while other families who make more pay no more than 16 percent of their family income.
 A third analysis looks at the unaffordability of health care by estimating how many people were without adequate coverage in 2010. The study, by the Commonwealth Fund, estimates some 29 million Americans were underinsured and about 52 million were or had been recently without coverage. Those 81 million adults compare to an estimated 75 million in 2007 and 61 million in 2003. 
 While the Commonwealth study suggests the federal health care law has the potential to significantly lower the number of people with insufficient or no coverage, the researchers also emphasize the need to reign in health care costs. "To ensure that premiums and care remain affordable, efforts to slow rising costs of care and reduce waste, duplication, and care of little value must intensify," they say. 
 The September issue of Health Affairs is focused on health care costs, and the two studies that look at how American families are affected are available online for a week and afterwards by subscription. The Commonwealth Fund report will remain available on-line without a subscription.

HEADLINE: You Get What You Pay For

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Rating agencies and lobbying groups continue to offer analyses paid for by their customers and clients, an economist cautions.

 BODY:
Standard & Poor's downgrade of United States government debt last month has been much debated, but not enough attention has been devoted to the fact, reported last week by Bloomberg News, that it continues to rate securities based on subprime mortgages as AAA. 
In short, S.&P. is suggesting that these mortgages are more creditworthy than the United States government - a striking proposition. Leave aside for a moment that S.&P. made a big mistake in its analysis of the federal budget (as explained by James Kwak in our blog). Just focus on all the things that can go wrong with subprime mortgages: housing prices can fall, people can lose jobs, the economy may fall into recession and so on.
Now weigh those risks against the possibility that the United States government will default. As we learned this summer, that is not a zero-probability event - but it would take either an act of Congress, in the sense of passing legislation, or a determination by members of Congress that they could not act. S.&P. finds this more likely to happen than some subprime mortgages' going bad.
Now S.&P. might be right, of course. Or its assessment might be influenced by the fact that it is paid by the issuer of those mortgage-backed securities - which presumably wants a higher rating. The rating agency's employees may want to do an accurate assessment; management can reasonably expect to make higher profits if its ratings please the paying customers.

Perhaps we should just disregard what S.&P. and its competitors say. But this is not so easy, because many investors are guided by rules - either self-imposed or created by regulators - that tie investment decisions, and thus these investors' holdings, to ratings. Ratings changes undeniably can move markets.
How can we take seriously a rating agency that is compensated by the issuers of securities? This system has long outlived its usefulness and should be discontinued.
In a similar vein, let me ask why we should take seriously economic analysis offered up by a financial-sector lobbying group on behalf of its members - if, for example, it says that regulation of its members will slow economic growth? Surely, we should check the numbers in the analysis carefully and be skeptical of the policy recommendations. 
A timely example comes from the Institute of International Finance, which calls itself "the Global Association of Financial Institutions" and whose board members are all from big banks. (Indeed, the institute is more than a mere lobbying group; in the recent Greek debt negotiations, it was in charge of coordinating the terms proposed by private-sector banks for their involvement in the debt restructuring.) 
So what do we make of its policy recommendations? In a report released this week, "The Cumulative Impact on the Global Economy of Changes in the Financial Regulatory Framework," for example, the institute asserts that additional capital requirements for its members could result in "3.2 percent lower output by 2015 in these economies than would otherwise be the case" (see Paragraph 5 of its news release accompanying the report).
In recent conversations with some policy makers from the Group of 7 nations, I was told that the institute's previous, interim report on this same topic was largely without value (some said completely without value). 
I hope these policy makers and others react the same way in this instance, because the institute refuses to acknowledge the vast cost imposed on society by the combination of big banks, high leverage and low capital that it endorsed through 2008 and that it defends today, with only minor modifications. (James Kwak and I wrote directly about these issues in "13 Bankers" - and we're now hard at work on the sequel.)
The institute's report is nothing more than lobbying masquerading as economic analysis. And just as S.&P. is paid for its ratings by the issuers, the institute is paid to represent the views of big banks. We would be wise to suspect that in both cases, the paying customer would prefer a particular outcome - irrespective of what the evidence says.

HEADLINE: The Education Bonus and the Gender Gap

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: There's more evidence of education's overriding impact on lifetime earnings, but demographics remain a major variable.

 BODY:
We at Economix have been fairly persistent in demonstrating why college is worth it. Say it together, now: you are overwhelmingly likely to earn more. 
 A new study from the Census Bureau confirms that the more education you get, the better off you are. A worker with a professional degree will receive median annual earnings nearly four times those of a worker with just a high school diploma, for example, and 87 percent higher than those of workers with bachelor's degrees. (A post by our colleagues at SchoolBook also looks at the findings.)
 But though the study concludes that education is the most important determinant of future earnings, the impact of demographic factors is still significant among those with comparable education levels. And even discounting other considerations, the gender gap is striking.
 The Census study, by Tiffany A. Julian and Robert A. Kominski, looked at lifetime earnings for a typical worker from 25 to 64, and came up with estimates measured in 2008 dollars. 
Among full-time, year-round workers, white men with professional degrees make nearly 49 percent more in lifetime earnings than white women with a comparable education level. The gender gap is narrower for blacks with professional degrees: black men with professional degrees earn 24 percent more in lifetime earnings than their female counterparts. 
 That gap is still pronounced at the bachelor's degree level, where white men working full time and year round earn 40 percent more than white women with the same level of education. Black men with bachelor's degrees earn 13 percent more than black women who also hold bachelor's degrees.
 Hispanic women appeared at the biggest disadvantage. Among those full-time, year-round workers with professional degrees, white men make 104 percent more than Hispanic women over their working lifetimes.

HEADLINE: Mississippi Lures 'Green' Manufacturing Jobs

BYLINE: MICHAEL KANELLOS


HIGHLIGHT: Calisolar is the fifth green technology company in the last 18 months to announce plans to build manufacturing facilities in Mississippi, which is actively pursuing environmentally-friendly jobs.

 BODY:
Calisolar, a Sunnyvale, Calif.-based manufacturer of silicon for solar cells, has decided to build its next factory in a faraway locale known for generous government subsidies, low taxes and relatively inexpensive labor rates: Mississippi.
Calisolar is the fifth green technology company in the last 18 months to announce plans to build manufacturing facilities in the Magnolia State, which is actively pursuing environmentally-friendly jobs. The state is giving Calisolar a $75 million incentive package that includes grants, workplace training and a $59.5 million low-interest loan.
The factory will cost approximately $600 million and produce 16,000 tons of solar-grade silicon a year when fully operational. Calisolar had planned to open a factory in Ohio supported by a $275 million federal loan guarantee, but didn't think it would make a Sept. 30 deadline to begin construction, so it opted for Mississippi instead.
Other new Mississippi residents include San Jose's Twin Creeks Technologies (which makes thin wafers for solar cells and received $54 million in state assistance), Kior (a biofuels company that got $75 million) and Soladigm (a developer of energy efficient windows that got $44 million).
Our colleagues on the Wheels blog also reported Thursday that a Mississippi-based company, GreenTech Automotive, planned to build electric cars in the state.
In all, the state has provided approximately $323 million in stimulus to green manufacturers.
In South Carolina, AQT Solar, another California company, is erecting facilities that are expected to produce a gigawatt of solar panels a year by 2014. AQT will start production this year with around 30 megawatts and ramp up to 1 gigawatt by 2014. The state's main incentive is accumulated tax credits with some modest cash grants.
This shift to the South will collectively lead to thousands of construction jobs and several hundred full-time factory positions, say proponents. It could also help bolster the arguments made by the industry and the Obama administration that green manufacturing will create jobs beyond high-tech corridors like Silicon Valley.
Mississippi and South Carolina tend to be somewhat conservative politically. Neither state has a renewable portfolio standard that would encourage solar or wind power within their borders.
But Governor Haley Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, is the driving force behind Mississippi's efforts.
Mississippi has several appealing attributes for green manufacturers. The state's corporate tax rate tops out at 5 percent and the state's development authority will help to negotiate tax holidays. The loans to manufacturers often come with interest rates of around 4 percent; the state obtains the loans itself and passes the funds onto to the manufacturers without a premium.
Land and employees are also comparatively cheap. The average manufacturing salary in Mississippi is $33,000, Kathy Gelston, chief financial officer for the Mississippi Development Authority, said earlier this year.
Stion, a thin-film solar company that hopes to start producing modules in its Hattiesburg, Miss., factory next year, has committed to paying an average salary of $43,000. In arguing for its incentive package, Calisolar told the state that it would pay an average of $45,000 plus benefits, according to the Associated Press.
Those salaries are far higher than what a factory worker might make in China. Stion, however, needs far fewer employees because of the advanced nature of its manufacturing processes. A factory capable of producing 100 megawatts of crystalline silicon solar cells in China might require 1,000 employees, estimated Aaron Thurlow, vice president of global sales at Stion during a talk at Intersolar earlier this year. But because it has automated most of its processes, Stion only needs 200 employees for 100 megawatts of capacity.
Thurlow also noted that 59 percent of Stion's materials and 73 percent of its tools came from American vendors.
Advanced manufacturing sits at the core of the strategies of the other companies moving to the South. Twin Creeks, for instance, is part of a small clutch of manufacturers that hopes to trim the cost of solar by reducing the thickness of solar cells by two-thirds or more.
Whether any of these companies succeed remains an open question. All but Soladigm are relatively young and have not commercially produced their products in large volumes. Soladigm, by contrast, has been promoting electrochromic windows which change tint with the weather since 1989. The cost and complexity have only recently been ironed out, its executives have said.
Calisolar, which says it has a technique to cut the cost of purifying silicon for solar cells, has experienced delays and had to adjust its strategy to counter some of the abrupt shifts in its markets.
State governments also have a long history of job creation efforts gone awry. In the '90s, many of the industrial parks built for semiconductors remained empty. Evergreen Solar, a cutting-edge solar company from Massachusetts, recently declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy, as did Solyndra.
But at the moment, the Deep South is certainly attractive.

HEADLINE: Judge Widens Antitrust Suit Against Private Equity Firms

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The suit accuses 11 firms, including Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, of a conspiracy to rig the market for multibillion-dollar takeovers.

 BODY:
A federal judge has greatly expanded the scope of an antitrust lawsuit against the world's largest private equity firms, broadening the case to include some of the largest leveraged buyouts in history.
The four-year-old suit accuses 11 firms, including Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, of a huge, overarching conspiracy to rig the market for multibillion-dollar takeovers.
The litigation is a flashback to the heady period from 2005 to 2007 when some of the country's most well-known companies fell into private hands. Flush banks lent private equity firms billions of dollars to finance these deals. As the acquisitions grew ever larger, the biggest firms pooled their money and began buying companies together.
At issue in the suit is whether the "club deals" in vogue last decade were an illegal attempt by private equity firms to collude and drive down the prices of the acquisitions they made jointly. The case was brought by former shareholders of the acquired companies, including a Detroit pension fund and a pair of doctors.
Late Wednesday, Judge Edward F. Harrington of Federal District Court in Massachusetts ruled that the plaintiffs could seek information about 10 additional deals, including the largest buyout ever: the $44 billion takeover of TXU by Goldman Sachs, K.K.R. and two other firms. Other transactions now subject to investigation by the plaintiffs include the acquisitions of Harrah's Entertainment, Univision, Clear Channel and Toys "R" Us.
Until now, the case was limited to 17 leveraged buyouts like SunGard Data Systems, purchased by seven private equity firms, and Freescale Semiconductor, which four different funds acquired.
With the additional transactions added to the lawsuit, the private equity firms will now be forced to turn over more internal documents and e-mails. Already, they have produced millions of pages of documents to the plaintiffs.
Lawyers defending the private equity firms have said that the case has no merit. In a court filing, the defendants called the lawsuit "a far-fetched theory by doing nothing more than describing routine M.&A. activity, and labeling it anticompetitive." Indeed, there were bidding wars for many of the largest deals that actually drove up their purchase prices, they say.
The case, no matter how it turns out, has become an expensive and distracting one. The firms have collectively racked up more than $100 million in legal fees defending the suit, people briefed on the litigation said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the case.
The plaintiffs have deposed more than 30 of the country's most prominent private equity executives, including Glenn Hutchins, one of the two chief executives of Silver Lake, and Stephen Pagliuca, a senior executive at Bain Capital Partners.
To be deposed later this year are Stephen A. Schwarzman, the head of Blackstone Group; David Rubenstein, a co-founder of the Carlyle Group; and Leon Black, the chief executive of Apollo Global Management.
Much of the case has been cloaked in secrecy. The judge issued a broad protective order early in the case that has kept all of the evidence from public view. A recently filed amended complaint that is said to include embarrassing e-mail correspondence between private equity executives has been under seal.
The case harks back to the boom, a period that the plaintiffs call the "conspiratorial era." In the suit, they portray a corrupt deal culture in which firms submitted sham bids and secretly allocated deals among themselves. The complaint cites a 2006 speech made by David Bonderman, a co-founder of TPG, in which he reportedly said, "There's less competition for the biggest deals."
As an example of possible collusion, the plaintiffs pointed to the $21.3 billion acquisition of the giant hospital operator HCA, which was led by Bain and K.K.R. No competing bid materialized, the lawsuit said, because of an understanding that if "you don't bid on my deal, I won't bid on yours."
The complaint also noted an academic study by three business school professors concluding that the premiums paid to shareholders for club deals were lower than those in takeovers involving one firm.
"The result is that private equity firms collectively capture multibillion-dollar corporations and take them private at artificially low prices," the lawsuit said.
The complaint was filed in 2007 after the Justice Department began investigating potential collusive behavior related to club deals. No actions were ever brought by the government.
Many of the largest deals of last decade's buyout boom have fared better than expected. During the depths of the financial crisis, Wall Street analysts predicted a wave of bankruptcy filings for companies as they struggled with a global recession and heavy debt load. But a recovery in the capital markets allowed many of these companies to shore up their balance sheets through debt refinancing and equity offerings. HCA, for example, has generated billions of dollars in profit for its owners.
Still, several of the biggest buyouts continue to suffer. Energy Future Holdings, the large Texas utility formerly named TXU, has been buffeted by persistently low natural gas prices. Clear Channel, the radio and outdoor advertising giant, has wrestled with a soft advertising market, although its performance has improved.
The type of club deals highlighted in the antitrust lawsuit are, for now, a thing of the past. As banks have tightened the reins on corporate loans, the size of deals has shrunk. Private equity firms have not teamed up on any of the 10 largest buyouts this year.

HEADLINE: GreenTech Intends to Build E.V.'s in Mississippi

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: The company, led by the former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe, intends to keep manufacturing jobs traditionally destined for China in the United States.

 BODY:
The MyCar is a Smart-sized, two-seat electric vehicle with an international pedigree to match its manufacturer's outsize ambitions. Designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, one of the auto industry's most famous stylists, the MyCar was originally intended for a manufacturer based in Hong Kong. But the diminutive E.V. is now scheduled to be produced by GreenTech Automotive, based in Mississippi, and shipped to Denmark for European distribution later this year.
The MyCar project grew yet another wrinkle this month. Terry McAuliffe, GreenTech's chairman and the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said the car's hybrid and electric drivetrains would be built not at the brand's Chinese joint-venture plant - currently under construction in Inner Mongolia - but in Mississippi, a distinct reversal of the usual flow of manufactured goods.
Mr. McAuliffe, who also headed the presidential campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton and mounted an unsuccessful bid for Virginia governor in 2009, was described in 2000 by Vice President Al Gore as "the greatest fund-raiser in the history of the universe."
In recent media appearances, Mr. McAuliffe has presented GreenTech as a catalyst of American job creation. "I am sick and tired of seeing our jobs go to China," Mr. McAuliffe recently told MSNBC. "I am sick and tired of seeing big cargo ships coming in from China." 
GreenTech's plans have engendered some skepticism. According to Automotive News, Mr. McAuliffe's ambitious scheme faces "overwhelming obstacles" and is "dead on arrival."
The Truth About Cars, an automotive news and commentary Web site, recently recounted GreenTech's history as an offshoot of Hybrid Kinetic Motors, founded by Yang Rong - also known as Benjamin Yeung - the former chief executive of Brilliance, another Chinese automaker. In 2009, Hybrid Kinetic outlined a plan to build green cars in northern Mississippi with the involvement of Charles Wang, currently the chief executive of GreenTech. But Mr. Wang and Mr. Yang parted ways before any cars were built. Brilliance's plans to enter the European passenger-car market also were dealt a blow when one of its products received a zero-star safety rating in a crash test.
Despite the skepticism, Mr. Wang said in a telephone interview that crews were moving at "warp speed" to build the Inner Mongolia plant, which he said would be completed by the end of 2012 and have the capacity to produce 300,000 cars annually for the domestic market.
Wheels reported last year that Hybrid Kinetic planned to "heavily rely" on the Immigrant Investor Program, also known as EB-5, which would grant green cards and permanent residency to foreign citizens and their families who invested at least $500,000 in successful businesses in rural locations, or in areas of high unemployment. The Commercial Appeal of Memphis reported in 2009 that GreenTech would also be financed through EB-5. Mr. Wang confirmed the report in an e-mailed statement to Wheels, saying that GreenTech Auto "has been utilizing the EB-5 program as part of our funding sources."
American customers must wait to sample the MyCar because GreenTech intends to ship "a sizable percentage" of production through 2014 to its European venture, Mr. Wang said, adding that neighborhood electric vehicles, or N.E.V.'s, are more widely usable in Europe, where they are not limited to speeds of 25 or 35 miles per hour as they often are in the United States. The MyCar has a top speed of approximately 50 m.p.h.
Phil Gott, an automotive analyst at IHS Global Insight, said that inexpensive N.E.V.'s like the MyCar might find a market, in Europe and elsewhere, as limited-range urban vehicles.

HEADLINE: Electability a Primary Liability for Perry

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Rick Perry's remarks about Social Security may play into concerns about his appeal to general election voters. 

 BODY:
I've developed a habit - it's probably a bad habit - of assigning letter grades to the Republican candidates based on my initial reaction to their performance in debates. After Wednesday night's debate in Simi Valley, I gave Rick Perry a B-minus, meaning an average performance. Meanwhile, I gave Mitt Romney, his primary rival for the Republican nomination, a higher grade of A-minus.
The grades are based on neither style nor substance , but instead mostly on strategy: how much each candidate did to improve his chances of winning the nomination. Newt Gingrich, for example, got in some good one-liners and seemed more poised than he had in past debates. But in deliberately avoiding contrasts between himself and the other candidates, he did little to give Republican voters a reason to pick him - something he needs to do, since he's standing at about 4 percent in the polls.
As for Mr. Perry, I thought he had a very good opening sequence, surprising Mr. Romney by going on offense and critiquing his job creation record in Massachusetts - including a crowd-pleasing remark that compared Mr. Romney unfavorably with former Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis.
But he got weaker as the night went along. Some of Mr. Perry's odder moments - like his invocation of Galileo Galilei in response to a question about climate change - are liable to make for a funny segment on The Daily Show and then be forgotten about. What was more noteworthy was Mr. Perry's response to a question about Social Security, where he doubled-down on rhetoric from his book and characterized the program as a "Ponzi scheme."
This particular remark is not likely to sit exceptionally well even with Republicans, conservative though they may be. A CNN poll published last month found 57 percent of Republicans opposed to major changes in Social Security and Medicare.
Perhaps for the Republicans who will turn out in the primaries - who tend to be more conservative than Republicans as a whole - the numbers are closer to even, or a little bit in Mr. Perry's favor. I would argue that Mr. Perry's remarks were nevertheless unwise.
The reason is that this will play into concerns about his appeal to general election voters. (With good reason: some 62 percent of independents, and 69 percent of moderates, are opposed to reforms on the scale that Mr. Perry has advocated, according to the CNN poll.)
Electability does matter to primary voters. Historically, parties have rarely nominated the most ideologically extreme candidates in their field. Yes, George McGovern and Barry Goldwater won - but they have been more the exceptions than the rule as compared with a host of others (Howard Dean, Pat Robertson, Jesse Jackson, Pat Buchanan, Jerry Brown) who lost.
In fact, Mr. Perry's lead in the polls right now is based in part on perceptions that he is electable. The recent Washington Post / ABC News poll posed an interesting set of questions to Republican voters - asking them who they thought was closest to them on the issues, and who they thought was most able to defeat President Obama, in addition to their first overall choice.
Mr. Perry led the Republican field on each of the measures. But his lead was actually larger on the electability question: 30 percent of Republican voters said they thought he had the best chance of defeating Mr. Obama, versus 20 percent for Mr. Romney. By contrast, Mr. Perry held a smaller, 6-point lead over Mr. Romney on the question of his issue positioning.
This perception stands in contrast to the views of Republican elites, about 70 percent of whom think that Mr. Romney is the more electable nominee, according to a survey conducted by the National Journal.
It also stands in contrast to head-to-head polls matching Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney against Mr. Obama. Since Aug. 1, nine polling firms have tested both Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney against the president, and eight of them have found Mr. Romney doing a little stronger. On average, he has trailed Mr. Obama by just one point in these polls, versus a 5 percent deficit for Mr. Perry.
I wouldn't put too much emphasis on these head-to-head polls - but my research (which we'll be publishing in more detail in a separate article) suggests that the ideological positioning of the candidates does affect general election performance, even after accounting for factors like the performance of the economy and a president's approval ratings, and might plausibly make several percentage points worth of difference.
But back to the primaries: voters and parties are looking to calibrate these two objectives - picking a candidate who has a good shot at winning, and picking one who can be counted upon to advance their agenda. In a reasonably competitive field, failing either test will usually be disqualifying.
What Republican voters may perceive to be "electable" and what swing voters think may be two different things. Still, you can see that people like Ron Paul, Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin perform badly according to this test even among Republicans, according to the Washington Post poll, and it seems to be limiting their upside potential.
Mr. Perry has so far avoided this fate. But if perceptions about electability fade, so will his overall numbers. Regression analysis of the Washington Post poll suggests that Republicans are weighing these two factors - electability and issue positioning - about equally. If Mr. Romney, rather than Mr. Perry, led on the electability question, that could be enough to push him past Mr. Perry even if Mr. Perry is a little closer to Republican voters on the issues.
To be sure, it can be tricky to invoke concerns about your rival's electability. You may, in some cases, implicitly (or even explicitly) be abandoning goals that your party holds dear. Such criticism can run the risk of harming the opponent's brand should he win the nomination, and therefore may be met with limited tolerance from party elites. And such remarks can have an eat-your-spinach tone to them, reading better on paper than they sound in the room.
Mr. Perry's problems on Wednesday night, however, were of his own making: he was strong when engaging the other candidates, but weak on handling questions from the moderators. Unless he develops a stronger defense of his positions on Social Security, he will make Mr. Romney's job much easier.

HEADLINE: More on Tar, Oil, Pipelines and Presidents

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Varied views on a pipeline that would link a dirty oil source in Canada with American refiners.

 BODY:
I sought reactions to my post on President Obama and the "Alberta tar pit" from a variety of analysts and campaigners examining the economics and environmental impacts of a proposed pipeline linking that Canadian source of oil with American refiners.
I argued that the pipeline issue, which will confront President Obama later this year as he decides whether to approve the project, is a distraction from the core issues involving our energy future and is largely insignificant if your concern is averting a buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
(You also may be interested in Canada's response to a series of Times editorials opposing the project. It's important to note that the oil is almost assuredly going to continue being produced, whether or not this particular route is approved.)
Here are the reactions to my post, starting with a note from Bill McKibben, who was among more than 1,200 people who were arrested in a White House protest aimed at convincing the president to reject the plan: 
Bill McKibben:
Here's what I would say, and I think I speak with many of the people arrested over the last two weeks, in the largest display of civil disobedience for four decades in this country.
1-The tar sands are the second biggest pool of carbon on earth. Of course this pipeline-the first really big one into the tarsands-won't by itself kill the climate, any more than the first pipeline into Saudi Arabia raised the atmospheric concentration of CO2 to 393 ppm all by itself. It will just make it that much easier to build the next and the next and the next. What we're trying to do is send a message to stop exploitation of unconventional fossil fuels-which extends to new aggressive coal mining, and also to fracking the planet for shale gas. We're fighting back against the rise of this new energy paradigm, and this is the clearest place to make the fight. As (NASA's Jim) Hansen said, so you can't distort his quote: "Phase out of emissions from coal is itself an enormous challenge. However, if the tar sands are thrown into the mix it is essentially game over."
2-The moral stakes are very clear. Consider Brazil, which a quarter century ago the world decided controlled a biological treasure the planet couldn't do without. It has-fitfully, but with increasing success, slowed deforestation enough that it has reduced its carbon emissions more than any nation on earth. North America has a unique geological treasure, again the second-largest pool of carbon on earth. Why do we just get to burn it?
3-You claim to want an energy transition etc., etc. Has it occurred to you that we will get one the day we stop plugging into new sources of fossil fuel? Your method is akin to Augustine's: make me chaste lord, just not yet. My bet is, if we get a new Saudi Arabia, we'll use it. And my further bet is, it will take a few thousand temporary workers, according to the State Department., to build the pipeline, but the result will be putting off for another decade or two the job-rich transition to what needs to come next. As Paul Krugman pointed out in your pages yesterday, doing the right thing on the environment usually creates jobs; it's ugly to see you perpetuating the right wing jobs-vs.-environment meme.
4-It's empty to insist that the right thing would be some huge energy plan to make some great transition. Sure, but that's no going to happen in Washington as presently constructed. If we're going to get anywhere, it will be fight by fight and battle by battle-and this once, the president can actually do it by himself. Your effort is as you say designed, for reasons not clear, to help him out of his dilemma. Why? This is the man who said "in my presidency the rise of the oceans will begin to slow and the planet begin to heal." He can prove it in a small way here; if he didn't mean it, he shouldn't have said it.
5-The idea that Canada will simply sell the oil off to China is mistaken. It is trying to build a new pipeline to the Pacific, but so far it has gone nowhere, and no one thinks it will be built any time soon. That's because, unlike the U.S., first nations tribes in Canada have a lot of legal power, and this pipeline would have to go across their land. This is why Alberta's energy minister told the Globe and Mail this summer that without Keystone XL Alberta would be 'landlocked in bitumen.' Eventually I suppose they'll figure out a way to unlandlock themselves. But eventually one has to hope that the planet will wake up to the reality of climate change and things like this won't be an option. We're buying time, but it might turn out to be precious.
6-Speaking of first nations peoples, you need to deal with the fact that their ancestral lands have been wildly damaged by this incredibly primitive and inefficient tarsands mining. A delegation of chiefs and other leaders came to Washington, and many were arrested in our protest. They were powerful people. So are the ranchers and farmers whose land is being taken by eminent domain across the Plains. Oh, and you really think a pipeline crossing the Oglalla aquifer is a good idea? I'm glad opinions last forever on the Internet.
7-Global warming is not some far off problem we're going to have to get around to dealing with eventually. It is wrecking our lives now. Come visit Vermont if you don't believe me, or take a trip to Texas. Not to mention Pakistan, Queensland, any coral reef you might want to name, the dwindling ice floes of the Arctic, and-you know, I could go on a while. Every useful thing to slow it down should be done; this is an easy one.
8- I do wish you'd taken the time to catch a train to D.C. and actually cover this protest. You would have gotten the chance to talk to some interesting and courageous people. Scientists like Jason Box, for instance, who wrote a wonderful piece explaining why he felt-at some risk to his career-it was necessary to be there. Or maybe Gus Speth, the great and venerable environmentalist who has served in every high position you can think of, from chair of the president's Council on Environmental Quality to Dean of the Yale School of Forestry to head of the U.N. Development Program. He was in the next cell to me for two nights at D.C.'s Central Cell Block, a place that's as much fun as it sounds like it might be. As we both turned over and over on the bare metal slabs that served as our beds, he said something memorable, that to me provides the perfect answer to your relentlessly middle-seeking blog. "I've served in a lot of important positions in this town," he said. "But none seemed quite as necessary as this one."
The following thoughts were expressed within a group e-mail exchange on the post, so some of them refer to preceding comments.
Burton Richter, retired Stanford University professor and Nobel laureate in physics:
You take a long time to get there, but your conclusion that the pipeline is OK is one I agree with. Actually there are two different environmental reasons for opposing it. One has to do with greenhouse gases while the other has to do with the pipeline itself and the danger leaks create. The second is the argument of the Audubon Society, for example. Most, however are opposed because of emissions.
This gooey stuff is hard to get out of the ground and has to be heated to flow. It takes on the average about 15%-20% of the energy content of the extracted oil to get it moving so emission from this stuff are in effect 15% - 20% higher than "normal" oil. The reason it is produced is because it can be done at less cost per barrel that the present selling price of oil which is itself determined by the cost of the most expensive oil. If the Canadian tar sands oil is not shipped to us it will be shipped elsewhere because the existence or nonexistence of the new pipeline will not affect demand. You might see more deep drilling in the Gulf to meet U.S. demand, for example, or we could replace the Canadian oil with oil from countries that don't like us much like Venezuela, or countries where corruption enriches the few like Nigeria.
The way to decrease emission from oil is to increase miles-per-gallon standards for light vehicles and eventually to electrify light vehicle transportation while at the same time shifting away from coal to produce electricity to sources with much lower emissions (gas, wind, nuclear). When we do that, perhaps we will not need the Canadian oil, but it is needed somewhere in the world now.
Daniel Kammen, chief technical specialist for renewable energy and energy efficiency, The World Bank:
The key issue here -- far larger than the debate over a 17% or an 84% excess emissions per [barrel] of tar sands oil vs. light sweet crude -- is highlighted by, [but] not put into full energy and climate context by, the compelling and depressing Charles Homans Foreign Policy article [link].
The full resource of 'unconventional' oil (becoming more conventional all the time) is that it is vast, as Homans illustrates. The climate impact of this 'bottom of the barrel' pathway is the full measure of problem that the pipeline and tar sands illustrates as just one step in a climate destructive pathway.
[A] paper by a former University of California Energy and Resources Group faculty member and a student now on the faculty at Stanford ["Risks of the oil transition," A. E. Farrell and A. R. Brandt] lays this out in a figure where each axis alone is cause for major worry, and together, the carbon intensity/barrel combined with the fact that if unconventional oil is now part of the resource, we have a not near 'peak oil, but are, in fact, only about 1/50th of the way through this resource. That equation is a climate calamity.
The conclusion that demand management/reduction is the best way to address this (climate certified fuels, low-carbon fuel standards as in California, carbon budgets, etc ...) is correct if we were advancing steadily on that pathway. At present, however, collectively we are not.
I am in Australia this week serving on their Climate Commission. With the U.K.'s carbon scheme very much in mind we are looking at ways to bolster an economically viable climate plan, but in the context of some very difficult Australian domestic politics.
Roger Bezdek, energy analyst, Management Information Services, sent a short note referring to a presentation he gave in 2008 positing a peak in total fossil fuel production and resulting forecast for carbon dioxide concentrations:
On the other hand, world fossil fuel production and greenhouse-gas emissions may peak well before then -- see attached. [The presentation is posted online.]
Andrew Leach, an environmental economist at the Alberta School of Business with a great blog on energy, climate and oil sands that has the best blog name I've seen in a long time -- Rescuing the Frog:
I agree strongly with Dan Kammen on the potential supplies of fossil fuel resources, and the implications of those supplies for greenhouse-gas emissions. Further, I have a hard time reconciling the reserve additions figures in Roger Bezdek's piece with actual reserve additions in Canada, Venezuela, Brazil and Madagascar in recent years, but perhaps they are integrated earlier in time that the U.S.G.S. data, I am misreading one or both pieces of data, or the definition of reserve is not consistent.
What really matters for energy transitions, it seems to me, is the resource-to-reserve price elasticity, combined with the pace of development of alternatives. If, as Jacobsen and Delucchi write in this piece (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-path-to-sustainable-energy-by-2030), the potential exists for rapid learning and deployment of renewables, then some of the production outcomes predicted in Roger Bezdek's piece may hold true, but it won't be for reasons of physical scarcity. Equally, the cost curves laid out in Farrell and Brandt's paper would also still be valid, there would simply be no remaining reason to climb the curves any further into new and more expensive fossil fuel resources. Either way, I think the road to emissions reductions must be paved with a carbon price or constraint of some sort -- but that constraint needs to be applied broadly. Renewables are not positioned as of yet to displace the "next best" alternative to oilsands, and so I am wary of emissions reduction estimates tied to shutting them down.
After reading Roger Bezdek's deck, I was reminded of this quote from Jevons in 1865 which I posted on my blog not long ago: "Coal in truth stands not beside but entirely above all other commodities. It is the material energy of the country-the universal aid-the factor in everything we do. With coal almost any feat is possible or easy; without it we are thrown back into the laborious poverty of early times."
 Of course, in the same way that Jevons could not see the ability for oil, gas, and nuclear power to render us less fundamentally reliant on coal, I am sure we are making equally egregious errors in our predictions of energy transitions (or at least some of us are). For what it's worth, Jevons predicted the peak in U.K. coal production - but the consequences were nowhere near as dire as he predicted 50 years beforehand.
David Doniger and Liz Barratt-Brown, Natural Resources Defense Council:
NRDC has worked on tar sands and unconventional fuels issues for many years, including Keystone XL. We view development and expansion of these fuels as a major impediment to reaching the nation's climate protection goals. There are also very significant risks of damage to land, water supplies, wildlife and wilderness areas from tar sands extraction and transportation through the pipeline.
The U.S. is the only major market for tar sands-derived oil, and that's not likely to change. Without this pipeline, Canada's tar sands development will take place much more slowly, and at a much smaller scale. Michael Levi (and others) argue that the tar sands oil will be developed regardless of what the U.S. decides on Keystone XL - if we don't use, it someone else will - but this overlook the very serious opposition to other pipeline proposals in Canada. Neither the Enbridge Gateway to the west nor the Trailbreaker project to the east have been approved due to opposition in Canada. That leaves Keystone XL as the only viable prospect for moving tar sands oil into the global market. My colleague, Danielle Droitsch responded to Michael's arguments here.
Analysis by Ensys, supported by the Department of Energy, has found that there is plenty of existing pipeline capacity from Alberta to the U.S. through 2025 (over 2 million barrels capacity per day - we currently import about 1 mbpd). The real goal of the pipeline is to move tar-sands-derived bitumen from the Midwest, where it is currently backed-up, to Gulf Coast refineries.
Accomplishing that will do three things: It will mean industry can charge higher prices for these resources; it will give the industry first-time access to an international export port; and it will send a market signal upstream that the game is on for expanding tar sands exploitation. This Pembina Institute report tracks the industry's own statements linking the pipeline and the scale of their development plans. There is no evidence that Keystone XL will reduce the global price of oil, as Levi states - it's too big a pool. But it will increase gas prices in the Midwest as Keystone XL siphons tar sands oil to the Gulf Coast and beyond. 
For centuries, Russian foreign policy was dominated by gaining access to warm-water ports. There's an analogy here for the Canadian tar sands and its quest for access to the Gulf Coast. The pipeline will give the tar sands industry the ability to export this fuel to Asia and other markets.
Andy Revkin and others argue that the main game is better climate protection and oil conservation policies, as if those goals were unconnected to the pipeline's approval. Michael Levi says, "slash oil demand and the need for oil sands goes away." The Obama administration has put important new fuel economy and carbon reduction standards in place for new cars and trucks. But it is unlikely we will do significantly more to slash oil demand if we deepen our dependence on tar sands by building the Keystone XL pipeline. In addition to making our vehicles use less fuel, we need to reduce the amount of climate-changing fossil-carbon in our fuels - through "low carbon fuel standards," for example.
Andy also says the fight over Keystone XL is a "distraction from the core issues" of broader climate policy. It is certainly true that we can't avoid disastrous climate change without much broader policies. But the reality is that the U.S. and Canada are now nowhere close to having such policies. For now, we are cooking our climate future project by project, and Keystone XL is the biggest project in the queue. And the decision is in the President's hands alone.
Even if one looks only to the short-term, approval of the pipeline will have a climate impact of 27 million metric tons a year (this isEPA's estimate; DOE Ensys estimates 26 MMT), which is nearly twice the anticipated benefit of California's low carbon fuel standard. It's equivalent to the carbon emissions of building seven new coal-fired power plants or putting 5 million more cars on the road. We cannot usher in a new era of cleaner energy by scraping the bottom of the barrel with tar sands oil.
Everyone is too quick to conclude that environmental concerns compete with economic stagnation and joblessness. To the contrary, reducing our dependence on oil - foreign or domestic - saves Americans billions of dollars at the pump. The administration's carbon pollution and fuel economy standards are helping rebuild the car industry by making cars cheaper for American families to own and operate. That translates into billions more dollars invested in creating jobs in America instead of paying foreign oil suppliers - including Canada. (It's worth remembering that when world oil prices go up, we get no special deal from Canada.)
Bottom line. This pipeline may be in the oil industry's self-interest, and even in Canada's national interest, but it is not in America's national interest.
Adam Brandt, a Stanford University researcher focused on oil and alternative fuels:
I have no strong objections to any of the perspectives laid out thus far. I will give my perspective first on peak oil, then on the emissions consequences of oil sands development.
1. Regarding peak oil, there is (in general) great confusion about the topic, which is aided by the use of imprecise definitions by various groups. I think peak oil is very important, but not for the reasons generally outlined. My feelings are as follows:
a. A peak in conventional oil (which I generally define as primary + secondary production) is likely to be upon us sooner than many optimists would imagine, even with Bakken tight oil. Despite a few encouraging finds (e.g., Brazil sub-salt), trends in E&P look dire over the past decade A great presentation by Steven Kopits at Douglas-Westwood is floating around the web on this topic. This is what the general public thinks of as "oil", and is the reason for panic about peak oil.
b. This peak in conventional output is driven both by political and geologic factors, and does not represent absolute geologic scarcity.
c. A peak in conventional oil is not a dire situation, and does not, in the end, mean a shortage of refined fuels at the pumps. Non-conventional liquids production has reached ~ 4.5 Mbbl/d since 1960, which includes EOR, oil sands, CTL, GTL, ethanol, biodiesel. Oil sands projects in the regulatory pipeline sum to over 7 Mbbl/d, meaning that a Saudi Arabia (give or take) is in the planning process up north.
d. The contrast between points a) and c) is the reason for so much confusion about peak oil. It is very possible (probable in fact) that we will face a peak in conventional oil output with a simultaneous increase in total liquid fuel availability. So did oil production peak or not? It all depends on what you mean by "oil".
e. So why does peak oil matter then? Because of the environmental impacts of oil substitutes. Oil sands are not a pretty picture, and biofuels are in all likelihood worse, despite the protestations from their supporters.
2. Next, on to oil sands GHG emissions:
a. Available evidence suggests that oil sands have 10-30% higher GHG emissions on a well-to-wheels basis than conventional oil. 15-20% is a reasonable industry-average figure. The range is caused by variation in conventional oil baseline and variation in oil sands projects (e.g., in situ production fueled by asphaltene residue gasification results in higher emissions than mining). This emissions increment is a concern in the present, as current policies in the US and EU aim to reduce the carbon intensity of fuels. In my mind, this is a small-scale concern.
b. The enormous problem in the future is the availability of trillions of barrels worth of unconventional hydrocarbons. This includes not only oil sands, but Venezuelan extra-heavy and oil shale as well. These all have a WTW emissions increase from conventional oil, and are available in truly vast quantities. That is a lot of carbon in the ground that we would ideally keep out of the air.
c. The fight over Keystone is (in my mind) unlikely to amount to much in the end. With demand drivers there, the oil sands will come out one way or another. There is too much money on the line to expect anything different. That said, I understand the effort as a first fight by environmentalists to try to keep the carbon in the ground.
d. In the end, the only way to keep this carbon in the ground is to 1) reduce demand with greatly improved efficiency, and 2) introduce low-carbon alternatives in the transport sector that people actually WANT to drive (e.g., electric vehicles running on power produced with natural gas, renewables or nuclear). All other measures, including pipeline protests, will fall to overwhelming market forces.

HEADLINE: At Obama Jobs Speech, Small Business Is in Audience

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Six small-business owners get special invitations to President Obama's jobs speech

 BODY:
Whenever a president addresses Congress, the White House invites a panel of Americans, distinguished and not, to watch the speech with the first lady from prime seats in the gallery above. The guests tend to be demographically diverse, but they also tend to be united in representing priorities the president intends to emphasize in the speech.
President Obama's speech to a joint session of Congress tonight on creating jobs hews to that tradition. According to the White House, 24 people will join Michelle Obama in the first lady's box. Some of the names are familiar - the invitees include Jeffrey R. Immelt,the chairman and chief executive of General Electric; Kenneth I. Chenault, the chairman and chief executive of American Express; Steve Case, the founder of America Online; and Richard L. Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. But six small-business owners and executives are also on the guest list, and their presence reflects the importance of small business to the economy and the political landscape. Here they are, in capsule biographies provided by the White House:
Darlene Miller, owner and chief executive of Permac Industries, a precision machining company in Burnsville, Minn. Ms. Miller joined Permac as a sales representative in 1992 and within two years became its full owner. She is also a member of President Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness.
Albert Green, chief executive of Kent Displays, a manufacturer of liquid crystal displays in Kent, Ohio.
Jan Heister, president and chairman of Premier Tooling and Manufacturing in Peosta, Iowa.
Philip Maung, owner and founder of Hissho Sushi, a 200 employee company based in Charlotte, N.C., that trains sushi chefs and distributes ingredients nationwide.
John Raftery, president and chief executive of Patriot Contractors, a construction firm specializing in interior and exterior architectural specialties. A service-disabled veteran of the Marines, Mr. Raftery founded Patriot Contractors in 2007; today the company has 21 employees and projects that revenue will exceed $5 million this year.
David Catalano, co-founder of Modea, a digital advertising agency in Blacksburg, Va., with 80 employees based around the country. The White House says Mr. Catalano "has been able to maintain his home in rural Virginia and build a globally competitive company, highlighting the importance of the need to provide high-speed broadband access to all parts of the country."
Check back with The Agenda tomorrow for more on how the president's proposals may affect small business.

HIGHLIGHT: Sonia Gandhi was missed.

 BODY:
She's back. At least, we think she is.
Sonia Gandhi returned to India on Thursday morning, shrouded in the same mystery and secrecy that shrouded her departure last month. At that time, we were abruptly told that she had left. Now, her spokespeople tell us that she is back, but say little more. Mrs. Gandhi did not make a public appearance or issue a statement. 
"She has returned early this morning, and she is fine," party General Secretary Janardan Dwivedi said on Thursday afternoon.
We know that Mrs. Gandhi has spent the last several weeks in the United States, recovering from surgery to treat an undisclosed medical condition. Her aides have described her medical status as a private matter and refused to say anything more -- or to comment on the speculation in the Indian media about treatment at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
Everyone, including her political enemies, has wished Mrs. Gandhi a full and speedy recovery, even if most people are not certain what she is recovering from, and even if a few have argued that more public disclosure is needed about the health of India's most powerful political figure. Not that it is unusual for India's political leaders to hide their ailments.
There is no doubt her Congress Party is ailing. The matriarch of the political party returns to a house that is suddenly a complete mess. The Anna Hazare movement exposed the Congress as rudderless and vacillating in her absence. Her son, Rahul, did little to persuade the public that he is prepared to fill her shoes. India's flagging economic numbers have brought criticism that Congress leaders have been too slow to push through reforms.
And now Wednesday's bomb attack at the Delhi High Court has brought criticism that the government is ill-prepared to protect the nation from terrorism.
Welcome back, Mrs. Gandhi. Your party needs you.

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: A review of the day in Washington.

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
 President Obama will present a jobs plan tonight to a joint session of Congress. The president is seeking to rebuild his support among moderate and independent voters, and his proposals are full of ideas that Republicans have supported in the past. The Times's Helene Cooper writes that Mr. Obama's pursuit of such votershas lasted the better part of two years but has yet to gain traction, forcing him to rethink his approach to those critical voting blocs.

        
The Republican presidential candidates faced one another last night at a debate in California for the first time since Gov. Rick Perry of Texas jumped into the race and became the instant front-runner. And the sparks flew. The Times's Jeff Zeleny and Adam Nagourney recap the action and assess the candidates' performances.

        
Obsess, campaign, fight, deploy: The Times's Jennifer Steinhauer says that was the Congressional template set by the debt ceiling fight this summer, one that will be repeated as the lawmakers pivot to a new subject: jobs.

        
Disaster aid emerged on Wednesday as the next Congressional battleground. The Times's Robert Pear reports that Senate Democrats propose providing $6 billion in disaster relief to the victims of Hurricane Irene without any offsetting cost savings. It's a plan Republicans oppose.

        
With the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on Sunday, President Obama has an opportunity to emphasize the progress his administration has made in the fight against terrorism, The Times's Eric Schmitt and Mark Landler write. They also look at how and why the administration is heightening defenses and increasing surveillance for the weekend in the absence of a specific threat.
Around the Web:

        
The president's job plan is expected to include a proposal to extend the payroll tax cut for the middle class, but The Wall Street Journal says that it may be a hard sell to economists and lawmakers who question its effectiveness.

        
The Washington Post examines President Obama's tendency to rely on big speeches in times of political trouble and highlights the risks he is taking with tonight's address.

        
Ahead of today's first meeting of the special debt reduction committee, Roll Calllooks at how the panel's 12 members will have to balance demands for transparency with their deal-making if they hope to reach a $1.5 trillion agreement by Nov. 23.
Happening in Washington:

        
President Obama lays out his jobs plan at 7 p.m. in front of a joint session of Congress.

        
At 9:15 a.m., the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, delivers remarks at the 10th Anniversary Summit of the Sept. 11 attacks. The event is sponsored by the Center for National Policy and the Voices of September 11 and will be held at the Newseum. Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut speaks at 4:45 p.m.

        
Economic data coming out today include consumer credit numbers data for July from the Federal Reserve, July trade data and the quarterly services survey from the Census Bureau, employee compensation costs for June and weekly jobless claims from the Labor Department, and weekly mortgage rates from Freddie Mac.

HEADLINE: The Vote That Delayed Obama's Speech

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: The president was told the House was too busy Wednesday for him to address Congress. Their one vote? Approving a charity run.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Last week there was a small hoo-ha over choosing a day for President Obama to address a joint session of Congress. Mr. Obama wanted to give his jobs speech on Wednesday, the same night as a Republican presidential debate. But he was rebuffed by John A. Boehner, the House speaker, who said late votes on Wednesday would prohibit an ample security sweep.
There was in fact one roll call vote Wednesday night: "Authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the District of Columbia Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run."
The resolution was a bright light of bipartisanship: It passed unanimously, with 379 members voting.
"As the majority leader announced more than a month ago, the House will not be in session until Wednesday, Sept. 7, with votes at 6:30 that evening," Mr. Boehner wrote last week to Mr. Obama. "With the significant amount of time, typically more than three hours, that is required to allow for a security sweep of the House Chamber before receiving a president, it is my recommendation that your address be held on the following evening, when we can ensure there will be no parliamentary or logistical impediments that might detract from your remarks."
So the president took the speaker's recommendation, and his speech was scheduled for Thursday evening.
The House did do a little more business than give its nod to the torch run (which will begin from the west terrace of the Capitol and continue along the grounds). Members discussed trade and unemployment and gave hearty congratulations to the girls all-stars team from North Carolina, which has made the Little League World Series. The House met at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, and adjourned at 9:36 p.m.

HEADLINE: The Different Audiences for Obama's Speech

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The success of the president's jobs speech may be judged by how lawmakers respond, but there are several other important constituencies to consider.

 BODY:
President Obama's jobs speech on Thursday evening will take place in front of a joint session of Congress, underlining the coming legislative clash over how best to jump-start the nation's flagging economy.
But the president will have many different audiences when he takes the podium in the House chamber at 7 p.m. (earlier than usual to avoid the start of the N.F.L. season).
The immediate success of the speech may be judged by how lawmakers in the chamber respond, though in Washington's hyperpartisan atmosphere the reaction is almost certainly going to be negative from the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.
The challenge for the president -- any president -- in such speeches is to find a way to communicate a series of different messages to the many groups who will be watching.
Everyone will hear the same words. But within the speech, particular words will be signals to different constituencies.
And the tone of the speech will matter, too. Will the Obama who gives the speech tonight be the professorial one, methodically explaining the situation to the public? Or will he be the more aggressive, campaign-mode Obama whose rhythm and pace is quicker and more urgent? Or maybe a mix of the two?
Here's a breakdown of the different groups that Mr. Obama will be talking to on Thursday night:
House Republicans. First and foremost, Mr. Obama will be putting House Republicans on notice that he intends to press them to pass his jobs package -- and to use their refusal as a campaign issue if they do not take it up. Speaker John A. Boehner and his top lieutenants have for months demanded that Mr. Obama put his jobs plan on the table. Now, they will have to decide how to deal with it. 
Reaction to the details of the president's proposals that have already leaked out suggests that Mr. Boehner's party intends to dismiss most of them. But again, the tone could matter. If Mr. Obama is combative, the legislative battle could be short and decisive. If the president extends a series of olive branches, there could be more of an effort to negotiate.
Independents. The White House has made clear that one of its chief goals with the speech is crafting an argument that independent voters will find reassuring.
The president's victory in the 2008 election leaned heavily on convincing those middle-of-the-road voters that he was the best candidate to handle the economy. Since taking office, his popularity among that group has plunged.
To win them back before the 2012 election, Mr. Obama is hoping to make the case that he is the reasonable one in Washington, the one person willing to compromise and negotiate in good faith to get something done.
"The professional left." For weeks now, there has been a steady drumbeat of expectations from liberal pundits and columnists who were once derided by Robert Gibbs, the president's former press secretary, as "the professional left."
It seems unlikely from the information we have so far that the president's proposals will completely satisfy the most liberal of his supporters. But the size of the jobs plan -- which could approach $400 billion -- may help to quiet some of the president's critics.
And his tone will matter with this audience, too -- though in the opposite way. The more he chooses conciliatory language in talking to House Republicans, the less the professional left will be happy. If he chooses fiery rhetoric that will whip up his base, he could anger those Republicans in the House.
Look for a bit of both in the speech to satisfy both audiences.
The markets. Senior White House advisers have long said that they do not measure the president's success by the daily ups and downs of the stock market.
But at the same time, the president and his advisers are well aware of how much Americans pay attention to their portfolios. And the recent wild swings in the market have been unnerving to the public and probably contributed to the decline in the president's poll numbers.
So the president will, in a sense, be talking to the markets tonight, hoping to reassure investors that there are plans under consideration that could help get the economy going again.
Europe. Along those lines, the president's speech will be watched closely in Europe. The economic turmoil there will not be solved by Mr. Obama's proposals on Thursday, but a disappointing speech will not help to calm nerves overseas either.
In particular, European leaders will be eager to see whether the United States appears headed toward more political gridlock, or whether there seems to be a renewed commitment to dealing seriously with the nation's economic situation.
His Republican rivals. Perhaps the most predictable audience will be the men and women who hope to replace Mr. Obama in the White House in 2013. They -- and their strategists -- will be watching closely for nuggets they can use to criticize the president on the campaign trail.
Mr. Obama will no doubt give them some ammunition. The 45-minute speech is almost as long as a typical State of the Union speech and is likely to be packed with rhetoric that a Republican ad-maker can use. And much like a formal State of the Union address, it is also being watched by an invited group of presidential guests who will be sitting in a box in the House chamber with Michele Obama. The group includes veterans, small-business owners and others.
But the White House is clearly hoping that the speech will also put the Republican candidates in the same box that Republican House members might find themselves: Either support popular jobs measures proposed by the president, or oppose them and risk angering voters who want something done.
Mr. Obama and his advisers will argue that the speech is not political. It is aimed, they argue, at actually getting something done to deal with the nation's sluggish job growth.
But everything he says will be picked apart by Republicans on the campaign trail. And unless something changes radically, the speech and his jobs proposals will be one of Mr. Obama's central arguments when he begins campaigning in earnest next year.

HEADLINE: Fresh Off Debate Debut, Perry Turns Down the Heat

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Rick Perry was less critical in his assessment of his Republican rivals the day after they met for a debate, focusing his attacks on President Obama instead.

 BODY:
CORONA DEL MAR, Calif. -- Rick Perry's first debate was a hot and unapologetic barbfest with his fellow Republican candidates in which he did not back down from his remarks that Social Security is a "Ponzi scheme." But the next day, speaking to the Orange County G.O.P., the Texas governor was more muted in his attacks, never mentioning the entitlement program, and he offered his own assessment of the debate.
"Last night was pretty awesome," Mr. Perry said, speaking at Roger's Gardens before a large crowd that, the owner of the gardening supply store said, had not been this big since then-Gov. Ronald Reagan addressed it many years ago.
Though Mr. Perry helped ensure that Wednesday night's debate was lively, tweaking everyone from Mitt Romney to Representative Ron Paul and even Karl Rove, he was less critical in his assessment of his competitors the next day. He also failed to address one of the buzziest moments of the night - his belief that social security is a "monstrous lie" in need of an overhaul.
"I stood on the stage last night with seven other very, very fine and great Americans, and every one of them would be better than what we have in the White House today," Mr. Perry said. "And I appreciate their great sacrifice and their great commitment to our country. We got our differences and we'll talk about them and what-have you, and hopefully in a very respectful way, and I do respect them."
Later, he touted his record as the governor of Texas to explain why he was best suited to be president.
"With all due respect to my folks who are my competitors, nobody else has got a record like I've got in the state of Texas, or in this country, for that matter," he said, adding that his is "a record that serves as a road map for this country to get our economy back on track and get America working."
Mr. Perry also tried to highlight his opposition to President Obama.
"The point is we need to have a nominee that doesn't blur the lines between themselves and the current president of the White House," he said. "And I'll promise you one thing: I have got that contrast between Obama and myself."
Mr. Obama, he said, has been in office for 31 months - "That's 76 rounds of golf," he joked.
The president is set to deliver his jobs plan to a joint session of Congress tonight, and Mr. Perry was quick to the criticize Mr. Obama and his administration as "a problem for this country" unable to offer solutions.
"I'm telling you, the promises and the platitudes that we're going to hear are not going to cut it," he said. "Mr. President, we cannot spend our way to prosperity, it does not work. I'm tired of the liberals who only care about jobs so that they can see an expansion of more government programs."
Though many viewed Mr. Perry's debut debate performance as a doubling down on some of his controversial stances - his assertion that social security is a Ponzi scheme and his skepticism in global warming and climate change - his remarks Thursday were a short eight minutes. He did not seem prepared to ramp up his pitch, offering only a variation of his standard stump speech.
Mark Miner, a spokesperson for Mr. Perry, also rejected the notion that Mr. Perry had offered up any new pieces of red meat in the debate.
"He stood his ground," Mr. Miner said. "He said what he's always said. I don't think anything new came up yesterday. He was just restating a position he's said before."
 Mr. Perry spoke Thursday under a hot sun with temperatures topping 80 degrees, and shortly after he took the podium, an elderly woman in the bleachers passed out. From his perch in the front, Mr. Perry had no idea a woman was sick, which created a somewhat incongruous scene for the first half of the speech - Mr. Perry making a loud and forceful case against Mr. Obama, while dozens of Republican attendees shouted for paramedics and scrambled to dial 911.
"And it is up to us, this current and present generation in America, to take a stand for freedom, to send a message to Washington, D.C., that we're taking our future back from the central planners who would control our health care, who would spend our treasure, who would downgrade our future, who would micromanage our lives," Mr. Perry said.
After the event, women in "Beverly Hills Tea Party" T-shirts and former Eagle Scouts gathered along a rope line to greet Mr. Perry. A woman in stiletto heels and a designer dress with a Perry for President sign stumbled through the shrubbery trying to get a picture of the governor.
Finally, he got into a black SUV, and gave a prolonged thumbs up through the tinted window as he pulled away.

HEADLINE: Reaction to Gingrich's Plan for Alaska

BYLINE: WILLIAM YARDLEY


HIGHLIGHT: Among the Republican presidential candidates proposing economic and energy solutions in their debate, Newt Gingrich cast one of his ideas as particularly bold.

 BODY:
Among the Republican presidential candidates proposing economic and energy solutions in their debate on Wednesday night, Newt Gingrich cast one of his ideas as particularly bold.
"We own 69 percent of Alaska," the former House Speaker said, referring to the portion of the state in government control. "That's one-and-a-half Texases. Now, let's set half of Texas - let's set half of Texas aside for national parks. We could liberate an area the size of Texas for minerals and other development. That would raise even more revenue, not the normal Washington viewpoint."
Precisely how Mr. Gingrich's idea might work was not clear (as was how many Alaskans were watching the debate) but the basic theme is hardly new in the Last Frontier or even in Washington: the idea that Alaska holds vast natural resources, from oil to gold to natural gas, but that federal control and restrictions over much of its land prevents those resources from being developed and therefore from benefiting the state and the national economy and energy supply. The shorthand for this position: "Drill, baby, drill." 
That line gets cheers for a certain former Alaska governor. This is what the current one, Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican who has repeatedly complained about what he has called "federal overreach," said in a statement about Mr. Gingrich's comments:
"We appreciate it when national figures give voice to the truth that Alaska is a storehouse of natural resource wealth. If federal agencies wanted, they could unlock Alaska's resources and lower costs of living for Americans -- fueling our nation's economic growth. I am happy when any candidate stands up for this kind of economic opportunity rather than for more of the same."
Countless obstacles likely would stand in the way of a Texas-sized resource development park in Alaska. Native groups would fight to protect their subsistence hunting rights on lands proposed for development. Environmentalists would question the impact on endangered species, wilderness areas and clean air and water. Numerous federal agencies would potentially have to undo decades of work. Then there are the costs and logistics of operating major development efforts - and transporting the resources elsewhere - in a remote and frigid land were stores of oil or minerals or gas are not always reachable road.
"It is a common refrain and it's been such for decades," said Scott Goldsmith, an economist with the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska in Anchorage. "You go back to the federal government's reports on economic development in Alaska back in the '20s and '30s. You'll see hard rock mining, mineral development along with timber, as the basis for an economy for the state. The response or the Alaskan response has always been, 'Unlock the federal lands and let us develop those resources.'"
And there have always been people who have pushed back.
"If he's just talking about our need to establish energy independence, the only way for us to do that is to focus on a transition to renewable energy," said Layla Hughes, the Arctic policy advisor for the World Wildlife Fund. Ms. Hughes said that while Alaska has substantial fossil fuels, "we don't have the reserves" to solve energy needs long term.
(Speaking of long term, Mr. Goldsmith said large development projects usually take 10 or 20 years to come to fruition and that the Texas Park proposal "is not going to happen tomorrow. It's not a solution to our short-term federal deficit problems by any means.")
Several people interviewed early Thursday said they had not seen the debate. Others, including those who support resource development in places like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, said they were unclear on what Mr. Gingrich had proposed.
"We're not entirely sure what Mr. Gingrich means by 'liberate for minerals and other development,'" said Julie Hasquet, a spokeswoman for Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat from Alaska. "If he means open up ANWR and the Arctic for oil and gas drilling, Senator Begich is for it."
Mr. Gingrich has expressed interest in the past about how Alaska benefits from its resources, including the annual dividend checks residents received based on oil revenues.
In July 2008, a month before Senator John McCain selected Sarah Palin as his running mate, Mr. Gingrich sent the Alaska governor an e-mail to her private Yahoo account.
"Someone recommended to me that we study the Alaskan model of revenue distribution back to the citizens and get bills introduced in state legislatures in California, Florida and elsewhere that if they go to offshore drilling they should split the revenue stream with a specified amount (maybe half) going to the citizens as a direct benefit," Mr. Gingrich wrote. "How much does each Alaskan get? What share of the oil revenue goes to state government and what share would go to the citizens? Do you have an expert who could explain all this to me? Would you be interested in writing or talking about all of this? Thanks, Newt."
Ms. Palin forwarded the e-mail to an aide.
"Pls forward to someone wise in revenue," she wrote.

HEADLINE: How Republicans Plan to Respond to Obama

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama has not started his speech about the economy yet, but House Republicans have talking points for their candidates ready to go.

 BODY:
President Obama has not started speaking yet, but House Republicans have talking points for their candidates ready to go.
In a letter to all incumbents and new Republicans candidates who will be on the ballot in 2012, Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, lays out a plan for beating Democrats, largely tied to blaming President Obama for the poor state of the economy.
"The top of the ticket will drive the 2012 election," Mr. Sessions writes, "and a politically-toxic President is now the Democrats' roadblock to retaking the majority. The Republican pathway to victory in 2012 is holding President Obama and his Congressional Democrats accountable for every job-destroying policy that stands in the way of Americans finding work and providing for their families."
Among the points candidates are encouraged to hit:

        
Overall theme: "President Obama has made a bad economy worse. This fundamental fact will headline the 2012 election. Instead of hope and change, President Obama has given the American people the longest economic downturn since the Great Depression."
        
Special hit for his jobs' speech: "Despite the fact that the trillion-dollar stimulus failed to keep unemployment at or below 8 percent as promised and turn around our economy, the Obama administration is calling for even more stimulus spending for 'shovel-ready' jobs like roads and bridges."
        
 Obama is no longer the one: "The once rock star figure of the Democrat party is now an alarming political liability for House Democrats."
        
 In conclusion: "Keep staying on the offense with the will to win in 2012."

HEADLINE: Social Media Gears Up for Obama Address

BYLINE: JENNIFER PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama speaks at the Capitol, but the arguments from both sides are already radiating out across the Web.

 BODY:
While the Republican Party will not deliver a formal response to President Obama's job speech on Thursday, some members of Congress and Republican presidential candidates will be turning to Twitter to get their message across. 
Representative Paul Broun of Georgia was one of the Republican lawmakers not attending the speech. Instead, he planned to watch it from his office, share live updates with his almost 6,000 Twitter followers (@RepPaul BrounMD) and answer questions from constituents during what he's calling his own Twitter Town Hall. 
Speaker John A. Boehner (@SpeakerBoehner) will be sharing his thoughts on Twitter shortly after the speech. Republican Congressional leaders did not organize a coordinated effort on social media for Thursday's speech, as they did for the State of the Union address, leaving it to members to say what they want about the president's jobs plan. 
The National Republican Congressional Committee has distributed its talking points to House Republicans and new Republican candidates, some of which will likely translate into Twitter messages emphasizing that Mr. Obama has made "a bad economy worse."
 But Representative Eric Cantor, the Virginia Republican and House majority leader, might have been trying to set the tone for some members' use of social media with his posts on Twitter Thursday. In several messages, he said Republican and Democrats needed to work together despite their differences. "The economic reality in our nation's communities requires that we transcend our political differences and reach points that we can agree on."
Republicans will be joining the White House in using the hashtag #JobsNow, along with the regular Republican hashtag on this issue, #4jobs.
The White House will livestream the speech, which begins at 7 p.m., on WhiteHouse.gov/live and on its official White House channel on Facebook. The live stream will include charts and statistics that will help visualize what the president is talking about. 
Then, immediately after the speech, a panel of White House advisers will be taking questions on Twitter from those who use the hashtag #WHChat and who post questions on Facebook. People can also submit questions on http://whitehouse.gov. 
"One of the most valuable things about social media is that rather than guess the questions that Americans have about something as important as President Obama's plan to create jobs now, social media allows us to hear immediately from people about what they don't understand, what they don't agree on and what they want to know more about," said Macon Phillips, director of digital strategy at the White House. "That allows us to answer those questions in real time, which is what tonight's event after the speech is all about." 
 On Friday, the White House is hosting another tweetup so that people will be able to ask more questions about the jobs speech from the press secretary, Jay Carney.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Urged To Plan to Aid Cuba in Case Of an Oil Spill

BYLINE: By VICTORIA BURNETT; John Broder contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
HAVANA -- The United States should urgently make plans for helping Cuba in the event of an offshore oil spill as it prepares to begin exploring fields opposite Florida this year, William Reilly, the co-chairman of a commission that examined the Deepwater Horizon spill, said during a visit here. 
Mr. Reilly, who met with Cuban officials, said they were hungry for expertise about offshore oil development and happy to get it from the United States. ''It seems to me to be profoundly in the interest of the United States to ensure that, if there should be a spill in Cuban waters, all efforts are undertaken by both government and private entities in the United States to assist in responding,'' he said Wednesday.
Mr. Reilly was part of a delegation organized by the Environmental Defense Fund and the International Association of Drilling Contractors, who have found common cause in pressing their message on the risks of shunning Cuba as it makes its first full-scale push into offshore drilling.
Repsol, the Spanish oil company, plans to dig at least one well using a Chinese-built rig, which is set to reach Cuba in November. A significant discovery would greatly change Cuba's economic prospects, but the possibility has also raised concerns about potential ecological disasters.
Cuba produced about 50,000 barrels of oil a day in 2009, according to Cuban government figures, and imported 120,000 barrels more a day from Venezuela.
Members of the delegation said it was not clear how drilling companies working in Cuban waters would be able to obtain safety equipment from the United States, like capping stacks or blowout preventers, to prevent spills or mitigate their effect.
The Treasury Department has said it will issue licenses to allow American companies to operate in Cuba under the economic embargo on a case-by-case basis, but experts contend that the licenses need to be broad in their scope.

HEADLINE: Customers Hurting, Wal-Mart Is Bringing Back Layaway

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Wal-Mart said on Thursday that it planned to bring back its layaway payment plan for the holidays, an indication that shoppers at the nation's largest retailer were feeling more and more strapped.
Wal-Mart had discontinued layaway in 2006, saying that so many customers were using credit cards or gift cards that the program was obsolete. Now, though, consumers are demanding it, said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising officer for Wal-Mart's United States stores.
''It just tells us the customer's still struggling, as they tell us about their concerns with energy prices, housing prices, the job security, that 9.2 percent unemployment -- it tells us that this is a fragile economy and the customer needs our help,'' Mr. Mac Naughton said. 
Layaway means that a store sets aside a product and requires customers to pay for it over time, usually charging a small service fee but no interest. With layaway, someone living paycheck to paycheck could potentially afford a more expensive item than otherwise, given the extra time to pay for it.
It was a common way to pay for expensive items through much of the 20th century. But as credit cards became popular, layaway dwindled and was mainly used by lower-income consumers who could not qualify for credit cards.
That has been changing in the last couple of years. As the recession hit and the recovery dragged on, some Wal-Mart competitors have offered layaway. Toys ''R'' Us started offering layaway on expensive items in 2009, while Sears brought back layaway in 2008 after a long hiatus. (Sears Holdings' Kmart division has offered layaway for decades.)
The other retailers' jump on layaway puts Wal-Mart into the unusual position of being a holiday season follower. Because of its size, it often sets the standards that other stores follow over the holidays, whether that is pricing on toys or its offer last year of free shipping on hundreds of online items.
Now, with nine consecutive quarters of declining same-store sales in the United States, and having said that improving those sales is a central focus, Wal-Mart is struggling to figure out how to get its consumers to spend. Executives have said throughout the year that shoppers are increasingly shunning credit and paying with cash, and are running out of money at the end of the month.
Wal-Mart's revival of layaway indicates it does not expect consumers to feel flush anytime soon.
The layaway program will ''alleviate the pressures they may have in their homes,'' Mr. Mac Naughton said. ''We think this is an opportunity for a cash-paying customer to create a payment program on their own time.''
Wal-Mart is limiting the program's scope and time frame. Only toys and electronics may be paid for on layaway, starting Oct. 17 and ending Dec. 16. Each item must cost $15 or more, and the total layaway purchase must be $50 or more. There is a $5 service fee, and a 10 percent down payment is required.
Other retailers have similar conditions: Sears has a $5 service fee and a 20 percent down payment, while Toys ''R'' Us has a $10 service fee and 20 percent down payment.
On a site where shoppers can offer feedback to Wal-Mart, layaway has been one of the more popular suggestions.
A commenter by the name of PamS wrote that even when she set aside money for gifts, ''the saved money usually gets used for some other unexpected bill or what not; whereas if I was able to do layaway I feel I could better budget and especially for special holidays.''
''I know for some the idea of layaway probably seems silly; but for those of us on very fixed and limited incomes, it does help,'' she wrote.
Another commenter, SueH, had a similar view.
''I can't get many things now either,'' she wrote. ''I don't make enough money to pay all at one time. I can't do extra for my grandkids. Please bring back layaway.''
Other shoppers said they were going to competitors because of their layaway programs. ''You would think in this economy every store would have it! During Christmas I have to shop at Kmart cause of the layaway,'' wrote a commenter under the name ''wishing'' on a West Virginia forum.
Mr. Mac Naughton also outlined other plans for the holiday season. Holiday merchandise will hit stores in mid-October, about two weeks earlier than usual, he said. And Wal-Mart will put a number of toys on sale for $15 starting Monday, including some Lego play sets and Princess Toddler dolls from Disney.

HEADLINE: From a Verbal Gaffe Comes Some Good

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL

 BODY:
OREGON, Ohio -- For at least a half-century, ''Little Sisters of the Poor'' has been used as a euphemism in college sports to describe a weak opponent. Its roots trace back to an emphatic victory by Senator Robert Taft of Ohio in his 1950 re-election, which the mayor of Cleveland compared to the ''Notre Dame football team beating the Little Sisters of the Poor.''
As the expression evolved into the vernacular of college sports, many failed to realize that the Little Sisters of the Poor is, in fact, a religious order. So after years of being considered the epitome of athletic ineptitude, the Little Sisters will finally get a chance to take the field Saturday. 
Before Ohio State's game against Toledo, the Buckeyes plan to recognize two Little Sisters from this Toledo suburb. The occasion marks a recovery from a verbal fumble by Ohio State's president, E. Gordon Gee, who last year criticized Boise State and Texas Christian, proclaiming, ''We do not play the Little Sisters of the Poor.'' The statement resulted in Gee's being vilified, especially after T.C.U. beat Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl and finished undefeated and No. 2 in the final polls.
''It was a dumb statement, it really was,'' said Gee, who vowed to eat crow at Antoine's, a restaurant in New Orleans.
Gee had no idea that the Little Sisters of the Poor was a religious order. He quickly realized the Little Sisters, which was founded in France in 1839 with 2,700 sisters and 200 homes around the world, and is dedicated to helping the elderly poor, are the last people he should be picking on.
After Gee removed his loafer from his molars, he called Sister Cecilia Sartorius, the mother superior here, to apologize. He wrote a $1,000 donation check, and has since given more. More important, he discovered the work that the Little Sisters do and pledged to help any way he could.
''We don't have any alumni; our alumni die and go to heaven,'' Sister Cecilia said, flashing an electric smile during an interview last month. ''We have no ways to get any funds from our alumni. We get prayers from them. If we could reach out to his alumni throughout the whole U.S., maybe they could help us with funds and we could help them with prayers and they could reach the same goal that our alumni have reached.''
Thus began a friendship between a bow-tie-wearing Mormon college president and a habit-wearing mother superior. Gee first met Sister Cecilia when the Ohio Legislature honored her for the Little Sisters' 125 years of service earlier this year.
In August, Gee visited the Little Sisters here along with about 20 Ohio State students, as well as Brutus, the Buckeye mascot, which provided a highlight of the summer for the 74 residents and 20 day visitors and stirred statewide and national publicity. It also engaged local Ohio State graduates to offer to help out.
Gee interacted with the residents, including a man in a wheelchair dressed in Michigan attire. Gee approached him and good-naturedly pretended to wring his neck. The publicity from the visit yielded an uptick in visibility and donations for an operation that needs $6 million a year to stay afloat, half of which comes from private donations.
Gee will privately present a check to the Little Sisters on Saturday. Four sisters, three staff members and five residents, three of whom are in wheelchairs, will be attending the game at Gee's invitation.
More important to the Little Sisters is the awareness that Gee's gaffe has caused, helping spread word of their work and mission.
''I think the net result has been positive,'' Gee said. ''Getting to know the sisters and getting an opportunity to talk about their cause. Personally, it's been very satisfying to me.''
Gee was quite impressed with the Little Sisters, whose home rests on 44 acres and includes a beauty salon, cafeteria, library, chapel and physical therapy center.
''We create family with them,'' Sister Cecilia said. ''Since our residents by and large are poor, most have never had anything quite this nice.''
The sisters are so reliant on donations that they go out begging. Nearly every day, two sisters hit the streets and beg in the tradition of the order. Sister Margaret Banar, a Michigan fan who will be honored on the field with Sister Cecilia before Saturday's game, often goes to Detroit Produce Terminal and begs for different fruits and vegetables.
''We go down the line and ask different companies if we could have a couple sacks of potatoes and oranges,'' she said. ''They usually give us whatever we ask for. It's not stuff that's spoiled, it's stuff that they could sell.''
The economic slowdown has made monetary donations more difficult to obtain. Bill Cook, the Little Sisters' director of development here, said it was difficult to quantify how much Gee had helped them. But in a slow economy, it has generated a much-appreciated uptick in attention.
''It's been much more of a challenge,'' Sister Cecilia said. ''Even our big benefactors and donors just aren't able to give what they could give a few years ago.''
Gee could not be more thrilled with the new rapport. And in a career in which he has received stern phone calls from officials at Southwest Missouri State and the Montana School of Massage for patronizing them the way he did the Little Sisters, he thinks he's finally found an appropriate euphemism.
''St. Aloysius of the Swamp,'' Gee said with a laugh. ''I haven't checked that one yet, but that's my new one.''

HEADLINE: When He Was Good, He Was Very, Very Good

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
One evening in the summer of 1972, John Chancellor of NBC began his newscast with a rundown of the day's reports. War, economic turmoil, the growing Watergate scandal -- all of that would be dealt with in due course. ''But first,'' Chancellor said, ''Bobby Fischer.''
That clip appears in ''Bobby Fischer Against the World,'' Liz Garbus's fascinating new documentary, as a reminder that, for a moment, Fischer was just about the biggest thing in the world. The matches he played against Boris Spassky in Iceland in 1972 were a global media event. A world championship was at stake, and so were cold war bragging rights, as Fischer, a prickly individualist from Brooklyn, took on Mr. Spassky, a product of the great totalitarian Soviet chess machine. Fischer's tactical brilliance and nerdy charisma inspired an explosion of interest in the game. Chess clubs popped up in schools all over America, and Fischer was added to the roster of sports heroes that children dreamed of emulating. 
But his story has a darker, sadder side that has over the years overshadowed Fischer's remarkable achievements as a player. His behavior before and during the tournament in Iceland was bizarre. He almost did not show up, taking refuge at the New York home of Anthony Saidy, a fellow American grandmaster and a crucial voice in Ms. Garbus's film. In Reykjavik he arrived late to matches and complained continually about the conditions of play, actions that were seen by some at the time as a form of psychological warfare intended to throw his opponent off guard.
In the retrospect afforded by Ms. Garbus's chorus of friends, rivals and colleagues, it seems more likely that the turmoil of Fischer's inner life was spilling out into the quiet and orderly arena of chess. Almost as soon as the duel with Mr. Spassky was over, Fischer disappeared from public view, only to return two decades later as a decidedly unheroic figure. After playing a tournament in Belgrade in the middle of the Balkan war and in defiance of a United States travel ban, he lived in exile in Japan and Iceland, giving increasingly strident voice to a paranoid worldview rife with conspiracy theories and riddled with anti-Semitism. (Fischer himself was of Jewish background.)
Fischer died in 2008, a poignant and repellent shadow of his brash and brilliant younger self. What happened? ''Bobby Fischer Against the World'' does not traffic in easy explanations or medical diagnoses, but it leaves the strong impression of a continuity between the oddness Fischer displayed in early interviews and the mania so jarringly evident toward the end. And it also tactfully but strongly posits a connection between the genius he brought to an infinitely complex game and the madness that defined his relationship to just about everything else.
Most of Ms. Garbus's interview subjects are chess players rather than psychologists, so the question of Fischer's possible mental illness is left to hover at the margins of the film. It is clear that he was seriously disturbed and also profoundly alone. He was estranged from his mother, Regina, and had a habit of turning on his most loyal and patient friends.
It is hard to avoid the conclusion that somehow he should have been protected, cared for, given more help than he was able to find. To see him in front of the camera as a twitchy, arrogant youth or a grizzled, angry older man is to witness -- and to participate in -- the cruel curiosity of celebrity culture. And yet if he had been spared fame, the world would have been denied a share of sublimity, and the kingdom of chess would never have found its wayward, dazzling, tragic prince.
BOBBY FISCHER AGAINST THE WORLD

HEADLINE: Stimulus For Skeptics

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
A few years ago, Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen M. Reinhart wrote the definitive guide to the current economic downturn, a book called ''This Time Is Different.'' Rogoff and Reinhart studied data from eight centuries of financial crises. They found that banking-crisis recessions are worse than normal recessions. They last longer.
In these recessions, it took an average of six years for housing prices to stop their decline. Unemployment rates were high or rising for an average of five years. Government debt increased by an average of more than 86 percent. 
The general lesson I take from this history is that policy makers stuck in a financial recession should probably think about the long term. You're going to be stuck with a lousy economy anyway. Anything you do to try to boost the growth numbers next month or next quarter is going to be overwhelmed by the underlying forces -- the continuing housing overhang, the gradual deleveraging process, the lingering mood of fear and anxiety.
You might as well use the winter of recuperation to take care of the fundamentals. Work hard to fix the education system, the tax code, the fiscal mess and the regulatory system. None of these things will produce short-term benefits. But when the recession finally does run its course, the economy will be ready to surge. Paradoxically, you have more power to influence these fundamental issues than you do next month's jobs report.
There's only one problem with this long-term orientation. Suppose in the middle of the winter of recuperation the economy stops recuperating? Suppose instead of grinding forward, the economy starts sliding back? In these circumstances, do you still have the luxury of thinking about the long term? Don't you have to try to reverse things here and now?
This is the problem the Obama administration is facing. Like everybody else, it has seen a sluggish economy come grinding to a halt. There is clearly now a significant risk of a double-dip recession. That would be terrible for America's workers, fiscal situation and psyche. This prospect is enough to shock even us stimulus skeptics out of our long-term focus. It's enough to force us to contemplate the possibility of another stimulus package.
The next question is this: Does the administration have any stimulus ideas that could actually stimulate? Thursday night the president gave one of the most forceful and compelling domestic policy speeches of his presidency. His proposals were drawn from the middle of the ideological spectrum and were selected to appeal to people who don't put a lot of faith in government spending. There's a payroll tax cut, a small business tax cut, infrastructure spending, subsidies so states don't have to lay off cops, firefighters and teachers, and a plan to use unemployment insurance to subsidize temporary work for the unemployed to get them back involved in the labor force.
Republicans have supported most of these ideas at one time or another. Still, let's not sugarcoat things. Recent stimulus packages have not exactly lived up to the hype. Temporary tax cuts generally don't lead to much job creation. Given the long lead times involved, infrastructure spending is an odd way to combat a double dip that might be starting right now. Job subsidies often go to companies that would have hired the people anyway. One recent study showed that a plurality of the people hired under the last stimulus package already had jobs; they were just switching from one to another.
In short, the administration is putting forth a package to prevent a double-dip recession that may not come to pass with a series of measures that may not work.
Yet it's hard to walk away. The prospect of a double dip is truly horrifying. What happens if next months job's report comes in negative? Or the one after that? Believe me, Congress will be rushing to do something then.
Personally, my bottom line is this: I think the president has earned a second date. He's put together a moderate set of stimulus ideas. His plan may not be enough to jolt prosperity, but it might maintain its current slow growth.
If he comes up with his own deficit proposal that pays for his programs with some serious entitlement reforms (and not merely with some boilerplate ''let's tax the rich'' plan), then Republicans would be wise to work with him to make his growth ideas more effective.
The mainstream economic view is that we should combine near-term stimulus with long-range austerity. Up until now, the political system has been unable to perform this two-stage approach. Republicans won't touch spending, and Democrats won't touch entitlement reform.
The president clearly wants to give it a final shot. His tone on Thursday was feisty and will please Democrats. But the substance was heterodox and worth pursuing. In this moment of peril, the country needs an insurance policy against the double dip.

HEADLINE: China's Flawed Inflation Figures

BYLINE: By JOHN FOLEY and MARTIN HUTCHINSON

 BODY:
When China reports this week that the consumer price index rose at an annualized rate of about 6 percent in August, economists may say inflation has peaked. They said the same last year, when the C.P.I. was running half as fast. The problem isn't bad forecasting: China's headline inflation measure is flawed.
Headline inflation is easily bent by volatile prices. Take pork, which rose 57 percent year on year in July. Vegetable prices are increasing more than 5 percent a week, and the effect is magnified because food composes a third of the C.P.I. basket. Conversely, some prices are artificially low, like energy and transport. A ticket on Beijing's subway has cost a flat 2 renminbi for three years. 
China's size creates another problem. While Shanghai urbanites lament the price of their lattes, farmers in the hinterland have different concerns. Perhaps it would be better to have one C.P.I. for the city and one for the country. New tailored bank rules for low-income Xinjiang Province make that not so far-fetched.
Finding the genuine inflation number isn't easy. One insight comes with the difference between nominal and real reported gross domestic product, the so-called G.D.P. deflator. By that measure, 2010's inflation was around twice the C.P.I.'s reported 3.3 percent rise. If that's a guide, today's inflation could be in double digits.
Savers, who are robbed by rising prices, are giving a strong signal. They have flocked to real estate and high-yielding wealth products to beat the measly 3.5 percent mandated one-year deposit rate. That makes inflation harder to fight, since money pushed into informal lending channels isn't affected by monetary policy tools like bank credit quotas. Allowing deposits to be set by the market would draw more back into the banks. But the fear of eroding banks' margins seems to stand in the way of what would be a potent inflation-fighting tool.
And then there are the dog whistles from politicians. Premier Wen Jiabao wrote in a state magazine on Sept. 1 that price stability was his priority, and warned of ''unstable'' conditions. Whatever the numbers say, when savers and politicians worry, investors should, too.
Proximity Blues
Canada's economic comfort is suffering at the hands of its troubled southern neighbor. The Bank of Canada on Wednesday stopped raising interest rates at 1 percent, largely because of deteriorating conditions in the United States. That's a pity -- Canada would benefit from rates above inflation. But sluggishness and policy-wrangling south of the border sap growth and make its currency less competitive.
That makes the central bank's decision understandable. Canadian short-term rates are already 1 percentage point higher than America's zero rates, while the Canadian dollar has strengthened 5 percent against the greenback in the last year. The prevailing near parity between the two currencies hurts Canadian exports, slows growth and hampers job creation, even though the country's resources sectors remain competitive.
A pick-up in growth in the United States would help Canada's exports, while higher interest rates in the United States would reduce the upward pressure on the Canadian dollar. But neither of those things is likely in the short term, and the Federal Reserve's commitment to a zero-rate policy through 2013 could even at some point put pressure on the Bank of Canada to reduce rates.
Yet Canadian inflation approached 3 percent in the year to July, and the nation's savings rate, at 4.1 percent in the second quarter, is uncomfortably low and has fallen by 2.7 percentage points in the last year. Higher rates could help on both counts. Increased savings could also help the government as it chips away at the budget deficit and tries to balance its books.
Not that inflation, let alone growth, can be said to be overheating. But that, like the Bank of Canada's rates policy, has a lot to do with the cold wind from the south. The United States represented 73 percent of exports in 2010 and the hobbled European Union and Japan a further 11 percent.
A push to build closer ties with faster-growing developing countries could help long term. Location makes that diversification challenging and, if a United States diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks is to be believed, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's foreign travel -- for instance, to Brazil last month -- isn't especially to his liking. But it's a worthy goal. In the meantime, Canada's erstwhile geographical advantage is, for now, its millstone.

HEADLINE: A Diamond Maker Joins Hearst To Show Power of Print and Dazzle

BYLINE: By TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
IN the current economy, some can afford to buy diamonds and some might need a little help to do so. A new advertising campaign by Hearts On Fire, the Boston-based diamond company, hopes to have something for all types of buyers.
Instead of hiring a traditional advertising agency, the company has collaborated with an in-house creative team at Hearst Magazines for a new campaign with customized messages in digital and print ads. The company says it also hopes to increase awareness of its brands by building a social media community. 
The campaign will be rooted in 82 print spreads that will run in seven Hearst magazines over 16 months. One of the main goals is ''to show the power of print and how it moves consumers into the funnel and brings them all the way down to the purchase,'' said Michael A. Clinton, the president, marketing and publishing director of Hearst Magazines.
The content of the print ads will vary slightly in each magazine based on its target audience. For younger fashion-conscious readers of Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire and Redbook, ads will highlight lower-priced items. The more affluent readers of Harper's Bazaar, O, The Oprah Magazine and Town & Country will see higher-priced items.
''It's not unusual for someone from Town & Country to pick up the phone and buy a $32,000 piece,'' Judith Bookbinder, the vice president of creative communications at Hearst, said, referring to readers of the magazine.
Male readers of Esquire will be encouraged to buy diamonds for the women in their lives. The campaign also seeks to entice women to purchase items like diamond hoop earrings or pendants for necklaces for themselves.
Before the new Hearst campaign, Ms. Bookbinder described previous ads by Hearts On Fire as ''very traditional, everything you've ever seen in a jewelry ad.'' Instead of featuring a simple image of the product, Ms. Bookbinder said, the new ads show real quotations from the brand's Facebook page describing jewelry as ''bling-tastic'' and ''a menagerie of twinkles.''
The ads showcase quotations about the jewelry from two fashion bloggers, Christine Cameron of My Style Pill and Stephanie Johnson of SJ's Style Compass. They also will write about the diamonds on their blogs.
Each month, users who ''like'' the Hearts On Fire Facebook page will be entered in a contest to win a piece of diamond jewelry. And users who need a little guidance before committing to a jewelry purchase can call one of the company's ''Perfection Stylists'' to help them select the right bauble. In anticipation of the campaign, the company expects to expand the number of phone agents on call to about 25, from three, and will counsel customers seven days a week. In addition to aiding potential consumers with diamond purchases, the stylists can also act ''as a platform to let people tell us what they'd like to be seeing in terms of products and price points,'' said Caryl Capeci, the vice president of marketing for Hearts On Fire.
The ads will also feature Web addresses linking each ad to its corresponding publication (HeartsOnFire.com/Esquire) and Quick Response, or QR, codes that consumers can use to go to HeartsOnFire.com. Once on the site, the users will be asked to share their own diamond stories and will be entered into a contest to be featured in one of the ads.
The use of QR codes and specific Web addresses will allow the company to learn more about its customers. ''We can see who's coming, what are they buying,'' Ms. Capeci said. ''We can optimize media and designs. It gives us an opportunity to really look more closely at our consumers.''
Consumers who may not have all of the money for a diamond purchase up front can enroll in the company's payment plan, which asks for a 35 percent down payment and six monthly installments.
''We wanted to be competitive in the payment plan area,'' said Glenn Rothman, the founder of Hearts On Fire. ''If we can give people an opportunity to get into the brand with a down payment through the payment plan, then that would add to the success of the program.''
Another feature of the campaign is a revenue sharing model where Hearst will get a percentage of the sales generated through the campaign, though representatives from Hearts On Fire and Hearst declined to say what the terms would be. The model could represent a new revenue stream for the publisher.
''That's part of it,'' Mr. Clinton said. He was the chief creator behind, ''The Power of Print'' a recent advertising campaign that extolling the virtues of print over digital content. The campaign was supported by Hearst, Time Inc., Conde Nast, Meredith, Wenner Media and the Association of Magazine Media.
The Hearst team says it hopes the Hearts On Fire campaign will drive home the point that print is still a major consumer vehicle, even if that consumer ultimately ends up on the Web. ''Effective creative in print today needs to have a lot of digital enablers,'' Mr. Clinton said, referring to advertising.
According to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, Hearts On Fire spent $3.8 million on advertising last year. For the first quarter of 2011, it spent $1.6 million, Kantar reported.
The partnership between Hearst and Hearts On Fire also represents a small evolution in the way brands interact with agencies. The Hearst Creative Communications team is handling all aspects of media planning and buying in addition to producing the creative elements of the campaign. Traditionally, those tasks would have been handled by several companies.
''Marketers are interested in partnering with us in much more and different ways,'' Ms. Bookbinder said. ''We've known the power of print. This is just a way of really making sure how that manifests.''

HEADLINE: N.B.A. Talks Show Hints Of Progress

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
When N.B.A. labor talks resumed Wednesday, for an extended session in Midtown Manhattan, officials from the players union opened with a broad premise: Tell us what it will take to end the lockout and save the 2011-12 season.
It was an open-ended request for ideas, an effort to move the conversation away from long-rejected proposals and to find some basis for common ground, according to a person who was briefed on the meeting. 
The union's request sparked a discussion that lasted five and a half hours, which in turn led to another five-and-a-half-hour session Thursday. Both sides declined to offer details, judgments or predictions, and they cautioned the public not to draw any conclusions. But for the first time in two years, there seems to be movement, or at least a constructive dialogue.
The next step will come Tuesday, when the N.B.A.'s labor committee and the union's executive committee will convene in Manhattan to continue the discussion. The recent progress was made with small groups in the room, of three to five people from each side.
''We think it's getting to be an important time, and it's a good idea to have larger group meetings at this point,'' Commissioner David Stern said Thursday.
The decision to expand the talks is not an indication that a deal is near, Stern said, but a nod to the calendar. With training camps set to open Oct. 3, the talks will need to accelerate to avoid the cancellation of preseason games. Any eventual deal will require participation from the full committees.
''It doesn't imply that somehow we're on the verge,'' Derek Fisher, the president of the National Basketball Players Association, said, referring to the larger meeting.
Next week will be the busiest since the lockout began. On Thursday, N.B.A. owners will gather in Dallas, while the union simultaneously holds a membership meeting in Las Vegas, where more than 40 players are already gathering to play and train.
Stern said he did not anticipate any vote to postpone camps or cancel preseason games during the owners' meeting.
Fisher said he expected to have ''some type of feeling about where this is going'' by the time he holds his union meeting. But he said that Thursday should not be viewed as a deadline.
Talks became more productive last week when the two sides agreed to a smaller negotiating group, with Stern, Deputy Commissioner Adam Silver and the San Antonio Spurs owner Peter Holt, who heads the labor committee, representing the N.B.A. The union was represented by its executive director, Billy Hunter, its lead counsel, Ron Klempner, and Fisher.
This week, the group expanded to include the union's economist, Kevin Murphy, and its outside counsel, Jeffrey Kessler. The N.B.A. brought in Dan Rube, its deputy general counsel, who specializes in collective bargaining issues. The purpose, according to the person briefed on the meeting, was to have experts in the room who could immediately run the numbers as the sides traded ideas for a new economic model.
Although the sides remained divided, they have moved from the entrenched, distant positions that led to the lockout on July 1. Silver seemed to allude to that Thursday when he said it was ''never accurate'' to say that the sides had not exchanged new proposals since June 30.
By all accounts, the recent discussions have been constructive, respectful and productive. Stern called them intense. Both sides were honoring their commitment not to discuss details in public.
''It's been engaging, it's been active, there have been tons of ideas and thoughts expressed in the room,'' Fisher said. He added: ''We're trying our best to get a deal done. Right now, it isn't there yet, but we'll keep at it.''

HEADLINE: Many Views On a Greek Bond's Value

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Is there one set of international accounting standards, or can each country choose its own when the going gets tough?
That is the important issue being sorted out now in Europe, where banks have taken widely divergent positions on valuations of Greek bonds.
Broadly speaking, there seems to be a consensus within countries. British banks were most willing to swallow bad medicine and admit the bonds were worth far less than par value. Some German banks were equally forthcoming, but others were less so. Italian banks seem to have done as little as they could, but did take write-downs. French banks went the farthest to find ways to act as if Greek bonds were just fine.
The first-half financial statements issued by the banks were unaudited, but they were reviewed by audit firms. The same firms -- well, firms with the same name -- seem to have signed off on wildly different ways of looking at the same underlying market for Greek bonds. In some cases there is enough disclosure for investors to try to adjust valuations, but in other cases there is not. 
The situation is so chaotic that the chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board, Hans Hoogervoorst, wrote to European securities regulators in early August to protest that ''it appears that some companies are not following'' the relevant accounting rule, known as IAS 39. He did not name names, but there was no doubt he had the French banks in mind.
The protest -- which was kept secret until someone leaked it to The Financial Times -- has so far provoked no public response from the regulators.
It is the French securities regulator, the Autorite des Marches Financiers, whose reaction will matter most. If it forces French banks to change their accounting, it risks incurring the wrath of both the French government and French bank regulators. If it looks the other way and other European securities regulators do nothing, the essential weakness of international standards -- a lack of consistent enforcement -- will be clear to all.
That the fight is taking place now may be critical to the future of the international rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission is weighing whether to allow American companies to use the international rules rather than the ones set down by the American rule writer, the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The S.E.C. would be able to enforce consistent application of the rules by companies whose securities trade in the United States, but arguments for the change would be undermined if it appeared there was little reason to think those reports would be comparable to reports issued by companies in other countries.
It has long been clear there is no common legal enforcement mechanism for international rules, but some hoped the audit firms would fill that role. In this very visible area, that did not happen.
''Auditors have not enforced a consistent approach among their clients,'' wrote Peter Elwin, the head of European accounting research for J. P. Morgan. ''Some institutions have taken full advantage of the principles-based IAS 39 impairment rules to achieve the desired result.''
In an interview, Mr. Elwin said that could change. ''Interim results are not audited, whereas the year-end figures will be,'' he said. ''That may tighten things up.''
Or it may not. Although they use similar names in various countries, the auditing firms are organized as national partnerships. There are efforts within the firms to assure consistency across borders, but in the end it is the French partnership -- which is no doubt quite aware of what the French government wants -- that decides what it will allow French companies to do.
Mr. Hoogervoorst is upset by the way banks are accounting for Greek bonds that they have carried on their books as ''available for sale.'' Under IAS 39, such bonds are supposed to be marked to market values. But such write-downs do not have to be shown in net income unless and until the bond values are deemed to be impaired.
During the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, banks could and did argue that there was no active market for some of the strange derivatives that they owned. If that were the case, then they were supposed to look to market values of similar instruments. Only if those were not available were they allowed to go to ''mark to model.'' If they can use models, they can apply assumptions about expected cash flows and determine current value from those calculations.
In the opinion of BNP Paribas, the largest French bank, the market for Greek bonds is inactive, never mind the fact that there are trades every day. It pointed to ''the lack of liquidity seen during the first half of 2011'' as it concluded market prices were ''no longer representative of fair value.'' It is now using a model to determine value.
In his letter, Mr. Hoogervoorst states that the fact that Greek bonds trade less frequently than they once did does not prove a market is inactive. ''That is because when measuring fair value, the issue is not about the level of market activity per se, but about whether an observed transaction price represents fair value,'' he wrote.
''IAS 39 is clear that unless there is evidence that the prices in those transactions do not represent fair value, for example, because those transactions are forced,'' he added, ''the observed transactions prices should be used to measure fair value.''
The French may be preparing to argue for a sort of sovereign immunity exception to the accounting rules. BNP Paribas cited ''the undertaking given by French banks at the request of the authorities not to sell their position'' in Greek bonds, but did not say why that was relevant. The argument may be that if their government won't let them sell the bonds, then there is no market available to them, even if there is one available to everyone else. With no market, they can go to their optimistic models to get values.
The Greek bailout proposed in July by European authorities -- one that is still tied up in disputes -- called for an exchange of Greek bonds maturing before 2020. The Institute of International Finance, a trade group of major banks, estimated that amounted to a 21 percent haircut, and many banks cited that figure in taking 21 percent impairment charges. Given that the bonds are generally trading for around half of face value, that seems optimistic.
Many banks applied that haircut to all of their Greek bonds, including the long-term ones not covered by the proposed exchange. But some banks, including BNP Paribas and Societe Generale in France and Intesa Sanpaolo in Italy, decided to carry the long-term bonds at full value, on the theory that it would all work out and that European governments had promised not to force exchanges of longer-dated bonds.
''It is,'' said Mr. Elwin, ''probably more of a faith-based measurement system than a fair-value-based measurement system.''
If those banks really believe that long-term Greek bonds will be paid in full when due, they could buy some at bargain prices. On Thursday, the average trading price for such bonds was about 37 percent of par value.
The accounting hocus-pocus may in the end be counterproductive for the banks. It highlights the latitude banks have in many areas of accounting, and shows that some are quite willing to use that latitude to come up with ridiculous valuations in a highly visible area. It undercuts investor faith in those banks, and is a major reason European bank stocks have fallen so far this year.

HEADLINE: A Tale of Jacob, Esau and Muscles

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
At one point in ''Warrior'' we see Brendan Conlon, a high school science teacher, laying down the law -- the law of physics that is -- for his students. ''Force equals mass times acceleration,'' he writes on the board. That formula might be of use in thinking this new film from Gavin O'Connor, which grasps the Newtonian principles at the heart of pugilistic melodrama.
''Warrior'' takes place in the world of mixed martial arts, and it is appropriately blunt, powerful and relentless, a study of male bodies in sweaty motion and masculine emotions in teary turmoil.
But like the brutal, brawling sport that provides Mr. O'Connor with a backdrop, a storehouse of metaphors and a pretext for staging some viscerally effective fight scenes, ''Warrior'' possesses surprising poetry and finesse. Which is not to say that it is subtle. The director's impressive technique -- and all the grace and discipline of his excellent, hard-working cast -- is mustered with a single, unambiguous goal in mind. This movie wants to knock you out. It will. 
Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is a dedicated educator and a devoted family man. His students adore him, and so does his wife, Tess (Jennifer Morrison). But Brendan's roots and his future are entangled in more violent pursuits. He used to be something of a big deal on the mixed martial arts circuit, and now, to make some extra money -- and perhaps also to find an outlet for the rage that simmers behind his kindly eyes and gentle grin -- he fights for cash in parking lots. As hard as they work, Brendan and Tess have trouble staying afloat. They are, indeed, under water, carrying debt on their modest house in Philadelphia that is much larger than its post-real-estate-bubble value. And one of their children requires expensive medical care.
Meanwhile Tommy (Tom Hardy), Brendan's estranged younger brother, returns to the modest house in Pittsburgh where they grew up. Years before, Tommy and their mother (whose maiden name he has adopted) fled the boys' abusive, alcoholic father, Paddy, a wrestling coach played with growling, broken-down grandeur by Nick Nolte. Tommy, a former Marine who served in Iraq, is not looking for reconciliation. He's looking for a fight, and without forgiving his sobered-up, apologetic dad, he engages the old man's professional services as he prepares to go into the ring.
Unbeknownst to each other, both Tommy and Brendan -- who is coached by an old friend (Frank Grillo) -- are training for Sparta, a $5 million, winner-take-all tournament. Every sports movie needs a Big Game, and in Mr. O'Connor's hands Sparta becomes a frenzied, fleshy opera: a grand, grunting, assaultive spectacle of redemption and revenge.
Tommy's style of fighting recalls that of the young, unbeatable Mike Tyson. He attacks with a combination of speed and strength that turns an opponent's bravado into fear in a matter of seconds. Brendan relies more on technical finesse and a capacity to withstand punishment. Mr. Hardy and Mr. Edgerton -- an Englishman and an Australian playing a pair of Irish-American he-men -- are physically potent actors, but the key to the movie's effectiveness lies in their ability to convey fragility. These are tough guys, but you can only care about them if you believe that they can break.
At the basic level of plot, what will happen at Sparta is never really in doubt. Though there are other imposing fighters in the Spartan ranks -- including a fearsome Russian who recalls (though he does not physically resemble) Dolph Lundgren in ''Rocky IV'' -- it is obvious that the bad brotherly blood between Tommy and Brendan can be expiated only one way, in a final showdown.
Mr. O'Connor, who wrote the ''Warrior'' screenplay with Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman, knows perfectly well that surprise is not the essence of sports-movie suspense. A few years back he directed ''Miracle,'' a rousing reconstruction of one of the most celebrated athletic moments in recent history, the 1980 victory of the underdog United States Olympic ice hockey team over its fearsome Soviet rival. It's not as if knowing the outcome of the real story diminishes that movie's impact. On the contrary, the sense of inevitability and improbability makes its triumphant finish all the more cathartic.
The engine of inevitability in ''Warrior'' is not history but fate. Paddy's constant companion in his lonely, sober old age is an audio-book version of ''Moby-Dick.'' That novel's theme of monomaniacal, violent obsession and the Shakespearean cadences of its prose underline what is happening on screen in a way that is only occasionally heavy-handed. (And in any case a good fight picture, like a good fighter, can benefit from a heavy hand.) Brendan, Tommy and Paddy uphold traditional family values -- the tradition, that is, of Cain and Abel, Jacob and Esau, King Lear and the fallen houses of ancient Greek tragedy.
But if there is something primal and archaic in Mr. O'Connor's fable of fathers and sons, he nonetheless grounds it in the painful realities of contemporary America. With arresting honesty and enormous compassion -- but without making a big topical deal out of it -- ''Warrior'' looks at an American working class reeling from the one-two punch of war and recession. Tommy and Brendan are too proud for self-pity, which makes the evident pain of their circumstances all the more affecting.
They fight because every other way of being a man has been compromised, undermined or taken away. Patriarchal authority, as represented by Paddy, is cruel and unbending until it turns sentimental and pathetic. The roads to an honorable life promised by work and military service are mined and muddied by the greed and mendacity of the institutions -- government, schools, banks -- that are supposed to uphold integrity.
In such conditions stripping down to your shorts and beating another guy senseless can seem not only logical, but also noble. The mock-gladiatorial theatrics of mixed martial arts may look tawdry and overblown, but the sport, perhaps even more than boxing, expresses a deep and authentic impulse to find meaning through the infliction and acceptance of pain. While the Conlon brothers are both fighting for the money, the real stakes are much deeper. Though their climactic confrontation is terrifyingly violent, it is also tender. And the most disarming thing about ''Warrior'' is that, for all its mayhem, it is a movie about love.
''Warrior'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A lot of fighting.

HEADLINE: U.S. Exports Rise to Record as Trade Deficit Shrinks

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- American manufacturers sold more cars, airplanes and industrial machinery in foreign markets in July, sending exports to a record high and pushing the trade deficit down to its lowest level in three months, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. 
The trade deficit narrowed to $44.8 billion in July, down 13.1 percent from June, an improvement that reflected a 3.6 percent rise in exports to the record level of $178 billion. Imports dipped 0.2 percent to $126.9 billion as the bill for imported oil dropped 6 percent to $35.5 billion as crude oil prices fell.
The big jump in exports should provide critically needed support for growth at a time when the United States economy has been in danger of toppling into a recession.
Also Thursday, the Labor Department said the number of people seeking state unemployment benefits in the United States ticked up slightly last week, rising 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 414,000.
The report suggested that companies were not significantly increasing layoffs, despite weak economic growth. But it also signals that little hiring was taking place. Applications need to fall below 375,000 to indicate sustainable job growth, economists say. They have not been below that level since February.
The four-week average, a less volatile measure, increased for the third straight week to 414,750, the government said.
Overall, the American economy grew at a meager 0.7 percent in the first six months of this year, the slowest growth since the recession ended two years ago. Economists are hoping for a modest rebound in growth in the second half of the year, some of it coming from stronger export sales, like those in July.
A narrowing trade deficit adds to economic growth because it means more products are being produced in the United States and less money is flowing into the hands of foreign producers to buy imports.
The United States trade deficit through July was running at an annual rate of $565.3 billion, 13.1 percent higher than last year's imbalance of $500 billion.
For July, the American trade deficit with China rose 1.1 percent to $27 billion, the largest imbalance since September 2010. Through the first seven month of this year, the deficit with China is 10 percent higher than the same period in 2010, a year when the trade gap between the two nation's hit a record high. The Obama administration has been applying pressure to China to allow its currency to rise more quickly in value against the dollar as a way of increasing U.S. exports to China and lowering Chinese imports to this country.
The deficit with Japan jumped by 30 percent in July to $5.3 billion, reflecting a sharp rebound in imports from Japan as that country's factories resumed more normal production following the March 11 natural disasters. The curtailment of Japanese shipments to the United States restricted U.S. production in such areas as autos where American factories are dependent on getting component parts from Japan.
Oil imports declined because the volume of shipments fell along with the price. The average price of a barrel of imported crude oil dropped to $104.27 in July, down from $106 in June. Because oil prices have declined further since then, economists are expecting oil imports to continue to fall in coming months.

HEADLINE: Showcasing Sound in a New Space

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
MONTREAL -- When a major new orchestra hall is opened, welcoming speeches from public officials and board members are almost inevitable. So it was here on Wednesday night for the inaugural program of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra at its handsome new home: more than 30 minutes of speeches, including remarks from Jean Charest, the premier of Quebec, and a ceremonial ribbon cutting onstage, with four charming children holding the ribbon and the orchestra's popular music director, Kent Nagano, conducting the official cutters.
But some allowances were called for. This adventurous orchestra has wanted a new home for decades. Finally it has one, an inviting place of just 2,100 seats. The auditorium's warm interior has walls of overlapping curved panels and three tiers of balconies made from textured, light-brown Canadian beech wood.
It was not until Wednesday morning that the Quebec government announced the hall's official name: La Maison Symphonique de Montreal, which may not be original but does the job. The city is abuzz over this addition to Place des Arts, its cultural center. The new hall sits (on what had been an asphalt lot with underground parking) right next to its old home, the Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier, a multipurpose hall of nearly 3,000 seats that was considered too big and acoustically indistinct for the needs of an orchestra. 
Building a hall in these challenging economic times is a real achievement. Mr. Nagano, who became music director in 2006, is reaping much credit for his leadership in bringing the orchestra's dream to fulfillment. Sometimes a music director's artistic vision and personality just fit with a city and its orchestra. And the California-born Mr. Nagano, still youthful and trim at 59, seems to be a high-culture rock star here.
He has worked tirelessly to enhance the profile of the orchestra as a true Montreal institution. During a brief interview earlier on Wednesday Mr. Nagano said that in trying to galvanize support for a new hall, he went to the Chamber of Commerce before approaching the cultural ministry, arguing that Montreal was a ''star on the rise'' and that the orchestra already played a dynamic role in the city's resurgence.
His program for this inaugural concert reflected that vision. The major work was Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. But as Mr. Nagano said in the interview, he has tried to present the masterpieces of the repertory in a context that helps make clear how stunning they were when new and how relevant they remain. So he preceded the Beethoven with works by composers representing three generations of contemporary music in Quebec.
There was a short, hauntingly subdued and harmonically piercing work for soprano (Erin Wall) and chorus (the Montreal Symphony Chorus), ''Jesus, Erbarme Dich,'' by Claude Vivier, a visionary composer born in Montreal, who died at 34 in 1983 (murdered in his Paris apartment). The orchestra's principal flutist, Timothy Hutchins, played a meditative and quizzical solo work, ''Envol: Alleluia'' by Gilles Tremblay, now 79, a pioneer among avant-garde composers in Quebec. And there was the premiere of ''Qu'un Cri Eleve Nos Chants!'' (''Let a Great Cry Lift Up Our Songs!'') by the 36-year-old Quebec native Julien Bilodeau, an orchestral piece that skillfully (and puckishly) weaves bits of motifs and riffs from Beethoven's Ninth into a restless, pungently contemporary 10-minute score.
Between those works came readings of short poems written by Josephine Bacon, Yann Martel, Marie-Claire Blais and Wajdi Mouawad, variously inspired by Beethoven's turbulent Ninth Symphony, which concludes with the famous setting of Schiller's ''Ode to Joy.'' Though the poems were intriguing, including them seemed thematically heavy-handed. And hearing amplified spoken words in a program intended to showcase the acoustics of a new concert hall was a little jarring.
It is hard to assess the sound of any hall after hearing only one concert. I had reservations about this one, though the overall acoustics are resonant and clear. The design and construction project involved a complex public and private partnership. The chief architect was Jack Diamond of Diamond & Schmitt. Artec Consultants designed the acoustics, though Mr. Diamond also brought in a team from Sound Space Design, with which he has worked closely.
Artec has a reputation for designing halls with adjustable elements, like this one, with large panels suspended from the ceiling that can be lowered to create greater intimacy or raised to accommodate large orchestral forces. Many modern halls have big, bright acoustics. La Maison has mellowness and warmth: during the Vivier work Ms. Wall's angelic solo soprano lines penetrated the space easily.
But in the Beethoven I found the string sound, especially the violins, lacking in depth, richness and presence. The adjustable elements may need some adjusting. As the Beethoven progressed, the sound seemed fuller, especially, of course, during the finale when the robust Montreal Symphony Chorus entered. The excellent vocal soloists (Ms. Wall, the mezzo-soprano Mihoko Fujimura, the tenor Simon O'Neill and the bass Mikhail Petrenko) stood at the rear of the stage, just in front of the choristers, and their voices came through vividly. Maybe I started adjusting.
I had no reservations about the compelling performance. Mr. Nagano is a brilliant conductor of contemporary music. Yet two of the most interesting Beethoven performances I have heard in recent seasons were Mr. Nagano's Fifth Symphony with his Montreal players at Carnegie Hall in May, part of the Spring for Music festival, and this Ninth.
There was nothing hyped up or exaggerated about his approach. What engrossed me was his way of shaping phrases into cogent arcs and sections, and bringing out the music's narrative urgency. The playing of the orchestra, if not always flawless, was lithe, eloquent and exciting.
After the concert I joined the mostly young revelers who had gathered in a new park next to the hall, where a delayed video broadcast of the Ninth Symphony performance was shown. It was projected on the side wall of the building, with additional small screens offering close-ups of players. The sound system used big, blaring speakers. For outdoor music the new gold standard is the sound system in the park adjacent to the New World Center in Miami Beach, which opened in January.
Still, the park was packed, and the crowd loved it. The music was complemented by a troupe of acrobatic performers from the Quebec circus company Cirque Eloize who danced and tumbled to Beethoven, sometimes with goofy smoke effects. The audience seemed more riveted by the booming music and the images of the players, especially the continual close-ups of Mr. Nagano.
And for three days, through Saturday, La Maison will truly be a welcoming home for the city. The public is invited to hear free performances by diverse ensembles -- jazz and folk music groups, orchestras and choruses from every region of Quebec -- performing in various locations throughout the building.

HEADLINE: Vegetable Gardens Are Booming in a Fallow Economy

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WEST LIBERTY, Ky. -- As the economy continues to stagnate in towns and cities across the country, here in eastern Kentucky it is causing things to sprout.
Garden plots are dug into the green hills, laid out in fuller force than people have seen in years. People call them sturdy patches of protection in uncertain times.
''You see a lot more people turning up ground,'' said Wanda Hamilton, 61, a lifelong gardener who sells her surplus vegetables at the farmers' market in West Liberty, a small town in the Appalachian foothills. ''It's the economy. You just can't afford to shop at the store anymore.'' 
It is not just eastern Kentucky. Vegetable gardening has been on the rise across the country, according to Bruce Butterfield, research director at the National Gardening Association, driven by rising food prices and a growing contingent of health-conscious consumers. Garden-store retailers have reported increased sales over the past two years, he said, and many community gardens have waiting lists.
''Our sales have skyrocketed,'' said George Ball, chief executive of Burpee, one of the largest vegetable-seed retailers. The jump, he said, began around the time Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, when anxiety about money started to rise.
In urban areas, the words ''locally grown'' conjure images of affluent shoppers in pricey farmers' markets. But in rural America, consumers are opting for locally grown food -- from their own gardens and neighboring farmers -- largely because it is cheaper.
Rebecca Frazier, a teacher here, said she had cut her food bill in half by growing her own and preserving and by buying in bulk from local farmers. She recently paid $10 for 40 pounds of sweet potatoes, a fraction of the store price.
''I'm getting twice the food for a whole lot less money,'' she said.
Timothy Woods, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Kentucky who has studied the evolution of farmers' markets in the state, said more rural residents were selling surplus out of their gardens for supplemental income, a pattern that has helped double the number of farmers' markets in eastern Kentucky since 2004.
Those markets are geared to shoppers who want to buy in bulk at the lowest possible price in order to pickle, can, dry and freeze, Mr. Woods said -- unlike urban markets, where customers pay double rural prices and typically eat what they buy right away.
''You won't see certified organic products or any fancy marketing,'' he said of rural markets. ''It's a very different world.''
Ms. Hamilton began selling about 10 years ago when her garden produced more than she could handle. She knows she could charge more but doesn't, because her customers ''are struggling just like me.'' Nearly two-thirds of her sales are to elderly residents who are using government food vouchers.
Another motivation for bigger gardens: the financial uncertainty that comes with retirement.
Brenda Engle, 56, an apparel factory employee, and her husband, Leon, 64, a former telecommunications company employee who works at Wal-Mart, are trying to squeeze their budget down to the size of their future retirement check.
They grew a year's worth of beans. ''We want to be self-sufficient,'' said Ms. Engle, who has even started making her own laundry detergent.
Her garden is also therapy.
''When I'm in the garden,'' she said, ''the world is gone.''
Sarah G. Fannin, an agriculture educator who works with the University of Kentucky's cooperative extension service to take research to people in the county, said calls for gardening assistance had doubled in the past three years, many from young people. Gardening classes have been full, she said, as has a class on canning taught by a colleague.
At J. A. Oldfield & Son, a country store in the area, vegetable seed sales have doubled in recent seasons.
And eastern Kentucky has a keen interest in cooking. Mr. Woods said residents were more likely to watch food shows on television than people in the more affluent, western part of the state, citing a survey he conducted in 2009.
''Ten years ago, we hadn't really been thinking about where our food was coming from other than the drive-through or the grocery store,'' Ms. Fannin said. ''Now there's more concern.''
That is because -- at least in the opinion of Ms. Frazier, the teacher -- health has become a bigger issue for more people here, partly as a hedge against rising health care costs. She said she planted her garden in 2008 after her daughter started having health problems.
Gardening doesn't necessarily lead to better health, of course. But Bridget C. Booske, a senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, said Morgan County, where West Liberty is, seemed to be better off than its neighbors.
People in the county live longer, and fewer babies are born underweight, she said, citing County Health Rankings, a ranking of American counties, published this summer, that she helped compile. Better trauma care in the county would contribute but not entirely account for better rates, she said.
Still, the rates of obesity and diabetes remain high, and a significant improvement in health will be possible only when the joblessness and poverty here ease, locals said.
Ms. Fannin said vegetables could be part of this area's economic future. She has urged farmers to start growing sweet potatoes, a hardy crop in vogue in urban kitchens. Robert Bradley, a coal worker turned farmer, said he had been laughed at when he first planted them, but his crop turned out so well that other farmers want to try.
His ultimate insurance policy, however, is his own garden.
''When I go to my cellar and get my own green beans and potatoes, I know I won't go hungry,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Federal Judge Widens Suit Against Big Equity Firms

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
A federal judge has greatly expanded the scope of an antitrust lawsuit against the world's largest private equity firms, broadening the case to include some of the largest leveraged buyouts in history.
The four-year-old suit accuses 11 firms, including Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, of a huge, overarching conspiracy to rig the market for multibillion-dollar takeovers.
The litigation is a flashback to the heady period from 2005 to 2007 when some of the country's most well-known companies fell into private hands. Flush banks lent private equity firms billions of dollars to finance these deals. As the acquisitions grew ever larger, the biggest firms pooled their money and began buying companies together. 
At issue in the suit is whether the ''club deals'' in vogue last decade were an illegal attempt by private equity firms to collude and drive down the prices of the acquisitions they made jointly. The case was brought by former shareholders of the acquired companies, including a Detroit pension fund and a pair of doctors.
Late Wednesday, Judge Edward F. Harrington of Federal District Court in Massachusetts ruled that the plaintiffs could seek information about 10 additional deals, including the largest buyout ever: the $44 billion takeover of TXU by Goldman Sachs, K.K.R. and two other firms. Other transactions now subject to investigation by the plaintiffs include the acquisitions of Harrah's Entertainment, Univision, Clear Channel and Toys ''R'' Us.
Until now, the case was limited to 17 leveraged buyouts like SunGard Data Systems, purchased by seven private equity firms, and Freescale Semiconductor, which four different funds acquired.
With the additional transactions added to the lawsuit, the private equity firms will now be forced to turn over more internal documents and e-mails. Already, they have produced millions of pages of documents to the plaintiffs.
Lawyers defending the private equity firms have said that the case has no merit. In a court filing, the defendants called the lawsuit ''a far-fetched theory by doing nothing more than describing routine M.&A. activity, and labeling it anticompetitive.'' Indeed, there were bidding wars for many of the largest deals that actually drove up their purchase prices, they say.
The case, no matter how it turns out, has become an expensive and distracting one. The firms have collectively racked up more than $100 million in legal fees defending the suit, people briefed on the litigation said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the case.
The plaintiffs have deposed more than 30 of the country's most prominent private equity executives, including Glenn Hutchins, one of the two chief executives of Silver Lake, and Stephen Pagliuca, a senior executive at Bain Capital Partners.
To be deposed later this year are Stephen A. Schwarzman, the head of Blackstone Group; David Rubenstein, a co-founder of the Carlyle Group; and Leon Black, the chief executive of Apollo Global Management.
Much of the case has been cloaked in secrecy. The judge issued a broad protective order early in the case that has kept all of the evidence from public view. A recently filed amended complaint that is said to include embarrassing e-mail correspondence between private equity executives has been under seal.
The case harks back to the boom, a period that the plaintiffs call the ''conspiratorial era.'' In the suit, they portray a corrupt deal culture in which firms submitted sham bids and secretly allocated deals among themselves. The complaint cites a 2006 speech made by David Bonderman, a co-founder of TPG, in which he reportedly said, ''There's less competition for the biggest deals.''
As an example of possible collusion, the plaintiffs pointed to the $21.3 billion acquisition of the giant hospital operator HCA, which was led by Bain and K.K.R. No competing bid materialized, the lawsuit said, because of an understanding that if ''you don't bid on my deal, I won't bid on yours.''
The complaint also noted an academic study by three business school professors concluding that the premiums paid to shareholders for club deals were lower than those in takeovers involving one firm.
''The result is that private equity firms collectively capture multibillion-dollar corporations and take them private at artificially low prices,'' the lawsuit said.
The complaint was filed in 2007 after the Justice Department began investigating potential collusive behavior related to club deals. No actions were ever brought by the government.
Many of the largest deals of last decade's buyout boom have fared better than expected. During the depths of the financial crisis, Wall Street analysts predicted a wave of bankruptcy filings for companies as they struggled with a global recession and heavy debt load. But a recovery in the capital markets allowed many of these companies to shore up their balance sheets through debt refinancing and equity offerings. HCA, for example, has generated billions of dollars in profit for its owners.
Still, several of the biggest buyouts continue to suffer. Energy Future Holdings, the large Texas utility formerly named TXU, has been buffeted by persistently low natural gas prices. Clear Channel, the radio and outdoor advertising giant, has wrestled with a soft advertising market, although its performance has improved.
The type of club deals highlighted in the antitrust lawsuit are, for now, a thing of the past. As banks have tightened the reins on corporate loans, the size of deals has shrunk. Private equity firms have not teamed up on any of the 10 largest buyouts this year.

PERSON: Michael Hart 

HEADLINE: Michael Hart, a Pioneer Of E-Books, Dies at 64

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Michael Hart, who was widely credited with creating the first e-book when he typed the Declaration of Independence into a computer on July 4, 1971, and in so doing laid the foundations for Project Gutenberg, the oldest and largest digital library, was found dead on Tuesday at his home in Urbana, Ill. He was 64.
His death was confirmed by Gregory B. Newby, the chief executive and director of Project Gutenberg, who said that the cause had not yet been determined.
Mr. Hart found his life's mission when the University of Illinois, where he was a student, gave him a user's account on a Xerox Sigma V mainframe computer at the school's Materials Research Lab. 
Estimating that the computer time in his possession was worth $100 million, Mr. Hart began thinking of a project that might justify that figure. Data processing, the principal application of computers at the time, did not capture his imagination. Information sharing did.
After attending a July 4 fireworks display, he stopped in at a grocery store and received, with his purchase, a copy of the Declaration of Independence printed on parchment. He typed the text, intending to send it as an e-mail to the users of Arpanet, the government-sponsored precursor to today's Internet, but was dissuaded by a colleague who warned that the message would crash the system. Instead, he posted a notice that the text could be downloaded, and Project Gutenberg was born.
Its goal, formulated by Mr. Hart, was ''to encourage the creation and distribution of e-books'' and, by making books available to computer users at no cost, ''to help break down the bars of ignorance and illiteracy.''
Over the next decade, working alone, Mr. Hart typed the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the King James Bible and ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' into the project database, the first tentative steps in a revolution that would usher in what he liked to call the fifth information age, a world of e-books, hand-held electronic devices like the Nook and Kindle, and unprecedented individual access to texts on a vast array of Internet archives.
Today, Project Gutenberg lists more than 30,000 books in 60 languages, with the emphasis on titles of interest to the general reader in three categories: ''light literature,'' ''heavy literature'' and reference works. In a 2006 e-mail to the technology writer Glyn Moody, he predicted that there would be a billion e-books in 2021, Project Gutenberg's 50th anniversary, and that, thanks to advances in memory chips, ''you will be able to carry all billion e-books in one hand.''
Nearly all the books are in the public domain, although a relatively small number of copyrighted books are reproduced with the permission of the copyright owner. The library includes two books by Mr. Hart: ''A Brief History of the Internet'' and ''Poems and Tales from Romania.''
''It's a paradigm shift,'' he told Searcher magazine in 2002. ''It's the power of one person, alone in their basement, being able to type in their favorite books and give it to millions or billions of people. It just wasn't even remotely possible before; not even the Gideons can say they have given away a billion Bibles in the past year.''
Michael Stern Hart was born on March 8, 1947, in Tacoma, Wash. His father was an accountant; his mother, a cryptanalyst during World War II, was the business manager for a high-end women's store. The couple retrained to become university teachers and in 1958 found posts at the University of Illinois, in Urbana, where his father taught Shakespeare and his mother taught mathematics.
Michael began attending lectures at the university before entering high school and, following a course of individual study on human-machine interfaces, earned a bachelor of science degree in 1973.
Work on Project Gutenberg proceeded slowly at first. Adding perhaps a book a month, Mr. Hart had created only 313 e-books by 1997. ''I was just waiting for the world to realize I'd knocked it over,'' he told Searcher. ''You've heard of 'cow-tipping'? The cow had been tipped over, but it took it 17 years for it to wake up and say, 'Moo.' ''
The pace picked up when he and Mark Zinzow, a programmer at the University of Illinois, recruited volunteers through the school's PC User Group and set up mirror sites to provide multiple sources for the project.
Shrewdly, Mr. Hart included books like ''Zen and the Art of the Internet'' and ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Internet'' to expand the audience for the project's books.
Today, relying on the work of volunteers who scan and proofread without pay, the project adds to its list at the rate of hundreds of books each month.
Even in the project's early stages, Mr. Hart envisioned it in revolutionary terms. Borrowing a term from ''Star Trek,'' he referred to e-books as just one form of replicator technology that would, in the future, allow for the infinite reproduction of things as well as words, overturning all established power structures and ushering in an age of universal abundance.
One hurdle on the road to the diffusion of knowledge was the Copyright Term Extension Act, passed in 1998. The act, sponsored by the California congressman and former pop singer Sonny Bono, removed a million e-books from the public domain by extending the copyright by 20 years. Under United States law, the average copyright now lasts for 95.5 years.
Lawrence Lessig, then a law professor at Stanford University (and now at Harvard), approached Mr. Hart to see if he would be interested in taking part in a constitutional challenge to the law.
He met Mr. Hart in a pizza parlor in Urbana, where, Mr. Lessig recalled in a telephone conversation on Thursday, Mr. Hart added a thick layer of sugar to his pizza while explaining that he saw the case as much more than a test of copyright law. It offered, as he saw it, a way to challenge the entire social and economic system of the United States.
Mr. Lessig, looking for a somewhat less visionary lead plaintiff, eventually enlisted Eric Eldred, the owner of Eldritch Press, a Web site that reprints work in the public domain. In 2003, in Eldred v. Ashcroft, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the copyright extension act.
Mr. Hart is survived by his mother, Alice, of Fort Belvoir, Va., and a brother, Bennett, of Manassas, Va.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Friday about Michael Hart, who founded Project Gutenberg, the world's oldest and largest collection of e-books, misstated Mr. Hart's source for the term replicator, which he adopted to describe how e-books would allow for the infinite reproduction of books. It comes from the television show ''Star Trek,'' not the film ''Star Wars.''

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths SACKS, DR

 BODY:
SACKS--Dr. Herbert S, a clinical professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association, and an international medical consultant died on August 30, 2011 in New Haven, Connecticut. He was 84 years old. Dr. Sacks was a longtime leader of professional psychiatric organizations, first in Connecticut, and then nationally. In this capacity, his broad concern was how modern psychiatry is represented in society. His contributions to the understanding of such issues as patient advocacy and confidentiality have informed social policy. As president of the Connecticut Psychiatric Association, Dr. Sacks led a successful campaign to mandate group insurance coverage for outpatient psychiatric treatment, the first such state legislation in the country. 
In 1997, as the president of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), he spearheaded a national initiative for mental health parity in insurance coverage as part of a policy of universal access to mental health care, testifying before a Presidential advisory commission, collaborating with national legislators, and making the case against the "industrialization of American medicine", as capitated managed care threatened the survival of individualized psychotherapy by psychiatrists. As a member on the National Commission on the Confidentiality of Health Records, Dr. Sacks was a forceful proponent for the maintenance of confidentiality of medical records, both to protect the integrity of the physician-patient relationship, and to safeguard against discrimination based on public disclosures of treatment. He strongly supported the "Goldwater Rule" promulgated in the APA's Principles of Medical Ethics, barring psychiatrists from offering professional opinions regarding anyone they have not personally examined. This guidance developed after Barry Goldwater was subjected to public statements questioning his mental fitness for office by physicians who had not examined him, prior to the 1964 Presidential election. During the 1960's, Dr. Sacks consulted to the U.S. Peace Corps, preparing young volunteers for their service overseas and acclimation upon their return. An advocate for culturally sensitive health care development, he continued his work as an international health consultant, focusing on the psychological impact of population dislocations caused by natural disasters and water development projects. He undertook these efforts in association with numerous medical schools, development assistance organizations and the U. S. Agency for International Development. Dr. Sacks was an early advocate for the integration of traditional healing into structured public health programs, in conjunction with village leaders and traditional healers. Dr. Sacks remained active as a founding member of Yale School of Medicine's Committee on International Health for more than 40 years. He was enthusiastic about his service on the Downs Fellowship Committee, which awards international student travel grants to Yale medical, nursing and physician assistant students pursuing scientific research and cultural exchange in developing countries. He was also a consultant to the Yale Five Year B.A. Program, which encouraged undergraduates to take a year away from college to work in developing countries, when such interruptions of college careers were uncommon. Dr. Sacks had recently been elected to a term on the Board of the Association of Yale Alumni in Medicine. Amongst his publications, Dr. Sacks was most enthusiastic about his book, Hurdles: The Admissions Dilemma in American Higher Education, (Atheneum 1978), which continues to be relevant today. Dr. Sacks was born in New York City in 1926, the son of Rabbi Maxwell and Mrs. Anna Sacks. He grew up in Brooklyn and enlisted as an ensign in the U.S. Navy at 17, serving in the South Pacific. He was a graduate of Dickinson College, where he later became a member of the Board of Alumni Advisors, and a graduate of Cornell School of Medicine. Dr. Sacks trained in pediatrics and child psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine, and joined the faculty of the Yale Child Study Center more than 50 years ago. Up until the time of his death, he maintained a private practice in Westport, Connecticut. In 1948, Dr. Sacks married Helen Margery Levin. They enjoyed a 63 year marriage. Mrs. Sacks, who retired as an assistant clinical professor of social work at the Yale Child Study Center, was always her husband's chief advisor and critic. She co-founded and directed a psychiatric clinic for the assessment of serious offenders in New Haven Juvenile Court, and shared many research interests with her husband. Dr. Sacks enjoyed private family time on his farm in Southern Vermont, the company of good friends, the glorious music of the Marlboro Music Festival, eclectic Vermont hardware stores, and late nights reading scores of police procedural novels set in his favorite foreign locales. He is survived by his wife; four children, Eric and Douglas of New York City, Russell of Albuquerque, NM, and Kate of New Haven; and seven grandchildren. Memorial contributions may be made to Marlboro Music (http://www.marlboromusic.org) or to the Yale School of Public Health, Downs Fellowship (http://publichealth.yale.edu/giving/gift). A memorial service will be scheduled in the coming months

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Describes Consumers As Too Bleak

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, offered a new twist on a familiar subject Thursday, revisiting the question of why growth continues to fall short of hopes and expectations.
Mr. Bernanke, speaking at a luncheon in Minneapolis, offered the standard explanations, including the absence of home construction and the deep and lingering pain inflicted by financial crises. He warned again that reductions in government spending amount to reductions in short-term growth.
Then he said something new: Consumers are depressed beyond reason or expectation. 
Oh, sure, there are reasons to be depressed, and the Fed chairman rattled them off: ''The persistently high level of unemployment, slow gains in wages for those who remain employed, falling house prices, and debt burdens that remain high.''
However, Mr. Bernanke continued, ''Even taking into account the many financial pressures that they face, households seem exceptionally cautious.''
Consumers, in other words, are behaving as if the economy is even worse than it actually is.
Economic models based on historic patterns of unemployment, wages, debt and housing prices suggest that people should be spending more money. Instead, just as corporations are sitting on their money, households are holding back, too.
Why? Well, one possibility is that Americans collectively are suffering from what amounts to an economic version of post-traumatic stress disorder.
''People are on edge waiting for the other shoe to drop,'' John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, told the Seattle Rotary Club on Wednesday. ''In fact, the latest consumer sentiment readings are near the all-time lows recorded in late 2008 during the most terrifying moments of the financial crisis.''
Moreover, the national mood is souring. Although the economy has grown this year -- albeit slowly -- surveys of consumer confidence keep finding increasing pessimism about the future.
Mr. Williams noted a recent survey finding that 62 percent of households expected their income to stay the same or decline over the next year, the bleakest outlook in the last three decades.
''It's hard to have a robust recovery,'' he said, ''when Americans are so dispirited.''
There is a longstanding debate among economists about the importance of confidence. Research has found that consumers are not very good at predicting the future. Optimism often fails to correlate with growth; pessimism doesn't necessarily foreshadow a recession.
Still, it seems intuitive that a lack of confidence can drag on the economy. As pessimistic people pull back -- deciding that there is no point in looking for work; that this is not the year to go on vacation; that it may make sense to stop eating in restaurants -- the economy shrinks.
There is a natural instinct to address this problem by trying to cheer people up. Mr. Bernanke in recent speeches has been careful to note that he continues to think that the American economy has a bright future.
There is also the possibility, however, that the national mood is a more accurate reflection of the economic reality than any of the other, sunnier statistics.
''Confidence is mostly reflective of fundamentals,'' said Eric Sims, a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame. As a result, he said, the only way to cheer people up is to improve the condition of the economy. ''You've got to give people a reason to have confidence.''

HEADLINE: Setting Their Hair On Fire

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
First things first: I was favorably surprised by the new Obama jobs plan, which is significantly bolder and better than I expected. It's not nearly as bold as the plan I'd want in an ideal world. But if it actually became law, it would probably make a significant dent in unemployment.
Of course, it isn't likely to become law, thanks to G.O.P. opposition. Nor is anything else likely to happen that will do much to help the 14 million Americans out of work. And that is both a tragedy and an outrage. 
Before I get to the Obama plan, let me talk about the other important economic speech of the week, which was given by Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve of Chicago. Mr. Evans said, forthrightly, what some of us have been hoping to hear from Fed officials for years now.
As Mr. Evans pointed out, the Fed, both as a matter of law and as a matter of social responsibility, should try to keep both inflation and unemployment low -- and while inflation seems likely to stay near or below the Fed's target of around 2 percent, unemployment remains extremely high.
So how should the Fed be reacting? Mr. Evans: ''Imagine that inflation was running at 5 percent against our inflation objective of 2 percent. Is there a doubt that any central banker worth their salt would be reacting strongly to fight this high inflation rate? No, there isn't any doubt. They would be acting as if their hair was on fire. We should be similarly energized about improving conditions in the labor market.''
But the Fed's hair is manifestly not on fire, nor do most politicians seem to see any urgency about the situation. These days, the best -- or at any rate the alleged wise men and women who are supposed to be looking after the nation's welfare -- lack all conviction, while the worst, as represented by much of the G.O.P., are filled with a passionate intensity. So the unemployed are being abandoned.
O.K., about the Obama plan: It calls for about $200 billion in new spending -- much of it on things we need in any case, like school repair, transportation networks, and avoiding teacher layoffs -- and $240 billion in tax cuts. That may sound like a lot, but it actually isn't. The lingering effects of the housing bust and the overhang of household debt from the bubble years are creating a roughly $1 trillion per year hole in the U.S. economy, and this plan -- which wouldn't deliver all its benefits in the first year -- would fill only part of that hole. And it's unclear, in particular, how effective the tax cuts would be at boosting spending.
Still, the plan would be a lot better than nothing, and some of its measures, which are specifically aimed at providing incentives for hiring, might produce relatively a large employment bang for the buck. As I said, it's much bolder and better than I expected. President Obama's hair may not be on fire, but it's definitely smoking; clearly and gratifyingly, he does grasp how desperate the jobs situation is.
But his plan isn't likely to become law, thanks to Republican opposition. And it's worth noting just how much that opposition has hardened over time, even as the plight of the unemployed has worsened.
In early 2009, as the new Obama administration tried to come to grips with the crisis it inherited, you heard two main lines from critics on the right. First, they argued that we should rely on monetary policy rather than fiscal policy -- that is, that the job of fighting unemployment should be left to the Fed. Second, they argued that fiscal actions should take the form of tax cuts rather than temporary spending.
Now, however, leading Republicans are against tax cuts -- at least if they benefit working Americans rather than rich people and corporations.
And they're against monetary policy, too. In Wednesday night's Republican presidential debate, Mitt Romney declared that he would seek a replacement for Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, essentially because Mr. Bernanke has tried to do something (though not enough) about unemployment. And that makes Mr. Romney a moderate by G.O.P. standards, since Rick Perry, his main rival for the presidential nomination, has suggested that Mr. Bernanke should be treated ''pretty ugly.''
So, at this point, leading Republicans are basically against anything that might help the unemployed. Yes, Mr. Romney has issued a glossy, well-produced ''jobs plan,'' but it might best be described as 59 bullet points with nothing there -- and certainly nothing to justify his assertion, bordering on megalomania, that he would create no fewer than 11 million jobs in four years.
The good news in all this is that by going bigger and bolder than expected, Mr. Obama may finally have set the stage for a political debate about job creation. For, in the end, nothing will be done until the American people demand action.

HEADLINE: Obama Challenges Congress to 'Pass This Jobs Bill'

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mixing politically moderate proposals with a punchy tone, President Obama challenged lawmakers on Thursday to ''pass this jobs bill'' -- a blunt call on Congress to enact his $447 billion package of tax cuts and new government spending, designed to revive a stalling economy and his own political standing.
Speaking to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Obama ticked off a list of measures that he emphasized had been supported by both Republicans and Democrats in the past. To keep the proposals from adding to the swelling federal deficit, Mr. Obama also said he would encourage a more ambitious target for long-term reduction of the deficit.
''You should pass this jobs plan right away,'' the president declared over and over in his 32-minute speech, in which he eschewed his trademark soaring oratory in favor of a plainspoken appeal for action, stiffened by a few sarcastic political jabs. 
With Republicans listening politely but with stone-faced expressions, Mr. Obama said, ''The question is whether, in the face of an ongoing national crisis, we can stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy.''
Though Mr. Obama's proposals -- including an expansion of a cut in payroll taxes and new spending on public works -- were widely expected, the package was substantially larger than predicted, and much of the money would flow into the economic bloodstream in 2012. The pace would be similar to that of the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009, which was spread over more than two years. Analysts said that, if passed, the package would likely lift growth somewhat.
While Republicans did not often applaud Mr. Obama,, party leaders greeted his proposals with uncharacteristic conciliation. Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, and other Republicans signaled a willingness to consider at least some of the measures, reflecting what some have described as anger in their home districts over the political dysfunction in Washington.
''The proposals the president outlined tonight merit consideration,'' Speaker John A. Boehner said in a statement. ''We hope he gives serious consideration to our ideas as well.''
Still, analysts said it was unlikely that the White House would win Congressional approval for many elements of the package.
For Mr. Obama, burdened by the lowest approval ratings of his presidency, the address crystallized the multiple challenges he faces, among them reviving a torpid economy with a Republican House that, however receptive some of its leaders appeared Thursday, has staked out a relentlessly confrontational course with the White House. The president must also shake off a perception, after so many speeches on the economy, that he has not delivered on the promise of his oratory.
After weeks on the defensive, however, Mr. Obama seemed to get off his back foot. He framed the debate over the economy as a tug-of-war between mainstream American values and a radical, antigovernment orthodoxy that holds that ''the only thing we can do restore prosperity is just dismantle government, refund everyone's money, let everyone write their own rules, and tell everyone they're on their own.''
With a difficult re-election bid looming, Mr. Obama declared that his vision would appeal to more voters. ''These are real choices we have to make,'' he said. ''And I'm pretty sure I know what most Americans would choose. It's not even close.''
At times, he edged into sarcasm. Promoting the extension in the payroll tax cut to Republicans, Mr. Obama said: ''I know some of you have sworn oaths never to raise any taxes on anyone for as long as you live. Now is not the time to carve out an exception and raise middle-class taxes, which is why you should pass this bill right away.''
The centerpiece of the bill, known as the American Jobs Act, is an extension and expansion of the cut in payroll taxes, worth $240 billion, under which the tax paid by employees would be cut in half through 2012. Smaller businesses would also get a cut in their payroll taxes, as well as a tax holiday for hiring new employees. The plan also provides $140 billion for modernizing schools and repairing roads and bridges -- spending that Mr. Obama portrayed as critical to maintaining America's competitiveness.
The president insisted that everything in the package would be paid for by raising the target for long-term spending cuts to be negotiated by a special Congressional committee. He did not go through the arithmetic, but said he would send a detailed proposal to Congress in a week. Senior White House officials said the amount of increased spending cuts would hinge on how much of the plan gets through Congress.
Mr. Obama said most of his proposals had support from both parties, a contention that Republican leaders rejected. ''There should be nothing controversial about this piece of legislation,'' he said. ''Everything in here is the kind of proposal that's been supported by Democrats and Republicans.''
After a summer consumed by bitter debate over how to reduce the debt and deficit, Mr. Obama kept his focus squarely on the need to create jobs. He acknowledged that the government's role in fixing the problem was limited, but rejected the Republican argument that Washington's major contribution would be to eliminate regulations.
''Ultimately, our recovery will be driven not by Washington, but by our businesses and our workers,'' he said. ''But we can help. We can make a difference. There are steps we can take right now to improve people's lives.''
Still, even if every one of the proposals were passed by Congress -- something that is extremely unlikely to happen -- the measures would not solve the economy's problems, forecasters say, though they would likely spur some growth.
And that encapsulates the quandary for Mr. Obama: so long as there is no evidence of improvement in the job market, his economic call to arms -- backed by a familiar list of proposed remedies -- may not resonate with an American public grown weary of stagnation and an unemployment rate stuck at 9.1 percent.
Even the scheduling of the speech set off a tempest when Mr. Boehner rejected Mr. Obama's request to address Congress on Wednesday, the night of a Republican presidential debate. At Mr. Boehner's request, the White House agreed to move the date to Thursday, which meant Mr. Obama had to wrap up his remarks before the New Orleans Saints and the Green Bay Packers kicked off the N.F.L. season. As Mr. Obama was entering the chamber, microphones caught him assuring a lawmaker that his speech would not interfere with the game.
In setting out his program, Mr. Obama was, in effect, daring Republicans not to pass measures that enjoy support among independent voters and business leaders. If the Republicans refuse to embrace at least some of the measures, administration officials said, Mr. Obama will take them directly to the American public, portraying Congress as do-nothing and obstructionist.
''Maybe some of you have decided that those differences are so great that we can only resolve them at the ballot box,'' Mr. Obama told the lawmakers. ''But know this: the next election is fourteen months away. And the people who sent us here -- the people who hired us to work for them -- they don't have the luxury of waiting fourteen months.''

HEADLINE: Fighting Backlog in Patents, Senate Approves Overhaul

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved a sweeping reform of the nation's patent laws on Thursday, sending to President Obama a bill that changes the system for determining priority for inventions at the patent office and provides more financing for an agency beset by application backlogs and outdated computer systems.
After rejecting proposed amendments to a bill approved by the House last June, the Senate voted 89 to 9 to pass the bill, completing an effort of at least six years to overhaul the patent office's operations and the procedures by which patents can be challenged. 
President Obama, who has made his support for the bill a central piece of his focus on promoting jobs, is expected to sign it into law soon.
''Improved patent quality will benefit businesses across the economic spectrum,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who was a primary sponsor of the bill. ''For years, low-quality patents have been a drain on our patent system, and in turn our economy, by undermining the value of what it means to hold a patent. Higher-quality patents will infuse greater certainty into the patent system, which will better incentivize investment in American businesses, create jobs and grow our economy.''
The bill, known as the America Invents Act, has not received universal acclaim. The bill changes the method for determining the priority of patent applications to a ''first to file'' system from the long-standing ''first to invent'' method.
Several groups representing small businesses, entrepreneurs and early-stage investors have said that change puts small companies, which usually account for the bulk of new jobs, and individuals at a disadvantage to large companies that employ fleets of patent lawyers.
''This bill is unequivocally a job killer,'' said Valerie S. Gaydos, a Baltimore-based investor in early-stage companies. ''It will create a rush to the patent office, with innovators seeking to file anything and everything. The applications will be less complete, less well written and it will create more of a backlog.''
David S. Kappos, the patent office director and under secretary of commerce for intellectual property, disagreed, saying that the first-to-invent system was flawed because it essentially granted an inventor the right to legally defend his contention that he came up with an idea first. By changing to a first-to-file system, which is used in nearly every other country around the world, priority is clearly established, he said.
Many large corporations -- like General Electric, Caterpillar and I.B.M. -- supported the bill, which opponents suggested was evidence that the bill favors behemoths at the expense of the little guy. They point out that Mr. Kappos worked at I.B.M. for 27 years before taking the patent office job.
One of the bill's main goals is to relieve the patent office's backlog of applications, which has grown considerably in recent years. It now takes, on average, two years to get a preliminary ruling on an application, and an additional year for final grant, the patent office says.
The Internet age has created a surge in applications: in 1997, 2.25 patents were pending for every one issued, but by 2008 the rate had nearly tripled, to 6.6 patents pending for every one issued, according to patent office statistics. A backlog of about 700,000 applications is made worse by computer systems that are out of date, Gary F. Locke, the secretary of commerce, has said.
Lawmakers are betting that the backlog will be helped by giving the patent office access to more money. The agency already pays its own way, generating revenue from fees for applications and maintenance of patents. Revenue has usually exceeded the amount appropriated to the patent office by Congress, and legislators have often used the excess money for unrelated projects.
The bill addresses that by setting up a reserve fund for the collection of any fees in excess of the annual appropriation. But the patent office has to return to Congress for specific authority when it wants to tap the reserve.
That provision was put in place by the House, which feared losing budgetary authority over the patent office. The Senate in March passed a bill that would have given the patent agency direct access to all of the money it raised through fees.
When the House bill was returned to the Senate, Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, tried to amend the bill to go back to the Senate financing version, but the amendment was killed Thursday.
Also defeated was an amendment that would have stripped a provision from the bill that clarifies a method of calculating the deadline for applications to extend a patent. Senator Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican who sponsored the amendment, said that the change was actually meant to benefit a single company and its law firm, which might have missed such a deadline in 2001.
A third amendment, by Senator Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat, also was defeated. The amendment would have created a transitional program for consideration of business method patents.
The bill also contains a provision for an eight-year period of postgrant review of patents already issued. The measure was specifically aimed at so-called business method patents, which provide protection for a unique method of performing a task. The measure was heavily favored by the banking industry, which has been beset by patent infringement suits over things like electronic imaging of paper checks. The bill also provides a new method for challenges to be made to patent applications before a patent is granted.

HEADLINE: A Candidate Reared in Politics, if Not a Natural on the Trail

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

 BODY:
David I. Weprin still remembers the moment he realized his family was just a little different from other families in Queens.
He was at the bar mitzvah of his older brother, Barry, when the rabbi grandly invoked the name of Abraham. But the Weprins, observant Jews, were so steeped in Democratic politics, David Weprin recalled, that his 4-year-old brother, Mark, began singing the campaign jingle of Abraham D. Beame, who was running for mayor. David Weprin had to explain to him that the rabbi was actually referring to the biblical figure.
''We didn't talk about Abraham the Patriarch at the dinner table -- we talked about Abraham the Democrat,'' recalled Mr. Weprin, the scion of a Queens political dynasty, who now occupies the same State Assembly seat once held by his father, Saul, and later by his brother Mark.
With his Inspector Clouseau mustache, self-effacing personality and liberal political views, Mr. Weprin, 55, seemed an inoffensive and dependable candidate for the Democratic Party to nominate to run for Congress after Representative Anthony D. Weiner quit over a scandal earlier this summer. 
Mr. Weprin, his aides note proudly, does not use Twitter. His brother Mark once said he did not campaign as ''Mr. Personality.''
The Ninth Congressional District in Brooklyn and Queens, which he is running to represent in a special election on Tuesday, is dominated by a middle-class, immigrant constituency that has long voted for Democrats.
But thanks to visceral disenchantment with Washington over a stagnating economy -- and to the sometimes gaffe-prone Weprin campaign -- what was expected to be a lopsided race between Mr. Weprin and his Republican opponent, Bob Turner, a retired television executive, has become a close and closely watched contest that is being seen by some as a referendum on President Obama.
Mr. Weprin, an Orthodox Jew, has faced an unlikely revolt among supporters within that religious community, including rabbis who refused to speak to him, because he supported legalizing same-sex marriage. He has also sustained a barrage of attacks by Mr. Turner, a Roman Catholic, who has tried to portray him as being insufficiently critical of Mr. Obama's stance on Israel.
This summer, Mr. Turner ran a provocative advertisement, featuring images of the World Trade Center in flames, that chastised Mr. Weprin for supporting the construction of an Islamic center and mosque in Lower Manhattan. (The ad failed to mention that he preferred a different location.)
Mr. Weprin said in an interview that he had been taken aback by the vociferousness of his opponent, who, he said, was appealing to the ''worst instincts in people.'' But he said he was confident that Mr. Turner's ''Tea Party-inspired'' actions would backfire.
As for his pro-Israel credentials, Mr. Weprin has in recent days adopted the posture of a Jewish Rambo, saying that he has not only visited Israel eight times, but also has come under rocket attack there twice, including while delivering bulletproof vests near the border with Lebanon in 2006.
With his decidedly unflashy demeanor, Mr. Weprin can sometimes be an awkward communicator. He seems more comfortable discussing policy -- his support for Social Security and for raising taxes on millionaires -- than communing with voters.
Longtime friends say his lack of outward charisma belies an abiding decency.
Former Gov. David A. Paterson, who is legally blind, recalled how when they studied together at Hofstra Law School in the late 1970s, Mr. Weprin volunteered to read legal tomes out loud to him for hours, several times a week, when most students were preoccupied with their own grades.
''He is not the guy you notice when you enter the room, but he has a big heart,'' Mr. Paterson said.
Mr. Weprin said he inherited a strong sense of civic duty from his father, who served in the State Assembly for 24 years and whose idea of a family outing was taking his sons out to paint over graffiti in their neighborhood, Holliswood, Queens. Mr. Weprin said his earliest political memory was of riding on a sound truck in 1962, campaigning for his father, who was running for a Democratic district leader position in Queens. He was 6.
His father's legacy still looms large. Mr. Weprin lives in the same leafy Queens neighborhood where he grew up, and every day when he drives his Honda Accord to his campaign headquarters, he drives along Saul Weprin Street.
His mother, Sylvia Weprin, a retired schoolteacher who emigrated to New York from Cuba, said that as the middle child, Mr. Weprin had to ''find his own way.'' She added, ''My elder son, Barry, is academically gifted, my younger son is outgoing and has political charisma, while David was the one who worked the hardest.''
While Mr. Turner has fashioned himself as a populist political neophyte, Mr. Weprin, a former investment banker, has had a long career in public service. He served as deputy superintendent of the State Banking Department under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, overseeing more than 3,000 financial institutions. He was chairman of the Finance Committee of the City Council from 2002 to 2009, and cites as points of pride the eight balanced budgets passed during that period, as well as his opposition to the temporary lifting of term limits.
Among his worst setbacks, he said, was finishing last in the 2009 Democratic primary for comptroller, which he attributed to a lack of support from the Democratic Party machine.
But political operatives who worked with him in that race said he had proved to be a sometimes temperamental candidate.
They said he would miss scheduled meetings with black and Latino groups, only to be discovered spending time with Orthodox Jewish constituents. While he was very skilled at raising money, they said he was also absent-minded.
Mr. Weprin roundly dismissed such criticism, saying he enjoyed mingling with voters; he has danced, however awkwardly, at gay pride parades and has visited mosques and Sikh temples.
John C. Liu, who beat him in the comptroller's race, said Mr. Weprin's struggle to connect with voters continued to haunt him. But he said the fact that he kept running for higher office showed admirable gumption.
Mr. Weprin's relative unease before voters was apparent on Tuesday at the Pomonok Senior Center in Flushing, Queens, where he appeared alongside Senator Charles E. Schumer before a feisty crowd of card-playing grandmothers.
While Mr. Schumer charmed the audience with tales of his own grandmother, Mr. Weprin described his background in a monotone before finally winning over the residents with a promise to safeguard Social Security.
''He doesn't smile much,'' said Arlene Kirschner, 72. ''But he's on the side of good, and at least he's trying.''
Hours later, in a live radio debate with Mr. Turner, Mr. Weprin more than held his own, grilling his opponent about his call to slash the federal budget by 35 percent.
When Mr. Turner, who has called for the elimination of the Education and Agriculture Departments, could not answer precisely how much of the federal budget went to the two departments, Mr. Weprin could barely contain his glee.
''It is less than 2 percent,'' he said. Then he smirked with the mischievous grin of a 9-year-old weaned on politics and Abraham the Democrat.

HEADLINE: Despite Talk of Taming Partisanship, a Show of It for President's Remarks

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It was, for a moment, Bizzaro World, with Republicans giving the president of the United States a standing ovation, while Democrats, in large part, remained firmly fixed in their seats as he expressed his desire for new trade agreements.
And it was a brief respite for Representative Eric Cantor, the Virginia Republican and majority leader. He had spent much of the day talking about the need for conciliation, but had, for the previous 20 minutes, become more and more agitated as the speech went on, furiously taking notes as President Obama ticked off a list of tax cuts and programs he claimed that Republicans had supported. 
For all the talk about the need to tame partisanship, both chambers of Congress put on a relatively full display of it Thursday night, with Democrats hooting and clapping at Mr. Obama's remarks about taxes, entitlement programs and teachers, and Republicans leading the charge when the talk turned to veterans and regulations.
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was first into the chamber, wearing a lavender tie, tan and bright white smile. He was followed by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, who was immediately set upon by a freshman Democrat, followed by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, who stood with his hands folded in front of him, pensive, speaking to few.
Unlike the State of the Union, when Democrats and Republicans sat together to show good will and cheer, members sat largely by party this time, as the room braced with anticipation for the speech. Oddly, former Representative David Wu of Oregon, a Democratic who resigned under the cloud of scandal before the August recess, sat with a young girl toward the back of the chamber, as others more or less avoided him.
Republicans were divided between those who criticized the president before he had uttered a word and those who reached with tentative hands toward an olive branch, citing the exhaustion of the American public with perpetual partisanship.
After the speech, Mr. Cantor said he liked some of the president's proposals, including one to provide tax relief to small businesses, and would try to ''peel off'' such elements and pass them separately.
However, Mr. Cantor criticized Mr. Obama for not specifying how he would pay for the new initiatives. He also complained that the president had offered his proposals on a ''take it or leave it'' basis, presumably referring to Mr. Obama's pledge to take his case ''to every corner of this country,'' beginning with Mr. Cantor's hometown, Richmond, on Friday.
Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, Democrat of Missouri and chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, hailed that part of the speech, saying it would ''energize the base'' of the Democratic Party and enhance the president's prospects for re-election.
Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, also had election plans in mind on Thursday, but with a different twist. Mr. Sessions sent a plan to all Republican House candidates, declaring the start of the 2012 campaign season and encouraging them to criticize the president often.
A handful of House and Senate Republicans decided the president's speech did not merit their attendance at all, even though Speaker John A. Boehner discouraged boycotts.
''I have encouraged my colleagues to come tonight and to listen to the president,'' Mr. Boehner told reporters. ''He is the president of the United States and I believe that all members ought to be here to do this. Doesn't mean they're going to.''
There were some notable guests on hand though, many of them corporate chief executives -- the presumed creators of jobs.
Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, invited Henry Juszkiewicz, the chief executive of the Gibson Guitar Corporation, to highlight the fact that two Gibson work sites had been raided by federal agents apparently in search of illegal, partly finished, wooden guitar fingerboard blanks from India. Since the visit, Mr. Juszkiewicz has become a walking, breathing, Republican talking point against excessive regulation.
The first lady, Michelle Obama, invited her own business people including Kenneth I. Chenault, the chairman of American Express.
The Republicans presented no official response to the president's speech, with Mr. Boehner suggesting that his party did not want to get in the way of the desire of many Americans to watch the first game of the N.F.L season rather than be ''forced to watch some politician they don't want to listen to.''
Mr. Reid had scheduled a post-speech vote on a Republican resolution to disapprove the increase to the debt limit. It failed on its first procedural vote, with 52 Democrats opposed. The inconvenient vote had an icing-on-the-cake quality for Mr. Reid, as it forced Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, to stay in Washington rather than flee to his home state to watch the Saints-Packers N.F.L. season opener, as he had said he would.

HEADLINE: After Debate Night, Pondering Election Night

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER; Nate Silver's 538 blog on election forecasts is available at nytimes.com/fivethirtyeight

 BODY:
I've developed a habit - it's probably a bad habit - of assigning letter grades to the Republican candidates based on my initial reaction to their performance in debates. After Wednesday night's debate in Simi Valley, I gave Rick Perry a B-minus, meaning an average performance. Meanwhile, I gave Mitt Romney, his primary rival for the Republican nomination, a higher grade of A-minus.
The grades are based on neither style nor substance per se, but instead mostly on strategy: how much each candidate did to improve his chances of winning the nomination. Newt Gingrich, for example, got in some good one-liners and seemed more poised than he had in past debates. But in deliberately avoiding contrasts between himself and the other candidates, he did little to give Republican voters a reason to pick him - something he needs to do, since he's standing at about 4 percent in the polls. 
As for Mr. Perry, I thought he had a very good opening sequence, surprising Mr. Romney by going on offense and critiquing his job creation record in Massachusetts - including a crowd-pleasing remark that compared Mr. Romney unfavorably with former Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis.
But he got weaker as the night went along. Some of Mr. Perry's odder moments - like his invocation of Galileo Galilei in response to a question about climate change - are liable to make for a funny segment on The Daily Show and then be forgotten about. What was more noteworthy was Mr. Perry's response to a question about Social Security, where he doubled-down on rhetoric from his book and characterized the program as a ''Ponzi scheme.''
This particular remark is not likely to sit exceptionally well even with Republicans, conservative though they may be. A CNN poll published last month found 57 percent of Republicans opposed to major changes in Social Security and Medicare.
Perhaps for the Republicans who will turn out in the primaries - who tend to be more conservative than Republicans as a whole - the numbers are closer to even, or a little bit in Mr. Perry's favor. I would argue that Mr. Perry's remarks were nevertheless unwise.
The reason is that this will play into concerns about his appeal to general election voters. (With good reason: some 62 percent of independents, and 69 percent of moderates, are opposed to reforms on the scale that Mr. Perry has advocated, according to the CNN poll.)
Electability does matter to primary voters. Historically, parties have rarely nominated the most ideologically extreme candidates in their field. Yes, George McGovern and Barry Goldwater won - but they have been more the exceptions than the rule as compared with a host of others (Howard Dean, Pat Robertson, Jesse Jackson, Pat Buchanan, Jerry Brown) who lost.
In fact, Mr. Perry's lead in the polls right now is based in part on perceptions that he is electable. The recent Washington Post / ABC News poll posed an interesting set of questions to Republican voters - asking them who they thought was closest to them on the issues, and who they thought was most able to defeat President Obama, in addition to their first overall choice.
Mr. Perry led the Republican field on each of the measures. But his lead was actually larger on the electability question: 30 percent of Republican voters said they thought he had the best chance of defeating Mr. Obama, versus 20 percent for Mr. Romney. By contrast, Mr. Perry held a smaller, 6-point lead over Mr. Romney on the question of his issue positioning.
This perception stands in contrast to the views of Republican elites, about 70 percent of whom think that Mr. Romney is the more electable nominee, according to a survey conducted by the National Journal.
It also stands in contrast to head-to-head polls matching Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney against Mr. Obama. Since Aug. 1, nine polling firms have tested both Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney against the president, and eight of them have found Mr. Romney doing a little stronger. On average, he has trailed Mr. Obama by just one point in these polls, versus a 5 percent deficit for Mr. Perry.
I wouldn't put too much emphasis on these head-to-head polls - but my research (which we'll be publishing in more detail in a separate article) suggests that the ideological positioning of the candidates does affect general election performance, even after accounting for factors like the performance of the economy and a president's approval ratings, and might plausibly make several percentage points worth of difference.
But back to the primaries: voters and parties are looking to calibrate these two objectives - picking a candidate who has a good shot at winning, and picking one who can be counted upon to advance their agenda. In a reasonably competitive field, failing either test will usually be disqualifying.
What Republican voters may perceive to be ''electable'' and what swing voters think may be two different things. Still, you can see that people like Ron Paul, Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin perform badly according to this test even among Republicans, according to the Washington Post poll, and it seems to be limiting their upside potential.
Mr. Perry has so far avoided this fate. But if perceptions about electability fade, so will his overall numbers. Regression analysis of the Washington Post poll suggests that Republicans are weighing these two factors - electability and issue positioning - about equally. If Mr. Romney, rather than Mr. Perry, led on the electability question, that could be enough to push him past Mr. Perry even if Mr. Perry is a little closer to Republican voters on the issues.
To be sure, it can be tricky to invoke concerns about your rival's electability. You may, in some cases, implicitly (or even explicitly) be abandoning goals that your party holds dear. Such criticism can run the risk of harming the opponent's brand should he win the nomination, and therefore may be met with limited tolerance from party elites. And such remarks can have an eat-your-spinach tone to them, reading better on paper than they sound in the room.
Mr. Perry's problems on Wednesday night, however, were of his own making: he was strong when engaging the other candidates, but weak on handling questions from the moderators. Unless he develops a stronger defense of his positions on Social Security, he will make Mr. Romney's job much easier.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: F.B.I. Raids Solar Firm That Got U.S. Loans

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD and MICHAEL KANELLOS

 BODY:
The F.B.I. on Thursday raided the office of a California solar company that borrowed $528 million from the federal government before filing for bankruptcy, as House Republicans announced that they would call two top Obama administration officials to testify about the case next week.
The federal agents, acting in a joint investigation with the inspector general of the Department of Energy, served search warrants on Solyndra, which announced last week that it was filing for bankruptcy protection. The search was part of an investigation into the loans Solyndra received from the Treasury Department that were guaranteed by the Department of Energy under a highly promoted federal stimulus program. 
''The F.B.I. is here,'' said David Miller, a Solyndra spokesman. ''We don't know the specifics. It is in connection with the loan guarantee, but other than that we don't know.''
The administration's handling of the loan guarantee program, which has already secured $18 billion in loans for energy projects, has come under increasing criticism from Congress.
Republican leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee said Thursday that they would call Jeffrey Zients, the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Jonathan Silver, the director of the Energy Department's loan office, to testify about the program next Wednesday. The panel also plans to ask two top executives of Solyndra to testify at the hearing.
Representative Cliff Stearns, a Florida Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and investigations, said that about $10 billion in additional loan guarantees could still be awarded before the program expired on Sept. 30. ''The last thing we can afford from the Obama administration are more of the same sloppy, poor investments in the final rush to get the cash out the door,'' he said in a statement.
Solyndra's approach has been controversial in the solar industry. Rather than conventional, flat solar modules, the company made tube-shaped modules that could harvest early morning light and evening sunsets for electricity. Its arrays were lighter and easier to install.
Critics have noted that Solyndra's modules cost far more than conventional modules. The Solyndra modules cost $2 a watt to produce, according to Shyam Mehta of GTM Research. Chinese crystalline solar module makers can produce conventional modules for $1.10 a watt, and the price continues to fall.
Some industry specialists say that the decision to offer Solyndra the loan guarantees may have looked better two years ago, when prices for cells were higher and the price of silicon, which is used in most cells but not in Solyndra's, was very high.
A likely area of inquiry by investigators, though, is a decision early this year by the Energy Department to allow Solyndra, which was in a cash-flow crisis, to borrow an additional $69 million from private investors that would be repaid before the government's loans if the company went bankrupt. Solyndra then drew down about $67 million more in government loans.
''This restructuring gave Solyndra and its workers the best possible chance to succeed in a very competitive marketplace and put the company in a better position to repay the loan,'' the department said on Thursday.
Venture capitalists and others had invested more than $1 billion in Solyndra. Last year President Obama toured Solyndra's factory in Fremont, Calif., and the company became a symbol of his push to promote ''green'' jobs.
Solyndra said it had sold more than $250 million worth of modules, but it has had product delays and management changes.
Last week, Solyndra shut its doors and laid off all of its 1,100 employees, a prelude to this week's formal bankruptcy filing.
Solyndra was a leading beneficiary of the Energy Department's programs to promote alternative energy, which were expanded as part of the 2009 economic stimulus legislation.
George Kaiser, an Oklahoma billionaire, is one of the largest investors in Solyndra through Argonaut Ventures and a family foundation, and he was also a donor to Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign. The company had begun preparing its federal loan application well before the election.
A buyer could emerge for all or part of the company.

HEADLINE: For Obama, a 'Moment' Speech at a Time of Great Obstacles to Change

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON; Reporting was contributed by Abby Goodnough, Ian Lovett, Dan Frosch, Robbie Brown, Emily S. Williams and Adrienne Hilbert.

 BODY:
Enshrined in the mythology of the American presidency, there is something called a moment speech, an address to the nation so forceful and eloquent that it changes the way the country feels about its leadership and even itself.
Long before Barack Obama took office, many of his supporters and even a few of his critics thought he would be the kind of president who could give those kinds of speeches. Ever since he took office there have been many wondering why these kinds of speeches have not been coming, and whether the president's hallmark reliance on calm, rational explanation needs more fire to galvanize the nation and persuade his adversaries. Thursday night's address to Congress on job creation, coming as the prospect of a double-dip recession looms, seemed to be another chance for an address that would do those things.
But a moment speech is less about the speech than it is about the moment. And as interviews with political historians and citizens around the country on Thursday made clear, Mr. Obama was approaching the lectern in a moment that offered more obstacles than opportunities for bringing about real change. 
Even in the strictest sense, the timing of the speech was inauspicious. After a partisan standoff over scheduling with the House speaker, Representative John A. Boehner, who asked the president to move his address from Wednesday night, the speech took place in a pre-prime-time slot shoved up against the start of the N.F.L. season.
But in more momentous ways, the president was facing serious disadvantages, some of his own making.
Speeches, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, are about context. Some of the most memorable and praised speeches -- by Mr. Obama after the shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, for example, or by President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks -- were delivered in moments of pronounced national grief or anxiety, when the country longed for a voice of reassurance.
Thursday's jobs speech, on the other hand, comes after a season of nasty partisanship, a time where the country's biggest threat seemed not to come from outside enemies or natural disasters but the inability of its own political leadership to get basic things done. The economy that the president is addressing is in crisis, but a crisis that has been excruciatingly prolonged, beaten out in a tiresome tempo of starts and stalls.
''The economy is a mess,'' said Becky Wallard, 71, a retired teacher in Atlanta. ''There's no speech that can hide that.''
Even Mr. Obama's defenders acknowledge that the political reality in Washington, with the committed opposition of a Republican Congress, makes the likelihood of bold action on the president's part very slim.
''At this point, his speeches haven't really been earth-shattering or made a major difference,'' said Lily Wolk, 59, who was sitting at a Starbucks in Los Angeles and who said she was hopeful nonetheless. ''I think that he's got his hands tied.''
Some political historians and polling experts suggested that this was not a problem particular to Mr. Obama and that anyone maintaining that the president has lost some special magic, or was choosing not to use it, is simply misreading history.
Despite the insta-polls insta-punditry that usually follow on a big speech, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that addresses like this do not have a major impact on public opinion over the short or long term. There has been little major polling movement after other speeches in Mr. Obama's presidency, including the State of the Union addresses and his speech on health care, and few think a speech on the economy would be an exception.
''It's just illusory to think that presidents can provide a narrative that can make unemployment sound acceptable,'' said George C. Edwards, a professor of political science at Texas A & M University and author of ''On Deaf Ears: The Limits of the Bully Pulpit.''
Professor Edwards pointed out further that the kind of people who have not made up their minds about the president or his policies are the kind of people who are least likely to watch speeches like this. These voters would be moved almost exclusively by tangible results.
In this sense, Mr. Obama's reputation as an orator could backfire among those who believe that his word-action ratio was askew, or that his famed professorial approach was unsuited to the dire times at hand.
''Supposedly the best way to convince Obama of anything is to say it's the consensus of experts,'' said David Morrell, 62, a library custodian in Atlanta who described himself as a dispirited Democrat, and who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008. ''Everything that has been disastrous in this country has had a ton of experts behind it.''
Mr. Morrell added, ''It doesn't seem to be in his nature to bring up anything other than superficialities.''
Jean Garber, 75, a retiree in Denver put it more succinctly: ''Too many speeches. Every time you turn around!''
Still, there are others, mainly supporters of the president, who believed that a strong voice of reassurance was more important than the policy details and that Mr. Obama was capable of delivering that reassurance.
''I think he recognizes that the country is so worried right now,'' said Jonathan Lee, a physician from Norwood, Mass. ''It's more a matter of saying, 'I recognize there is immense trouble.' ''
Dr. Lee said the would not change his opinion: he was a committed backer of the president. Anyway, he added, he was probably going to watch the Red Sox game instead.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall After Fed Speech Offers No New Measures

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks closed sharply lower on Thursday after Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, gave no indications of new stimulus measures to help the flagging economy in a keenly awaited speech.
Investors have been looking to Mr. Bernanke, who gave his outlook on the economy on Thursday, and other policy makers to address a host of concerns like slowing global growth and Europe's debt crisis.
A rise in jobless claims reported earlier in the day underscored the weakness in the economy, only hours before a scheduled speech by President Obama on a plan for creating jobs. 
''The Fed hasn't come out with more options or tools that the market wants or was expecting,'' said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, N.Y. ''The market was disappointed because this wasn't a game changer.''
Banks were the biggest decliners after gains on Wednesday. They have been some of the most turbulent companies in the volatility that has engulfed equity markets this summer. The KBW Bank Index fell nearly 3 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 119.05 points, or 1.04 percent, to 11,295.81. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 12.72 points, or 1.06 percent, to 1,185.90. The Nasdaq composite index lost 19.80 points, or 0.78 percent, to 2,529.14.
Among bank shares, JPMorgan Chase fell 3.8 percent to $33.51. Bank of America fell 3.7 percent to $7.20. The S.& P. 500 financial sector index lost 2.3 percent.
The current market conditions mean short-term views are dominating and company fundamentals are taking a back seat.
''All of a sudden everybody is a trader, now, nobody is an investor,'' said Samuel Ginzburg, a senior trader at First New York Securities. ''Everything is trading macro, everything is trading on psychology and everybody is staring at charts.''
Stocks of health insurers fell, including Aetna, which dropped 1.9 percent to $39.19. On Thursday, a federal appeals court overturned a lower court ruling that the federal government could not compel people to buy health insurance. The appeals court ruled that Virginia did not have standing to challenge the federal law. It did not rule on whether the mandate itself was constitutional.
Yahoo shares rose 6.1 percent to $14.44 after a top shareholder, Third Point, demanded that Yahoo overhaul its board.
Separately, the government said the United States trade deficit narrowed considerably in July, a positive sign for economic growth after a sluggish first half of the year.
The trade gap shrank 13.1 percent to $44.8 billion in July, Commerce Department data showed, compared with June's $51.6 billion deficit and forecasts around $51 billion.
The decline was the biggest month-to-month percentage drop in the trade deficit since February 2009.
''The trade numbers are probably sufficiently better than expected to cause some upward revision in the G.D.P. forecast,'' said Pierre Ellis, a senior economist at Decision Economics in New York.
Also on Thursday, the Labor Department said that applications for unemployment benefits rose to 414,000 in the week ending Sept. 3 from an upwardly revised 412,000 the previous week. Analysts forecast a dip to 405,000.
Excluding one week in early August, jobless claims have held above 400,000 since early April. The Labor Department said there was no discernible effect from recent storms on the national figures this week.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 19/32, to 101 11/32. The yield fell to 1.98 percent, from 2.04 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: A Bipartisan Move to Tackle Benefits Programs

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In a significant shift driven by bipartisan concern about the looming long-term debt, Republicans and Democrats are no longer fighting over whether to tackle the popular entitlement programs -- Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- but over how to do it.
In the presidential race, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, the Republican front-runner of the moment, took the debate over entitlements to a level never before seen from a major candidate, calling for the end of all three programs as currently structured. In his debate with Republican rivals Wednesday, he amplified his claims that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and a ''monstrous lie'' to younger Americans counting on the money for retirement. On Thursday, he circulated similar past criticisms from his chief rival, Mitt Romney, who defended Social Security in the debate.
At the same time, Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill expressed a willingness to wring savings from the long-untouchable programs during the first meeting of the special committee that is charged with recommending $1.5 trillion in deficit reductions over the decade. Then President Obama, in his address to a joint session of Congress on spurring job creation, reiterated his call for a plan reducing long-term debt with both changes in entitlement programs and taxes from the wealthy. 
It is far from clear whether the comments from Mr. Perry, a self-proclaimed provocateur, will speed or stall early moves between the White House and Congress to deal with the costly benefit programs at the heart of the debt problem. The parties' repositioning on the New Deal and Great Society pillars is leaving both sides on shaky ground, uncertain of where to stand.
To the chagrin of many in his party, this summer Mr. Obama proposed changes in Medicare and Social Security that once would have been unthinkable for a Democratic president during his unsuccessful talks with the House speaker, John A. Boehner, for a ''grand bargain'' on cutting deficits. In return for the Republicans' agreement to raise taxes after 2012 for the wealthy, Mr. Obama indicated that his party would support slowly increasing the eligibility age for Medicare to 67 from 65 and changing the formula for cost-of-living increases in Social Security to a less generous one that some economists consider more accurate.
Now Mr. Perry's comments could cause Congressional Democrats to dig in against changing the entitlement programs, sensing a political advantage in 2012 -- especially if Mr. Perry is the nominee.
For all of Mr. Perry's bravado, many Republicans are anxious about his stand on entitlement programs, Social Security especially, given their popularity and the disproportionate number of seniors who vote. Even his advisers tried to temper the remarks before Mr. Perry made plain he was standing his ground, and some Republican lawmakers on Thursday were distancing themselves from his remarks.
Many Congressional Republicans remain haunted by the experience of former President George W. Bush's futile effort in 2005 to partly privatize Social Security, which contributed to the party's loss of its House and Senate majorities the next year and convinced Congressional Democrats of the power of the issue.
More than half of Americans, 56 percent, would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who favored phasing out Social Security so that workers could invest their payroll taxes in the stock market, according to a nationwide poll in June by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News. That included 64 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of independents, whose swing votes decide elections, and even a 45 percent plurality of Republicans. Only one-third of Republicans said they would be more likely to vote for someone who espoused ending Social Security.
Until Mr. Perry's recent entry into the Republican contest, the debate over reining in the projected growth of the entitlement programs focused on the health programs, Medicare and Medicaid. Their projected costs, given the aging of the population and fast-rising medical expenses, are greater and growing faster than those for Social Security.
While House Republicans boasted in April of the boldness of their budget -- it would turn Medicare into a voucher program for private insurance and Medicaid into a reduced block grant to states -- they steered clear of changing Social Security.
Now they have a potential presidential standard-bearer who is taking on Social Security -- the so-called third rail of American politics -- with both hands.
The collapse of the budget negotiations between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner, with their tentative trade-off between savings from entitlement programs and new revenues, left many in both parties convinced that no significant debt-reduction bargain is likely before the 2012 elections. Unless Republicans accept higher taxes on the wealthy, and they swear they will not, Democrats will not support reductions in future entitlement benefits.
Yet both parties are feeling the pressure to act sooner. That reflects not only the seriousness of the nation's looming debt crisis as baby boomers age, but also the possibility later this year that just as in this summer's fight over raising the debt limit, the financial markets and the economy in general will be shaken by dysfunction in Washington if no plan can be mapped out by the new deficit-reduction committee and enacted by Congress.
The turn in both parties toward tackling the cost of the entitlement programs has been building. In 2010, Congressional Democrats approved about $500 billion in future savings from Medicare to help pay for the new health care law, though Republicans attacked them for it in last year's midterm elections. But the onset of the new deficit committee's work and Mr. Perry's scathing critique of social spending has added a new dimension.
At the first meeting of the House-Senate committee on deficit reduction, which is to make recommendations by Nov. 23 for a quick up-or-down vote in Congress, several Republicans said that entitlements were the main cause of annual deficits and should be the panel's focus.
''In order to succeed, I know this committee must be primarily about the business of saving and reforming social safety-net programs that are not only failing many beneficiaries, but going broke at the same time,'' said Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and co-chairman of the committee, which is evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats.
James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, a House Democratic leader on the panel, said that he was for ''smart and compassionate budget cuts'' and ''ending military adventurism,'' but that Congress must not shred Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits.
Separately, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, Sander M. Levin of Michigan, circulated a memo listing two dozen options that could squeeze more than $500 billion out of Medicare in the next 10 years. Aides to Mr. Levin said that he was not endorsing the ideas but helping other Democrats understand the sorts of actions that could be taken.

HEADLINE: Grist for Left and Right in Perry Immigration Record

BYLINE: By JULIAN AGUILAR and EMILY RAMSHAW. 
jaguilar@texastribune.org; eramshaw@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Ann Coulter, the conservative pundit, has called Gov. Rick Perry ''a little bit too much like George Bush'' on immigration -- and she does not mean it as a compliment. Tea Party loyalists have decried Mr. Perry's opposition to a border fence and Arizona-style enforcement laws. And Mitt Romney has taken not-so-veiled jabs at Mr. Perry, criticizing officials who provide ''incentives that promote illegal immigration.''
As Mr. Perry edges into front-runner status for the Republican presidential nomination, his opponents are trying to plant seeds of doubt about how tough the border state's governor has been on illegal immigration -- from his compassion for immigrant students to the tightrope he has walked between securing the border and protecting Texas' symbiotic relationship with Mexico.
Critics hope his track record, which some have generalized as tough on security and gentle on people, will be a complicating factor for the Republican faithful. 
''You can't even have an honest discussion about the economy without taking into consideration illegal immigration,'' said Katrina Pierson, a member of the Dallas Tea Party's steering committee. ''Governor Perry has not met the standards, for me, to be the president of the United States if he can't even address the real issues in Texas.''
The governor's campaign counters that a serious discussion about immigration reform cannot take place until the Mexican border is secure.
''The Obama administration has failed to do so, but as president, Governor Perry will deploy adequate resources, manpower and technology to get the job done,'' said Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perry.
Mr. Perry's first immigration-related move as governor was probably his most controversial. In 2001, he signed into law a bill making Texas the first state to grant in-state college tuition rates and financial aid to immigrant children, regardless of their legal status. In 2009, roughly 1 percent of Texas college students -- about 12,000 students -- benefited from the law.
Two years later, Mr. Perry joined forces with Vicente Fox, then the president of Mexico, to advocate for overhauling guest-worker laws. When the fiscal conservative commentator Lou Dobbs questioned him on immigration on CNN in 2003, Mr. Perry said that Texas had a ''close, complex'' relationship with Mexico, and that businesses relied on immigrants for affordable labor.
To that end, Mr. Perry has split with the platform of the Texas Republican Party, asserting that an Arizona-style immigration enforcement law -- in which the authorities are required to question people about their legal status -- is not a good fit for Texas.
''We have to understand why millions of people come here and why many more have died trying,'' Mr. Perry said in his 2007 inaugural address. ''It is for something as basic as the freedom to find a job and feed their families.''
Mr. Perry's compassion ends where he believes Texas' security concerns begin. He has never wavered in his desire to secure the 1,200-mile Texas-Mexico border with manpower, not ''preposterous'' fencing, or in his frustration with the federal government, which he believes has not adequately protected Texas from the drug violence raging across the Rio Grande.
In 2005, Mr. Perry announced a $10 million state program to increase border patrols and upgrade radio systems along the border. A year later, he unveiled plans to install hundreds of video cameras, creating a multimillion-dollar ''virtual'' wall that in its first four years proved overly ambitious, netting few arrests. Though Mr. Perry expressed support for improving guest-worker programs in 2003, when President George W. Bush pushed for it in 2005, the governor's frustration with the federal government kept him from supporting it.
Meanwhile, Mr. Perry has remained at war with the Obama administration over his request in 2010 for 1,000 National Guard troops along the border; he got 250. In August, he asked the federal government to reimburse Texas $350 million, the estimated cost of imprisoning illegal immigrants in state lockups.
The immigration debate has at times been a minefield for Mr. Perry, who has had to balance the ardently anti-immigration views of his base with the backing of his major donors, some of whom often rely on immigrant labor. And the governor's rhetoric -- and his tone -- has ebbed and flowed, coinciding with his re-election bids and a State Legislature that is growing ever redder.
In 2009, he endorsed legislation, which has since passed, requiring Texans to present a form of photo identification to vote, although some opponents said it singled out minority voters.
And this year, in the lead-up to his run for president, Mr. Perry deemed a measure to outlaw so-called sanctuary cities in Texas a legislative emergency. The bill would have stripped state financing for municipalities that barred local law enforcement from inquiring into the immigration status of individuals detained for any crime.
Though Mr. Perry tried to differentiate the bill from the strict Arizona law, the legislation ultimately died, largely because of an 11th-hour push from Republican businessmen -- some of the governor's financial backers -- who opposed it.
Despite his recent efforts, Mr. Perry has largely remained opposed to legislation backed by the most conservative lawmakers, including efforts to repeal the tuition law and measures that would end birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants.
This stance has been highly unpopular with the Tea Party. ''Governor Perry has been governor for 10 years,'' said JoAnn Fleming, the chairwoman of the Texas Tea Party Caucus Advisory Committee, ''and we've not had enough interior enforcement of immigration laws.''
But it has not won him many fans among progressives either, whose strategy is to keep the memory of sanctuary cities fresh in the minds of Hispanic voters until the 2012 general election.
''No candidate will be more effective at alienating Hispanic voters than Rick Perry,'' said Shannon Perez, the political coordinator in Texas for the Service Employees International Union.
And neither side particularly trusts the conservative business community. Last week, an e-mail surfaced from some of the Republican donors who urged Mr. Perry to back down on sanctuary cities, offering the governor's critics low-hanging fruit. In the message, Norman Adams, a co-founder of Texans for Sensible Immigration Policy, congratulated members for helping raise $205,000 for Mr. Perry's presidential campaign and said their efforts were the key to courting Hispanic voters.
For Mr. Perry, criticism from both sides of the political spectrum is hardly new. In past races for governor, former Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison accused him of being lax on immigration -- to no avail.
On the presidential trail, and as recently as the Republican presidential debate on Wednesday, Mr. Perry has taken heat from Mr. Romney, who, trailing Mr. Perry in several national polls, has made a point of reminding voters that as Massachusetts governor, he vetoed legislation that would have provided in-state tuition to illegal immigrants and strengthened the authority that state troopers have to enforce immigration laws.
Mr. Perry has said that young students should not be punished for their parents' decisions, that a border fence will do nothing but bolster the ''35-foot-ladder business, and that Arizona-style enforcement laws are not appropriate for Texas, a state that is 38 percent Hispanic.
But his latest talking points also include opposition to amnesty and to national legislation that would provide a path to legal residency for some children living in the country illegally.

HEADLINE: Lost in the Fog: The Republican candidates are offering no ideas on job creation, just ideological noise

 BODY:
As they debated at the Reagan library Wednesday night, the Republican presidential candidates seemed lost in a separate, frivolous galaxy from the sobering economic reality that President Obama was trying to confront. A public desperate for ideas about economic revival heard an astonishing argument about whether Social Security is a hoax, along with a fight about which states were more effective in luring low-wage jobs from other states. 
The Republican Party has already demonstrated its lack of interest in rebuilding the economy, preferring instead to use stagnation as a club to dismantle President Obama's agenda and damage his chances for re-election. Much of that was on display at the debate, where Representative Michele Bachmann wrongly insisted that health care reform was a principal reason for high unemployment. Other candidates blamed the minimum wage, or corporate taxes (widely evaded through loopholes) or unspecified ''federal regulations'' and bureaucrats.
If only the American entrepreneur could be free from a crushing burden of taxes and regulations, jobs would flow, bemoaned Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. He did not mention that federal income taxes are near a historic low and taxes on investment gains are even lower. He boasted of having ''created'' a million jobs in Texas in the last decade, leading to a ridiculous quarrel with two former governors, Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Jon Huntsman Jr. of Utah, over who had a better record of job creation.
Governors, of course, don't create private-sector jobs. Most often, they engage in race-to-the-bottom competitions to lure companies from one state to the other, or they take advantage of natural resources, location or climate. The job growth in Texas was largely the result of the oil and gas boom, increased American trade with Mexico and heavy federal spending. Many of those jobs are less than desirable: the state has one of the highest percentages of hourly workers who are paid the minimum wage and is dead last in health-insurance coverage.
Mr. Romney released his own prescription for growth this week, full of largely discredited ideas like cutting the taxes on capital gains and corporations, repealing health care reform and reducing regulations. But at least he stood up to defend Social Security from Mr. Perry's charge that the program is a ''monstrous lie'' and a Ponzi scheme. It is mind-boggling that the Republicans should be debating the value of Social Security as the economy teeters and millions worry about their retirement. But Mr. Perry isn't ashamed of his willful ignorance. As he said at the debate: ''I don't care what anyone says.''

HEADLINE: Focus on Social Security Taxes Reflects Plan's Modest Ambition

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The centerpiece of President Obama's job-creation plan, a proposal to further reduce Social Security taxes, is emblematic of a package of modest measures that some economists describe as helpful but not sufficient to lift the economy from its malaise.
In his speech on Thursday night, Mr. Obama asked Congress to cut the amount that workers must contribute toward Social Security benefits, extending an existing measure, and to reduce, for the first time, the matching payments that employers are required to make. 
The cuts, which would deprive the government of about $240 billion in revenues next year, are the largest items in the president's $447 billion job-creation plan, which includes payments to unemployed workers, incentives for companies that hire workers and increased federal spending on infrastructure. All of the measures will require the support of Congressional Republicans.
Cutting taxes is a time-honored strategy for stimulating growth. The formula is simple: Workers will spend more money when their paychecks grow, and companies will respond to that increased demand by hiring more workers, creating a cycle that increases the pace of growth.
Preliminary analyses of the White House plan estimate that the tax cuts could create more than 50,000 jobs a month, a significant boost considering that employment climbed by 35,000 jobs, on average, in each of the last three months. But even if Congress immediately agreed to pass the president's entire plan, the economy is likely to continue to struggle. Companies must increase payrolls by about 100,000 people every month to keep pace with population growth.
Still, Joel Prakken, senior managing director at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm, said that the benefits of creating more than half a million jobs next year should not be minimized. ''It's going to make the unemployment rate lower than it otherwise would be,'' he said.
The other elements of Mr. Obama's plan, however, highlight the challenges of doing more. Economists regard benefits for unemployed workers as among the most effective means of increasing growth because people without jobs tend to spend the money quickly. But Republicans generally oppose increased spending on social programs.
Infrastructure spending, by contrast, enjoys bipartisan support, but breaking ground on new projects can take a long time, delaying the impact on the economy.
The administration's focus on payroll tax cuts, which became more ambitious in the days leading up to the speech, is an exercise in the art of the possible. While economists regard other kinds of measures as potentially more effective, the cuts would put money directly in the hands of consumers, and Republican leaders have indicated they are willing to consider the proposal.
Seeking to exploit that potential opening, the White House decided to considerably expand the scope of the cuts in the latter stages of planning.
The Social Security tax is paid in equal shares by workers and their employers. Both pay 6.2 percent of a worker's annual income up to $106,800. The president's plan would reduce the amount that workers pay by half, a savings of $1,500 for an employee who makes $50,000.
The current tax cut, set to expire in December, has reduced the tax to a rate of 4.2 percent. The new proposal would further reduce it to 3.1 percent in 2012.
In the present climate, however, there are significant reasons to doubt that consumers are honoring the predictions of economic models by taking that money and racing out to spend it.
Families are devoting a larger share of income to paying debts, which is important for the economy's long-term health but does nothing to stimulate growth. Concern about future earnings also is weighing on many households, reducing their willingness to spend. A recent study found that 62 percent of households expect their income to stay the same or decline over the next year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the lowest level of confidence in 30 years.
''One striking aspect of the recovery is the unusual weakness in household spending,'' the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Thursday in Minneapolis.
There is also broad disagreement among economists about the president's companion proposal to give companies a tax break, too.
The plan is divided in two parts. The amount employers must pay also would be reduced by half on payrolls up to $5 million, a condition that the White House said would focus the benefits on small businesses. And the plan would waive all payroll taxes on increased spending on salaries -- either for new hires or raises -- up to the first $50 million in increased wages.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that a tax cut for employers would have a greater impact than a tax cut for workers. The nonpartisan office reported that every dollar in reduced taxes on employers would generate up to $1.20 in economic activity, while every dollar in reduced taxes on workers would generate up to 90 cents because workers tend to save a portion of their additional income.
Some independent economists, however, doubt that the tax cut will persuade companies to make significant hires because the primary issue remains a lack of demand. If a company cannot sell more sofas, it does not need more workers to make them, whether the cost of each new worker is $106,200, including employer payroll taxes, or only $100,000, if the tax cut is enacted. As a result, they argue, companies are even more likely than consumers to refrain from spending the money.
Mark Thoma, a University of Oregon economist, said that company tax cuts should be tied to hiring: ''If they don't spend the money on employees, you don't get a demand-side effect.''
Studies of similar tax cuts in other countries suggest the truth lies in between. A 2008 study by the Government Institute for Economic Research in Finland, for example, found that companies shared about half the money from a payroll tax cut with workers in the form of higher wages.
The study also found, however, that there were ''no significant effects on employment.''
Cutting payroll taxes does not affect the government's obligation to pay benefits to older Americans. Indeed, the White House plan specifies that amounts not paid by workers and companies must be paid to Social Security from other sources of government revenue.
But some advocates, noting that temporary tax cuts have a history of becoming permanent, worry that reducing direct Social Security revenues could undermine political support for the program by making it seem more like a form of welfare.
The Social Security tax ''creates a stake for every American working person in the system,'' said Nancy Altman, co-director of the Social Security Works coalition. ''If you start meddling with that you start to pull apart the political contract.''

HEADLINE: The Jobs Speech: An aggressive president, at last, challenges the defeat-everything Congress

 BODY:
With more than 14 million people out of work and all Americans fearing a double-dip recession, President Obama stood face to face Thursday night with a Congress that has perversely resisted lifting a finger to help. Some Republicans refused to even sit and listen. But those Americans who did heard him unveil an ambitious proposal -- more robust and far-reaching than expected -- that may be the first crucial step in reigniting the economy.
Perhaps as important, they heard a president who was lately passive but now newly energized, who passionately contrasted his vision of a government that plays its part in tough times with the Republicans' vision of a government starved of the means to do so. 
The president's program was only a start, and it was vague on several important elements, notably a direct path to mortgage relief for troubled borrowers. And some of the tax cuts for employers may prove ineffective. Nonetheless, at $447 billion, the plan is large enough to potentially lower the unemployment rate and broad enough to be a significant stimulus.
As Mr. Obama pointed out, virtually every proposal on his agenda has been accepted over the years by Democrats and an earlier generation of Republicans that was not reflexively opposed to a recession-fighting fiscal policy. This generation is different, and the president's challenge to purely partisan resistance was forceful and clear.
''The question is whether, in the face of an ongoing national crisis, we can stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy,'' he said.
Though he went on too long, he was authoritative in demanding that Congress pass his plan quickly and in laying out its benefits for average Americans. He directly, even mockingly, challenged the increasingly nihilistic Republican view that government's very presence is noxious. Just as Lincoln helped start the transcontinental railroad and land-grant colleges, he said, the two parties must together push the country past its economic crisis. Waiting for the next election will waste valuable time, he said.
''The people who sent us here -- the people who hired us to work for them -- they don't have the luxury of waiting 14 months,'' he said. ''Some of them are living week to week, paycheck to paycheck, even day to day. They need help, and they need it now.''
At the core of his plan are two cuts in the payroll tax -- one for employers and one for employees -- that have long been embraced by Republicans. The employee cut would reduce the tax to 3.1 percent of income instead of the 4.2 percent negotiated last year. (It was 6.2 percent originally.) Although it could have been better targeted to low- and middle-income families, it will put money in people's pockets quickly and increase consumer demand.
For employers, the plan would halve the payroll tax for most small and medium-size businesses and would provide an incentive for hiring by temporarily removing the tax for new employees (and on raises for existing ones). Companies would also get a $4,000 tax credit for hiring anyone out of work for more than six months. Unemployment insurance would be extended for five million people. Though Mr. Obama said more Americans would be able to refinance their homes at low interest rates, he did not say how.
The plan would provide $35 billion in state aid to prevent up to 280,000 teacher layoffs while hiring tens of thousands more, along with additional police officers and firefighters. It would create jobs to modernize 35,000 schools across the country. And it would accelerate $50 billion in improvements for highways, railroads, transit and aviation.
Though the plan would be paid for by more deficit reduction, he left those vital details until later. It was gratifying to hear him call for higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, but his warning of cuts to Medicare and Medicaid -- lifelines to the most vulnerable -- raised concerns about trading one important program for another.
We hope Mr. Obama keeps his promise to take his proposals all over the country. The need to act is urgent.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Study Quantifies the Pain of Commuting

BYLINE: CHERYL JENSEN


HIGHLIGHT: A survey by the company ranked cities worldwide according to respondents' levels of displeasure with their commutes.

 BODY:
I.B.M. knows your pain. Not the pain of the frustrated desktop user or the stymied motherboard programmer, but of the commuter.
And there is plenty of pain to go around in cities from New York to Nairobi, according to I.B.M.'s fourth annual Global Commuter Pain survey, which looks at the connection between traffic congestion and commuters' emotional response to it in some of the world's largest cities on six continents.
The survey, which began in 2008 and surveyed only residents of cities in the United States, has been expanded worldwide. This year's survey is based on responses from 8,042 commuters in 20 cities. IBM compiled the results of that survey into an index of commuter pain to score and rank the emotional and economic toll of commuting in each city, with the highest-ranking number representing the worst.
The index suggests a big disparity in the pain of the daily commute, with Mexico City, at a score of 108, outranking all other cities surveyed and Montreal, at 21, reporting the lowest level.
Cities near the top included Beijing with 95, Nairobi with 88 and Moscow with a score of 65. New York came in relatively low, with a score of 28.
The pain index accounts for 10 issues that lend themselves to easy quantification, like commuting time and the amount of time a commuter is stuck in traffic. There were slipperier parameters, too, such as whether the respondent agreed that the price of gas was too high; that traffic was worse than it was last year; and that driving caused stress and anger.
The study's authors also observed an important disconnect: Despite big increases in the percentages of commuters who said traffic had improved either "somewhat" or "substantially" in the past three years, drivers in 12 of the 15 cities surveyed in both 2010 and 2011 complained substantially more than they did in previous years about the stress and frustration that accompanied their daily commute.
In New York, 45 percent of drivers this year said that traffic increased their stress, compared with 13 percent in 2010. In Los Angeles, it was 44 percent in 2011 versus 21 percent in 2010; in London, it was 33 percent in 2011 versus 19 percent in 2010; and in Johannesburg, it was 52 percent in 2011 versus 30 percent in 2010.
"Substantial" increases in anger over traffic were tallied in several cities, including New York (35 percent in 2011 versus 14 percent in 2010), Los Angeles (29 percent in 2011 versus 14 percent in 2010) and Toronto (29 percent in 2011 versus 14 percent in 2010).
Among other findings, 41 percent of commuters globally said that improved public transportation would reduce stress. If traffic did not occupy so much time, 56 percent of respondents said they would spend more time with family and friends, 48 percent would exercise more and 29 percent would sleep more.

HEADLINE: A Jobs Program in Need of Reform

BYLINE: JUDITH SCOTT-CLAYTON


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Work-Study Program does not ensure that the neediest college students and colleges get their fair share, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Readers following recent proposals to stimulate employment may be surprised to learn that one of the largest and longest-running federal programs providing direct employer subsidies to hire disadvantaged workers is run by the Department of Education. 
The Federal Work-Study Program, created in 1964, provides more than $1 billion in wage subsidies to institutions and reaches more than 750,000 college students each year. For students who are financially eligible, the program covers up to 75 percent of wages for 10 to 15 weekly hours of on-campus employment or, in some cases, for community service work off campus. The college covers the rest. 
The federal government spends only about half as much on the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which subsidizes 25 to 40 percent of wages when employers hire workers in one of nine target groups.
The longevity of the work-study program program reflects its popularity, and, to some extent, romanticized public conceptions of the student "working his way through college" (see, for example, this 1907 article from The New York Times Magazine). Surveys suggest that students like the program. And it's obvious why work-study is beloved by institutions: it provides a highly discounted labor pool.

But popularity aside, the equity and efficiency of the program are questionable at best.
Unlike Pell Grants or student loans (and also unlike other wage-subsidy programs like the Work Opportunity Tax Credit), work-study dollars aren't really distributed on the basis of need. The eligibility criteria are loose enough that far more students qualify for work-study than can receive it, and colleges can choose from among eligible students however they want. 
Fewer than half of undergraduate work-study recipients are needy enough to qualify for a Pell Grant, and 20 percent come from families earning more than $100,000 a year (see chart).
Moreover, the way work-study funds are allocated to individual institutions has virtually no connection to the neediness of its student body. The precise formula is incredibly arcane, but the first five words capture the essence: "Allocation based on previous allocation." The highest per-student allocations go to already advantaged institutions that had access to savvy grant-proposal writers when initial allocations were determined by review boards in the late 1960s (see this report for the program history). 
The inequity is extreme: Columbia University receives more than five times as much in work-study allocations as Florida State University, although Florida State has more than five times as many undergraduates, a much higher proportion of whom qualify for Pell Grants. 
The chart below shows the ratio of work-study allocations to aggregate Pell Grants awarded (a summary measure of the neediness of the student population) for selected institutions. The ratios for elite schools like Columbia and Harvard have been even higher in previous years.
More fundamentally, it's not clear that the program works very well either as a jobs program or a financial aid program. While work-study jobs may help improve students' work ethic, they are typically low-skill clerical or service positions unrelated to students' studies or future career plans. In other words, they are the type of jobs most students would be able to find even without a work-study subsidy.
Finally, in comparison with the large body of rigorous research on other types of financial aid, the evidence regarding the academic benefits of work-study assistance is thin. While some correlational studies have found a positive relationship between on-campus employment and academic outcomes, one particularly rigorous quasi-experimental study found large negative effects of student employment on grade point averages.
My own research-in-progress indicates strong negative effects for women, but some positive effects for men - perhaps explained by gender differences in job types or in what students would be doing if they weren't working.
Now is not the time to reduce federal investments in financial aid and jobs programs. The work-study program could be reformed to better target truly needy students, to provide more substantive job options or even to give students the option of taking the value of their wage subsidy as a grant instead.
But in its current form, federal work-study may better serve the interests of privileged institutions than those of needy students.

HEADLINE: Is Dodd-Frank the Original 'Jobs Bill'?

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Some regulators, including Bart Chilton of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, argue that a regulatory shake-up would spawn a wave of hiring on Wall Street and in Washington.

 BODY:
It's a familiar cry from Wall Street executives and Congressional Republicans: New regulations will dampen profits and crimp an already-feeble job market. 
But some federal regulators, now charged with writing dozens of new rules for Wall Street, beg to differ. Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, argues that a regulatory shake-up would actually spawn a wave of hiring on Wall Street and in Washington. 
"The possibilities for economic growth and competition here are mind-boggling," Mr. Chilton said on Friday during a speech at the University of Maryland. 
The debate centers on the controversial Dodd-Frank Act, which overhauled financial regulations after Wall Street nearly collapsed during the financial crisis. The law, among other things, transformed the $600 trillion derivatives markets, a lightly regulated industry at the center of the mess. 
With President Obama's $447 billion job bill facing an uncertain future, could Dodd-Frank be the next best thing? After all, the nation's biggest banks and financial firms are hiring a steady stream of lawyers, compliance experts and technology gurus to gear up for the new regulatory regime. As The New York Times reported on Friday, some are calling the growth industry "Dodd-Frank Inc."
"This is the full employment act for derivatives lawyers," said Richard McVey, chief executive of MarketAxess, a derivatives trading platform well-positioned to capitalize on Dodd-Frank. 
Under the law, the bulk of derivatives contracts must be traded on regulated exchanges or trading platforms like MarketAxess. At the commodity commission, Mr. Chilton and other regulators are writing more than 50 new rules to usher in the new requirements. 
"I have no doubt that these new regulations, instituting new types of clearing, trading and reporting platforms, will foster a landslide of hiring in the financial sector," Mr. Chilton said. 
In particular, Mr. Chilton forecast growing demand for technology experts. "All of this new trading activity, with new regulatory oversight requirements, will mean the development of new technologies, both in the private and public sectors," he said.
On the other hand, many banks are scrambling to slash headcount in recent weeks, owed in part to Dodd-Frank's constraints on debit card fees and other major revenue generators. Bank of America, in the midst of cutting 7,000 jobs this year, ultimately plans to shed around 10 percent of its roughly 290,000 person workforce.

 BODY:
Settlement Said to Be Near for Fannie and Freddie | A proposed agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission would end an investigation into whether Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac adequately disclosed their exposure to risky subprime loans. 
The proposed agreement, under the terms being discussed, would include no monetary penalty or admission of fraud, according to several people briefed on the case. Still, a settlement would represent the most significant acknowledgement yet by the mortgage finance companies that they played a central role in the housing boom and bust.
The potential accord comes at an awkward time for both firms. Should Fannie and Freddie sound a note of contrition for their own role in the implosion of the mortgage market, it could complicate a separate but similar lawsuit playing out in Washington. Last week, the government overseer of the two companies sued 17 large financial firms, blaming them for luring Fannie and Freddie into buying troubled loans.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Turner Strong Against Weprin in Race to Replace Weiner

BYLINE: THOMAS KAPLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican, Bob Turner, is leading his Democratic opponent, David I. Weprin, by six points with just a few days to go, according to a Siena poll released Friday.

 BODY:
The Republican candidate is in a strong position heading into Tuesday's special election in the heavily Democratic Congressional district formerly represented by Anthony D. Weiner, according to a new poll released on Friday.
Fifty percent of likely voters in New York's Ninth Congressional District supported the Republican, Bob Turner, compared with 44 percent who supported his Democratic opponent, Assemblyman David I. Weprin, according to the poll (pdf), conducted from Tuesday to Thursday by the Siena Research Institute.
The gap between Mr. Turner and Mr. Weprin lies within the margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. But the poll, which was conducted by telephone of 886 likely voters, suggests that Mr. Turner, who sought to frame the race as a referendum on President Obama, has managed to turn what was expected to be a coronation for Mr. Weprin into a highly competitive contest. 
The Ninth Congressional District, which includes portions of Brooklyn and Queens, has three registered Democrats for every one registered Republican. Last year, Mr. Weiner, a Democrat, defeated Mr. Turner by nearly 22 percentage points. But the poll found considerable disenchantment among likely voters: 74 percent said the country was headed in the wrong direction, and only 43 percent had a favorable impression of Mr. Obama, compared with 54 percent who viewed the president unfavorably.
"This race is going down to the wire," said Steven A. Greenberg, a Siena pollster. "While Turner leads and has momentum on his side, this is still a heavily Democratic district, and in a low-turnout special election, the campaigns' get-out-the-vote operations are going to be key."
A previous Siena poll, conducted in early August, showed Mr. Weprin with the support of 48 percent of likely voters, compared with 42 percent for Mr. Turner.
Advisers to both campaigns have suggested that the race has tightened since then, thanks to several gaffes by Mr. Weprin and fiery campaigning by Mr. Turner, a retired cable television executive, who has described himself as an ordinary businessman who was fed up with Washington's financial stewardship.
Mr. Turner's campaign said in a statement after the poll was released, "Queens and Brooklyn voters of all political parties are sending a terse telegram to President Obama that they are unhappy with his economic agenda and his hostile stance toward Israel. Today's Siena poll captures that in a snap-shot. 
While Mr. Weprin has centered his campaign on a promise to protect Social Security and Medicare, the poll cast doubt on the effectiveness of his appeals to older voters. Forty-nine percent of likely voters 55 or older supported Mr. Turner, compared with 45 percent who supported Mr. Weprin.
The poll suggested that efforts by Mr. Turner and others, including former Mayor Edward I. Koch, to make Israel a decisive issue in the race have not fully succeeded. Only 7 percent of likely voters cited a candidate's position toward Israel as the most important reason for their vote. Instead, nearly two in three voters said their most important issue was either a candidate's position on improving the economy or dealing with federal entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.
In the poll, Mr. Turner was viewed favorably by 48 percent of likely voters, while 34 percent who viewed him unfavorably. Likely voters were evenly divided, at 41 percent on each side, in their favorability rating of Mr. Weprin. And 43 percent of likely voters said that Mr. Turner was running a more positive campaign, compared with 32 percent who favored the tone of Mr. Weprin's bid for office.

HEADLINE: On Twitter, President Obama's Job Speech Drives the Conversation

BYLINE: JENNIFER PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama's job speech Thursday night prompted more than 125,350 mentions of his name on Twitter, the highest number of mentions in a day since he announced Osama Bin Laden was killed.

 BODY:
President Obama's job speech Thursday night prompted more than 125,350 mentions of his name on Twitter, the highest number of mentions in a day since he announced Osama Bin Laden was killed, according to an analysis by Trendrr, a social media analytics firm. 
In the hours after he gave his speech, 53 percent of the posts were favorable. Another 19 percent expressed negative sentiment and 28 percent were neutral, according to the analysis of real-time data on Twitter about the speech by Trendrr, a firm that measures sentiment in real time on social media platforms.
Not surprisingly, some of the harshest comments were from some of the presidential candidates seeking the Republican nomination. 
Then there was the Twitter post from candidate Herman Cain, the founder of Godfather Pizza, that could be characterized as neutral, perhaps. He wondered why Mr. Obama didn't contact him for advice before addressing Congress. 
Speech time & I never got a call from the President. Figured he'd want to know how I created millions of jobs for 40 years.Thu Sep 8 22:57:30 via TweetDeckHerman Cain
THEHermanCain
Former Massachusetts GovernorMitt Romney was one of the candidates who used Twitter to try and draw attention to his own job plan. Then, echoing some of the themes about leadership that he mentioned in the Republican primary debate on Wednesday night, Mr. Romney posted: 
We can't afford 4 more years of failed leadership http://t.co/Bg4Xa9W. RT & share if you agreeThu Sep 8 22:48:10 via webMitt Romney
MittRomney
Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania U.S. Senator, also posted a link to his job plan on his Twitter account, describing it as a plan that "accurately creates jobs immediately and permanently." He also took on Mr. Obama: 
Wrong Mr. President, it's not government involvement that makes America great, it is the American people.Thu Sep 8 23:40:33 via webRick Santorum
RickSantorum
Many Republicans, including Representative Paul Broun, a lawmaker from Georgia, attacked Mr. Obama's plan on Twitter during and after the speech. He stayed in his office instead of heading to the joint session so he said he could offer live updates about the speech and conduct a Twitter Town Hall in his office. No cellphones, he noted, are allowed in the chambers.
But other Republicans were using Twitter to strike a more conciliatory tone. 
Republican Representative Eric Cantor, the Majority Leader from Virginia, delivered a few jabs at President Obama's plan during his appearance on Fox's "Hannity" show after the speech. 
On Twitter, both before and after the speech, he published posts that focused on delivering a message about finding common ground. Shortly after the speech he wrote:
Let's work together and quickly pass those areas where there is common agreement, so we can grow this economy and create jobs. #JobsNowFri Sep 9 0:55:29 via webEric Cantor
EricCantor
Nancy Pelosi used Twitter to make her point that both sides had to come together. 
GOP has a choice to either work with Dems on creating #JobsNow or waste more time--POTUS has put forward a plan & Dems are prepared to act.Fri Sep 9 0:14:15 via webNancy Pelosi
NancyPelosi
Shortly after Mr. Obama announced he was calling his plan the American Jobs Act, the phrase was used on Twitter more than 3,600 times and was trending on the social networking service across the country, despite some serious competition in the social space. In addition to the launch of the N.F.L. season and all the talk about the Green Bay Packers, conversation about Mr. Obama's speech was competing with breaking news about a specific, credible but unconfirmed terror threat for Washington, D.C., and New York, and then the massive power outage in San Diego.
The #jobsnow hashtag, which was used by the White House and GOP leaders, was used in Twitter posts 7,538 times on Thursday night. It also gave some people on Twitter an opportunity to have a little fun, wondering if it should be changed to #snowjob. 
In an effort to keep the conversation going about the jobs plan on Twitter, the White House had a panel of experts field questions Thursday night. And the White House is hosting a "Tweetup" on Friday. Press Secretary Jay Carney will be taking the questions then.

HIGHLIGHT: A review of the day in Washington.

 BODY:
Today's Times:

        
President Obama called on Congress to pass his $447 billion proposal to revive the stalled economy on Thursday, emphasizing earlier bipartisan support for its components, Mark Landler reports. The package of tax cuts and spending received little applause from Republicans during Mr. Obama's 32-minute address to Congress, but party leaders later expressed their willingness to consider some of his proposals.
        
Driven by concern over the debt, lawmakers are no longer arguing about whether to touch entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security, but rather how to tackle them, Jackie Calmes and Robert Pear report. Members of both parties signaled they may be willing to make cuts to the popular programs on Thursday.
        
Both parties gave Mr. Obama standing ovations during his address - just not at the same time. Jennifer Steinhauer lays out the scene on Capitol Hill on Thursday.
        
The president's modest proposal to reduce payroll taxes that finance Social Security is emblematic of the modest impact some economists say the package could have on the economy. Binyamin Appelbaum reports on whether the plan could stimulate enough job growth.

Mr. Obama will be in Richmond, Va., on Friday to reiterate the economic proposals presented in his address to Congress on Thursday.

HIGHLIGHT: The strengths and weakness of the president's re-election strategy.

 BODY:
Mark Schmitt explains the political theory of last night's presidential address:
It's not a fiery partisan confrontation; it's a kind of fighting bipartisanship. [President Obama is] now putting forth a substantive agenda that is very likely to boost the economy, create jobs, and improve the basic fairness of the tax system in order to spread the benefits of economic growth more broadly. But he aggressively linked almost all of those things to ideas that Republicans had already supported, or that wealthy people such as Warren Buffet had embraced. He took ownership of some ideas that had traditionally been conservative, and embraced ideas that had had some Republican support.
[This] sets up, in theory, a different hypothetical win-win ... One possibility is that Republicans have some qualms about a wholly obstructionist agenda, Congress passes some or most of the American Jobs Act, the economy improves (likely with some help from the Federal Reserve, international circumstances, and good fortune), and actual conditions get Obama out of the box he's in. Failing that, if the White House and Democrats can keep their focus on the American Jobs Act (and if the left can avoid getting distracted by Obama's wise concessions to reality, such as long-term reductions in Medicare spending), then Republican obstruction takes a new form. It's not just blocking Obama, or his agenda-it's blocking economic recovery, systematically, including ideas that Republicans have embraced in the past and will embrace again.
Pulling that off, however, requires a discipline that goes beyond one speech. It means that every action of the administration from here into 2012 needs to reinforce the point ...
In one sense, this is a plausible strategy, and last night's was an effective speech. If Obama campaigns in 2012 promising a payroll tax stimulus, a tax reform that lowers rates (including the corporate rate) but increases revenue by closing deductions for the wealthy, and an entitlement reform package that's more modest and less scary-seeming than the Republican alternative, he'll have a good chance to claim the policy center, and paint his Republican rival (especially if that rival is Rick Perry) as dangerously right-wing and extreme.
The problem, though, is that it's a little odd for an incumbent to try to win re-election by promising to be centrist and mainstream and moderate in his term. Incumbents usually win by talking about how centrist and mainstream and moderate their first-term agenda already - and how successful they've been, of course, at doing the specific things they were elected to do. Between the unpopularity of the stimulus package and the health care bill and the grimness of the unemployment rate, this is a much harder story for the president to tell. Which is why it's very possible to imagine him making all the right promises and taking all the right positions over the next 14 months and still falling short of re-election.

HEADLINE: What's in the Obama Jobs Plan for Small Businesses

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Will it encourage small businesses to hire?

 BODY:
In his speech to the joint session of Congress on Thursday night, President Obama proposed a jobs bill, the American Jobs Act, with several specific, if not yet particularly detailed, tax initiatives that would benefit small businesses - though most in fact would bring the same relief to all companies, large or small. The initiatives can be sorted into two flavors, incentives to promote investment broadly and incentives to promote hiring in particular.
The following investment incentives would be in place for 2012.
Payroll tax cut for employers. The plan would halve the employer share of payroll taxes, to 3.1 percent, on the first $5 million in wages. While this tax cut would be available to all businesses, the White House said it would most benefit the 98 percent of companies with wages below $5 million. A company with a $5 million payroll would see a tax cut of $155,000.
Extending bonus depreciation through 2012. The plan would extend a provision that permits companies to fully depreciate in the first year certain purchases that would normally be amortized over as much as 20 years. The provision was included in last year's compromise legislation to extend the Bush tax cuts and unemployment insurance. Without any action, bonus depreciation in most cases would be limited to 50 percent in 2012 and then expire altogether.
The following hiring incentives would take effect in October 2011. It is unclear when, or if, they would expire. 
Tax credits for hiring the long-term unemployed. Mr. Obama proposed a tax credit of up to $4,000 for hiring a person who has been unemployed for at least six months. If the prospective employee is a veteran, the credit would increase to as much as $5,600. If the veteran became disabled in the course of serving, the credit would rise to as much as $9,600. According to a White House spokesperson, the amount of the credit would depend on the employee's wages and the number of hours worked.
Employer payroll tax holiday on payroll growth. The president would eliminate the entire 6.2 percent payroll tax on any increase in payroll up to $50 million above the prior year. The growth in wages can be spent on either new hires or raises for existing employees.
All of these initiatives would require approval by Congress. In his speech, the president also mentioned other changes that the administration could undertake on its own. He promised that the government will pay its contractors more quickly, without specifying how quickly. (Federal law requires that the government pay contractors within 30 days of receiving an invoice. "Historically, agencies have been generally encouraged to pay contractors at or right before the 30-day deadline," said Moira Mack, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget.)
Additionally, the White House said the president would ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to "to reduce the regulatory burdens on small-business capital formation in ways that are consistent with investor protection, including expanding 'crowdfunding' opportunities and increasing mini-offerings."
Before the president had finished delivering his speech, the National Federation of Independent Business, the conservative-leaning small-business lobbying group, panned it as "more of the same" in an e-mailed statement. "Small businesses need the government out of their way," said Dan Danner, the group's president and chief executive, in the statement. "Tax breaks are always a welcome help to small businesses, especially in these tough economic times. But those outlined tonight by the president are temporary, and avoid the question of meaningful business tax reform."
The president's proposals did cheer at least one group of small-business executives -- those invited by the president to witness the speech. Albert Green, chief executive of Kent Displays, a manufacturer of liquid crystal displays in Kent, Ohio, said that while he didn't have time to study the proposals in detail, "the takeaway is that money for businesses always helps - it helps them grow."
But even these business owners expressed reservations. David Catalano, who helped found Modea, a digital advertising agency in Blacksburg, Va., said that he was wary of the president's pledge to pay for the package by having the "wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to pay their fair share." Mr. Catalano said that because his company was organized as an S Corporation, in which profits are passed through to shareholders, he would then face higher taxes. But, he said, "my partner and I have reinvested 100 percent of the profits that our agency has made over the last five years back into the company. If the government takes a bigger share of that from me, it directly impedes my ability to grow the agency."
Darlene Miller, who owns and runs Permac Industries, a precision machining company in Burnsville, Minn., said she also worried about the president's call for higher taxes but added that even with her company's profits, "I'm not the wealthiest, so it does not affect me directly." She said the president could have done more to address regulatory burdens. "There's still a lot of work in that area to be done," she said. "There are a lot of regulations that really just aren't necessary."
Both Ms. Miller and Mr. Catalano said they were looking for employees right now and acknowledged that President Obama's proposed hiring incentives would not influence their decisions, reinforcing a concern among economists that such inducements don't encourage new hiring but reward actions that would be taken anyway. But both echoed Mr. Green's view that every little bit helps. "You don't hire somebody because you're getting a tax credit," said Mr. Catalano. "This just eases the burden, to invest in their education, or do more things for them."

HEADLINE: Podcast: The Economy, Manufacturing and Commercialized College Life

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen.

 BODY:
The economy has been slowing and unemployment in the United States is stuck at 9.1 percent. President Obama has come up with a program that he says will help.
In a speech on Thursday, he offered a $447 billion package of tax cuts and spending programs that received a lukewarm reception from Republicans in Congress. The total of fiscal stimulus items was bigger than expected, but it's not clear how much of it will be enacted, Floyd Norris says in the new Weekend Business podcast.
The Federal Reserve is contemplating action of its own, deriving inspiration from an old song by Chubby Checker. Among the options being considered to stimulate the economy is a variation on a 1961 Fed program known as Operation Twist. As I write in the Strategies column in Sunday Business, and as we discuss in the podcast, the Fed might twist the composition of its own bond portfolio to lower longer-term interest rates. New research suggests that such an effort might be effective, though its impact could be dwarfed by other influences on financial markets.

In a separate conversation in the podcast, Greg Mankiw, the Harvard economics professor, analyzes the economy's problems and suggests a long-term solution: stoking the "animal spirits" of business to increase investment spending. This is the focus of his Economic View column in Sunday Business.
And Louis Uchitelle discusses the role of government in manufacturing, the subject of his cover article in Sunday Business. The manufacturing sector is in relative decline in the United States, he says, and isn't likely to recover without more government help.
The increasing commercialization of college life is the focus of a Sunday Business cover article by Natasha Singer. In a conversation with David Gillen, she says brand marketing on campus has grown in scope and intensity. Along with traditional college colors, student T-shirts have sometimes been emblazoned with corporate logos.
You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Floyd Norris and Operation Twist (33:31); news summary (25:03); Natasha Singer (22:58); Louis Uchitelle (14:59); Greg Mankiw (7:07); the week ahead (1:43).

HEADLINE: Guitars, a Federal Raid and a Jobs Speech

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: After federal investigators impound what they say is illegally imported wood, a company's chief executive gets a seat of honor in a joint congressional session.

 BODY:
If President Obama was concerned that Republican threats to play hooky during his job speech Thursday night would result in a shortage of disgruntled faces in Congress, he needn't have worried. On Thursday night, House Republicans hosted 13 business people to drive home the myriad ways in which they say that federal regulations are destroying American jobs. 
Among the guests were farmers and manufacturers who say the Clean Air Act prevented them from expanding their businesses and creating new jobs. Perhaps the most high-profile guest seated in Speaker John Boehner's box, however, was Henry Juszkiewicz, the chief executive of Gibson Guitar. 
Over the last two weeks, the public face of this renowned guitar brand has become a Tea Party icon and a sought-after talk radio guest as a token victim of what is cast as President Obama's overreaching administration. 
Maybe you're wondering why we're discussing this at the Green blog. On Aug. 24, armed federal agents executed search warrants on Gibson facilities in Nashville and Memphis. The search resulted in the confiscation by the federal Fish and Wildlife Service of $2 million to $3 million worth of exotic wood and guitars in addition to electronic records.

Gibson Guitar is being investigated about the legality of its imports of ebony, used for fingerboards, from India. It is the second time that suspect wood has been seized from a Gibson factory. 
In November 2009, hardwood from Madagascar was taken from a Nashville warehouse. While no charges have been pressed, Gibson abruptly stopped importing wood from Madagascar, where illegal logging is spurring the plunder of the rainforest and threatening the habitat of several species. 
The federal law causing all the commotion is the Lacey Act of 1900, one of the first federal laws designed to protect wildlife; in 2008 it was amended to include wood products, making it illegal for American companies to purchase wood which was illegally exported from abroad. 
Mr. Juszkiewicz denies any wrongdoing by Gibson and says his company is being bullied over a technicality. If the wood had been finished in India rather than in the United States, he says, there would be no question of legality. 
Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, including Fred Upton of Michigan and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, have written to the secretary of the Interior demanding more information concerning the investigation. 
 "Your agencies and this Administration are actively pursuing regulatory and legal policies that discourage job growth in the United States and encourage shipping those very same jobs overseas," the letter says. 
In his jobs speech, President Obama had a few words for those who demand more relaxed regulations. 
"What we can't do -- what I won't do -- is let this economic crisis be used as an excuse to wipe out the basic protections that Americans have counted on for decades," he said. 
He went on: "We shouldn't be in a race to the bottom, where we try to offer the cheapest labor and the worst pollution standards. America should be in a race to the top. And I believe that's a race we can win."

HEADLINE: Obama Jobs Plan Would Boost the City, Comptroller Says

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: The effect of the cut in the payroll tax would be greater in the city than in other parts of the country because incomes are higher, John Liu says. The gain would be $4.8 billion and preserve or create 25,000 jobs.

 BODY:
 President Obama's plan to temporarily cut payroll taxes in half would yield big benefits in New York City, if Congress passed it as proposed, the city comptroller's office said on Friday.
 The president's jobs plan, which he announced on Thursday night, called for reducing the Social Security tax on income to 3.1 percent in 2012. The rate is currently set at 6.2 percent on the first $106,800 of an employee's pay. Because workers in New York are relatively highly paid, the effect of that cut would be greater in the city than in other parts of the country.
 It would save $775 for a worker earning $25,000 a year and $3,100 for one who makes $100,000. All told, the comptroller's office estimated, the gain to New Yorkers would amount to $4.8 billion, and the spending of a portion of that total would preserve or create about 25,000 jobs in the city.
 What's less clear is how the city would be affected by the increases in federal spending on infrastructure and other programs that the president proposed, or how it would fare under the spending cuts that would also be part of the program, the comptroller's analysis said.
 "The president's plan is in the best interests of New Yorkers, but we must remain vigilant and ensure that any potential spending cuts do not disproportionately impact our city," John C. Liu, the city comptroller, said.
 Every $1 billion of new spending on infrastructure projects in the city would create about 7,500 jobs and provide a boost to the struggling construction industry, which lost about 20,000 jobs during the recession, the comptroller's analysis said. In addition, the proposed increase in educational aid could help restore 3,700 teaching positions slated for reduction over the next two years, it said.

HEADLINE: 'Jobs, Jobs, Jobs' Versus the S-Word

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: There haven't been many polls recently about proposals to stimulate the economy, but we can get a basic sense of how the major elements of President Obama's American Jobs Act are seen. 

 BODY:
There have not been very many polls recently about proposals to stimulate the economy - perhaps a signal of how the conversation in Washington has shifted toward deficit reduction. Nevertheless, we can get some basic sense of how the major elements of President Obama's American Jobs Act poll.
Basically, we are going to see three major themes here:
1) The White House is probably going to want to talk about elements of the proposal, while the Republicans will argue against it in terms.
2) Republicans are going to want to use the s-word, - or another s-word, - while the White House will talk about .
3) The polls are liable to produce highly divergent results based on differences in question wording. For this reason, in my analysis below, I have included more detail on the precise questions asked than I usually would.
The largest single element in the proposal, about $240 billion of a total of $447 billion in spending, would consist of extending and expanding cuts in payroll taxes.
The only recent survey on the topic, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released earlier this week, had 40 percent of respondents in favor of the the cuts and 20 percent opposed, with a large number of Americans undecided.
I have also included polls conducted on the payroll tax from last December, when a one-year extension was adopted. A CNN poll at the time had a 62-to-36 majority in favor. But an ABC/Washington Post survey had much different numbers, with respondents opposing the measure by a 38-to-57 margin.
Note, however, that The Washington Post's question began with the three-word phrase "Cutting Social Security." I suspect that a lot of respondents heard these words and did not listen to the rest of the question. Nevertheless, the fact that payroll taxes are the financing stream for Social Security may be the source of some critiques of the proposal from Democrats in Congress.
Another $140 billion in the bill consists of infrastructure spending. Two recent questions on the subject, one focusing on road construction and the other more general, have it polling reasonably well, with about 50 percent of Americans in favor of the proposals, 25 percent opposed and 25 percent undecided.
Extending unemployment benefits, another $49 billion in spending, was an overwhelmingly popular idea in December. Two more recent polls, however, suggest that Americans may be losing patience, with only narrow pluralities in favor:
Finally, a small amount of expenditures in the bill would consist of job-training programs. One pollster included a question on such a proposal and found it to be quite popular:
Although the polls on the specifics of the bill are not without ambiguity, in general they look decent for the White House. And that is no surprise, really, since the broad acceptability of these proposals was presumably among the reasons that the White House picked them.
But what about the bill as a philosophical matter? Are Americans going to be tolerant of proposals for new spending after having spent six months hearing about deficit reduction?
Well, it depends on how you ask them. A dozen polls since the first of the year have juxtaposed different priorities against one another, for example, "reducing unemployment" against "reducing the deficit," one of which would speak favorably to Mr. Obama's bill and the other less so.
The good news for Mr. Obama: when the issue is framed as one of jobs against deficits, jobs win. On average, polls that ask Americans to prioritize "creating jobs" or "reducing unemployment" against "cutting spending" or "reducing the deficit" have had 57 percent of respondents coming out on the jobs side, against 36 percent who prioritize the deficit:
The answer changes, however, when the conflict is instead framed as stimulus or recovery spending against deficits. In polls that employ the term "spend" or "spending" in describing the additional stimulus, its support drops to an average of 44 percent, with 50 percent saying that deficit reduction is the higher priority:
It is no surprise, then, that in his speech on Thursday night, Mr. Obama used the term "job" or "jobs" 39 times, often preceded by "create" - but never uttered the word "stimulus." He did say "spend" or "spending" a number of times, but usually to describe his having reduced spending during the debt-ceiling negotiations rather than about any new proposals. Nor, at any point during the speech, did Mr. Obama specify the cost of his program.
We are likely to see a real semantic scrum over the next few weeks as partisans seek to define the territory that the bill occupies. Pollsters, whether knowingly or not, will be a part of that battle. I would advise them to use multiple question variants where possible, taking a larger sample and splitting it into halves or thirds, and I would advise readers to be suspicious of articles that cherry-pick one or two polls without discussing the broader context.
As for whether Mr. Obama actually has a chance to score policy victories rather than political points: well, the smart money probably argues against his winning the cooperation of the Republican Congress, especially with his approval rating just above 40 percent.
I suspect, however, that in order of plausibility, Congress is most likely to approve the job-training programs, which are cheap and have a bipartisan lineage, followed by the payroll tax cuts, which Republicans may appear hypocritical in arguing against. An extension of unemployment benefits may be less likely, and substantial infrastructure spending less likely still.

HEADLINE: Magazine Covers on a Topic Known All Too Well

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Choosing the right magazine cover is a challenge in any ordinary week. But capturing the right sentiments surrounding the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks presented questions more fraught and delicate than most.
How could editors make their magazines distinctive without being distasteful, evocative yet not exploitative? And how could they present something fresh when so many of the images from that day have been seared indelibly into the nation's consciousness?
Many weekly newsmagazines used images of the World Trade Center towers, in forms both real and imagined. And despite the considerable differences in what magazines chose, there seemed to be one unanimous sentiment: avoid images of destruction and carnage. Editors and art directors instead opted for photographs, illustrations and headlines that with varying degrees of subtlety say, ''Reflect, remember, carry on.''
The Economist, using the same illustration that it chose to mark the one-year anniversary of the attacks, went with the two towers silhouetted against a blue-and-pink backdrop, with no other buildings in sight. The magazine's intent, said the editor, John Micklethwait, was to avoid hitting readers over the head with something that they surely find all too familiar. 
''If you use the towers, people know what comes with it,'' he said. ''This is not the kind of cover where you need to shock.''
The New Yorker selected an illustration called ''Reflections,'' by Ana Juan, which shows Lower Manhattan as seen from New York Harbor. The towers, absent from the illuminated skyline, are reflected in the black water.
''The image is quite somber, but there are lights,'' said Francoise Mouly, the magazine's art editor. ''We wanted to look back and look forward. This image, I felt, was poised just at that cusp moment where it's also positing a future.''
But striking the right balance between present and past was a challenge. Initially the New Yorker editors considered covers that showed the World Trade Center being rebuilt. ''For us it was premature,'' she said.
Time's cover shows an image of the United States from space at night, with twin beams of light emanating from New York City. The words ''Beyond 9/11'' are written in white. The photo illustration is a collaboration by Julian LaVerdiere, Paul Myoda, John Bennett, Gustavo Bonevardi, Richard Nash Gould and the light designer Paul Marantz; the artists who created the ''Tribute in Light'' at ground zero that appears every year around the Sept. 11 anniversary.
''I wanted something that was uplifting, that was more optimistic,'' said Richard Stengel, the Time managing editor. ''Something that literally and figuratively moved beyond 9/11.''
In the first version of the cover, Mr. Stengel said the beams were not as full and pronounced. So he asked the artists to enlarge them to the point that they were almost leaping off the page. ''That made it much more compelling and powerful,'' he said.
The New Republic used an Associated Press photo of one of the towers as it appeared from the ground before the attack. The idea, said the editor, Richard Just, was to capture the World Trade Center in the way that ordinary New Yorkers would have seen it if they were passing by or walking into it.
''The way many New Yorkers experienced the towers in their daily lives was that kind of ground-level looking up, these things towering over you,'' he said. ''Yet that was a shot of the towers you rarely saw.''
That same concept -- capturing a moment before American life was forever altered -- was behind Newsweek's cover, which depicts a jet soaring across a cloudless blue sky.
''I wanted not to show the towers, because in doing so we hand back the day to the most agonized moments,'' said Tina Brown, the editor of Newsweek. ''Rather, I thought the most important thing was to reclaim a moment that day took away from us too long.''
The photo illustration is meant to memorialize the instant before the attack, Ms. Brown added. ''The next thing is everything in the world changes.''
New York magazine actually cropped out the towers in its cover photo. The image is a close-up of the smoke and ash that poured from the site. A hint of sky frames the top, providing the only bit of color, other than white and gray.
''We feared we didn't know how to make a cover of the burning towers that would still have impact,'' said Adam Moss, the magazine's editor. ''The image is, sadly, too familiar at this point. But the towers were also impossible to avoid. So we tried gesturing at them instead.''
The effect was something of a Rorschach test, he said. Was it that horrifying moment when the towers started to collapse? An illustration symbolizing hope as the smoke yields to a clear blue sky? Heaven, perhaps?
''We weren't sure why it worked, but the effect seemed appropriate to the kind of issue we were making,'' he said.
The choice that editors faced in planning their 10th-anniversary issues was in many ways less complicated than it was when they created their Sept. 11 issues in 2001. Back then, the obvious and unanimous choice was to use an image from the attack.
Most picked pictures of the burning or fallen buildings. Time, Newsweek and U.S. News and World Report all showed close-up shots of the fireball erupting from the south tower as Flight 175 crashed into it.
The New Yorker went with a two-tone cover of all black by Art Spiegelman that faintly depicted the towers. The magazine ran no cartoons.
The cover of People was a wide shot of the Lower Manhattan skyline as Flight 175 approached the south tower. In a rare departure, the Fortune cover depicted a man covered in ash holding a rag over his mouth.
The 10-year mark as a news event gave editors more creative leeway. They weren't restricted to a certain kind of photo. And in the decade that has passed since the attack, magazines have become more comfortable using photo illustrations, more common in the era of Internet and cable television, when most readers have already seen the pictures by the time their magazine arrives.
''The anniversary is going to be ubiquitous, and that's why you can stray from the usual images,'' Mr. Stengel of Time said. ''It's a challenge because you have to thread the needle between something that is tasteful and powerful.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sept. 10 about magazine covers commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks referred imprecisely to the role played by two artists, who designed the Time magazine anniversary cover, in the creation of the ''Tribute in Light'' memorial that appears every year at ground zero. While the artists, Julian LaVerdiere and Paul Myoda, created the memorial, they did so along with John Bennett, Gustavo Bonevardi, Richard Nash Gould and the light designer Paul Marantz; they were not the sole co-creators.

HEADLINE: A New Start for Libya: Some signs of progress amid daunting challenges for the country's new leaders

 BODY:
After 42 years of erratic dictatorship, it would be unrealistic to expect a smooth transition in the early days of Libya's post-Qaddafi era. There have been water and fuel shortages, episodes of vigilante justice, and power struggles among the victorious rebel forces. There are also signs of progress on military, diplomatic, economic and political fronts. 
The last bastions of the regime are under assault, while Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi remains unaccounted for. Foreign governments have begun releasing billions of dollars of Libyan assets that were frozen during the fighting. Plans have been drafted for electing a constitutional assembly by early next year. Technicians are assessing damage to the oil wells and pipelines that account for 98 percent of the country's annual revenues, though full production may not be restored for months or even longer. Considering the situation six months ago, there is reason to be encouraged.
Nonetheless, the new regime faces many challenges. Among the most troubling developments is the brutal treatment of dark-skinned Africans rounded up by vigilantes and the regime's security forces.
The overwhelming majority of sub-Saharan Africans in Libya are migrant workers. Two and a half million worked there before the rebellion. Roughly two million remain. Colonel Qaddafi is thought to have hired several thousand Africans to fight for him in February. How many stuck with him to the end is unclear. But Western journalists saw no evidence of mercenaries in Tripoli when the city fell.
What they have seen is Africans being rounded up and treated differently from Libyans who fought for the dictator, many of whom have already been set free. Some Africans accused of being mercenaries were lynched after the rebels captured Benghazi in February. To maintain its international credibility, the transitional government must release innocent Africans and make sure that those who fought for Colonel Qaddafi are treated fairly.
Much hard work remains in other areas as well. Vigilantes must be disarmed or placed under firm government control. Tribes, factions representing different regions and rival rebel leaders must be reconciled and represented in the transitional government.
Other countries should help with technical assistance and cash until Libyan assets are fully unfrozen and oil revenues flow again. Qatar and Kuwait have been generous so far, as have the United States, Britain and France. Promises of support are also flowing in from countries like Germany and Turkey, which refused to take part in NATO's protective airstrikes against Colonel Qaddafi's forces.
Libya's new leaders may be tempted to skew future Libyan oil contracts and other economic rewards toward nations that helped most in the fight against the Qaddafi regime. But they should resist that temptation. Bidding for contracts should be open and transparent to ensure the best returns for the Libyan people. Colonel Qaddafi was a master at using Libya's oil wealth to forge his international alliances. That is a tactic his successors should not emulate.

HEADLINE: A Setback for the Euro Zone: Central Bank Resignation Reveals A Widening Split on the Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By JACK EWING AND NICHOLAS KULISH; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and Nicholas Kulish from Berlin. David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Discord over the handling of Europe's debt crisis spilled into full view on Friday when an influential member of the European Central Bank's executive board unexpectedly resigned. The news intensified fears over the euro currency union's ability to cooperatively resolve its problems.
Stock markets swooned in Europe and the euro fell against the dollar after the bank announced the resignation of Jurgen Stark, a German who is the central bank's de facto chief economist and also a member of its policy-setting governing council, and the sell-off continued in the United States, with the major indexes all falling more than 2 percent. 
Although the central bank said that Mr. Stark was leaving for personal reasons, the impression was that Mr. Stark's departure was connected to his well-known opposition to the bank's buying of government bonds to ease pressure on countries like Greece, Italy and Spain.
Mr. Stark's resignation, nearly three years before his term was up, is widely viewed as another fissure in the edifice of European unity, which has suffered as wealthier countries like Germany have been asked to underwrite poor performers like Greece.
''It's a very bad sign,'' said Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. ''It means that the split within the E.C.B. that we thought was far down the road is here now.
''It puts a shadow over the E.C.B. and risks financial markets asking, 'How long can they go on buying these Italian bonds?' This indicates that the answer is, 'Not as long as I had thought.' ''
The government debt crisis among the 17-nation euro union's weaker members continues to weigh on markets, and any sign of a deepening in the rift between rich and poor countries could further spook investors.
There is a chance that Mr. Stark's departure could give the central bank a freer hand. Mr. Stark was an inflation hard-liner very much in the German tradition, and his dissent created an impression that the bank suffered internal divisions. Mr. Stark declined a request for comment.
But if, as expected, a German replaces him, that new member of the bank board is very likely to be as mindful as Mr. Stark of the fierce opposition that the bank's policy has generated in Germany.
Germany's finance minister declined to comment on reports that his country would recommend Jorg Asmussen, a deputy finance minister, to replace Mr. Stark, who was the only German on the six-member executive board. Mr. Asmussen has been a central figure in negotiations with other euro zone countries on how to deal with the sovereign debt crisis.
While Mr. Asmussen's views on monetary policy are not well known, he comes from the same tradition of German economics as Mr. Stark -- one that puts an emphasis on price stability and is skeptical of efforts to help countries that run up too much debt. So it is not clear if he would be any more receptive to the central bank's bond buying than Mr. Stark has been.
When the Bundesbank, the German central bank, was Europe's most powerful monetary authority before the advent of the euro union in 1999, it made controlling prices its mission. There are mounting concerns in Germany and elsewhere that the European Central Bank has overstepped its bounds in trying to fight the current crisis by acting as the buyer of last resort for Italian and Spanish bonds to prevent those countries from slipping closer to insolvency.
In a statement Friday, Kurt Lauk, president of the economic council for the Christian Democrats -- the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany -- called the resignation ''a dramatic alarm bell for the fact that the E.C.B. must be led back to the right path.''
As the debt crisis continues, the future of the euro union has become increasingly uncertain. Lawmakers and citizens in countries like Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, which are known for fiscal responsibility, are watching events in Athens and Rome with growing skepticism and even alarm.
Mr. Stark had warned of rising danger from public spending in a column to be published Monday in the Handelsblatt newspaper, Reuters reported. ''We are in a situation in which the massive sustainability risks in public sector budgets are undermining financial stability,'' he wrote.
The unexpected departure of Mr. Stark comes at a time of transition for the European Central Bank, whose presidency will change hands at the end of October. That is when Mario Draghi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, succeeds Jean-Claude Trichet, whose eight-year term is ending.
The bank has often been the main institution holding the euro zone together in the face of relentless market pressure, especially in the bond market. Last month, the bank began buying Spanish and Italian bonds on the open market, as prices plummeted and yields rose to potentially ruinous levels.
But the bond-buying program is risky because investors are likely to continually test the central bank's resolve -- and financial ability -- to bolster the weaker countries.
Mr. Stark is the second prominent German this year to leave the bank's policy-making governing council, a broader panel consisting of the executive board and the heads of the central banks of the 17 euro countries. Axel Weber, who was president of the German Bundesbank, announced his resignation from that post in February, which resulted in his leaving the central bank council.
Mr. Weber, who until his resignation had been the front-runner to succeed Mr. Trichet, was displeased along with Mr. Stark about the bank's foray into bond markets, which he argued was an improper involvement in member nations' fiscal policies.
Jens Weidmann, Mr. Weber's successor as president of the Bundesbank, is also known as an opponent of the bond buying.
The German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, said at the Group of 7 meeting in Marseille that Germany would propose a replacement for Mr. Stark, but he would not comment on whether it would be Mr. Asmussen.
Although nationality officially plays no role in the selection process, Germany would customarily have the privilege of naming the replacement for Mr. Stark, the only German on the board. The nomination also requires the ratification of other euro zone governments.

PERSON: Dr. Elmer Mejia 

HEADLINE: Devoted to Keeping Lobster Divers of Honduras Alive

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

 BODY:
La Ceiba, Honduras AT a modest clinic down a dirt road, there are rocking chairs on the front porch and a hyperbaric chamber in the front room where Dr. Elmer Mejia treats deep-sea lobster divers who arrive paralyzed but walk out days later.
Courtly in manner and crisply dressed despite the tropical heat, Dr. Mejia could pass for an accountant in a suburban office park. But his appearance masks a fierce sense of mission. He calls what is happening to his impoverished patients ''economic genocide,'' and compares the lobsters they collect on the ocean floor to the ''blood diamonds'' that finance African civil wars.
''Here, the problem is strictly about money, where money is given more value than human life,'' Dr. Mejia said.
Since fishing for spiny lobster off the Caribbean coasts of Honduras and Nicaragua became industrialized in the 1980s to meet demand from the United States, the Miskito Indian divers who are the first link in the supply chain have moved farther and farther out to sea as stocks vanish in shallow waters. 
They descend to depths of 100 to 120 feet, repeatedly diving and resurfacing, pushed by poverty to ignore all the safety rules. A few die every season; many more are paralyzed by decompression sickness, commonly known as the bends.
During a two-week fishing trip, they make as many as 12 to 16 dives a day -- no more than two are recommended at that depth -- to scrabble for a catch that earns them about $3 a pound. (On a productive trip, they may catch as much as 100 pounds of lobster, but they must pay expenses that total about 40 percent.)
Aside from the drug trade, most Honduran Miskito Indians have no other way of making a living. They live in a region so remote that it is reached only by sea or air, and they are among the most neglected inhabitants of an already poor country.
''The only way to avoid the deaths and the injuries is to shut it down completely,'' Dr. Mejia said of the lobster diving industry. ''But you can't do that unless you provide alternatives.''
Every two or three years, the Honduran government starts to discuss a moratorium. This year, the Central American regional body known as Ospesca, which regulates fishing, did the same, but the fishermen asked for a two-year delay. In 2013, they will ask for a new extension, Dr. Mejia predicted.
He is also skeptical of intervention by outside groups. The Global Fish Alliance, promoted and largely financed by Darden Restaurants, which owns the Red Lobster chain, has sponsored conferences in La Ceiba to encourage conservation in the lobster fisheries and map out alternatives for the fishermen. ''The money doesn't get to the Miskito Indians,'' Dr. Mejia said. ''Nothing has changed so far.''
Rich Jeffers, a spokesman for Darden Restaurants in Orlando, Fla., pointed to efforts to encourage the fishermen to use traps to catch the lobsters rather than dive for them. The restaurant chain requires its suppliers to purchase only trap-caught lobsters and sends teams to monitor compliance, he said in an e-mail.
But getting into the trapping business requires capital that virtually no Miskito Indians have. Moreover, trapping boats employ only a few fishermen, so a wholesale switch would leave most of the Miskitos without jobs.
HOWEVER the issue is finally decided, if ever, the rickety boats stocked with air tanks at the port here suggest that dive-caught lobster is still in demand.
''There is still a lot of lobster being pulled by hand, and it is being chilled and brought to the U.S.,'' said Eric Douglas, a diving safety expert and author who has studied divers in Honduras, Brazil and Mexico. Consumers have forced the tuna industry to protect dolphins and sea turtles, but when it comes to lobster fishing ''we don't seem to care about the human beings,'' he said.
Dr. Mejia, 42, has made easing the plight of the fishermen -- he estimates there are about 2,100 of them in Honduras -- the purpose of much of his adult life. Raised in a poor family in the capital, Tegucigalpa, he joined the Honduran Navy at 18 because it offered a chance to continue his studies. He became a navy diver and trained as a nurse and a paramedic.
When he left the navy three years later, he moved to Roatan, a Caribbean island where Episcopal missionaries had set up the first hyperbaric chamber for Miskito Indian divers.
Throughout medical school in Tegucigalpa, Dr. Mejia never wavered. He has climbed aboard the lobster boats to learn more about the fishing trips and endure the same conditions as the divers. Typically, 100 sleep on hammocks slung together in the cramped cabin of a boat measuring no more than 80 feet. To dull pain and fear, they smoke marijuana, clouding the boat with so much smoke that Dr. Mejia said he had to go to the prow for fresh air.
Finally, in 2009, through contacts in the United States and with financial help from the Episcopal Diocese of Wyoming, he was able to buy the hyperbaric chamber. He rented a truck and drove the chamber to Honduras from Virginia in nine days.
''He is a man of strong conviction,'' said Dr. Caroline Fife, the director of clinical research at the Center for Hyperbaric Medicine at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston, where Dr. Mejia studied in 2008. ''He practices what he believes.''
The clinic here, called La Bendicion, or the Blessing, gets no outside help and is financed by what Dr. Mejia charges fishing boat owners for treating divers, an average of $300 to $350 per diver. The shoestring operation is a family affair: Dr. Mejia's wife, a nurse, their son and a brother, work with him.
Compression sickness occurs when a diver ascends too fast and nitrogen in the bloodstream that is normally expelled by the lungs forms bubbles. The bubbles can lodge in the joints or along the spinal cord, causing paralysis. A bubble that reaches the brain causes an arterial gas embolism, which can be fatal.
In the hyperbaric chamber, the atmospheric pressure is raised to what the diver would experience underwater and then reduced over several hours as the diver breathes oxygen through a mask, allowing the nitrogen to be expelled.
Many of the injured divers have spent days on a boat after becoming sick because captains are reluctant to lose money by returning to shore. Dr. Mejia has shown that, contrary to standard medical thinking, it is possible to cure patients even after a delay.
''Elmer is seeing some really impressive recoveries,'' Dr. Fife said.
IN June, Dr. Mejia and Mr. Douglas held workshops for boat captains to teach them basic first aid for injured divers. This season, more divers have come into the clinic, but far fewer of them for severe illness.
During an interview, Dr. Mejia got a call from a boat owner telling him that a new patient was on his way in. The clinic's ''ambulance'' -- a red pickup truck -- picked up the diver at the port.
At the clinic, Dr. Mejia took the patient's history: Rolando Pita Gomez, 55. Mr. Pita has been diving since 1975, a testament to the Miskito Indian divers' extraordinary resilience. ''Theoretically they should be dead,'' Dr. Mejia said. ''They violate all the physiological diving laws. They dive for 20 or 30 years; we are looking at superhumans.''
Mr. Pita looked far from superhuman, but he was on his feet two days later.
Wilmer Allen Marly had been brought to the clinic unconscious a week earlier. Somewhat dazed, the 27-year-old fisherman was preparing to return home.
''After this, I don't want to dive anymore. I have small children,'' he said. A cousin of his died in June in a diving accident. ''I have to find something else to do to support us.''
After he said goodbye to Mr. Marly, who had been close to death a week earlier, Dr. Mejia spoke, almost to himself. There was no sigh, no shrug of resignation, just a simple fact.
''He'll dive again.''

HEADLINE: For Banks, Unfortunate Echoes Of 2008

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THREE years ago, financial stocks tumbled as worries about the health of the banking system grew. By Sept. 12, indexes of financial stocks were down 28 percent from the end of 2007 in both the United States and Europe.
Then Lehman Brothers failed, and prices fell much more.
As the anniversary of that date approached, investors seemed to fear it might all happen again. By the end of this week, those same indexes were down about as much this year as they were at this point in 2008, and many bank stocks did even worse than they did in early 2008. 
There is a circular logic to this year's decline. In 2008, banks in many countries were rescued by governments. Now it is feared that banks may be in danger because some of the same governments may not be able to meet their obligations. That is particularly true in Europe, where bonds from several countries trade well below face value.
On Friday, Greece's finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, blamed ''organized rumors'' for renewed speculation that Greece would default, and said the country intended to comply with all terms needed for the bailout that European countries agreed to in July. But the fact that the details of the deal have yet to be locked down has unnerved some investors.
In a speech this week, Josef Ackermann, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, said it was not justifiable for politicians to demand that European banks raise more capital, as Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, had done. ''It's obvious,'' he said, ''that many European banks would not be able to handle writing down the sovereign bonds they hold on their banking books to market levels.''
But, he said, it would ''risk undermining the credibility'' of European bailout packages ''if politicians were to now send out the signal that they do not believe in the success of those measures.'' And, he argued, forcing banks to raise capital now would anger investors by forcing the dilution of current shareholders.
As can be seen in the accompanying charts, Deutsche Bank has lost more than two-fifths of its value this year, a performance that is better than that of some banks. Its shares are trading for about what they cost at the end of 2008, but they are less than half what they were worth just before the Lehman failure.
Of the 30 banks shown, only one -- Standard Chartered of Britain -- has a share price higher than it had on the eve of the Lehman collapse. Even so, its shares have lost nearly a quarter of their value this year.
Shares in Intesa Sanpaulo, an Italian bank, have lost half their value this year, and are trading for about one-quarter less than they did on March 9, 2009, when most financial stocks hit their credit crisis lows. UniCredit in Italy, Societe Generale in France and Lloyds in Britain have also suffered badly this year, losing half or more of their value. Credit Suisse, in Switzerland, and Barclays, in Britain, have fallen almost as much.
Among the largest American banks, some of the worst performers have been those that were widely deemed to be too big to fail. Bank of America, troubled by its ill-fated acquisition of Countrywide Financial, is the worst performer so far in 2011, but Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have done almost as poorly. Morgan Stanley's share price is also a little below its March 9, 2009, level.

HEADLINE: Mr. Banker, Can You Spare a Dime?

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Not long ago, I received an e-mail from David Rynecki, an old friend and former colleague who left journalism a half-dozen years ago to become a small businessman. David's firm, Blue Heron Research Partners, does research for investment professionals; he was writing to share his frustration in trying to build a business in the aftermath of the recession.
''Like many small businesses,'' he wrote, ''we were socked by the recession. Rather than cut back, however, we chose to be aggressive.'' He and his wife, Marcia, invested everything they had in the firm. They refused to lay off their three employees. During an especially bad stretch, they used their credit cards to stay afloat. 
Their risk-taking paid off. ''We're hiring again,'' David's note continued. (Indeed, he's now got a full-time staff of nine.) ''Business is strong. Our receivables are unbelievable. We have long-term contracts with established investors.''
His problem was -- and is -- the same one facing millions of small businesspeople. With lending standards extraordinarily tight in the wake of the financial crisis, banks simply aren't making small business loans, not even to perfectly creditworthy people like David. Which means he can't expand -- and hire -- the way he would like to. Yes, he said, he could continue to plow his cash flow into the business and grow it slowly. But to get the firm to the next plateau, he needs a bank loan.
''Banks say they have credit to offer,'' he wrote. ''And they make you go through all the motions. But then they offer nothing.'' He tried three times to wrest a paltry $50,000 from two different banks, including JPMorgan Chase, which the firm uses for its own banking needs. He showed the loan officers Blue Heron's receivables and its long-term contracts. It didn't matter. He was turned down all three times. No collateral, said JPMorgan. Lack of a relationship, said the other bank.
As it happens, around the same time I was hearing from David, a small businessman on the West Coast was sending me very similar e-mails. His name is Bill Schultheis, and he was trying to help his wife start an upscale spa in Bellevue, Wash. He and his wife, Zhiqin Zhang, were looking for $500,000.
''My wife moved here from China 13 years ago,'' Bill wrote. She had already built and sold two spas; now she wanted to create something bigger and more luxurious. If all went according to plan, wrote Bill, she would employ between 25 and 35 people -- ''something Obama would appreciate,'' he added with a touch of sarcasm.
Bill sent me the business plan for the new spa. It was impressive. He outlined Zhiqin's track record. He explained that the cash flow from his day job -- he's an investment manager -- could pay off the loan within 18 months. And then he sent me a chronology of his failed efforts, going back to April 2010, to land a loan that would allow Zhiqin to follow her entrepreneurial dream.
Wells Fargo. Cathay Bank. KeyBank. Columbia Bank. In all, 14 banks turned down Bill and his wife. Lack of collateral was invariably the reason. ''Banks tell us to get lost when we come knocking on the door, even though we are putting up 60 percent on a $1.3 million project, which is halfway complete,'' Bill wrote in early August.
A few weeks later, however, Bill sent me another, very different e-mail: Bill and Zhiqin were going to get their loan after all. A local institution, Sterling Savings Bank, based in Spokane, Wash., had said yes -- much to their amazement and delight.
Why had Sterling been willing to overlook the lack of collateral, which had a been a deal-breaker for every other institution? Because, as one of its executives, Robert Weisel, explained to me, making sensible loans to small businesspeople was how Sterling competed for business -- even when the loan applicants didn't meet ''the traditional standard,'' as he put it.
''We are linked to our region and our community,'' he said. 'We try to distinguish ourselves by trying to figure out how to make transactions work, even if it means being willing to think outside the box.'' In this case, Bill's cash flow and Zhiqin's track record more than made up for the lack of collateral.
On Thursday night, President Obama offered up a series of tax breaks to small businesses as part of his jobs package. ''Everyone here knows that small businesses are where most new jobs begin,'' he told Congress. I don't mean to diminish the tax relief, which may, indeed, encourage small businesses to start hiring. But, far more than tax relief, small businesses need credit. That is what the president should be pushing for.
Three years ago, the federal government used tens of billions in taxpayer dollars to save the banking system. Now, at this dire economic moment, the country needs the banks to return the favor. Pushing the country's banks to act more like Sterling Savings Bank, and less like JPMorgan Chase, is something that the president might want to put on his jobs agenda.

HEADLINE: A Setback for the Euro Zone: Calls for Bolder Action as Europe Enters a 'Dangerous Phase'

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
MARSEILLE, France -- If anyone was counting on finance officials of the powerful Group of 7 nations to help map a way out of Europe's debt crisis and calm the markets, consider this: the G-7 met on Friday, the crisis grew worse and the markets plummeted.
The stock sell-off, which began in Europe and continued in the United States, was prompted by news that an important German member of the European Central Bank was resigning, creating new uncertainty for the euro monetary union's ability to take unified action.
But adding to the gloom was a word of caution from one G-7 attendee, the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, that headwinds from Europe's deepening debt crisis risked hitting the United States at a time when its own economy was still weak. 
He urged European leaders to take more forceful action to show they were committed to resolving their problems. But he did not say the United States was prepared to backstop them to prevent the crisis from spreading.
There were also admonishments from the chief of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, who said it was time for Europe's policy makers to take bold and unified action to see the global economy through what she described as a ''dangerous phase.''
By the end of the day, the Europeans had acknowledged the seriousness of the situation and were eager to reassure markets.
The G-7 finance officials issued a statement declaring its members were ''committed to a strong and coordinated international response'' to the crisis and the slowdown in global growth. But the group stopped short of taking explicit action to address tensions that have worsened in financial markets over the last month. Coordinated action might be left to the Group of 20 industrial and emerging economies, which includes China and has started to eclipse the G-7 in influence.
In the meantime, a senior American official said, until European parliaments vote later this month on whether to expand a bailout fund for the crisis, the European Central Bank has enough firepower to keep Spain and Italy from catching the contagion.
Some economists are not so sure of that.
''I do think the United States needs to try to prepare for what might happen if the European crisis is not resolved soon,'' said Martin N. Baily, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former chief of the Council of Economic Advisors during the Clinton Administration.
In the financial crisis of 2008, he noted, the United States Federal Reserve lent a lot of money to the Europeans who needed it at that time. ''I think they should work with the E.C.B. and the main governments of Europe now to make sure that we do not fall again into a liquidity crisis, a solvency crisis with the banks,'' Mr. Baily said.
One nation that is not part of the G-7 but has the world's second-biggest economy and its largest stash of foreign reserves -- China -- has been seen as a potential rescuer, if it were to help shore up the weaker European economies by buying up more of their government bonds.
But don't count on it.
China already has apparently poured tens of billions of dollars worth of foreign reserves into euro-denominated investments this year. But Chinese officials are still cautious about taking big risks with the country's $3.2 trillion nest egg. When considered in the context of China's 1.3 billion people, that nest egg is not necessarily an infinite treasure.
''China is a poor country with only $4,000 per capita income,'' Yu Yongding, a Chinese top economist and former member of the central bank's monetary policy committee said in an interview in China. ''To talk and think about China to rescue countries with $40,000 per capita incomes is ridiculous.''
China is ready to help, Mr. Yu said, ''but European countries first should show that they have a clear road map and convincing policies to preserve the euro and solve their problems as well as the political will to make necessary sacrifices.''
And so, with mounting worries of a new recession in the United States and Europe, the G-7 finance ministers have little choice but to focus on restoring growth -- even at the risk of running up further deficits and debt.
A day after President Obama pressed the Congress to enact a $447 billion package of tax cuts and new government spending to try to create jobs in the United States, Mr. Geithner insisted that such an economic stimulus would reduce the odds of America slipping into a new recession.
Mr. Obama's plan won support among G-7 officials, but there was also recognition that the United States could not be a primary source of growth for the global economy.
Europe's growth engine has lost steam as the euro zone's leaders have struggled to prevent a crisis that started in Greece nearly two years ago from contaminating larger countries like Italy and Spain. Instead, worries about high debt and deficit levels, and the health of European banks that hold the bonds of governments hit by the crisis, have spread. Even France -- which, together with Germany is paying most of the bill for the crisis -- has came under attack as investors grow more nervous about the state of its banks.
The United States is not blameless. As the world's largest economy, its slowdown, ignited by the collapse of Lehman Brothers investment bank and the global financial crisis that blew up on Wall Street in 2008, has ricocheted through other economies -- none of which has ever really recovered since then.
The downgrade to the United States' AAA rating by Standard and Poor's ratings agency last month also did more damage to European banks than initially thought, for instance, by forcing them to reprice the risks of what was once considered a totally risk-free asset -- United States Treasury securities.
Simon Tilford, the chief economist of the Center for European Reform in London, is among those who say Europe should not be looking to the United States or China or Japan for much additional help -- at least for now.
''What we'll see in coming months is the Americans and Asians will become more open in their expression of concern about way the Europeans are handling the crisis, because unless they do address key problems, including the banks, there is a risk this is going to trigger a Lehman 2,'' he said. ''They recognize Europe's strategy is not working, and they are starting to panic.''
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Economic said Thursday that the industrial nations were near stagnation and set to remain limp through the rest of the year, even if a downturn on the scale of the last one appeared unlikely.
Ms. Lagarde, the I.M.F. leader, delivered a speech in London Friday before she headed to join G-7 finance ministers meeting here. She said that governments with surpluses or the flexibility to use more direct fiscal action should do so -- meaning countries like Germany and France, presumably, even though she did not name them.
The world is ''collectively suffering from a crisis of confidence in the face of a deteriorating economic outlook,'' she said. ''Countries must act now and act boldly to steer their economies through this dangerous phase of the recovery.''
Ms. Lagarde also reiterated the fund's concern about the health of Europe's banks. She has recently suggested that the euro zone's bailout fund should be used to provide a big injection of capital into European banks.
On Friday, she added, ''Some banks need additional capital,'' warning of the possibility of ''a debilitating liquidity crisis.''

HEADLINE: Wall St. Follows Europe's Markets Down on Economic Uncertainty

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Jack Ewing and Nicholas Kulish contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
Stocks on Wall Street declined sharply, and 10-year bond yields hit fresh lows on Friday as developments in Europe related to sovereign debt problems weighed on the financial markets.
Analysts attributed the declines, which pushed down indexes more than 5 percent for the month to date, at least partly to reactions related to the resignation of a top financial official at the European Central Bank, a development that put a spotlight on the internal discord over the response to the debt crisis. Jurgen Stark, a German who is leaving his position on the executive board of the E.C.B., is known as an opponent of the bank's bond-buying program.
In addition, a Bloomberg News report said Germany was preparing banks in the event that Greece failed to meet the terms of its aid package and defaulted. 
''These are particularly negative headlines, and the market took them as such,'' said Dan Greenhaus, the chief global strategist at BTIG. ''Market participants are increasingly nervous about a Greek default and its effect on the already weak European bank sector.''
He added that the resignation news ''exacerbated'' concerns about the euro currency zone.
Greece's finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, dismissed the talk of a default and said it was committed to fully executing the terms of the aid package, Bloomberg News also reported.
But concern over the euro zone debt crisis, along with uncertainty related to global economic growth, has been a touchy factor affecting the markets for months.
The DAX in Germany fell 4 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain closed down 2.4 percent, and the CAC 40 index in France was down 3.6 percent.
Stocks in the United States followed markets in Europe. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks closed down 31.67 points, or 2.7 percent, at 1,154.23. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 303.68 points, or 2.7 percent, to 10,992.13, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 61.15 points, or 2.4 percent, to 2,467.99.
The S.& P. and the Dow were each down more than 4 percent in the week, and the Nasdaq was just over 3 percent lower.
A speech on jobs by President Obama did little to lift the malaise because of uncertainty over whether the program would pass and help the recovery, analysts said.
Paul Ballew, a former Federal Reserve economist and now chief economist at Nationwide, said short-term interest rates in Greece reflected uncertainty in Europe as well as speculation over whether there would be adequate restructuring in that nation's economy to address its problems.
Yields on Germany's 10-year bonds declined. In the United States, the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose to 101 27/32, and the yield fell to 1.92 percent from 1.98 percent late Thursday, after touching a low of 1.89 percent during the day.
''Issue No. 2 is the continued anxiety in the United States that the recovery continues to stall and that we will not be getting growth as strong as we would need in terms of corporate profits,'' said Mr. Ballew.
''Even yesterday's speech raises questions of whether there will be support for fiscal policy,'' he said about the president's jobs address.
Mr. Obama's plan focused on generating jobs and included a number of tax cuts and spending proposals, like an extension and expansion of the cut in payroll taxes and a tax holiday for small businesses for hiring new employees.
Mr. Ballew said that questions persisted about how much of the proposal would pass.
In addition, investors are awaiting a Federal Reserve policy meeting later this month. Stocks were sharply lower on Thursday after the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, gave no sign that there would be fresh stimulus measures.
''If you are in the market right now, you've got uncertainty on top of uncertainty on top of uncertainty,'' Mr. Ballew said. ''You have got a pretty toxic mix.''
Volatility, as measured by the Vix, was just over 40, its highest level since Aug. 22, when it was 42.44.
Energy, financials and materials stocks lost the most on Friday, or more than 3 percent each.
Clark Yingst, the chief market analyst at Joseph Gunnar, said that the fall of the euro against the dollar on Friday, resulting in a six-month low, suggested that the S.& P. 500 had not yet completed its recent correction.
''The market just doesn't believe that it is going to be passed by that Republican house,'' Mr. Yingst said of Mr. Obama's speech.
He noted that the United States bond's 10-year price recently touched record highs, with the yield lower than where it was in the midst of the global financial collapse, 2.055 percent in December 2008.
''It is an indication that bond investors clearly see a significant slowdown in the U.S. economy,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Fearing Loss of Weiner's Seat, Democrats Make a Late Push

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN and KATE TAYLOR; Raymond Hernandez contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Panicked Democrats are releasing a barrage of negative television advertising, turning to the national party for a cash infusion and pleading with President Obama's network of supporters for help as they confront what seemed impossible two months ago: defeat in the heavily Democratic House district last represented by Anthony D. Weiner.
Party leaders say the president's flagging popularity and defections among Jewish voters have left them facing the embarrassing possibility that their candidate, Assemblyman David I. Weprin, could lose New York's Ninth Congressional District to a little-known Republican businessman who has never held elected office.
A new poll released on Friday showed Bob Turner, the Republican, with a six-point lead over Mr. Weprin. The election is on Tuesday, and even though lawmakers have discussed eliminating the district in redistricting next year, the race has become symbolically important as an indication of how much Mr. Obama's unpopularity might affect other Democratic candidates. 
''This has been a difficult campaign, and this campaign has had some major operational problems,'' said Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, chairman of the Brooklyn Democratic Party.
Mr. Lopez said that he expected Mr. Weprin to win, but that the campaign needed to become much more aggressive in the final days.
Steven A. Greenberg, a pollster from Siena College, which conducted the survey, said the special election, though it was taking place in a traditionally Democratic section of Brooklyn and Queens, had become a chance for voters to register their unhappiness with the national economic and political climate. The poll, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, found that 54 percent of likely voters in the district had an unfavorable view of Mr. Obama, and nearly three quarters said the country was headed in the wrong direction.
''You have the potential perfect storm for the Republicans,'' Mr. Greenberg said. ''When the country is headed in the wrong direction, you want to blame the people who are there. And who are in charge? The Democrats.''
Mr. Turner has repeatedly sought to link Mr. Weprin with Mr. Obama; Mr. Weprin, for his part, has not highlighted the president in his campaign literature, and has instead featured the state's popular Democratic governor, Andrew M. Cuomo.
As a sign of how worried Democrats are, they are already engaging in back-room finger-pointing about who is most responsible for Mr. Weprin's plight. In Washington, several Democrats said in interviews that they believed the race was slipping away from their party; several cited Mr. Obama's unpopularity as the cause, but others blamed Mr. Weprin for running a weak campaign.
Party leaders, however, hope their heavy advantage in party registration -- and the help of labor unions -- will pull their struggling candidate to victory.
''In this environment, we take nothing for granted,'' said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But he pointed to factors in the party's favor, including a sizable get-out-the-vote effort and the final advertising blitz, which is being backed by more than $600,000 from party organizations.
Both campaigns plan to spend Saturday and Monday trying to bolster turnout in an election that is expected to draw only a small fraction of registered voters to the polls. Both candidates say they will not campaign on Sunday, which is the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
''Weprin has lost the campaign,'' said Bruce N. Gyory, a Democratic political consultant who was not involved in the race. ''Now it's about who wins the turnout.''
On Friday, in Douglaston, Queens, Mr. Weprin's brother, City Councilman Mark S. Weprin, met with several dozen teachers at Strawberry's Sports Grill to urge them to call fellow union members on behalf of the Weprin campaign. The United Federation of Teachers estimates there are teachers living in 11,000 households in the district.
The teachers, chatting over chicken wings at the back of the restaurant, proceeded to make calls on their cellphones.
Despite the ample signs of trouble for the Democratic campaign, Weprin supporters professed optimism.
''Look, you always like to be ahead in the polls,'' Councilman Weprin said. ''But this is not your typical race.''
He said that he thought the Weprin campaign had ''a much more motivated volunteer base'' and that ''who votes is going to decide this race.''
In Mr. Turner's small campaign office, in Howard Beach, Queens, about 20 people, many of them young volunteers clearly excited to be participating in politics, made phone calls and tapped away at computer keyboards. In one corner, Mr. Turner's sister-in-law, Maria Turner, cut articles about the race out of a stack of newspapers, to make a scrapbook for Mr. Turner's grandchildren. A whiteboard in the room reminded volunteers to tell voters that the campaign could give them rides to the polls -- though the campaign was asking volunteers to offer their cars because it could not afford rentals.
''Right now things look positive,'' Jesse Bohman, 24, said. ''We just need to keep calling people and knocking on doors.''
Mr. Weprin's campaign has been hurt by his lack of charisma, a handful of campaign gaffes and, most surprisingly, his position on Israel. He is an Orthodox Jew and staunch supporter of Israel, but former Mayor Edward I. Koch urged Jewish voters to reject Mr. Weprin as a way of protesting Mr. Obama's suggestion that pre-1967 borders of Israel should form the basis of a Middle East peace agreement.
Some prominent Orthodox Jewish leaders -- citing not only Mr. Obama's position on Israel but also Mr. Weprin's support of same-sex marriage -- have endorsed Mr. Turner, a Roman Catholic who has aggressively courted observant Jewish voters. A group of Jewish Republicans sent voters postcards featuring a Holocaust survivor attesting that, despite being a lifelong Democrat, she would vote for Mr. Turner.
Mr. Weprin, a former city councilman and the son of a former state Assembly speaker, has in the closing days of the campaign emphasized his promise to protect Medicare and other federal entitlement programs, and has warned that Mr. Turner would pose a risk to Social Security.
At the same time, Mr. Turner is getting some help from the National Organization for Marriage, which is urging voters to oppose Mr. Weprin because of his support for same-sex marriage. And Mr. Turner has enlisted several boldface names to record automated phone calls on his behalf, including Mr. Koch, Donald J. Trump and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who implored people to consider the national implications of the race.
''The entire country will be watching how you vote,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Perry and Social Security

 BODY:
To the Editor:
At this week's Republican presidential debate, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas was given the opportunity to repudiate his long-held view of Social Security as ''a crumbling monument to the failure of the New Deal.'' But instead, as you report, he ''doubled down,'' once again calling Social Security a ''monstrous lie'' (''Perry and Romney Joust Over Direction of G.O.P.,'' front page, Sept. 8). 
As President Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote in 1954: ''Should any political party attempt to abolish social security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things. Among them are H. L. Hunt [and] a few other Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or business man from other areas. Their number is negligible and they are stupid.''
Governor Perry is completely out of touch with the vast majority of the American people, who recognize Social Security's vital importance in providing economic security when wages are lost as a result of death, disability or old age. If Mr. Perry continues to defend those views, we predict, to quote John Wayne in ''True Grit,'' ''You do it and it'll be the biggest mistake you ever made, you Texas brushpopper!''

HEADLINE: Rise of the Fallen?

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
The man was on fire!
President Obama was champing at the bit during Thursday night's speech to a joint session of Congress. He'd had it with those do-nothings. He was going to show everyone that he could be tough -- and he did.
So why does it feel as if we've been here before? Why does it feel as if we've heard him ''give it to them'' before only to have him lighten up and give in later? Because we have, that's why. 
Yes, Thursday's speech was an encouraging shift in tone with a meaty jobs plan of the president's own design.
Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, even gave USA Today a glowing review of the plan. The paper reported it this way: ''The plan, if enacted would boost economic growth next year by 2 percentage points and create two million additional jobs.'' Of course, it will never be passed as is, but the positive analysis is still a nice feather in the president's cap.
But, in the end, it was just another speech. It didn't answer definitively the larger questions that remain for this president:
Has he truly shifted strategy or is his tonal shifting merely temporal?
Has he finally realized that you can't rub the belly of the beast that wants to eat you, that you have to fight your way off the plate and bring the monster to heel?
Has he come to understand that Americans value valiant struggle over bloodless surrender?
Does he have any interest in becoming the Obama of people's imaginations, the one they thought they saw through the showers of streamers, and explosions of confetti in 2008 -- the man who only ever existed in their own minds?
Is the ''transformative president'' more than an opportunistic transformer, shifting shape to suit the moment, but truly settling on none?
And can any adjustment halt the precipitous slide in the number of people who see him as an effective leader? According to a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released last week, the number of people who rated the president ''very good'' at having strong leadership qualities has steadily dropped from 70 percent the month he took office to 42 percent last month. It's not that people don't believe him, it's that an increasing number don't believe in him. And that is far more dangerous politically.
Obama can and must answer these questions, and quickly.
He isn't only battling a calcifying cynicism about the inefficacy of government in general, he's battling the rapidly hardening public perception that he himself is a product of what I call the doughnut doctrine of leadership -- soft, glazy, hollow in the middle and ideally suited for getting dunked.
Americans want him to clearly identify his core beliefs. It's simple: They want to fully understand his values and how they apply to us as individuals and as a country. Moreover, they want to be completely convinced that he is willing to defend it all. The vacillation between hot and cold, stern and pliable, resolute and accommodating hasn't inspired that confidence.
Americans respect authenticity and conviction even when they don't fully agree with it. Conviction bespeaks strength; strength bespeaks power; and, for better or worse, this is a culture that applauds and is comforted by power.
Obama has a list of accomplishments as long as your arm. But a less-than-masterly use of the bully pulpit has allowed both opponents and supposed allies to minimize them. A very vocal part of the progressive base has painted many of his successes as capitulations, while many on the far right have painted them as a threat to the security and solvency of the republic. That's the problem with lingering too long in the middle: you take fire from both sides.
And then there is the prickly racial question that we dare not raise lest the raiser him or herself be called a race baiter: can the president win back enough of the white and Hispanic support? A Gallup report issued this week found that the president's approval rating among both whites and Hispanics had dropped to the lowest point of his presidency. Since he was elected, his approval rating among whites has dropped by 43 percent and by 36 percent among Hispanics, but it has dropped nearly 9 percent among blacks.
There is no way to fully understand this racial movement, but there is no denying that it exists. Maybe some blacks are stubbornly sticking with him, in part for racial reasons. Maybe some whites and Hispanics are drifting away from him, in part for the same reasons. Who knows? But the dramatic difference points to something that exists beneath the surface and beyond policy.
Whatever the reason, it's hard to imagine a successful re-election bid for a president who can only muster a third of the white vote and half of the Hispanic vote. That should send ice-cold shudders of fear through every Democrat because the leading Republican contenders for the job are either hopelessly hokey, obviously plastic, horribly misguided or some other form of terrible.
Gov. Rick Perry, the newly minted Republican presidential front-runner, participated in his first presidential debate on Wednesday and did his best imitation of Andy Griffith on acid. He said that he believes Social Security is a Ponzi scheme, global warming is based on shaky science and hasn't struggled at all with executing more inmates in Texas than any governor in recent American history.
This man shouldn't even be allowed to traipse his boots and spurs into the White House for a visit, let alone take up residence there.
And even beyond re-elections, it will be hard for the president to accrue enough political capital to effectively finish out this term with approval numbers like the ones he has had.
Thursday's jobs speech was a good start toward a positive change if, indeed, it was a genuine start and not part of a pattern of fits and starts. The president was on fire, but the jury is still out on whether that fire was just another flash of light or a source of sustainable heat and whether some people would rather freeze than warm to him.

HEADLINE: White House Plans Effort To Refinance Mortgages

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM; Louise Story contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is seeking to broaden access to a two-year-old refinancing program that has helped far fewer homeowners take advantage of low interest rates than initially expected.
President Obama announced the effort Thursday night as part of his package of measures to spur job creation, saying it would help ''responsible homeowners'' by reducing their monthly mortgage payments, and bolster the economy as they spent the money on other things instead.
''I know you guys must be for this,'' Mr. Obama told a joint session of Congress, ''because that's a step that can put more than $2,000 a year in a family's pocket, and give a lift to an economy still burdened by the drop in housing prices.'' 
The Home Affordable Refinance Program was set up to help homeowners who cannot qualify for loans from private companies. The government-owned companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agreed to offer loans at lower rates to borrowers with mortgage debts up to 125 percent of the value of their homes.
The administration had predicted that millions of homeowners would benefit, but through the end of June, the companies refinanced only 838,000 mortgages. Falling home values reduced the numbers of eligible borrowers. So did strict income requirements that excluded people even if they had never missed a mortgage payment. And large fees exceeded the potential available savings in some cases.
Administration officials said Friday that they were examining a range of issues and hoped to complete new guidelines in the next few weeks.
Economists, including the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, see the poor housing market as a crucial reason the economy is not growing faster. Business interests and consumer advocates have pressed the White House for grand plans, arguing that the economy will not fully recover as long as the housing market is depressed.
But some of the president's key advisers worry that efforts to aid struggling homeowners will infuriate people who do not need help, and the memory remains fresh in Washington that the Tea Party movement began as an angry response to a mortgage aid program.
The modest proposal this week to expand the refinancing program emerged from months of deliberations. Just two sentences about it were included in the speech after an internal debate, and Mr. Obama was careful to say that the plan was aimed at ''responsible homeowners.''
He also proposed investing $15 billion to rehabilitate vacant and foreclosed properties, creating construction jobs and helping to refresh blighted neighborhoods.
While most of Mr. Obama's stimulus plan requires the consent of Congressional Republicans, expanding the refinancing program must instead be negotiated with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the independent guardian of Fannie and Freddie.
The agency is charged with limiting losses at the two companies, which fall to taxpayers, and it has resisted some ideas that could increase those losses.
But Edward J. DeMarco, the agency's acting director, said Friday in a statement that he shared the administration's desire to expand the program because broadening eligibility might benefit both homeowners and the companies, by limiting defaults.
''The final outcome of this review remains uncertain, but F.H.F.A. believes this undertaking is worthwhile and consistent without our conservator responsibilities,'' Mr. DeMarco said.
The financial implications depend on the particulars. In a recent paper, however, the Congressional Budget Office said Fannie and Freddie could refinance an additional 2.9 million loans without significantly increasing taxpayers' liability.
The office calculated that such a program would save homeowners about $7.4 billion in the first year and help about 111,000 of those homeowners avoid default. It said the cost to the government would be about $600 million, because the loss of revenues from future interest payments on the refinanced loans would exceed the savings from reducing defaults.

HEADLINE: Syrian Protesters Call for International Protection From President Assad's Crackdown

BYLINE: By NADA BAKRI

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Tens of thousands of Syrians took to the streets on Friday to call for international protection from President Bashar al-Assad's crackdown on pro-democracy activists who have been trying to topple his government for more than five months.
Political and human rights campaigners said that large crowds demonstrated in several cities and towns across the country after noon prayers, and that security forces fired live ammunition at them, killing at least 10 protesters, including a 15-year-old in the northern province of Idlib and a 19-year-old in the eastern city of Deir al-Zour. 
Activists also said that at least eight soldiers were killed in al-Kiswah and Zabadani, two suburbs of Damascus, the capital, for refusing to fire at protesters. Defections among low-level soldiers have increased in the past couple of weeks but have yet to threaten the unity of the army. Many of those who desert their positions in the mostly Sunni rank-and-file army are either arrested, killed or simply drop out of sight, residents have reported.
Friday's demonstrations were an outcry for the international community to interfere on behalf of Syrians, who face the wrath of troops and armed men in plain clothes loyal to Mr. Assad on a daily basis.
Activists say that many Syrians are growing more and more frustrated as they are realizing that street demonstrations alone might not lead to the toppling of the government without the help of foreign powers.
Posters and banners held across the country on Friday read ''The Syrian people demand international protection for civilians,'' and ''After all these killings and assaults, where is international protection?'' Many chanted, ''The people want the execution of the president.''
''We know this is a sensitive slogan -- to ask America and Europe to protect us from our brothers in the country -- but what can we do?'' said a political activist in Damascus who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''We have entered the sixth month and there is no hope that the Assad regime will stop the killings and arrests.''
Activists said that the number of Syrians who would welcome foreign involvement against the leadership has greatly increased in the past month, encouraged by the fall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, whose government fell with the help of foreign military assistance.
The United States and European countries have imposed a series of economic sanctions on Syria that singled out top officials and government institutions, and many have called on Mr. Assad to step down, but a military intervention similar to the NATO bombing of Libya has not been seriously considered.
Even Syria's closest ally, Iran, has called on its leadership to end the crackdown and hold talks with the opposition, in surprising comments delivered this week by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which signaled growing unease with the unrest there.
Iran crushed its own pro-democracy protesters in 2009 after Mr. Ahmadinejad was re-elected to a second term in office.
''I can say that half of the Syrian people will accept international intervention to finish the bloodshed in our country,'' said Hani, 30, a protester from al-Midan neighborhood in Damascus. ''I think foreign countries will have more sympathy for us than the Assad regime.'' One person was killed in al-Midan, according to the Local Coordination Committees, a group of activists who are involved in tracking and documenting the uprising.
But there remain many voices that are warning against foreign intervention and want the uprising to stay peaceful in the face of the government's security measures.
Residents and activists said that large demonstrations broke out in Homs, a restive city nicknamed by Syrians as the capital of the revolution. Homs was raided by the army and security forces several times in the past week in the search for more than a dozen soldiers who defected there and for activists involved in planning demonstrations. At least seven people were killed when security forces fired at demonstrations in different neighborhoods.
They also reported big protests in Deir al-Zour, in the east near the Iraqi border, a region that was attacked last month; in the Kurdish northeast; in Idlib, near Turkey; and in southern Syria, near Jordan.
Activists said that at least 27 civilians died in the military assault on Homs this past week. Human Rights Watch said that security forces forcibly removed 18 wounded people from a hospital in the city on Wednesday and prevented medical workers from reaching those who were hurt in the attack.
The crackdown on pro-democracy activists has killed at least 2,200 people from mid-March to mid-August by the United Nations' account, but other activists say that the number now exceeds 3,000 with thousands of others in jails and secret detention centers.
The government of Mr. Assad, who came to power in 2000, disputes the numbers and says that it is facing a foreign conspiracy to divide Syria, and that it is battling foreign armed groups who have killed more than 500 police officers and soldiers.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Is Cautious In Jobs Response

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Armed with worrisome poll data and seeking to maintain the legislative upper hand, Congressional Republicans who have spent the balance of the year pouring buckets of criticism on the Obama administration are shifting to a more restrained approach as they ponder how to respond to the president's jobs plan.
Back from a summer break in their districts -- where they faced constituents howling about Washington bickering and intransigence -- Republicans on Friday left the door open to several elements of the president's $447 billion jobs package of tax cuts and spending programs, even those that just five weeks ago were met with vehement opposition.
The abrupt change in tone and substance after months of searing budget fights that turned off a watching public suggested that Republicans on Capitol Hill were anxious about entering the 2012 races with a reputation more for confrontation than compromise. 
''People expect results, and they're very frustrated that they are not seeing that coming out of Washington,'' Representative Charles Boustany Jr., Republican of Louisiana, said in an interview. ''That implies that we have to have some compromise, some area where we agree that we're going to move things forward for the better.''
Speaker John A. Boehner and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia are also taking a more conciliatory approach than in previous fiscal battles, when both men essentially declared war on the administration's policies. ''We are going to work together,'' Mr. Cantor said, adding, ''I think it's time to build consensus here.''
On Friday, the two leaders sent an exceedingly polite letter to Mr. Obama asking that he send any bills containing his jobs plans to the Congressional Budget Office so that their costs can be evaluated. ''It is our desire to work together to find common ground between your ideas and ours,'' the letter read, in a significant switch from a few weeks ago, when Mr. Cantor, in an interview on The Wall Street Journal's Web site, said Mr. Obama was ''over his head as to what to do about the economy.''
Of course, this is not exactly a loving courtship; it is more like two families joined at a wedding that both would rather not attend. Republicans, whose views on Mr. Obama's plans are still being formulated, may well be seeking to tamp down criticism that they are shrill or contributing to stagnant employment, with many of their members facing re-election in Democratic strongholds. The dynamic may mirror that of the House under Newt Gingrich in 1996; after a prolonged fight with President Bill Clinton about the budget, long-stalled domestic legislation ultimately came to bipartisan fruition.
On Thursday and Friday, after Mr. Obama's speech, Republicans cited areas where they thought there could be agreement. Many Republicans, like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, now say they are open to the idea of a payroll tax cut, especially one extended to small businesses, and pointed to the three free trade bills as worthy of support.
''I think it was admirable, and I appreciate that he spoke the truth about entitlements,'' said Representative Michael G. Grimm of New York, referring to Mr. Obama's remarks concerning his determination to adjust Medicare. (Last month, as the chosen speaker for the Republican weekly address, Mr. Grimm said Mr. Obama needed to ''wake up to reality, abandon his failed policies and join Republicans in the hard work needed to turn our country around and create jobs.'')
In another sign of Republican desire to avoid partisan collision, the House and Senate on Friday reached a deal on a bill to extend the operating authority of the Federal Aviation Administration through the end of January 2012 and highway and transit aid programs through the end of March. Representative John L. Mica, Republican of Florida, said that his party would not include spending cuts or contentious policy provisions in the bill and that Democrats, too, had made concessions.
Whether the current tone is largely a tactic or could produce some legislative agreement remains to be seen as the president and his Congressional opponents have weeks to hash out the jobs legislation as well as other contentious issues on the calendar.
Indeed, Republicans are not backing down from their own fiscal agenda, which will be heavy this month in deregulation bills and curbs on unions. Many elements of Mr. Obama's plan are known irritants to Republicans, in spite of the president's claim to the contrary, including the $4,000 tax credit to employers for hiring long-term unemployed workers or tax credits for new hires.
Some House Republicans suggest that dismantling pieces of the administration's regulatory regime could be part of a trade-off with the administration for advancing some of the president's jobs agenda, though members insist that they have not seen enough details to know where potential compromise could be found. ''I don't think anyone is dismissing the president's ideas,'' Representative Candice S. Miller of Michigan said. ''It's just, 'Where are the details?' ''
Further, to many Republican members, policies already embraced by their party are the only thing on Mr. Obama's wish list they are interested in, which means that much of his plan will be seriously tested in both chambers. ''Our goal should not be to find middle ground,'' said Representative Trent Franks of Arizona, ''but true common ground.''
The new era of propitiation was conceived by the House Republican leadership, a group that other members, particularly those belonging to the conservative Republican Study Committee, have been known to buck.
Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, who heads the organization to re-elect Republican House members, derided the payroll tax cut on Friday as a ''horrible idea,'' and said, ''I respect our leaders, but I found what the president said to be out of balance.'' His organization, the National Republican Congressional Committee, has already distributed talking points to Republican candidates, telling them to blame the president for all manner of the nation's woes.
And illustrating something of disconnect between Republican leaders and their current field of White House hopefuls, Republican presidential candidates had no truck for Mr. Obama's plan.
Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, said in a statement that it ''is guided by his mistaken belief that we can spend our way to prosperity.'' Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, called the plan ''960 days late'' in a campaign video.
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota did not attend Mr. Obama's speech, but immediately responded. ''Every time the president speaks,'' she said, ''his policies have cost the American people jobs and future prosperity.''
Mrs. Bachmann will not find a partner in pique with a fellow Republican from Minnesota, Representative Chip Cravaack, who is seeking re-election in a traditionally Democratic district. ''I hope that we start working together more and find solutions to problems,'' he said Friday. ''I am willing to compromise on anything that provides a solution.''

HEADLINE: And The Good News Is ...

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Finally, we're coming to a consensus about what's wrong with the economy. It's us. And our bad attitude.
Ben Bernanke says we're too depressed. On Thursday, the Fed chairman suggested that consumers have an irrationally negative worldview.
''Even taking into account the many financial pressures that they face, households seem exceptionally cautious,'' he told an audience in Minnesota, where the Twins are in last place, attendance at the state fair was way down and the state's best-known elected official is Michele Bachmann. Also, star hockey player Dustin Byfuglien was arrested on Lake Minnetonka on suspicion of boating while intoxicated. 
Meanwhile overseas, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, expressed concern that ''the world is collectively suffering from a crisis of confidence.'' Which is not helped by the fact that nobody can hear the words ''International Monetary Fund'' without thinking sleazy French pol in a hotel room with the maid.
On Friday, President Obama told Americans to ''shake off all the naysaying and the anxiety and the hand-wringing.'' He is on the road, following up on the big jobs speech he gave before Congress. It got a pretty good reaction, which would probably have been even more positive if the television broadcasts had not been interspersed with reports that Homeland Security was searching for a trio of terrorist truckers.
The president is urging people to contact their elected representatives and tell them to pass his proposals: ''I want you to call. I want you to e-mail. I want you to tweet. I want you to fax. I want you to visit. I want you to Facebook ... Send a carrier pigeon.''
Now that last one might really work. Truly, if the Republican House Conference was inundated by a couple hundred thousand angry carrier pigeons, there would probably be a real reaction.
You may want to do the other stuff, too, because you are concerned citizens, people. But the idea that the president's opponents are going to come around to his way of thinking because they're buried in tweets and faxes is not a likely scenario.
''In a Frank Capra movie, maybe,'' said Michael Beschloss, the presidential historian.
I think there's another opening here for citizen involvement. If the problem is attitude, declare war on the national funk. Every time you hear a depressing piece of news, come back with something cheerful.
For instance, the weather has been absolutely horrendous. We've had everything this summer but locusts. However, on the plus-side, Fox News has reported that the earthquake in the Washington area caused Robert Valderzak, a 75-year-old patient at a Veterans Affairs Hospital, to regain his hearing.
The price of gas is approaching $4 a gallon in some places. On the other hand, Beyonce is pregnant.
Some viewers of this week's Republican debate found it depressing that Rick Perry, who has referred to evolution as ''a theory that's out there'' also did not seem to believe in climate change, and appeared to be under the impression that Galileo was persecuted for his belief in the earth revolving around the sun by his fellow scientists, rather than the religious establishment.
However, it did give us a welcome chance for a national discussion about Galileo, who does not get mentioned nearly enough.
And did you notice that the University of Cambridge has reported that high levels of chocolate consumption might help reduce the risk of heart disease? That the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention named moderate alcohol consumption as one of ''four healthy lifestyle behaviors'' that helps increase longevity? This has to be confidence-building information. If you wait around long enough, scientists will probably discover that virtually everything is much better for you than you originally believed. Except mammograms.
Go through any issue of the paper and you'll find positive stories you can share with your friends, possibly over a glass of merlot and a Hershey bar. In South Africa, there's word at the University of the Witwatersrand of an important new fossil discovery. Nicholas Wade reported in The Times that ''the bones are especially well preserved because their owners apparently fell into a deep cave and a few weeks later were swept into sediment that quickly fossilized their bones.'' Focus on the scientific aspects of this development while glossing over the fact that for an increasing number of American college graduates now working on their fourth unpaid internship, falling into a deep cave and becoming fossilized may begin to sound like a good career plan.
Those bones are estimated to be about 2 million years old. Perhaps better not to mention that to Rick Perry.

HEADLINE: Employers Say Jobs Plan Won't Lead to Hiring Spur

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH; Reporting was contributed by Steve Lohr, Duff Wilson, Damon Darlin, Reed Abelson and Robb Mandelbaum in New York, Clifford Krauss in Houston and Andrew Pollack in Los Angeles.

 BODY:
The dismal state of the economy is the main reason many companies are reluctant to hire workers, and few executives are saying that President Obama's jobs plan -- while welcome -- will change their minds any time soon.
That sentiment was echoed across numerous industries by executives in companies big and small on Friday, underscoring the challenge for the Obama administration as it tries to encourage hiring and perk up the moribund economy.
The plan failed to generate any optimism on Wall Street as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average each fell about 2.7 percent.
As President Obama faced an uphill battle in Congress to win support even for portions of the plan, many employers dismissed the notion that any particular tax break or incentive would be persuasive. Instead, they said they tended to hire more workers or expand when the economy improved. 
Companies are focused on jittery consumer confidence, an unstable stock market, perceived obstacles to business expansion like government regulation and, above all, swings in demand for their products.
''You still need to have the business need to hire,'' said Jeffery Braverman, owner of Nutsonline, an e-commerce company in Cranford, N.J., that sells nuts and dried fruit. While a $4,000 credit could offset the cost of the company's lowest-cost health insurance plan, he said, it would not spur him to hire someone. ''Business demand is what drives hiring,'' he said.
Indeed, the industries that are hiring workers now -- like technology and energy -- are those where business is strong, in contrast to the overall economy. Administration officials and some economists, of course, say they believe the president's plan, if adopted, could help increase demand more broadly. The proposed payroll tax cuts for individuals should spur consumer spending and in turn, prompt companies to hire more people.
But the plan also includes incentives for companies to hire more workers, including a payroll tax cut for businesses and a $4,000 tax credit for those employers that hire people who have been out of work for six months or more.
To the extent these measures could be used, many employers said they would most likely support people whom companies were planning to hire anyway.
Chesapeake Energy, one of the biggest explorers of oil and gas in shale fields across the country, for example, said it had 800 positions open, and had already received tax credits for hiring the long-term unemployed.
But Michael Kehs, vice president for strategic affairs and public relations, said in an e-mail that the credit ''does not drive our hiring.''
For others, the math just does not add up. Roger Tung, the chief executive of Concert Pharmaceuticals, said the company, a privately held biotechnology firm with 45 employees, would save $150,000 a year from the proposed corporate payroll tax deductions.
But that is still not enough to cover the cost of hiring even one additional employee at the Lexington, Mass., company, Mr. Tung said, once benefits and other expenses besides salary are included. He can hire, he said, only when investors become confident again and the company can raise more money.
Economists estimated that President Obama's plan, costing an estimated $447 billion if it were ever fully adopted, could create anywhere from 500,000 to nearly two million jobs next year.
Most of those jobs would be added, economists say, as workers spend the additional take-home pay that would result from a proposed payroll tax cut for employees. As consumers increase spending, that can prompt more hiring by retailers, washing machine makers, restaurants and more.
Some of the new jobs would also probably come from measures like the proposed $35 billion to retain or hire teachers, police and firefighters, as well as $30 billion to refurbish school buildings and $50 billion to build or repair highways, railroads, transit systems and waterways.
Construction workers in particular are in dire need of work, as they were among the hardest hit by the collapse of the housing market. More than a million construction workers are still looking for employment.
''There are so many trades people sitting at home waiting for jobs, and we have to turn them down because we don't have work, '' said Syed Habib, secretary of Falak Construction, a contractor in North Brunswick, N.J., that works on public projects and is hoping that the school modernization measure passes.
Some analysts said the president's proposal to cut payroll taxes for the first $5 million of a business's payroll taxes could give some companies a reason to hire, though mostly at the margins.
In the pharmaceutical industry, for example, where tens of thousands of employees have lost jobs in the last few years, a lowered payroll tax could significantly affect labor costs, said Richard M. Gordon, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.
''So it's a little less likely that people will be fired, and a little more likely that people will be hired in pharmaceutical companies that are doing well,'' Mr. Gordon said.
President Obama's jobs plan would actually have a detrimental effect on other parts of the health care industry, some officials said. Hospitals warned that the proposals could end up crimping their hiring if the president's programs were paid for with sharp reductions in the federal Medicare program.
Lloyd H. Dean, the chief executive of Catholic Healthcare West, a large health system that employs some 55,000 people in California, Arizona and Nevada, praised Mr. Obama's efforts to promote job growth. But, he said in a statement, ''Approximately 65 percent of the people we care for are insured through Medicare or Medicaid, and any further cuts in reimbursements from those programs will severely impact our ability to hire and retain workers.''
Even some company officials among the president's invited guests at the joint address expressed concerns about how the government could pay for such a large package.
David Catalano, who helped found Modea, a digital advertising company in Blacksburg, Va., said that he was wary of the president's pledge to ask the ''wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to pay their fair share.''
His company was organized as an S Corporation, in which profits are passed through to shareholders, so it would face higher taxes under the president's proposal, he said.
He added: ''My partner and I have reinvested 100 percent of the profits that our agency has made over the last five years back into the company. If the government takes a bigger share of that from me, it directly impedes my ability to grow the agency.''
Perhaps the most intractable problem facing the economy right now is the plight of the long-term unemployed. More than six million people have been searching for jobs for six months or longer. But with the growing stigma that employees attach to this group of people, the president's proposal to give employers $4,000 tax credits for hiring the long-term unemployed is likely to be a hard sell among companies.
Jen-Hsun Huang, the chief executive of the chip maker Nvidia, a Santa Clara, Calif., designer of chips for smartphones and tablets, said that because of growth in those markets, the company, which currently employs about 5,000 of its 7,000 global workers in the United States, expects to add about 20 percent more people within the next year.
But he said the incentives would not influence the company's hiring decisions. ''The people we hire tend not to be out of work for six months,'' said Mr. Huang. Instead, he said, the company recruits recent graduates from the country's top engineering schools. ''The guys we hire are like sports stars,'' he said.
Lucious Plant, work force development administrator in Montgomery County, Ohio, where Dayton is the county seat, said companies were shortsighted for viewing people who had been out of work for several months as somehow inferior. Given today's economy, he said, it was common for those who lost their jobs to stay unemployed for six months or more, and that many of those workers were highly skilled.
''I think it would be very easy to have six months of unemployment and still be a top candidate,'' Mr. Plant said.
But more people needing work than the current business climate warrants.
''If I get a $4,000 benefit for hiring you and I pay you $80,000 and you're going to sit at your desk and do nothing because there's nothing to do,'' said Marty Regalia, chief economist of the United States Chamber of Commerce, ''then the businesses aren't going to hire you.''

HEADLINE: House Freshmen Emerge as G.O.P. Power Brokers

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
CONWAY, S.C. -- Voters here were showing Representative Tim Scott the love, and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas looked as if he might jump across the stage and give Mr. Scott, a Republican freshman, a kiss himself.
Mr. Scott, who represents a coastal swath of this early primary state, had invited Mr. Perry to speak in a town-hall-style meeting last weekend with his constituents, the third Republican presidential candidate to do so. After introducing Mr. Perry as ''perhaps the next president of the United States,'' the two bantered about Mr. Scott's ''mama,'' taxes and guns to peals of laughter and applause. Mr. Perry beamed, bathing in the light of Mr. Scott's local star.
That Mr. Scott is emerging as a power broker in the South Carolina Republican primary says much about the trajectory of his career and influence since being elected to Congress last year on the leading edge of the Tea Party wave. Along with three fellow Republican freshmen in the House from South Carolina -- one of the most concentrated manifestations of the conservative populism that has reshaped the party -- Mr. Scott has shown he can help advance his agenda in Congress and is now flexing his muscles in presidential politics as well. 
The four South Carolina freshmen -- Mr. Scott and Representatives Jeff Duncan, Trey Gowdy and Mick Mulvaney -- have been among the most prominent faces of the anti-Washington movement. They were among the 66 Republican House members to vote against the deal to raise the debt ceiling, and they remain popular in South Carolina, a state where the Tea Party has been the wind beneath the wings of Senator Jim DeMint and the hot breath on the neck of Senator Lindsey Graham, whose occasional deviations from orthodoxy have left some conservatives grumbling about him.
In a state that could play a vital role in the selection of a presidential nominee, the blessing of the Freshmen Four would be enormously helpful to candidates looking for some Tea Party sheen, and demonstrate the unusual power that they enjoy within their state's party.
''What our freshmen did is, they went to D.C., they took a stand even against their own leadership,'' said Chad Connelly, the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. ''They say, 'This is why we were elected, this is what we believe in,' and that makes them popular.''
The four find their phones ringing and their e-mail inboxes filling with requests for support from the presidential candidates. ''They're obviously more refined in their efforts than to flat-out ask for an endorsement,'' said Mr. Gowdy, who says he is unlikely to give one. ''But they all regularly ask to sit down and meet with me, and I can't imagine it is because I am such good company.''
Mr. Mulvaney has already signed on as an economic advisor to the Perry campaign, a small coup that the campaign spent Labor Day promoting. The invitation to advise Mr. Perry was extended, Mr. Mulvaney said, because of his work on the ''cut, cap and balance'' deficit-reduction bill that passed the House this summer but was defeated in the Senate. Mr. Duncan is still examining his options in terms of affiliating himself with a candidate, as is Mr. Scott.
''I will step out there,'' Mr. Scott said. ''I'm still looking, probably for the next 60 days.''
Mr. Scott brings something else to the table: he is one of only two black Republicans in Congress right now, which candidates also see as a boon. ''We hear all the time, 'How are you going to reach out to the African-American vote?' '' Mr. Connelly said. ''I always tell people two words: Tim Scott. He has proved that conservatives have principles that are attractive to black Americans.''
The four freshmen were present on Labor Day at a cheerful grilling of several presidential candidates on constitutional and fiscal issues led by Mr. DeMint, the forum's host. That the major candidates are all competing for conservative support here underscores the importance of a state that could well winnow the field after the initial contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. While Mr. Perry and Mitt Romney are beginning to build their operations, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, has the deepest and most professional infrastructure in the state, where he is hoping that the open primary system will attract more moderate voters to his cause. He was Mr. Scott's first town hall guest, back in May.
Mr. Huntsman has also picked up some of the earliest endorsements of elected officials in the state, including Attorney General Alan Wilson, the son of Representative Joe Wilson, and Henry McMaster, a former attorney general.
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who is chairwoman of the Tea Party caucus in the House, has the strongest grass-roots effort in the state, several political advisers here said.
But if South Carolina is where the currents of 2010 are meeting the tides of 2012, it is not yet clear whether voters will apply the same values to choosing a president that they did in choosing members of the House.
''If you look last year at the electorate, there was a mood for something new,'' Richard Quinn, the high-powered South Carolina strategist who helped Senator John McCain win the primary in 2008 and is now advising Mr. Huntsman, said in pointing to Nikki Haley's victory in the governor's race. ''There is reason to believe that may continue.''
However, traditionally, ''we pick mainstream conservatives in this state rather than far right-wingers,'' Mr. Quinn added. ''Whether that will hold true, we will see. I think Jon Huntsman will make it clear you need to focus on electability.''
While a block endorsement from the four freshmen would be powerful, it seems unlikely, largely because Mr. Gowdy said he did not want any candidate to feel unwelcome in his district. Mr. Scott insists all of his options are open. ''I get a call or an e-mail from a candidate every week,'' he said. ''I am both a social and fiscal conservative, and I am looking for someone who has the panoramic view of what it takes to restore jobs and our nation.''

HEADLINE: Threat by Turkish Premier Raises Tensions With Israel

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER; Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Paris, and J. David Goodman from New York.

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Israel was wrestling on Friday with growing tensions with Turkey after the Turkish prime minister threatened to use his navy to accompany aid flotillas to Gaza and to challenge Israel's plans for gas exploration and export in the Eastern Mediterranean.
The prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told Al Jazeera, the pan-Arab network, that he would use his warships to prevent Israeli commandos from again boarding a Gaza-bound ship as they did last year, killing nine passengers, and from letting Israel exploit natural gas resources at sea. 
A United Nations report issued a week ago criticized the commandos' actions but said Israel's blockade was legal, which was not what Turkey had hoped to hear. It demanded an apology from Israel -- which refused, as it has from the earliest days of the flotilla raid, when it expressed regrets -- and then took steps to express its displeasure, including expelling the Israeli ambassador and cutting military ties.
Dan Meridor, Israel's intelligence minister, responded on Friday to Mr. Erdogan's recent threats, saying they were ''grave and serious.'' He told Army Radio, however, that he did not want to get into verbal saber rattling.
In Washington, the State Department urged leaders of both countries to avoid a war of words. ''We would like to see both sides cool it and get back to a place where they can have a productive relationship,'' the spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, told reporters. Activists with the Free Gaza Movement, who have organized a series of flotillas to challenge Israel's blockade of the Palestinian coastal strip, said they had no announcement about any efforts to come but that the most recent, which was stopped by Greece and Cyprus in June, would not be the last.
But Israeli diplomats and experts here and abroad said that while they were not overly concerned about a flotilla to Gaza materializing soon, the naval threat regarding the gas fields could prove more dangerous.
''Israel and Cyprus reached agreement dividing the water between the two of them for gas drilling,'' Alon Liel, a former ambassador to Turkey said. ''Turkey said the division was illegal. Israel is also clashing with Lebanon on demarcation and drilling rights. Turkey will also support Lebanon and things could escalate.''
Mr. Liel said that Israel hoped to export its gas via Cyprus in a few years, and that would require the digging of a large port there -- something that he imagined that Turkey would try to prevent. That could mean possible clashes between Israel and Turkey like those Turkey has had with Greece over drilling and demarcation.
Israel's foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, has ordered studies on how to defend Israelis from being prosecuted by the Turks over the flotilla attack last year -- including urging Israelis associated with the military to avoid flying there -- and get back at Turkey for its growing anti-Israel stand. Officials who spoke of the studies said they were still in the realm of brainstorming and were far from being accepted as policy. They included getting closer to Armenia, Turkey's historic rival, and the minority Kurds in eastern Turkey, who along with Kurds in neighboring countries hope for an independent state.
Some analysts said Turkey's rejection of the United Nations report showed hypocrisy. Before the commission issued its account, Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, asserted on Turkish television that the report would ''reaffirm the supremacy of international law.'' After it was issued, Turkish officials declared the report null and void.
Mr. Erdogan's comments come before a planned trip to Egypt and a meeting with President Obama the week after. Henri Barkey, a professor of international relations at Lehigh University, said Mr. Erdogan was trying to force the United States into the uncomfortable position of choosing between its ally Israel and Turkey, a NATO-member nation.
Turkey announced last week that it would host a NATO missile defense shield to protect against a potential strike from Iran. If tensions between Israel and Turkey increase, that could put NATO in a delicate spot.
''This is very high-stakes poker,'' Professor Barkey said. ''It's very, very dangerous.''
Sinan Ulgen, director of EDAM, a center for economics and foreign policy studies in Istanbul, said he, too, was worried. ''The latest threat is not only diplomatically difficult, but may even require direct U.S. involvement if Israel and Turkey come to face each other in the Eastern Mediterranean,'' he said. ''And the only one capable of coming between them is the United States, and the U.S. Sixth Fleet.''

HEADLINE: The Enlightened Rich Want to Be Taxed: Capitalists know that slashing social spending can undercut future competitiveness

 BODY:
Some of the world's wealthiest people are calling for higher taxes on the rich. They seem to recognize that the burden of the economic downturn cannot be borne entirely by the poor and middle class. 
After the American billionaire investor Warren Buffett urged Congress last month to raise taxes on millionaires, the call echoed across Europe. Sixteen of France's wealthiest individuals urged the government to raise their taxes. The Italian Formula One magnate Luca di Montezemolo publicly backed Mr. Buffett's idea ''for reasons of fairness and solidarity.'' About 50 of Germany's richest people have been campaigning for a higher top tax rate since 2009.
The suggestion is motivated, no doubt, by a sense of justice -- that the very rich, who have survived the financial crisis very well, should contribute more to shrinking public coffers to reduce the spending cuts that would hurt the most vulnerable.
But altruism does not fully explain why members of the global elite are suddenly keen to prevent the deep budget reductions that will occur if governments don't raise more money. They are also moved by what some might call enlightened self-interest.
Their walls may be high, but the wealthy live in the same world as the poor and the middle class, who have been walloped by unemployment and cuts to social welfare programs. When Mercedes-Benzes burned in Berlin and riots broke out on London's streets, the rich were watching on TV.
These nations risk more than social unrest. Austerity is already undermining economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic. Slashing funds for education, infrastructure and other vital needs will undercut future competitiveness and endanger industrialized nations' economic performance for generations.
Americans have been historically less inclined than Europeans to explosions of social rage, despite suffering more poverty than most other wealthy democracies. But with unemployment above 9 percent, rising poverty rates and declining family incomes, the no-taxes, all-cuts agenda that has gripped Congressional Republicans will fray our social fabric and squander human capital here as well.
Mr. Buffett lives on the other end of the income spectrum, where 1 percent of American taxpayers -- about 750,000 families -- pocket more than 20 percent of the nation's income. It is not surprising that the enlightened rich would think paying higher taxes was a wise investment. The Republicans in Congress need to be persuaded of that truth.

HEADLINE: Obama Hits the Road to Try to Sell His Jobs Proposal to Washington

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and JACKIE CALMES; Mark Landler reported from Richmond, and Jackie Calmes from Washington. Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
RICHMOND, Va. -- A day after throwing down the gauntlet to Congress, President Obama took his new $447 billion jobs plan on the road on Friday, exhorting college students here to contact their lawmakers in the first salvo of what the White House says will be a sustained campaign by the president to sell his legislation this fall.
''I want you to call, I want you to e-mail, I want you to tweet, I want you to fax, I want you to visit, I want you to Facebook, send a carrier pigeon,'' Mr. Obama urged a boisterous crowd of nearly 9,000 on the lush, red-brick campus of the University of Richmond.
''I want you to tell your congressperson, 'The time for gridlock and games is over; the time for action is now,' '' said the president, who appeared energized after his address to Congress. 
The White House says the Richmond appearance and others to follow represent what is planned as a concerted effort by the president to sell the public on the tax cuts and spending in his jobs package, seeking to pressure Republicans in the House and the Senate to go along with at least some measures.
Mr. Obama's choice of the Virginia state capital for his first foray was no accident: it is the home district of Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader and one of the president's fiercest Republican antagonists in Congress on budget and economic matters. Next Tuesday, the president plans to visit a school in Columbus, Ohio, the political backyard of Speaker John A. Boehner, and on Wednesday Mr. Obama will be in North Carolina -- a state, like Ohio and Virginia, that he won in 2008 but that is up for grabs next year.
Foretelling the political battles to come, Mr. Cantor returned home on Friday for his own visit, to a Richmond building-materials manufacturer, Titan America, where he spoke about Republican alternatives to the package Mr. Obama had presented to a joint session of Congress.
In his speech here, Mr. Obama referred to Mr. Cantor, though not by name, saying he was cheered that Republicans have expressed openness to parts of the package. After the president's Thursday speech, Mr. Cantor had voiced a willingness to compromise and advance the bill if Mr. Obama did not insist on an ''all-or-nothing'' approach.
In another example of how the White House is reaching out to voters, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, called in, unprompted, to a morning radio show in Iowa to explain the president's proposals.
Democrats and pundits have complained that Mr. Obama neglected to mount a sustained campaign for job creation and to counter Republicans' claims that his proposals for it have failed, allowing them to gain traction on the issue.
White House officials largely reject that, saying that except for the period when the president was fighting to pass his health care law, Mr. Obama's distractions from the jobs message were due to unforeseeable events like the oil spill in Gulf of Mexico and the upheaval in the Arab world.
''An analysis of the events the president has done -- what he's talked about, the travel he does, the statements he makes, the interviews he does -- would clearly show that the overwhelming majority of them are designed to talk about the economy,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director. ''Even when the national media decided to cover something else, the president's economic message dominated local news and front pages. This effort is inherently different than all the others because at a critical moment for the country, the president is pushing for Congress to act on a specific plan that folks across the country can rally around.''
Even so, Mr. Obama's schedule will depart from his usual trips in the past two years when he would visit a small business, typically one involved with energy-efficiency products and green jobs that had benefited from previous stimulus measures.
The fall offensive is expected to include another bus tour, like the one he did in rural Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois in August, officials said. And Mr. Obama will do more events with bigger crowds, like the one here or Monday's Labor Day rally before about 13,000 union families in Detroit.
There was plenty of partisan edge in the president's message in Richmond. He gleefully recycled the better lines from his Thursday speech, including a sarcastic plea to Republicans not to break their no-new-taxes-ever pledge by refusing to extend the cut in payroll taxes. The tax cut is the centerpiece of Mr. Obama's plan, and he pitched it to this crowd by saying it would ''put more people back to work and more money back in the pockets of people who are working.''
The president also continued his pivot away from the painful debt-ceiling negotiations with House Republicans, saying, ''We spent a whole summer fussing about the deficit.''
For now, he said, the country needs to focus on keeping enough teachers in schools and rebuilding its crumbling roads and bridges -- if only to avoid falling behind China and South Korea. The audience responded with chants of ''U.S.A! U.S.A!''
Mr. Obama did reiterate that the costs of the jobs bill would be offset by spending cuts. He plans to detail how to pay for it when he submits the bill, the American Jobs Act, to Congress next week. A week after that, he will submit a broader set of recommendations to the special Congressional committee charged with working out at least $1.5 trillion in long-term deficit reduction.
''He's asking the supercommittee to overshoot its target, so they are linked,'' Mr. Carney said.
There is evidence that Mr. Obama's robust performance on Thursday might have restored the faith of some wavering supporters, said Geoff Garin, a Democratic strategist. Mr. Garin monitored 32 swing voters in Richmond who watched the speech, and said their responses, as measured by dials, spiked as soon as he began speaking.
''There was a feeling of conviction and confidence that came across in the speech,'' said Mr. Garin, who does research for a political action committee that supports Mr. Obama's re-election but has no ties to his campaign.
The administration also pointed to a raft of forecasts from economists that the mix of tax cuts and new spending would spur growth and appreciably reduce the jobless rate.
If passed, the package would add 1.3 million nonagricultural jobs by the end of 2012 and an additional 800,000 jobs the following year, according to Macroeconomic Advisers, a private firm used by the Federal Reserve. The firm's report said the package would raise economic growth 1.3 percentage points by the end of 2012 and 0.2 percentage points by the end of 2013.
An economist with Moody's Analytics, Mark Zandi, was even more bullish, projecting that the plan would add two percentage points to economic growth in 2012, add 1.9 million jobs, and cut the nation's unemployment rate by a full percentage point.
''Many of the president's proposals are unlikely to pass Congress,'' Mr. Zandi said, ''but the most important have a chance of winning bipartisan support.''

HEADLINE: On 10th Anniversary of 9/11, Social Media Is a Forum for Reflection

BYLINE: JENNIFER PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: To mark the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, people are using social networks to reflect and to share their memories, thoughts and prayers.

 BODY:
Shortly after noon on Friday, Sarah Rachael Wainio told her 661 followers on Twitter that she was starting her journey to Shanksville, Pa. She got in the car with her family in Baltimore and headed toward western Pennsylvania, where she would join hundreds of other relatives and friends of the 40 victims from Flight 93 who died when the hijacked plane crashed there on Sept. 11, 2001.
Ms. Wainio was 14 when her only sister, Elizabeth Wainio, 27, a regional manager for Discovery Channel stores, died in the crash. On the weekend of this 10th anniversary, Ms. Wainio is posting regular updates and photoson her Twitter account. She said it was important to share as much information as possible for those friends and family members who could not attend the dedication ceremony of the new memorialat the crash site on Saturday and the services on Sunday.
"For me, my mission every day is to tell the story of my sister and to tell the story of Flight 93," said Ms. Wainio, 24, a development officer at Towson University. "I would like everybody to be here today. But since they can't, I believe that sharing mostly photos is a way to share my experience and let people have a window into my life." 
In the days leading up to the anniversary, friends and families of those lost, as well as people from around the world, are using social networks to reflect and to share their memories, thoughts and prayers.
Mark Zuckerberg was still in high school when the planes struck the towers, and he would not create Facebook until three years later. Twitter, of course, didn't exist. YouTube was not around. There has been much speculation in recent months about how people trapped in the towers or on the planes might have used these tools to share last-minute goodbyes or perhaps have learned information in real time that could have saved lives.
In the days after Sept. 11, 2001, people didn't instantly turn to their cellphones or the Internet to communicate, in the way they do today. They put up posters all over Manhattan. There were online chat rooms, blogs, list-serves, Yahoo groups and plain old-fashioned e-mail lists. But the growth of social media networks in the last three to five years has offered new opportunities for people to find each other and to communicate. They are using them in creative ways to remember 9/11.
The volume of conversation about the 10th anniversary has grown exponentially on Twitter since Sept. 2, based on an analysis by Trendrr, a social media analytics firm. On Tuesday, Jason Damata, of Trendrr, said there were 135,000 posts on Twitter about Sept. 11, 238,369 on Thursday and more than 451,350 on Friday. The most commonly shared hashtags, he said, were #9/11, #911 and #neverforget. And the top five cities posting about the anniversary have been New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Chicago.
To help facilitate the conversation, Facebook worked with the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, to introduce a new application last week as a tribute to those who died. People who use Facebook are invited to dedicate their status, update their profile photo, and tell their family and friends how they're remembering and honoring the victims.
Mary Jaco, originally from Chelsea, Mass., but now living in France, used the application to dedicate her profile to one of the victims, Jeremiah J. Ahern, who was 74 and worked as an auditor in the New York State sales tax office on the 86th floor of 2 World Trade Center.
"May God bless Mr. Ahern, his family and friends and may God Bless us, everyone," Ms. Jaco wrote.
Michael Frazier, director of communications for the museum, said that social networks have broadened the conversation about the 10th anniversary and allowed people from all over the world to "come together at once to recall, remember and reflect."
On Saturday, the comments posted on the museum's Facebook wallreflected that international exchange.
Writing from Melbourne, Australia, Nazelle Skews wrote: "My thoughts and sympathies to the families and friends of 9/11."
"R.I.P. for the heroes of WTC from Brazil," posted Andre Moura.
"Remembering 9/11/01. A truly awful & sad day in human history. God Bless America and New York City. My thoughts and prayers to the families and friends of 9/11," Odette Landin wrote from San Juan, Puerto Rico.
To honor the victims, people also posted photos of loved ones and even YouTube videos on the museum's Facebook wall, including a touching video montage from Poly Prep Country Day Schoolin Brooklyn that was created to commemorate the lives of the 10 students and one parent who were killed.
YouTube created a special channeldedicated to the anniversary that includes videos from The New York Times. Dozens of people have uploaded their reflections.
In one, Lawrence Snow, 42, of Staten Island, stares into the camera, recounting his memories of working at the World Financial Center, located directly behind the towers, when the planes hit. He concludes his short video by describing the thing that still haunts him. "That is the sound of firefighters' personal alerts or alarms going off," he said. "Hundreds of them, like a swarm of crickets. But no firefighters in sight."
In an interview, Mr. Snow said that he didn't talk much about that day with friends or family anymore. But, for this anniversary, he said, he felt the need to document his memories and YouTube offered him the opportunity. "There is something special about 10 years," he said. "I thought social media would be the way for me to do it. I still remember like it was yesterday."
For Ms. Wainio, her plan this weekend is to continue providingphotosand live postson her Twitter account, @sarahrachaeland on the Twitter account, @fof93, that was created for the foundation for the families of the victims of Flight 93.
She said that by sharing her experience on Twitter, she hoped to draw attention to the $10 million that is still needed to complete the memorialat the crash site.
As the dedication ceremony began Saturday, sheposted on Twitter: "The reading of the names is always the longest part. You feel, you imagine & you wonder the pain of each individual family. I only know mine."
Ms. Waino said, though, it was important to be sensitive and to be mindful about what information she shared publicly for herself and the other families.
"I do think that there are things that remain private and need to remain private," she said. "I am not going to tweet that I was in my hotel room crying for the last three hours because I miss my sister. I can't share it all. But there are things that I want to share. And I do have a larger objective, which is helping tell the story. "

HEADLINE: Small-Business Owners Respond to Obama Plan

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Even some of the small-business owners who watched the speech live at the White House's invitation said they would not be swayed to hire.

 BODY:
President Obama, in his speech on Thursday before a joint session of Congress, promised to deploy the power of the federal government to induce small businesses to hire out-of-work Americans. But even some of the small-business owners who watched the speech live in the House chamber at the White House's invitation said they would not be swayed by the carrots the president proposed to dangle.
David Catalano, who helped found Modea, a digital advertising agency in Blacksburg, Va., and Darlene Miller, who owns Permac Industries, a precision machining company in Burnsville, Minn., both said they planned to hire regardless of what the government does. "We're going to hire based on our needs," Ms. Miller said.
In his speech, the president outlined several tax incentives for businesses to prompt investment in general and to reward hiring in particular. The investment incentives, which would take effect in 2012, include cutting the employer payroll tax in half, to 3.1 percent, for the first $5 million in wages. The president would also allow companies to continue taking a full deduction for certain kinds of property purchases immediately, rather than having to amortize the expense over many years. 
To reward hiring, the president proposed a full payroll tax holiday on up to $50 million in increased wages over what a company paid in 2011, regardless of whether the growth comes from new hires or salary increases. The president also proposed a series of tax credits for companies that hire people who have been looking for work for at least six months: up to $4,000 for most employees, but up to $5,600 for veterans, and up to $9,600 for veterans injured during their service. It is unclear when the hiring incentives would expire. According to a White House representative, the amount of the credit would depend on the employee's wages and the number of hours worked.
Some economists have questioned whether such incentives really induce hiring and investment or simply reward companies for actions they would have taken anyway. But both business owners said that any extra boost would help. "This just eases the burden, to invest in their education, or do more things for them," Mr. Catalano said.
Ms. Miller added: "It will definitely help small businesses with cash flow."
While the proposals would benefit all businesses, not merely small ones, the White House said the payroll tax cut was directed toward "the 98 percent of firms that have payroll below" the $5 million limit. Some economists believe that the bonus depreciation, in particular, offers more help to large firms than small ones.
The president's speech split advocates for small business along predictable lines. The National Federation of Independent Business, the conservative-leaning small-business lobbying group, panned it as "more of the same" in an e-mailed statement that cited "the threat of higher taxes and the thousands of pending federal regulations."
"Small businesses need the government out of their way," said Dan Danner, the group's president and chief executive, in the statement. "Tax breaks are always a welcome help to small businesses, especially in these tough economic times. But those outlined tonight by the president are temporary, and avoid the question of meaningful business tax reform."
The National Small Business Association, a more centrist organization, was more generous in its praise of the tax cuts. "Offering a payroll tax holiday can help all small employers - not just the profitable ones who benefit from an income tax cut - with some much-needed cash while at the same time making it a bit more affordable to bring on new employees," said Todd McCracken, the group's president and chief executive, in a statement. But the N.S.B.A. joined the N.F.I.B. in calling for a lighter regulatory burden for businesses and demanded a far-reaching overhaul of the whole tax code, not just for corporations.
These concerns resonated even with the president's invited guests. Mr. Catalano said that he was wary of the president's pledge to pay for the package by asking the "wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to pay their fair share." Mr. Catalano said that because his company was organized as an S corporation, in which profits are passed through to shareholders, he would then face higher taxes. But, he said, "my partner and I have reinvested 100 percent of the profits that our agency has made over the last five years back into the company. If the government takes a bigger share of that from me, it directly impedes my ability to grow the agency."
Ms. Miller said the president could have done more to address regulatory burdens. "There's still a lot of work in that area to be done," she said. "There are a lot of regulations that really just aren't necessary."
She also worried about the president's call for higher taxes. But she added that even with her company's profits, "I'm not the wealthiest, so it does not affect me directly."

HIGHLIGHT: Republican lawmakers are signaling a willingness to compromise, but struggling with how to also keep the upper hand to press their priorities.

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
With troubling poll numbers and a bleak economic outlook to address, Republican lawmakers are signaling a willingness to compromise, some even backtracking on vehement positions they held just weeks ago. But they're struggling with how to also keep the upper hand to press their priorities, Jennifer Steinhauer reports.

        
President Obama brought his new jobs proposal to Richmond, Va., on Friday, encouraging his audience of college students to tell their representatives to pass the bill, Mark Landler and Jackie Calmes report. It was the president's first shot at drumming up support for the plan he laid out before Congress on Thursday, an effort he hopes will pressure lawmakers to act.

        
 Four Tea Party freshmen from South Carolina are finding themselves the center of attention among Republican presidential hopefuls, hoping to win their favor and gain traction in the critical state, Jennifer Steinhauer reports.

        
Law enforcement officials in New York City and Washington searched cars and patrolled subway stations on Friday after federal officials warned of a credible but unconfirmed and frustratingly vague terrorist plot that could be carried out to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, Eric Schmitt and Scott Shane report.
Weekly Address

        
In his weekly address, Mr. Obama recalled the victims and heroes of Sept. 11, as well as those who have protected the United States since then - "our extraordinary 9/11 Generation." Reflecting on how the country has overcome the wounds inflicted that day, he said: "We've forged new partnerships with nations around the world to meet the global challenges that no nation can face alone. And across the Middle East and North Africa, a new generation of citizens is showing that the future belongs to those that want to build, not destroy."
Washington Happenings

        
On Saturday, Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, will participate in a service project in Washington. On Sunday, he will visit the sites of the Sept. 11 attacks in New York City and Shanksville, Pa. Later that day, he is expected to speak at the National Cathedral's "Concert for Hope" at the Kennedy Center in Washington.

        
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. plans to speak at the dedication of the memorial honoring the passengers of Flight 93 in Shanksville on Saturday. He will also speak at the Sept. 11 anniversary ceremony at the Pentagon Memorial on Sunday, then attend the National Cathedral's concert later.

        
There will be several other events recognizing the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks in Washington this weekend. They include a peace rally in defense of Muslims at the Justice Department on Saturday and the George Washington University's third annual Freshman Day of Service, during which students complete service projects around the community, on Sunday.
