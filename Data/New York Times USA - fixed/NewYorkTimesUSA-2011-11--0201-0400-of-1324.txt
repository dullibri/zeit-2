HEADLINE: Corzine Resigns From MF Global

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Jon Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey who stepped down as chairman and chief executive of the bankrupt brokerage, will not seek $12 million severance payments. 

 BODY:
Jon S. Corzine has resigned from his posts at the embattled brokerage firm MF Global, the company announced on Friday.
Mr. Corzine, the firm's chairman and chief executive, will not seek his $12 million severance from MF Global, which filed for bankruptcy on Monday, according to the company's statement. 
The resignation capped a disastrous week for Mr. Corzine, as he saw MF Global lose two-thirds of its market value, file for bankruptcy and face a handful of federal investigations into more than $600 million in missing customer money. The decision also signaled a rapid downfall of what was supposed to be Mr. Corzine's grand return to Wall Street -- a comeback that began in early 2010, after a roughly 10-year sabbatical that he spent in politics.
 "I feel great sadness for what has transpired at MF Global and the impact it has had on the firm's clients, employees and many others," Mr. Corzine, 64, said in a statement. "I intend to continue to assist the company and its board in their efforts to respond to regulatory inquiries and issues related to the disposition of the firm's assets."
Mr. Corzine's resignation signals the end of a troubled chapter in his career. The former head of Goldman Sachs, Mr. Corzine joined MF Global in March 2010 following a failed re-election bid for New Jersey governor. 
Soon after joining the firm, he moved to transform the sleepy brokerage firm into a full-service investment bank in the mold of his former employer, Goldman. He aggressively bought up European sovereign debt, wagering that the Continent would not let troubled countries default on their loans. 
As the sovereign debt crisis dragged on this fall, regulators noticed the risky bets and pushed the firm to hold more capital against the investments. The move alarmed shareholders, clients and rating agencies, inciting a crisis of confidence. With the stock in free-fall, the firm searched desperately for a suitor to buy at least a part of its business. 
MF Global had a handshake deal late Sunday, but the overnight revelation of hundreds of millions of dollars of missing customer money scuttled any potential deal. Early Monday, the firm filed for bankruptcy.
After MF Global filed for Chapter 11 regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, started searching for missing money. On Tuesday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began its own inquiry. Roughly $630 million in assets remains unaccounted for, and regulators are examining whether the firm used the money to plug holes in a scramble to save itself. 
Mr. Corzine, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing, is said to have hired Andrew F. Levander, a prominent criminal defense lawyer. Mr. Levander, the chairman of Dechert, has represented other Wall Street executives including John Thain, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch. Mr. Corzine has also retained two bankruptcy lawyers from the firm Perkins Coie, Alan D. Smith and Schuyler G. Carroll, to represent him in the civil Chapter 11 proceedings.
Edward L. Goldberg, the head director, and Bradley I. Abelow, the president and chief operating officer, will remain in their positions at MF Global.
An earlier version of this post misspelled the surname of a lawyer with Perkins Coie. He is Schuyler G. Carroll, not Caroll.

HEADLINE: The Norquist Rebellion

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A letter urges the supercommittee to take a balanced approach to deficit reduction. 

 BODY:
It seems like every day brings a fresh reminder of how polarized and paralyzed Washington has become. On Thursday, the Senate took up Mr. Obama's proposal to spend $60 billion on repairs to roads, bridges, airports - the things that get lumped under the poetic-sounding "instrastructure." Not a single Republican voted to break their party's filibuster of this bill, despite the fact that many, if not all of them, have supported such spending before.
As we pointed out in our editorial on the subject this morning, the bill would pay for itself with an income tax surcharge of 0.7 percent on people who make more than $1 million a year.
So how to explain the filibuster? Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, accused Democrats of designing the bill to fail. In other words, they played the dastardly trick of asking Republicans to vote for job-creating spending, and to pay for it with a small charge to about 345,000 taxpayers. The nerve!
In this atmosphere, it was hard to know what to make of a letter that came out Wednesday, signed by 40 Republicans and 60 Democrats urging the supercommittee on deficit reduction to cut $4 trillion through spending reductions revenue increases.
That is a good sign, although, of course, it's one thing to sign a letter, and another thing to actually cast a tough vote. David Firestone, who writes about politics and Congress for the editorial page, offered some thoughts on this development:
There are a lot of ways the 40 Republicans could wriggle out of this request without endorsing higher taxes. The letter did not refer to "tax revenues," just revenues, which in theory could come from increasing Medicare premiums or other methods. (More likely, the Republicans probably have in mind eliminating some tax breaks and loopholes.)
And last week, as a Tuesday editorial noted, Republicans on the supercommittee claimed they could bring in $200 billion in new revenues by taxes, because of increased economic growth. That tired canard was discredited decades ago in the days of voodoo economics, and in any case would never pass muster with the nonpartisan Congressional scorekeepers of the deficit.
But the letter was still significant, because Republicans who signed it directly defied the autocratic demands of Grover Norquist, the anti-tax vigilante who coerced Republicans into sign a no-taxes pledge and now threatens to ostracize them if they violate it. Among other requirements, the pledge forbids the use of any new revenues to lower the deficit. In other words, if a tax break is removed, it has to be offset dollar for dollar by spending cuts.
Mr. Norquist's pledge has been a huge obstacle to honest dialogue in Washington, and beyond that to real deficit reduction. If 40 House Republicans are willing to actually vote for a sensible, balanced approach to cutting the deficit, and not just co-sign a letter about it, that would be a marvelous thing, indeed. But for some reason I think the recent filibuster is a better indication of things to come.

HEADLINE: Early Economic Projections Could Haunt Obama in 2012

BYLINE: RICHARD W. STEVENSON


HIGHLIGHT: Friday's tepid jobs report brings a fresh reminder of the stubborn difficulty President Obama and his team face in overcoming the argument that his administration has failed to address unemployment. 

 BODY:
A year out from Election Day: an eon in political time, sufficient to alter circumstances substantially for or against either party. But Friday's tepid jobs report brings a fresh reminder of the stubborn difficulty President Obama and his team face in overcoming one of their most enduring mistakes, one made before he even took office. 
Ten days prior to Mr. Obama's taking the oath of office in January 2009, his economic team released a report outlining the estimated benefits of the $775 billion stimulus plan he was seeking. The projections were quite specific. The stimulus legislation passed just a few weeks later at about the size the White House had sought. Had all gone as promised by the report, the unemployment rate right now would have been around 6.5 percent, heading down to around 6 percent by the end of this year and a little over 5 percent at the end of next year.
The Labor Department announced Friday that the unemployment rate for October was 9 percent, down from 9.1 percent a month earlier, and that job growth for the month was just 80,000, nowhere near the rate necessary to drive joblessness toward anything like 6 percent. The Federal Reserve has already projected that the unemployment rate will be at least 8.5 percent at the end of next year, meaning the next presidential term would start with a higher rate than the 7.3 percent Mr. Obama inherited when he took office.
The gap between the projections his team made in early 2009 and the grim reality of the last three years has produced a substantively debatable but politically powerful argument for Republicans. It has helped rally conservative opposition to most of Mr. Obama's subsequent agenda, and going into the thick of the presidential race it has become the primary basis not only for the Republican case against a second Obama term but also for the most intensive conservative assault in decades on Keynesian economics and the role of government. 
Sometimes in factually exaggerated ways, Republicans on the campaign trail are using the busted projections to assert that the stimulus bill failed, that government cannot create jobs and that it is time for less spending rather than more. 
"He has proven for once and for all that government spending will not create one job," Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said of Mr. Obama at one Republican presidential debate, adding: "Keynesian policy and Keynesian theory is now done. We will never have to have that experiment on America again."
Mitt Romney's economic plan highlights the chart in the 2009 Obama report showing the projected path of the unemployment rate following the stimulus and an additional line showing the (much higher) actual unemployment rate. Other than its caution about significant margins of error, Mr. Romney's plan states, the Obama projections "failed to fulfill the predictions of its authors and their White House sponsor" and make clear that Mr. Obama's approach has not worked.
The two parties would no doubt be engaged in a spirited ideological debate over economic policy right now even if that early 2009 report had gotten it exactly right.
And for those interested in the underlying economics, there's a persuasive case that the report actually did not get it all that wrong. While the report seriously underestimated the severity of the recession and therefore the job losses the nation would suffer in 2009, it was proven right in its basic point that the stimulus plan would yield substantial job-creation compared to doing nothing. In other words, it was correct in projecting a significant, positive impact on jobs from the stimulus spending, but wrong in its assumptions of the depths of the job-loss hole the stimulus was trying to fill.
Despite repeated Republican claims to the contrary, the stimulus bill created at least hundreds of thousands of jobs, according to nearly all nonpartisan analysts, including the Congressional Budget Office. 
But it's impossible to compress the nuance onto a bumper sticker. As a political matter, Republicans have used the shortfall relative to the projections to establish a narrative that the stimulus failed, and with it Mr. Obama's presidency. To the White House's intense frustration, the chart showing the early 2009 projections has become the centerpiece of the closing Republican argument against Mr. Obama's re-election and against the economic policies his party stands for, including the jobs package Congress is debating and largely rejecting now.
"It's the most destructive non sequitur in the history of economic policy," said one of the authors of the report, Jared Bernstein, who was economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. until earlier this year. "Somehow because we got the forecast wrong, they don't have to do anything to help the unemployed."
"The fact that the recession was deeper than we and the majority of other forecasters realized at the time is no reason for Congress to give up on helping the jobless," he said. "If anything the numbers suggest that we should still do more."
Christina Romer, who served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers and was the report's other main author, has similarly called for additional stimulus measures, and the White House has labored to produce counternarratives to offset the damage from the 2009 projections.
But so far the White House arguments, while sound on the merits, have been largely defensive in nature and hardly inspiring politically: The economy's condition three years ago was much worse than anyone realized. Without the stimulus job losses would have been much worse. If nothing further is done to address the problem, it's the fault of the Republicans.
The best hope now for the White House may be convincing voters not to judge Mr. Obama based on those nearly three-year-old projections of how the stimulus would work, but instead on whether the economy is substantially improving from a year ago, when unemployment peaked at 10.1 percent.
The jobless rate is down more than a full percentage point since then, not a small improvement. Friday's jobs report held mixed signals about the economy's strength. But there are not many months left for Mr. Obama to persuade the nation to measure his performance by a different benchmark.

HEADLINE: Romney Outlines Entitlement Changes

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney stirred a group of fiscal conservatives by talking about repealing "Obamacare" and overhauling Medicaid and Social Security. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney was met with generally tepid applause on Friday afternoon as he addressed a cavernous ballroom of fiscal conservatives gathered for the Americans for Prosperity Foundation's annual summit . 
Then a line about repealing "Obamacare" landed him a standing ovation. "I should have started with that line," Mr. Romney quipped.
Mr. Romney's speech, which he previewed Thursday evening in New Hampshire, focused largely on spending cuts and fiscal responsibility, but the buzziest items of his plan were perhaps his potential modifications to entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security.
Mr. Romney's proposal concerning entitlement programs - which includes slowly increasing the retirement age for younger workers to match increasing longevity - brings him closer to Representative Paul Ryan's plan for overhauling entitlement programs.
Mr. Romney's Medicare proposal would give beneficiaries the option of enrolling in private health care plans. But unlike the Ryan plan, Mr. Romney would allow seniors to keep traditional Medicare as an option. However, if the existing government program proved more expensive and charged higher premiums, the seniors would be responsible for paying the difference.
Seeking to reassure the audience that current seniors would not see their programs upended, Mr. Romney explained that there would be "no change" for retirees or those near retirement.
"For the next generation of retirees, we should slowly raise the retirement age," he said, referring to Social Security. "And finally for the next generation of retirees, we should slow the growth of benefits for those that have higher incomes."
On the Medicare front, Mr. Romney presented his plan as offering more choice - though Americans would need to be prepared to possibly pay more, for instance, for higher quality options.
"Younger Americans today, when they turn 65, should have a choice between traditional Medicare and other private health care plans that provide at least the same level of benefits," he said. "Competition will lower costs and increase the quality of health care."
He concluded: "The future of Medicare should be marked by competition, by choice, and by innovation, rather than by bureaucracy, stagnation and bankruptcy."
Americans for Prosperity was co-founded and financed by David H. Koch. Mr. Koch, a billionaire who, along with his brother, Charles, runs Koch Industries, was sitting at a table near the front row.
Mr. Romney previewed his speech at a town-hall-style forum Thursday evening in Exeter, N.H., and he also laid out the basics of his overall vision of spending cuts and debt in an op-edin USA Today.
"Tomorrow's Medicare should give beneficiaries a generous defined contribution and allow them to choose between private plans and traditional Medicare," Mr. Romney wrote. "And lower-income future retirees should receive the most assistance. I believe that competition will improve Medicare and the coverage that seniors receive."
Mr. Romney's overall plan aims to cap spending at 20 percent of gross domestic product, and would require $500 billion per year in spending cuts in 2016. To accomplish this, Mr. Romney said he would eliminate all nonessential government programs, return federal programs to the state level, and improve the productivity and efficiency of the federal government.
Democrats wasted no timing in attacking Mr. Romney's plan, saying that not only would it effectively end Medicare and Medicaid, but that his tax cuts would disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
"Romney apparently operates under the false assumption that we can just cut our way to prosperity," said James Kvaal, the policy director for Obama for America, in an e-mail. "In recent months, he has embraced extreme ideological approaches like Representative Paul Ryan's budget plan and the 'cut, cap and balance' proposal. He would return American families to the failed economic policies that contributed to the years of rising inequality, stagnant wages and eroding middle-class security."
Mr. Romney repeated what seems to be his new mantra - "making government simpler, smaller and smarter," he explained - and cast the issue of spending cuts in moral terms.
"We cannot with moral conscious borrow trillions of dollars that can only be repaid by our children," he said. "We cannot so weaken our economic foundation that we jeopardize our ability to preserve freedom."
As he did Thursday night, he also contrasted his time running companies in the private sector with how Solyndra, a solar power company that received government funds and is now facing bankruptcy and scandal, was run.
"They had robots that whistled Disney songs, I'm not kidding," Mr. Romney marveled. They had what was described as spa-like showers, with liquid crystal displays that told you what temperature the water was."
The company headquarters, he explained, was known as the "Taj Mahal."
"When I get to the White House, hopefully, no one will need to teach me how to balance budgets," he said. "I've been doing that for 35 years."

HEADLINE: Corzine Out as Search for MF Global Funds Continues

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Jon S. Corzine resigned as chief executive of MF Global early Friday, while officials briefly thought they had located the firm's missing $600 million in customer money. 

 BODY:
The missing customer money at MF Global is still missing.
On Friday, funds from the bankrupt brokerage firm suddenly surfaced at JPMorgan Chase. Washington and Wall Street, for a moment, were hopeful it was the money they had been searching for all week.
But then, just as quickly, nearly everyone agreed it was not the missing money, and the hunt was on again.
While MF Global has more than $2 billion in accounts at JPMorgan, regulators had previously accounted for those funds, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. Federal officials estimate that roughly $600 million has been misplaced or misused or has disappeared altogether, two of the people said.
The revelation - and the sharp reversal - is the latest debacle in the bankruptcy of MF Global.
Adding to the drama, the firm's chief executive, Jon S. Corzine, the former Democratic governor of New Jersey and head of Goldman Sachs, resigned early Friday. In a more surprising development, Gary Gensler, head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, will no longer participate in the investigation due to his long acquaintance with Mr. Corzine, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
It is just the beginning. Regulators are still camped out at the brokerage firm's Midtown Manhattan headquarters, poring over the books. Exchange officials are transferring customer accounts to other brokerage firms. And company executives are helping to close the firm.
The process of winding down MF Global will be long and arduous. The courts continue to sort through the mess at Lehman Brothers, more than three years after the investment bank filed for Chapter 11.
"It's going to be complicated when you have a multibillion-dollar company," said Professor J. Samuel Tenenbaum, the director of the Investor Protection Center at Northwestern University School of Law. "That just doesn't happen overnight. It would be nice to think that you can get this done quickly, but that would be fanciful."
The demise of MF Global can be traced to risky bets on European sovereign debt.
Soon after joining the firm in 2010, Mr. Corzine moved to transform the sleepy brokerage firm into a full-service investment bank in the mold of his former employer, Goldman. He aggressively bought up the bonds of troubled economies like Italy, Ireland and Spain, betting that the Continent would not let the countries default on their loans.
As the sovereign debt crisis dragged on this summer, regulators noticed the risky bets and pushed the firm to hold more capital against the investments. The move alarmed shareholders, clients and rating agencies, inciting a crisis of confidence. With the stock sliding, the firm searched desperately for a suitor.
But the missing money proved the death knell for MF Global.
Before dawn on Monday, the firm uncovered a nearly $1 billion hole in its customer accounts. The startling discovery scuttled a last-minute deal to sell part of the business to Interactive Brokers Group, a Connecticut rival. Out of options, MF Global filed for bankruptcy that morning.
Within hours, regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, started investigating MF Global and the missing money. The Federal Bureau of Investigation joined the fray on Tuesday. Federal authorities worried that MF Global had violated a basic principle in this business: customer assets must be kept separate from company funds.
As the scrutiny intensified, Mr. Corzine was said to have hired Andrew F. Levander, a prominent criminal defense lawyer. Mr. Levander, the chairman of Dechert, has represented other Wall Street executives including John Thain, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch. Mr. Corzine has retained two bankruptcy lawyers from the firm Perkins Coie to represent him in the civil Chapter 11 proceedings.
Neither Mr. Corzine nor MF Global have been accused of any wrongdoing. MF Global says the shortfall is temporary, as additional money will flow in from banks and clearinghouses.
In resigning on Friday, Mr. Corzine ended what was supposed to be his grand return to Wall Street after nearly a decade in politics. The company said that he would not seek his $12 million in severance.
"I feel great sadness for what has transpired at MF Global and the impact it has had on the firm's clients, employees and many others," Mr. Corzine, 64, said in a statement. "I intend to continue to assist the company and its board in their efforts to respond to regulatory inquiries and issues related to the disposition of the firm's assets."
Mr. Gensler, head of the C.F.T.C., decided Thursday to step back from the inquiry, and the following day he did not participate in an agency briefing on MF Global; Mr. Gensler had worked for Mr. Corzine while both were at Goldman Sachs in the 1990s.
As regulators try to untangle the books, customers, whose accounts were frozen on Monday, are waiting to get their money back. The CME Group, the exchange where MF Global did business, is transferring client funds to other brokerage firms, including R.J. O'Brien and ABN Amro, people involved in the process said.
But customers won't be made whole - at least not yet.
Industry groups pushed for customers to receive about 70 percent of their cash, according to the people involved in the process. But because roughly $600 million hasn't been found, clients will only get on average 60 cents on the dollar, court filings show.
The situation puts customers, including individual investors, hedge funds and big companies, in a financial bind. Until the money surfaces, many clients will have to come up with extra cash to maintain their positions, or they will be forced to liquidate their trades, potentially at a loss.
It could take some time for the money to materialize, assuming it does.
With scarce information, even regulators and industry insiders are grasping for answers. The situation was underscored by the brief elation following media reports that the missing money might have turned up.
But, it hadn't. JPMorgan, which confirmed MF Global had accounts with the bank, said in a statement "that it does not have any information as to whether any such balances are related in any way to the 'missing' customer funds."

HEADLINE: This Sunday: Butter With Your Toast, Mr. President?

BYLINE: HUGO LINDGREN


HIGHLIGHT: Many readers will wrongly assume that Nate is predicting the election, and that's not their fault, really. We tricked them into that with the cover line, "So, Is Obama Toast?" 

 BODY:
Predicting the future may be impossible, but that doesn't stop millions of people from trying. And because so many of them do try, somebody is bound to be correct, and then that person is hailed as a genius until the next thing comes along and then they're back to being fools like the rest of us.
I was thinking about this as I was reading Nate Silver's cover article this week on the odds of President Obama being re-elected. Many readers will wrongly assume that Nate is predicting the election, and that's not their fault, really. We tricked them into that with the cover line, "So, Is Obama Toast?" Nate doesn't end up answering that question so much as isolating the factors that are likely to decide it. That's what makes the piece so valuable and compelling. This is not just more political riffing. By mining the historical record and analyzing current polls, Nate has distilled the fundamentals of the race - the president's approval ratings, the performance of the economy and relative conservatism of the possible G.O.P. candidates - and then sketched out a bunch of different scenarios, most of which leave the president looking very vulnerable. Nate concedes that other factors could come into play; we just have no way of knowing what those might be. But by zeroing in on what we do know, we can filter out the noisy attempts by pundits and strategists to fit the race into their own narratives and pet theories. Naturally, many of them will accuse Nate of doing just that himself. Naturally, we think they're wrong.
The Obama article is pegged, in case you're wondering, to the one-year countdown to Election Day 2012. Another of our big features, Christopher McDougall's story on the best way to run, is timed to an event happening right now, the New York City Marathon. You might recognize Chris's byline; he wrote a best-selling book called "Born to Run," about the Tarahumara Indians of Mexico. This story is something of an update to the book. I also think of it as a complement to a story I edited years ago in another magazine, called "You Walk Wrong," which happened to have been written by Adam Sternbergh, now the culture editor here. That story changed my life, or at least the kind of sneakers I wear. I even tried out those Vibram Five-Fingers for a while.
Chris also helped us with a video to accompany his article.Take a minute to watch that, so you get the form right for the lost art of the 100-Up. There's also a celebrity cameo.
Meanwhile, in the front of the magazine, this issue marks the debut of no less than three new elements. First, we have our new first page, called "The One-Page Magazine." Yes, just as the name implies, it is all the contents of a magazine compressed into a single page. Sort of. It's a light, funny but not (entirely) frivolous reading experience that we think is a great way to start the magazine. We are also very excited to unveil a column called "It's the Economy," by Adam Davidson of NPR's Planet Money. Back in the dark days of the financial panic, Adam and his team were among the most reliable and engaging translators for those of us desperate to understand what was going on. A program they did for This American Life called "The Giant Pool of Money" is, in my view, as enduring a piece of journalism as any about the crisis. Listen to the audio here, or read the transcript here. For the next year, Adam will import the wisdom and enterprising spirit of Planet Money to the magazine every week, illuminating the workings of the economy and all the vicious politics that surround it.
The third new feature is called Who Made That? and was invented by Hilary Greenbaum, one of the magazine's designers, on this very blog. After Hilary did several posts on a wonderful range of subjects that included the crossword puzzle, the Moka Express stovetop espresso maker and the Nasa logo, we decided it was a natural fit for the print magazine. Given that Hilary has a full-time job here, she is collaborating on the column with Dana Rubinstein.
Finally, I want to mention Brigitte Lacombe's beautiful pictures from the set of "Hugo," Martin Scorsese's 3-D extravaganza. We are delighted to publish them, and I get the special thrill of putting my own name in a headline.

HEADLINE: Nov. 4, 2008 | Obama Is Elected President

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On Nov. 4, 2008, Barack Obama was elected the 44th president of the United States, defeating the Republican nominee John McCain. 

 BODY:
On Nov. 4, 2008, Barack Obama was elected the 44th president of the United States, defeating the Republican nominee John McCain. Mr. Obama, a United States senator from Illinois who was the son of a Kenyan father and a white mother from Kansas, became the first black commander in chief.
As The New York Times reported: "The election of Mr. Obama amounted to a national catharsis - a repudiation of a historically unpopular Republican president and his economic and foreign policies, and an embrace of Mr. Obama's call for a change in the direction and the tone of the country. But it was just as much a strikingly symbolic moment in the evolution of the nation's fraught racial history, a breakthrough that would have seemed unthinkable just two years ago."
The election capped a meteoric political rise for Mr. Obama. He entered the national consciousness when, as a state senator, he delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Later that year, he won his bid for the United States Senate. 
Mr. Obama entered the race for president in February 2007 with a speech at the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Ill., where Abraham Lincoln had delivered his "House Divided" Speech. He defeated the perceived front-runner for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a contentious primary campaign.
Mr. Obama campaigned on a theme of "change we can believe in," promising to end the Iraq War quickly, to introduce environmentally friendly regulations, and to pass universal health care. His message appealed to Americans who said they were frustrated by eight years of President George W. Bush's administration as well as to young voters.
Mr. Obama faced several controversies surrounding his ties to the 1960s left-wing activist William Ayers and his pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, as well as questions over the authenticity of his birth certificate, but the voting public favored him on most of the serious issues.
The Times reported on Mr. McCain, a United States senator from Arizona and military war hero, that he "fought the headwinds of a relentlessly hostile political environment, weighted down with the baggage left to him by President Bush and an economic collapse that took place in the middle of the general election campaign." 
Mr. Obama defeated Mr. McCain in the key battleground states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida on his way to winning by a margin of 365 electoral votes to 173.
In his victory speech at Grant Park in Chicago, seen in this video, Mr. Obama declared: "The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you: we as a people will get there."
Connect to Today:
Three years after his election, much of the excitement over Mr. Obama's presidency has faded. Since his election, the president has faced a number of challenges, perhaps most notably the mobilization of conservatives against his universal health care plan and stimulus bill, and the Democratic party defeats in the 2010 midterm elections. The president has been unable to turn around the economy and many of his most ardent supporters have criticized him for being too centrist.
In an article that appeared on Sept. 11, 2011, The Times reported that many Democrats fear that Mr. Obama will be defeated in the 2012 election. One member of the Democratic National Committee "said Democrats needed to find a new blast of energy - something to remind them of what they felt in 2008 when Mr. Obama was elected on a slogan of hope and change."
Do you believe that President Obama has lived up to the promise of his election campaign? Why or why not? What are your thoughts on the criticisms leveled against him from both Republicans and Democrats? If you could share your thoughts with him regarding the 2012 presidential election, what would you say?

HIGHLIGHT: A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance. 

 BODY:
A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance.
 Mergers & Acquisitions
YAHOO SUITOR "The private equity firm TPG Capital has signed a nondisclosure agreement with Yahoo, making it one of the first potential suitors to begin formal due diligence work on the company, which is weighing a sale," DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced and Evelyn M. Rusli reported.
Investment Banking
MF GLOBAL DOOM It was a disastrous week for the brokerage firm led by Jon S. Corzine. Here is a brief run-down of the action:

        
On Sunday, the former powerhouse in the world of commodities and derivatives trading was working frantically toward a potential sale with Interactive Brokers.
        
On Monday, the potential buyer discovered that some of the money in MF Global's customer accounts was missing, DealBook's Ben Protess, Mr. de la Merced and Susanne Craig reported. Interactive Brokers abandoned the deal and MF Global had to disclose the missing money to regulators. By midmorning, the New York-based firm had filed for bankruptcy and federal investigators began an investigation into the missing funds. The bankruptcy rattled Wall Street firms.
        
DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin noted that Mr. Corzine was at Goldman Sachs for nearly 25 years. "Being a former Goldmanite has long been considered the ultimate calling card. But, in some cases, it has proved to be a liability."
        
On Tuesday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission escalated their investigation. The Securities and Exchange Commission, exchanges like the CME Group and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were all looking at whether MF Global diverted customer money in a last-ditch effort to save itself. MF Global's lawyers played down the missing money in Federal Bankruptcy Court.
        
MF Global was supposed to be Mr. Corzine's comeback vehicle, DealBook's Peter Lattman and The Times's Nelson D. Schwartz reported. "Instead, the collapse of the firm appears to be a humiliating coda to the career of a one-time titan of Wall Street."
        
The collapse came after regulators raised warning flags for more than four months. Yet Mr. Corzine resisted, according to DealBook's trio of Ms. Craig, Mr. Protess and Mr. de la Merced.
        
In meetings over the last year, Mr. Corzine personally pressed regulators to halt their plans, DealBook's Azam Ahmed and Mr. Protess reported.
        
The Times's Louise Story and Eric Dash ask, "who was in charge of regulating MF Global?"
        
On Friday, the company announced that Mr. Corzine had resigned from his posts and would not seek his $12 million severance.

EARNINGS SEASON The British bank Barclays said "that its profit rose 5 percent in the third quarter, helped by lower provisions for bad loans," The Times's Julia Werdigier reported.
Nomura Holdings, the largest Japanese investment bank, posted its first quarterly loss in more than two years, warning "that it would make steep cuts as the European debt crisis and a slowing global economy crimped earnings," The Times's Hiroko Tabuchi reported.
Credit Suisse, the second-largest Swiss bank after UBS, said "that its third-quarter profit rose 12 percent, to 683 million Swiss francs, even as the bank announced a further 1,500 job cuts," DealBook's Mark Scott reported.
"BNP Paribas, the largest French lender, announced a sharp decline in third-quarter profit ... and said it was writing off 60 percent of the value of all the Greek debt it holds," The Times's David Jolly reported.
BANK OF AMERICA Responding to consumer outrage, Bank of America abandoned its plan to charge customers $5 to use their debit cards for purchases.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the bank outlined a plan to issue nearly $3 billion in common stock to raise capital and reduce debt.
COMMUNITY BANKS "New Resource, a small community bank that focuses on sustainable and "planet-smart" small businesses and nonprofits, is one of the many community-based lenders benefiting from the criticism of Wall Street," DealBook's Kevin Roose reported.
IN EUROPE The Times is updating a graphic that tracks Europe's debt crisis.
The Lloyds Banking Group said that its chief, Antonio Horta-Osorio, would take a leave of absence for several weeks because of exhaustion.
Hedge Funds
PAULSON KEEPS INVESTORS John A. Paulson's rivals have been wondering whether investors would bolt after the suffered staggering losses this year, Mr. Ahmed and The Times's Julie Creswell reported. For now, pensions, endowments and wealthy individuals are standing by the billionaire hedge fund investor. Redemption requests totaled less than 8 percent of assets, or roughly $2.4 billion.
I.P.O./Offerings
GROUPON After a few stumbles along the way, the internet darling went public this week.

        
As investors clamored for shares, Groupon, on Thursday, priced its initial public offering at $20, above the expected range of $16 to $18, Ms. Rusli reported. "The stock sale, which raised $700 million, values the company at $12.65 billion."
        
The coupon company with "no profits but plenty of momentum - stunned Wall Street on Friday with a premiere that echoed the dot-com boom."
Venture Capital
IN THE MIDDLE EAST Hanan Abdel Meguid, chief of OTVentures, one of the region's largest technology companies, is "guiding young entrepreneurs on how to turn ideas into commercially viable businesses," Sara Hamdan reported.
Legal/Regulatory
GALLEON INVESTIGATION Mr. Lattman finds that Rajat K. Gupta's "calendar for Sept. 23, 2008 - entered into evidence during [Raj] Rajaratnam's trial as Government Exhibit 3035 - provides a lens into the busy and influential life of Mr. Gupta at a time when federal prosecutors say he was also breaking the law."
MADOFF SCANDAL Ruth Madoff said that "she and her husband felt so hopeless and embattled in the weeks after his arrest that they tried to commit suicide by swallowing large handfuls of Ambien," The Times's Diana B. Henriques reported. Mrs. Madoff is promoting an authorized family biography.
OLYMPUS SCANDAL The maker of medical devices and digital cameras appointed an outside committee led by a former justice of Japan's Supreme Court to investigate more than $1 billion in unusually high payouts linked to a series of acquisitions, Ms. Tabuchi reported.
DEAL PROFESSOR DealBook columnist Steven M. Davidoff argues that "If there were any doubt remaining, the scandal surrounding the Olympus Corporation of Japan has proved Michael Crichton wrong." 
2008 A.I.G. BAILOUT A report by the Government Accountability Office says that New York Fed officials have offered inconsistent explanations for their decision to pay other financial companies the full amounts they were owed, rather than seeking concessions.
IN EUROPE DealBook's Mark Scott reports that "as the Continent grapples with the sovereign debt crisis, financial regulatory revision in Europe has been put on the back burner, with some rules delayed until at least 2013."

HEADLINE: Cain Accuser Tells of Pattern, Lawyer Attests

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR, JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY; Ashley Parker and Susan Saulny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The lawyer for one of the women who accused Herman Cain of sexual harassment said Friday that Mr. Cain engaged in a ''series of inappropriate behaviors and unwanted advances'' toward his client over two months in the 1990s, and he directly accused Mr. Cain, a Republican presidential candidate, of not telling the truth about his behavior.
The lawyer, Joel P. Bennett, who represents a former employee of Mr. Cain's at the National Restaurant Association, said the accusations did not center on a single exchange that could be easily misinterpreted, which is how Mr. Cain has characterized it. Mr. Bennett said there were multiple episodes that led his client to file a formal complaint with the restaurant association. 
''Mr. Cain knows the specific incidents that were alleged,'' Mr. Bennett said during a brief news conference outside his Georgetown office. ''My client filed a written complaint in 1999 against him specifically and it had very specific instances in it, and if he chooses not to remember or to acknowledge those, that's his issue.''
A statement issued by the association on Friday confirmed that a complaint was filed and that Mr. Cain had denied the accusations at the time. The association eventually paid the woman $45,000, which Mr. Cain has called a severance payment. But on Friday, Mr. Bennett, who represented the woman at the time, said the payment was meant as a settlement in response to her accusations.
Mr. Bennett described his client as ''anxious'' to rebut Mr. Cain's comments while maintaining her desire not to become ''a public figure.'' He explained her decision to authorize his statement by saying that she was concerned about Mr. Cain's public statements and the reports of allegations against him from other women.
After days of insisting that he never committed sexual harassment, Mr. Cain on Friday sought to move past the controversy. At a gathering of conservatives in Washington, he received thunderous applause for his forceful stump speech while his chief of staff declared on television that the campaign would no longer answer questions about the matter.
''We look forward to focusing our attention on the real issues impacting this country -- like fixing this broken economy and putting Americans back to work through our '9-9-9' plan, as well as strengthening national security,'' said J. D. Gordon, a spokesman for Mr. Cain.
The first scandal of the 2012 campaign has consumed the entire week and distracted the Republican Party from its ultimate goal of defeating President Obama. It has led to finger-pointing and fierce exchanges among the Republican rivals but could prove to be a clarifying moment in the still-unsettled race.
''If you're sharp enough to make it through this gantlet to the nomination, you're going to be competitive in November,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader. ''I think we're going to have a really close, hard-fought campaign.''
One early snapshot of public opinion would suggest that Mr. Cain's candidacy has not been diminished in the eyes of voters. A Washington Post/ABC News poll on Friday found that 7 in 10 Republicans say the allegations do not matter when it comes to selecting a presidential candidate.
The controversy around Mr. Cain, which intensified as the week wore on, is not likely to subside as long as differing accounts keep emerging. In a radio interview Thursday, Mr. Cain said, ''How many more ways can I say this stuff is totally fabricated?''
His response to the allegations, first reported on Sunday by Politico, has provided the biggest test yet for an unorthodox campaign and a candidate whose popularity has been rooted in his unconventional style and outsider appeal to voters.
But his denials -- he said repeatedly that his only crime had been telling a woman that she was as tall as his wife -- have also fueled a sense of outrage among his accusers and their friends that he was using his national platform as a presidential candidate to rewrite history and diminish the seriousness of his actions.
As the week ended, Mr. Cain faced a continued stream of allegations, including new details about a different accuser, who, according to people familiar with the events, has said that he persistently propositioned her during a work event, and that the environment at the restaurant association turned hostile after she complained about it. That woman received a negotiated severance of $35,000 that included a confidentiality clause, people familiar with the agreement said. But it remains an open question how long the spectacle will hang over the presidential race. The candidates gather Wednesday in Michigan for a debate on the economy.
In Washington, Mr. Cain was met with a standing ovation by the crowd at an event hosted by Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group; some in the crowd even danced to his campaign theme song, ''I Am America,'' by Krista Branch. Mr. Cain once worked as a spokesman and promoter for the group, founded with support from the conservative billionaire industrialists Charles and David H. Koch.
Those ties were outlined in an article in The New York Times on Friday. Referring to that article, Mr. Cain declared: ''I am the Koch brothers' brother from another mother. Yes, I'm their brother from another mother, and proud of it.'' As he said so, David Koch, beaming, stood up and pumped his fists in the air.
Mr. Cain's network of supporters around the country appeared to remain largely behind their candidate.
Maurice Atkinson, a former Republican committeeman from Macon, Ga., who is backing Mr. Cain for the nomination said, ''I'm sticking with Herman,'' adding: ''Herman is a decent guy, rock solid. What you're seeing is the gutter side of politics and life.''
A co-chairman of his campaign in Florida, State Representative Scott Plakon, said the criticism of how the campaign had handled the accusations was ''fair enough.'' But, he said, ''given the choice of an inspiring candidate with an imperfect campaign apparatus and an uninspiring candidate with a perfect campaign apparatus, I'll take the first one every time.''

HEADLINE: To Fix Housing, See the Data

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
In Miami recently, I met up with Laurie Goodman, a senior managing director of Amherst Securities. I'd been trying to meet her ever since I'd read an article that she had written in March entitled ''The Case for Principal Reductions.'' But our schedules never seemed to mesh. So when I noticed that we were both going to be at a conference in Miami, I wangled a breakfast appointment. It was one of the more illuminating breakfasts I've had in a while.
The idea of helping struggling homeowners by writing down some principal on their mortgages -- as opposed to reducing the interest or reconfiguring the terms to lower the monthly payments -- is much in the air right now. Banks loathe the idea of principal reduction; they fear that people who are current on their mortgages will start defaulting just to get their principal reduced. They also don't want the hit to their balance sheets. 
But the states' attorneys general who sued over the robo-signing scandal have made principal reduction the central plank of the settlement they are close to completing. The settlement will force the big banks to begin a sustained program of principal reduction, and will heavily penalize banks that don't comply. From what I hear, the goal of the states is to prove to the banks that principal reduction will not cause the sky to fall -- and is, ultimately, less damaging to bank profits than foreclosures.
Housing activists love principal reduction because they tend to see it as a just solution to an unjust situation -- it's a way of making the banks pay a real price for their sins during the subprime madness while allowing people to keep their homes. Conservatives, on the other hand, hate principal reduction. They believe that borrowers who made poor decisions by taking out mortgages they could never afford have to take responsibility for those decisions. If that means foreclosure, so be it.
Enter Laurie Goodman. One of the country's foremost authorities on mortgage-backed securities, she is also one of the most data-driven people I've ever met; at breakfast, she was constantly pointing me to one chart or another that backed up her claims. ''She's not into politics,'' says my friend, and her client, Daniel Alpert of Westwood Capital. ''She is using data to tell us the truth.''
Her truth begins with a shocking calculation: of the 55 million mortgages in America, more than 10 million are reasonably likely to default. That is a staggering number -- and it is, in large part, because so many homes are worth so much less than the mortgage the homeowners are holding. That is, they're underwater.
Her second calculation is that the supply of housing is going to drastically outstrip demand for the foreseeable future; she estimates that the glut of unneeded homes could get as high as 6.2 million over the next six years. The primary reason for this, she says, is that household formation has been very low in recent years, presumably because of the grim economy. (Young adults are living with their parents instead of moving into their own homes, etc.) What's more, nearly 20 percent of current homeowners no longer qualify for a mortgage, as lending standards have tightened.
The implication is almost too awful to contemplate. As Goodman put it in testimony she recently gave before Congress, the supply/demand imbalance means that housing prices ''are likely to decline further. This may recreate the housing death spiral -- as lower housing prices mean more borrowers become underwater.'' Which makes them more likely to default, which lowers prices further, and on and on.
The only way to stop the death spiral is through principal reduction. The reason is simple: ''The data show that principal modifications work better'' than other kinds of modifications, she says. Interest rate reductions can lower monthly payments, but the home remains just as underwater as it was before the modification. And the extent to which a home is underwater is the single best indicator of whether the homeowner will default. The only way to change the imbalance between the size of the mortgage and the value of the home is to reduce principal.
Will widespread principal reduction cause homeowners to purposely default on their mortgages? Goodman has some ideas about how to reduce that likelihood, but she is also realistic: ''A borrower will make a decision to default if it is in his or her best interest.''
One wishes that the country could make economic decisions that are in its best interest, decisions that use Laurie Goodman's data-driven approach instead of being motivated by ideology. Goodman's case for principal reduction is powerful precisely because it is not about just or unjust, or who's to blame and who's at fault.
It is about cold, hard economics. Three years after the bursting of the subprime bubble, principal reduction isn't just a nice-sounding way to help homeowners. It is our only hope of finally ending the housing crisis.

HEADLINE: Producer Explains Scrapping 'Funny Girl'

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY; Dave Itzkoff contributed to this article.

 BODY:
The Broadway producer Bob Boyett had never heard so much bad news in a single week: Four longtime investors in his shows had each backed out of his latest, a $12 million Broadway-bound revival of the hit 1964 musical ''Funny Girl,'' he said in an interview on Friday.
He had been counting on $750,000 to $1 million from each of them, he said, but now they were skeptical about the profitability of ''Funny Girl'' in a theater season when six other classic musicals -- including ''The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess'' and ''Evita'' -- were also opening in revival on Broadway. Some of the investors were also feeling the pinch of the nation's economic troubles, which New York commercial theater has largely escaped so far. 
At the same time, the buzz among Broadway ticket agents and other producers was that the star of ''Funny Girl,'' the television actress Lauren Ambrose (''Six Feet Under''), might end up giving a brilliant performance, but she was unlikely to sell many tickets on her name. Most musical revivals are star-dependent, since theatergoers tend to be familiar with the music; hence the casting of stars in current Broadway hits like ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying'' (Daniel Radcliffe), ''Anything Goes'' (Sutton Foster), and ''Follies'' (Bernadette Peters).
And ''Funny Girl'' was a star vehicle if there ever was one, with the original production making Barbra Streisand's reputation for her performance as the comedian Fanny Brice -- a legendary run that is one reason the musical has not been staged on Broadway since then.
On Thursday afternoon Mr. Boyett -- who has won nine Tony Awards for ''War Horse,'' ''South Pacific,'' ''Spamalot,'' and other shows -- made the toughest call that a theater producer can make. He indefinitely postponed the Los Angeles tryout of ''Funny Girl,'' which was already selling tickets for a winter run, and scrapped a springtime transfer to Broadway, which had been officially announced just four weeks ago.
He spent the next few hours on the telephone with, among others, his director Bartlett Sher (who said on Friday that he was still ''in a state of shock'') and Michael Ritchie, the artistic director the Center Theater Group who had booked ''Funny Girl'' in a handshake deal for the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles.
Mr. Boyett, who had spent eight years developing the ''Funny Girl'' revival, declined to name the investors who dropped out. But he said he had never found himself in this position before.
''I just kept hearing from other producers, and then from my investors, that the timing was wrong and that the economic landscape wasn't right to try to do a top-level revival of 'Funny Girl,''' said Mr. Boyett, whose budget for the show included an orchestra of 23 musicians (large by current Broadway standards), a cast of about 25 actors, and multiple sets. ''I think we could have turned a profit in a year on Broadway, but there were just no guarantees that the tourists and others would flock to the show in the numbers we needed.''
Pulling the plug on a previously announced Broadway production is rare, especially when (as in this case) theaters have been booked and actors cast. (The Tony nominee Bobby Cannavale was slated to play Nicky Arnstein, Brice's love interest.) Since the economic downturn began in 2008, only one major commercial production of a musical revival -- ''Hair'' -- had difficulty raising money at the 11th hour; in that instance, new producers were brought in and ''Hair'' ultimately opened in March 2009 at a cost of $5.8 million. The show went on to win the Tony for best musical revival and turn a profit in five months.
''Financing Broadway productions is no doubt challenging in this economy, but over all most investors have been standing by shows and our theaters are pretty much booked up with productions,'' said Philip J. Smith, chairman of the Shubert Organization, one of Broadway's chief landlords and the owner of the Imperial Theater where ''Funny Girl'' was set to run.
The Imperial will now go to ''Nice Work if You Can Get It,'' a Gershwin songbook show whose producers had been vying with ''Funny Girl'' for the theater.
Landing the Imperial for ''Funny Girl'' proved to be a curveball, Mr. Boyett said. With Broadway theaters generally scarce this season, he had initially been planning to open the revival in Los Angeles in January to energize his investors about the production and Ms. Ambrose's performance. When the Imperial unexpectedly became available in early October with the closing announcement for ''Billy Elliot,'' Mr. Boyett chose to give a quick yes to an offer from the Shubert Organization.
''I had been thinking of bringing 'Funny Girl' to Broadway in late summer or fall 2012, when maybe there would be fewer musical revivals running than in the current season, but the Imperial is a great theater that doesn't become available very often,'' Mr. Boyett said.
In Los Angeles, Mr. Ritchie is now looking for a quick fill-in for the Ahmanson. ''We hadn't spent much money on 'Funny Girl' at this point, so we'll be able to move on,'' he said. ''Bob is a great producer and, really, I think he made a courageous decision here.''
Representatives for Ms. Ambrose did not reply for requests for comment on Friday, but Mr. Sher described her as ''heartbroken, like the rest of us.''
He and Mr. Boyett insisted that the revival did not fall apart because of concerns about her drawing power; investors had not seen her perform songs from the show -- Mr. Boyett does not usually hold so-called backers' auditions -- but details about her audition performance and singing ability had been provided to investors, Mr. Boyett added.
Mr. Sher noted that, inevitably, ''investors might have had concerns about any actress we picked given that Barbra Streisand was extraordinary as Fanny.'' (Ms. Streisand won an Academy Award for best actress for the 1968 film adaptation.) However, he added, ''I think Lauren would have given a performance that would have long been remembered.''

HEADLINE: When Two Beautiful Lives Begin to Unravel

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
NEW HAVEN -- The young couple in ''Belleville,'' a quietly devastating new play by Amy Herzog, would seem to have everything going for them. Attractive, amiable and well educated, they are still playfully affectionate after five years of marriage. Sure, their funky new apartment in Paris is on the scruffier outskirts of the city, in the neighborhood that gives the play its title. But what's better than to be young, in love and living in Paris -- anywhere in Paris?
And yet as the play proceeds, Ms. Herzog slowly scrapes away the surface of glossy hope and promise coating the central characters, Zack (Greg Keller) and Abby (Maria Dizzia). Hints of unhappiness and disorder are slowly, almost stealthily revealed, until we come to see, with a clarity that is both heartbreaking and hair-raising, how both members of this seemingly contented couple are walking a tightrope over a chasm of despair. 
Ms. Herzog's thrillingly good play, having its premiere here at Yale Repertory Theater, confirms her reputation as one of the brightest new talents in the theater. (Her play ''4000 Miles'' will reopen at Lincoln Center Theater in the spring after its acclaimed run in a smaller theater last summer.) Directed with flawless finesse by Anne Kauffman, ''Belleville'' is both a perceptive drama depicting the sudden fraying of a young marriage and a nail-biting psychological thriller about how festering secrets and reservoirs of guilt can drive even stable people to the brink of violence.
After meeting in college and marrying shortly after, Zack and Abby have embarked on a new life in Paris, where he is working for Doctors Without Borders on research to prevent the spread of AIDS among children. Abby, an aspiring actress who feels she is already surfing toward Social Security at 28, has to settle for teaching yoga. (''To be an actor you have to love to suffer,'' she says in one of the play's lighter moments, ''and I only like to suffer.'') Their move was inspired in part by the death of Abby's mother, from which Abby has not entirely recovered, although she has finally decided to stop taking antidepressants.
In the play's opening scene Abby shuffles in from a canceled yoga class, expecting to find the apartment empty. Instead she stumbles on Zack in the bedroom, in front of the computer during a moment of, shall we say, self-intimacy. At Zack's cajoling, Abby quickly laughs off the embarrassment, but when she later steals into the bedroom to see what he was watching on that computer, the sounds of violent sex we hear are just the first in a series of seemingly inconsequential events that contribute to the play's unsettling atmosphere.
Zack explains away his presence at home during a workday -- he just felt like playing hooky -- but when he and the couple's landlord, the French-African Alioune (Gilbert Owuor), get a little high together, we learn that Zack hasn't paid the rent in four months, a fact that Abby clearly doesn't know. Nor does Abby realize just how dependent Zack has become on his self-medication with marijuana; when she's in the bedroom he goes on a frantic search for leftovers, having used up his regular stash.
It is rare for a young playwright to be in such confident command of all the theater's resources as Ms. Herzog is here. In ''Belleville'' it is not just the perfectly pitched, naturalistic dialogue that contributes to the play's steadily growing atmosphere of tension and unease, as Abby and Zack bicker over matters large and small: her obsessive need to talk to her father on her cellphone every day, or whether she's really happy living in Paris. When Zack tells her his first priority is her happiness, she flares up at him: ''I am not happy, O.K., that's just not, like, my mode of being, so if that's what you're trying to accomplish, stop.''
Even such small details as the closing and opening of the bedroom or bathroom door resonate with ambiguous meaning as we come to sense that under the congenial surface of their marriage are more complicated layers of feeling. In the destabilizing atmosphere of a foreign city, both Abby and Zack are discovering alien new facets of each other -- and perhaps of themselves. A stubbed toe, a playfully confiscated cellphone, Abby's overindulgence in alcohol on their date night: these seemingly innocuous events take on shades of menace and threat as the facade of Abby and Zack's easygoing relationship crumbles to reveal far darker currents.
And then there's the appearance of that knife. It's brought into the living room for a practical purpose, to cut up some bread to help settle Abby's stomach. But from the moment it shows up we are alive to the possibility that it might be used for more gruesome ends.
But while ''Belleville'' is among the most suspenseful plays I've seen in years, I don't mean to suggest Ms. Herzog has written a standard-issue thriller. The drama is as moving as it is unnerving in its intimate examination of how Zack and Abby find themselves stumbling toward tragedy for reasons neither of them can quite fathom, and at a pace that's terrifying to watch. That they are immensely appealing people, compassionate toward each other's weaknesses and doing their best to battle through their own, is precisely what makes their disintegration so harrowing to watch.
It helps that they are portrayed with insight and delicacy by Ms. Dizzia and Mr. Keller. The nuanced performances of these fine actors in rich and complex roles may benefit from the pair's prior experience acting together, as not one but two married couples in the lighter-spirited ''Cradle and All'' at Manhattan Theater Club last season. Mr. Keller never loses his laid-back charm as Zack, even when we begin to see the irresponsibility beneath it. Ms. Dizzia likewise makes Abby touchingly vulnerable and distinctly prickly.
The distinctions between two couples in the play -- Alioune's wife, Amina (Pascale Armand), is the fourth character -- could be read as a pointed commentary on the aimlessness and sense of entitlement endemic to some American youth, members of a new lost generation who are finding it hard to move forward in their lives and careers amid a moribund economy. The businesslike gravity of Alioune and Amina is a far cry from the casual attitudes and genial fecklessness of the Americans.
But that's not to say that our sympathy ever really abandons Abby and Zack. The predicament they find themselves enmeshed in so suddenly involves just a few small mistakes, made mostly out of sincere love and the brash enthusiasm of youth, the natural hope that in the end things will work out. And as you watch ''Belleville,'' you find yourself wanting to believe it too, desperately wishing them the best even as those goose pimples tell you to fear the worst.

HEADLINE: From Roughnecks to Bosses, Ministry Seeks to Save Souls in the Oilfields

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN. 
E-mail: sgf1@columbia.edu

 BODY:
JEWETT, Tex. -- With a box of Bibles as cargo, John Bird steered his Chevy Suburban off a two-lane road in the oil patch of East Texas and pulled up to the isolated derrick of Energy Drilling Company Rig 9. He was delivering the holy books to a man named Robert Bailey, the site superintendent, known in industry jargon as a tool pusher.
The two men had never met, and Rig 9 was a modest destination, a cluster of turbines and trailers around a steel tower, all of it surrounded on three sides by a cattle ranch. On a brilliant autumn Saturday, the kind normally reserved for the Texan religion of football, Mr. Bird had driven there, 140 miles from his home outside Houston, on behalf of the Oilfield Christian Fellowship.
He had helped found the lay ministry 20 years earlier with the aim of evangelizing among the itinerants and tough guys and hard livers who populate the rigs. That effort took the textual form of a Bible interspersed with testimonies from oil workers, sized to fit in the back pocket of overalls and titled ''God's Word for the Oil Patch: Fuel for the Soul.'' 
Mr. Bailey, the middle man in this particular transaction, had endured 15 years of crystal meth addiction and repeated rounds of jail and drug rehab. Clean and sober for three years now, he still has the weathered face and scarred veins to show for his journey and a story of salvation he is eager to share.
''People always say the Lord looks out for fools and idiots,'' Mr. Bailey, 38, joked with Mr. Bird as they sat in a trailer, its walls covered with specs for drill bits, occupational safety fliers and an 800 number for poison control. ''And that's the truth, because I was the biggest fool and idiot.''
So as Mr. Bird handed over 10 copies of the special Bible for Mr. Bailey to pass out to co-workers, and as he promised to ship a carton with 20 more, he was enacting the most foundational of Christianity's commands, spreading the good news of the Lord. And in an era of high-tech proselytizing, by computer and satellite and smartphone app, he was doing it in a way as ancient as the faith itself.
''It's 2,000 years old,'' Mr. Bird said of the fellowship's evangelism. ''Jesus, when he was out witnessing, was rejected by plenty of people. So he said, 'Shake the dust off your sandals and get on down the road.' I'm 68. I don't have time to waste.''
He certainly has wasted little in the last 20 years. Since its founding, the Oilfield Christian Fellowship has expanded from a single room in Houston to rigs off the coasts of Brazil and Gabon and to trailer chapels in the oil shale boomtowns of Wyoming and North Dakota. It has distributed 125,000 copies of ''God's Word for the Oil Patch'' in English and Spanish and is now publishing a version in Mandarin as well.
The fellowship has accomplished all this in an industry fearsomely resistant to the niceties of religion. Rig work is measured in the extremes of boom-and-bust cycles; of weeks on the job with nowhere to go and weeks off the job with money to spend; of families waiting a state or a continent away; of drugs, alcohol, gambling and pornography all abundantly at hand.
''The oil and gas industry is the last vestige of cowboys and rough and tumble,'' Mr. Bird said. ''When someone died on the rig, you just mopped up the blood and everyone went back to work. Christianity was seen as a sissy thing.''
Back in 1991, when Mr. Bird was selling specialized chemicals for drilling, a friend and petroleum engineer named Jim Teague asked how many Christians he knew in the industry. After Mr. Bird struggled to come up with eight or nine names, Mr. Teague said, ''That many?''
Even so, the two men persuaded the pastor of First Baptist, a Houston megachurch, to let them try to hold a prayer breakfast. By word of mouth alone, 46 people turned out for the 6 a.m. event. The next one, a Wednesday lunch, drew 250.
Many of these oil workers, it was true, attended more as a way of networking and job hunting during a recession than of worshipping the Almighty. Then again, they may have been the economic version of the foxhole that has no atheists. Mr. Bird and Mr. Teague realized they were onto something.
From the outset, the two leaders insisted that the fellowship be composed of lay volunteers, not paid professionals. Among the leathery skeptics of the oil patch, Mr. Bird believed, a minister preaching the born-again message would be dismissed as a mere salesman. An oil worker sharing his Christian witness would be far more credible.
Sure enough, from the roughnecks at the bottom of the industry hierarchy to the executives at the top, the fellowship attracted a growing number of members. Mr. Bird proposed that instead of just sending out Bibles, the fellowship should design its own, targeted at oil workers. A fellowship member, Mike Chaffin, then elicited and edited 16 personal testimonies -- from sales representatives, engineers, even a chief executive -- to be incorporated amid the New International Version text. A first printing of 5,000 in 2006 has now gone well into six figures.
What the phenomenon comes down to is the same thing that worked for the original apostles: relationships. Several years ago, newly saved and newly sober, Mr. Bailey spotted a rig buddy reading ''God's Word for the Oil Patch.'' He found out he could order his own from this fellow named Mike Chaffin, and so he did. Since then, Mr. Bailey has received and given away upward of 150 copies, along with his own tale of degradation and redemption.
''I just tell them God blesses them and loves them,'' he said of his evangelism. ''I minister to them about things that happened in my life, and I tell them the answers are all in this book.
''Some people just look at you like you're stupid. Others say they lost the book, whatever the excuse is. But that's all right. It's about planting seeds. Once you plant the seeds and fertilize them, something's going to grow.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The On Religion column on Saturday, about the Oilfield Christian Fellowship, a ministry that serves oil workers in the field, misidentified the person who proposed that the fellowship design its own Bibles interspersed with testimonies from oil workers. He is John Bird, founder of the ministry -- not Mike Chaffin, a drilling engineer. (Mr. Chaffin elicited and edited the personal testimonies included in the Bible.)

HEADLINE: L.S.U.-Alabama Assures Tuscaloosa of Many Winners

BYLINE: By MARQUAVIUS BURNETT

 BODY:
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- When it comes to the college football showdown between No. 1 Louisiana State and No. 2 Alabama on Saturday night, there are already plenty of winners.
Fans are selling their tickets for hundreds of dollars over the face value and businesses are salivating at the prospect of 150,000 or more people who will arrive in this college town for the game. At football-mad universities like Alabama, every home game provides a financial boon to the local economy, but a highly anticipated matchup like this week's is something different.
Ahmad Ijaz, the director of economic forecasting for the Center of Business and Economic Research at the University of Alabama, said this weekend would be bigger than a normal football weekend. 
''The impact on Tuscaloosa is estimated to be around $18 million and impact on the state could be around $25 million,'' Ijaz said. ''The impact is about $3 to $4 million higher than the average football game.''
The game also presents an opportunity for students to take some of the lessons learned in their economics classes and apply them to real life. Some Alabama students, who were able to purchase tickets to the game for $5, are now selling them for hundreds of dollars to other students and fans.
Jared Downing, a junior majoring in philosophy who said Saturday would be a huge day for his bike taxi business, sold his ticket for $400.
''I talked to my boss and said, 'If you're going to let me work 14 hours, I'm going to sell my ticket,' '' Downing said. ''If I was to go, I wouldn't be missing out on $300, I'd be missing out on $1,000.''
But others, like Debra Flax, a senior majoring in journalism, see a drawback when student tickets go to those who do not attend Alabama.
''It's helpful to be able to sell your ticket, but it takes away from the student section,'' Flax said. ''When you start filling it with family and friends, then it takes away from what makes the student section great.''
A number of small businesses are welcoming the big crowds.
Freddie and Marsha McKinley own Big Bad Wolves BBQ, which sets up at the Houndstooth Sports Bar. Big Bad Wolves offers catering for tailgates and has a varied menu, but it is the barbecue nachos that draw the most customers.
''The portions are very large, and the meat has a lot of flavor,'' said Lee Thomas, manager of Big Bad Wolves. ''A lot of people really enjoy the sauce that we have.''
Thomas said he expected a huge profit on Saturday, especially because the game was being played at night.
''People come and eat barbecue all day, and they'll pick up some for their tailgates,'' he said. ''So with this being a later game and it being such a big SEC game, we will see a larger profit.''
Big crowds can also mean trouble, and Mayor Walter Maddox said Tuscaloosa was readying itself.
''We plan to employ a 15 percent increase in our police force that day,'' he said. ''Other than that, we expect to have normal game-day operations.''
Maddox also said he and the city would embrace the large crowd and the economic benefits it would bring to the city.
''We know L.S.U. travels large,'' Maddox said. ''I would imagine, obviously, we'll have more than 100,000 people inside the stadium and tens of thousands outside, and it's a night game. We anticipate a long day of festivities in the city.''

HEADLINE: Occupying the National Debate

 BODY:
The Occupy Wall Street protest continues to inspire demonstrators across the nation and beyond. At midweek, protesters of the economy's woeful status quo were reported gathered in more than 70 American cities, while there were similar demonstrations in London, Frankfurt and, of course, Cannes, where the G-20 governments wrestled with the threat of more economic disaster. 
As their numbers grow, the protesters seem to be increasingly welcomed, or at least tolerated, by their fellow citizens, many of whom share their despair at a fundamental lack of opportunity and their anger at Wall Street's fiascos, aided and abetted by politicians.
The Occupy movement insists it will not fade with winter's foul weather. Some activists talk of going to the Iowa caucuses, which would be a real change for a presidential arena usually ringing with bromides and placebos.
Headlines lately have focused on two nights of sporadic violence in Oakland, Calif., marked by firebombs and police tear gas. But members of the main body of 7,000 peaceful protesters quickly apologized and denounced what even the Oakland police characterized as a minority of self-styled anarchists exploiting from the fringe.
New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, has been juggling the imperatives of free speech and civic peace while remaining wary of police excesses. ''There is no easy answer,'' he properly noted. ''If you want to yell and scream, we'll make sure you can do it.'' Actually, Occupy Wall Street is not merely yelling and screaming. The movement's progress is heartening for all Americans suffering lost opportunity and clueless political leaders.

HEADLINE: Brazil's Long Shadow Vexes Some Neighbors

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Sara Shahriari contributed reporting.

 BODY:
LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Sandal-clad indigenous protesters have excoriated their president, calling him a ''lackey of Brazil.'' Angry demonstrations in front of Brazil's embassy here denounced its ''imperialist'' tendencies. Bolivian intellectuals lambasted the ''Sao Paulo bourgeoisie,'' likening them to the slave hunters who expanded the boundaries of colonial Brazil.
Such heated words used to be reserved for the United States, which has wielded extraordinary influence across Latin America. But as American dominance in the region recedes and Brazil increasingly flexes its newfound political and economic might, it has begun to experience the pitfalls of the role as well: a pushback against the hemisphere's rising power.
''Power has shifted from one side of Avenida Arce to the other,'' said Fernando Molina, a local newspaper columnist, referring to the street in La Paz where the Brazilian ambassador's residence sits opposite the towering embassy of the United States. 
Brazilian endeavors are being met with wariness in several countries. A proposal to build a road through Guyana's jungles to its coast has stalled because of fears that Brazil could overwhelm its small neighbor with migration and trade.
In Argentina, officials suspended a large project by a Brazilian mining company, accusing it of failing to hire enough locals. Tension in Ecuador over a hydroelectric plant led to bitter legal battle, and protests by Ashaninka Indians in Peru's Amazon have put in doubt a Brazilian dam project.
But perhaps no Brazilian project in the region has stirred as much ire as the one here.
Financed by Brazil's national development bank -- a financial behemoth that dwarfs the lending of the World Bank and has become a principal means for Brazil to project its power across Latin America and beyond -- the plan was to build a road through a remote Bolivian indigenous territory. But it provoked a slow-burning revolt; hundreds of indigenous protesters arrived here in October after a grueling two-month march that took them up the spine of the Andes, denouncing their onetime champion, President Evo Morales, for supporting it.
''Llunk'u of Brazil,'' read one of their placards, calling the president a minion of Brazil, in Quechua, an indigenous language. Mr. Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president and an avowed environmentalist, suddenly found himself at odds with an important part of his political base, defending a Brazilian project that could increase deforestation. He eventually yielded to the protesters' demands and ruled out the road though the territory.
Companies from other countries, notably China, are also expanding rapidly in Latin America and occasionally confronting hostility. But Brazil is the region's largest nation, with a population of about 200 million people, and the size and boldness of its rise over the past decade help explain some of the tension it has generated.
Hundreds of thousands of Brazilian immigrants and their descendants have settled in Paraguay, often buying up land for large-scale agriculture in a country with a much smaller population. Called Brasiguayos, they have been both celebrated for helping Paraguay's economy boom and demonized for controlling large tracts of land, at times leading land activists to burn Brazilian flags.
More than a century ago, before it became a republic, Brazil was an empire with occasional designs on neighbors' territory, often serving as an arbiter in disputes in Latin America.
Brazil now relies on a sophisticated diplomatic corps, rising foreign aid payments and the deep pockets of its development bank, which finances projects not just in Latin America but in Africa as well.
''When Kissinger came to Brazil more than three decades ago, he warned his hosts that they could end up being feared rather than loved by their own neighbors,'' said Matias Spektor, a professor at Brazil's Fundacao Getulio Vargas, an elite educational institution, referring to the former American secretary of state, Henry A. Kissinger, and his efforts to forge stronger ties with Brazil in the 1970s.
''Now Brazil is engaging Latin America more deeply, without a clear policy of addressing the anxiety that can accompany this process,'' Mr. Spektor said. ''There's the real danger of being on the receiving end of anger in certain places.''
Here in Bolivia, the United States once had unrivaled influence, before Mr. Morales's election in 2005. Since then, Mr. Morales has clashed repeatedly with Washington while warming to other countries, notably Brazil, Venezuela, Cuba and Iran. Since 2008, when Mr. Morales expelled the American envoy, Philip S. Goldberg, the United States has not had even an ambassador here.
But Brazil's profile has grown. A Brazilian company, OAS, won the $415-million road contract in 2008, with financing coming from the National Bank for Economic and Social Development in Brazil. It is making about $83 billion in loans in 2011. The World Bank, by comparison, lent $57.4 billion.
As the protest march against the road began advancing through the lowlands in August, Brazil's popular former president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, flew to Bolivia to deliver a speech sponsored by the Brazilian company to businessmen and to meet with Mr. Morales. (Mr. da Silva's aides argued the road dispute was not part of the trip's agenda.)
The trip came at critical time, when talks were faltering. But Mr. da Silva's trip failed to ease the tension, and it became known his visit was part of a three-country trip paid for by OAS and Queiroz Galvao, another Brazilian construction company, which included stops in Costa Rica and El Salvador.
''It's obvious that Brazil just wants our resources,'' said Marco Herminio Fabricano, 47, an artisan from the Mojeno indigenous group who was among the marchers to La Paz. ''Evo feels like he can betray us to his Brazilian allies.''
Brazilian officials insist that the road has nothing to do with betrayals or resource grabs.
''We want Brazil to be surrounded by prosperous, stable countries,'' Marcel Biato, Brazil's ambassador to Bolivia, said about infrastructure financing in Bolivia and elsewhere in South America.
Indeed, Brazilian authorities argue that their country has access to other sources of raw materials, as well as to routes across the continent through which it can send goods to ports on the Pacific.
But the road does hold strategic importance for coca growers, perhaps Mr. Morales's most loyal constituency, made up largely of Quechua- and Aymara-speaking Indians, setting up a clash between them and other indigenous groups that live in the territory.
Brazil continues to nurture an array of plans in Bolivia, including several hydroelectric projects and an ambitious antidrug policy that involves deploying drones on the border and training and equipping Bolivian security forces.
But the road dispute has put Brazil on watch here. ''Just as China consolidates regional hegemony in Asia, Brazil wants to do the same in Latin America,'' said Raul Prada Alcoreza, a former senior official in Bolivia's government who is now a fierce critic of Mr. Morales.
''A Bolivian process intended to provide an alternative, and the social movements which helped make this government possible,'' Mr. Prada said, ''end up being trampled by Brazilian interests.''

HEADLINE: 26.2 Miles of Change

BYLINE: By C.J. HUGHES

 BODY:
As dusk fell, a woman, head to toe in black, bounded down the sidewalk, with a leash in one hand and a baby tucked against her chest. By the curb, two men in suits loudly debated the stock market. And at a Mexican bistro, patrons sipped Chardonnay from stemless glasses under graffiti framed as art.
Ordinary stuff, maybe, for many New York neighborhoods. But this lively mix of bar-goers and Wall Streeters and harried parents was percolating on Vernon Boulevard, in Long Island City, Queens, a highway-bordered neighborhood that until recently seemed to function largely as a giant parking lot.
In 1976, when the New York City Marathon first trudged through Long Island City en route from Staten Island to Manhattan, the area had an even more pungent industrial flavor. A common sight at night then wasn't stockbrokers but trucks, lots of them, rumbling from low-slung warehouses down dark streets with cargoes of bread, beer and soda. 
And sometimes they got too close for comfort. ''I had my car hit by so many Pepsi trucks, I couldn't even tell you,'' said Robert Guarnaschelli, a lifelong resident, as he stood near 46th Avenue, marveling at the changes.
For the first six races of the New York marathon, from 1970 to 1975, the course did little more than loop through Central Park. But in the funk of the cash-poor, high-crime late 1970s -- the Me Decade for some, the Crisis Decade for the city -- organizers thought they should give a wide and varied slice of New York something to cheer about.
To say that the marathon, in its touching of the five boroughs in 2011, will traverse a changed city is to state the obvious. Still, to run the course today is to appreciate, in a distinctive block-by-block, bridge-by-bridge progression, just how different the city is. And at least in some instances, how truly ''other planet'' different it is.
The transformation of Long Island City, from a vast asphalt expanse into a neighborhood rich with luxury two-bedroom condos, is just one startling stop on the city's remade and repopulated landscape. Charred blocks are now flush with trees. Discos have given way to pharmacies. Immigrant groups have faded, to be replaced by arrivals of new colors. The gulf between rich and poor has blown open.
Sure, one could pick any thoroughfare in the city, or devise your own 26-mile spin through New York, and note change. But the marathon's route, year in and year out, draws runners from across the globe and declares, in its punishing and entertaining way, ''This is New York.''
Consider this, then, a how-we-live-now guide, observed in tank top.
Mile 2
Following the graceful curve of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, runners practically coast into Bay Ridge, their introduction to Brooklyn.
For most of the 20th century, this was a tight-knit enclave of Scandinavians, Irish and Italians, drawn by work on ships. When Grete Waitz, the nine-time marathon winner from Norway, went whizzing through there, her country's flags would be flapping, said Bob Carlsen, 72, a third-generation Norwegian who cheered her on.
A Miss Norway is still crowned every spring, and Nordic Delicacies sells tins of fish pudding on Third Avenue.
But in the 1970s, Norwegians had seven social clubs, Carlsen said; now there are two, and they share space. And attendance at the annual Norwegian parade, held in May, ''seems to be more limited each year,'' he said.
The Irish and the Italians are dwindling as well, as Bay Ridge over the last 15 or so years has experienced the turnover and tumult of ethnic change.
New faces belong to Russians and Asians, with a huge Muslim population, too. Women in purple and gold hijabs stroll down Fifth Avenue past the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge, a popular mosque that is the community's spiritual heart.
Ziad Khaled, 48, a Muslim born in Lebanon, now owns Hookahnuts, a store that sells pistachios with its tobacco pipes. A window sign promises ''alcohol-free perfume.''
Muslims are among the fastest-growing segment of new arrivals in New York. And while the aftermath of Sept. 11 produced all sorts of discomfort and unease -- many Pakistanis, for instance, either chose or were forced to leave -- the arrival of Muslims in the city continues unabated.
Khaled, a Muslim, still feels the sting of the post-9/11 anger and anxiety, and from people who say all who practice Islam are terrorists. He said, ''I'm ashamed to say this, but we need a lot more education in this country about religion.''
But he is not going anywhere, as he and his fellow Muslims in New York continue what can no doubt feel like their own marathon toward acceptance.
Mile 8
Slightly less than a third of the way into the route, the marathon takes a sharp right onto Lafayette Avenue, and thus into the heart of perhaps one of the neighborhoods more representative of change in New York: Fort Greene, Brooklyn.
Its rebirth reflects some of the sweeping changes that have altered daily life in the city: reductions in crime, explosions in property values, and the development and deepening of the city's cultural life outside Manhattan.
Those changes, of course, have also ignited in Fort Greene the kind of conversation taking place in many corners of the city -- about the merits of gentrification, the complications of integration and the implications of aggressive policing.
The shifts, seismic or nuanced, good or controversial, are beyond dispute. Shaded blocks, like those along South Portland Avenue, boast antique row houses with inviting stoops. Intersections are anchored by stylish eateries like Olea Mediterranean Taverna at Adelphi Street. There is dance and art, concerts and readings.
Access to all that doesn't come cheap; one-bedroom apartments fetch half a million dollars. Prices have also soared for basics. Back in the 1970s, Ralph's, a corner market at South Portland, was a Budweiser station, for marathon watchers or runners looking to reload some carbs. Now, Ralph's stocks River House beer for $18 a six-pack.
Mile 11
Williamsburg can seem timeless, and for decades runners entering it have mingled, mostly with mutual respect, with the neighborhood's Hasidic Jews in their traditional attire.
The neighborhood today, just a little way up Bedford Avenue, is the authentic, if slightly overexposed, frontier of one of the more significant demographic developments in New York in the last decade or so -- the influx of young people from places other than New York. They have poured into the Lower East Side and the South Bronx, Bushwick and Astoria, but Williamsburg is the de facto capital of the infusion.
Of course, the hipsters of Williamsburg can have a retro take on their own dress that might make the Hasidim smile.
On a recent evening, near North Seventh Street, a man in a floppy blazer held what looked like a lime-green banana to his ear, then began talking into it. It was a plastic telephone handset, the kind that graced most America homes through the Reagan era, though its cord was plugged into a digital device. Following him, a group of girls giggled in awe.
The surge of twenty-somethings here in the past 10 years -- the area's construction fences are tagged with literate squiggles like ''the world is crazy but you don't have to feel like that'' -- is evident with the arrival of each L train at North Seventh Street, and is at least responsible in some significant part for driving the average age of a New Yorker to 36.
Already, though, the adjoining neighborhood on the marathon's route, Greenpoint, looks at Williamsburg and sniffs: too old.
Patrick Ferrell, 27, moved to Greenpoint from Greensboro, N.C. A record label employee with Buddy Holly glasses, Ferrell also plays bass for No Man, No Eyes, an ''experimental rock band.''
Ferrell said he would never relocate to Williamsburg; too many aging poseurs, he said. ''Way too many 'rad dads' floating around,'' he said.
Mile 14
In a legacy-solidifying push, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration has rezoned some 20 percent of the city, a vast relaxation of restrictions on the building of housing, housing and more housing, much of it awfully expensive.
Long Island City's changed character and altered look are a testament to that rezoning and the rebuilding that has come as a consequence. Yes, there are still myriad taxi depots, used-car lots and garages. Not to mention that huge billboards, for department stores, orange juice and cellphones, catch the eyes of commuters on the Long Island Expressway below.
But people who ran the route in the '70s no doubt do double takes these days. Developers have recently lined Jackson Avenue with angular condos. A complex known as Hunters View was built over an auto-parts store. One Vernon Jackson rose over a razed glue factory. And One Hunters Point, on Borden Avenue, stands in the footprint of a parking lot where children a couple of generations back played touch football.
Adding so much sizzle to a sleepy city corner has charmed some business owners like Sung Park, 52, a deli owner on Vernon since 1988.
In 2009, he decided the neighborhood had changed enough that he could move beyond selling soda and sandwiches. He opened a museum on 50th Avenue, formally known as Underpenny Antiques, where his collection of 19th-century cast-iron pot holders, some 200 of them, are on display. Oh, and you can buy an oil painting there, too.
''Years ago, you couldn't tell cabdrivers 'Long Island City,' so we would tell them to go to the Midtown Tunnel tollgate,'' he said. ''But now they know where to go.''
Mile 16
Mention First Avenue to club-hoppers of a certain age, and a wave of nostalgia, not to mention a flashback or two, might overtake them.
Starting in the 1960s, and bumping and grinding until the 1980s, the area that radiates north of the Queensboro-Ed Koch Bridge, where marathon runners now enter Manhattan, was a trove of boisterous disco/restaurants that were so memorable that they still inspire Austin Powers-like reactions.
''This place was absolutely swinging, night after night,'' said Anthony King, who in 1972 opened Finnegan's Wake, at East 73rd Street, to join the party. Today, the stucco-sided restaurant and the comedy club Dangerfield's, circa 1969, are the only surviving traces.
Times have buttoned up. From a staff of two bartenders and a bouncer, and a closing time of 4 a.m., King has just one bartender today and winds things down at 1 a.m., he said.
His more shimmering peers seem to have met rather dull ends, contributing to the contemporary sleepiness of this stretch today.
Adam's Apple, at No. 1117 (''Come take a bite out of life,'' a TV commercial urged), is a mattress store; Magique, which later became a Chippendale's, at No. 1110, sells bath towels. About the only watering hole to morph into something similar is the original T.G.I. Friday's, at No. 1152, now Baker Street.
The most marquee-level club was clearly Maxwell's Plum, at No. 1885. From 1966 to 1988, its burgers-and-caviar menu drew an A-list of actors like Cary Grant, Warren Beatty and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was torn down in the mid-1990s, and the site now has an orange-brick 12-story apartment building with a Duane Reade.
''At some point, the scene headed downtown,'' King said, ''definitely somewhere below 14th Street.''
Mile 22
Harlem: For a century, it might have been the American address most strongly identified with African-Americans, and as such it was one of the signature locations on the marathon's map of New York.
Yet for many years, Harlem, the upper Manhattan neighborhood between the East and Hudson Rivers that marathoners traverse along Fifth Avenue, was also considered imperiled: Block after block of brownstones had concrete blocks for windows. And rubble-choked lots could have an apocalyptic look.
Today, both notions of Harlem -- as a distinctly black piece of the New York puzzle or as a place afflicted with urban ills -- no longer quite apply.
Many of the neighborhood's black residents, having been priced out of their homes or after having made a surprising killing by selling them, have left in the last decade. Indeed, the population in the standard boundaries of Harlem no longer has a black majority. In 2008, for instance, black residents accounted for just 40 percent of the population from roughly 96th to 155th Streets, census data shows. Even in one of Harlem's cores -- west of Fifth, by Marcus Garvey Park -- residents are 10 percent white.
Whether this black-white flip-flop signals an unwanted invasion or just a chance for old-timers to cash out is a question that is fervently hashed out over dinner at Sylvia's, the Lenox Avenue mainstay, or Red Rooster, a popular upstart nightspot.
Some new white arrivals are just glad to clear up misconceptions.
''I never came up here before because I was told it was dangerous,'' laughed Ron Van Lieu, 70, who has lived in lower parts of Manhattan since the 1960s and moved to Harlem two years ago. An acting teacher at Yale's drama school, Van Lieu was out walking his dog, Ella.
Harlem, it turns out, has also lured one of the marathon's founders -- George Hirsch, 77, who in 2008 traded his home in Murray Hill for a condo on Central Park North.
For all the change, or perhaps because of it, Hirsch thinks the race is no less able to unify the city now than it did when he helped dream it up. In fact, two years ago, when he ran it for the last time, ''the guy from my bodega came over to give me a shout,'' he said. ''That was really nice.''

But many of its neighboring restaurants and businesses are newcomers: Staples is across the street and Red Rooster Harlem and Chez Lucienne are one block south.

(PHOTOGRAPH BY SHANNON STAPLETON FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (D5) GRAPHICS: The Evolving Face of the Course: The New York City Marathon began in 1970, but the route first touched all five boroughs in 1976. The runners from the early years would find significant changes to the neighborhoods along the current course. Places that were largely working-class and white in the '70s are now much more diverse. Rezoned industrial neighborhoods are attracting the next generation of affluent New Yorkers. Historically black neighborhoods are less distinct, as the city's black population declines. Poor parts of the route's quick swing through the Bronx are just as poor, now with more Mexican immigrants. And the wealthy parts of Manhattan's Upper East Side are as rich as ever.
A Richer Route: The chart along the marathon route shows the change in median income from 1980 to 2009 after adjusting for inflation. Incomes across the city rose 23 percent in that period. The peaks on the chart are in neighborhoods that have gentrified since 1980.
Comings and Goings: The ethnic makeup of some of the neighborhoods along the route has changed. The Puerto Rican and black populations are down in nearly all of the neighborhoods and the Asian population is up, sometimes significantly, along virtually the whole course. Mexicans have seen their numbers rise as well, especially in places like Sunset Park and East Harlem. (Sources: Socialexplorer.com

HEADLINE: The World Leader in Health Care Costs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''How Much Does Health Cost?'' (Sunday Review, Oct. 30):
Citing the latest figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showing that the United States spends far more than all other countries on health care, Ezekiel J. Emanuel notes that the United States ''is actually doing worse than a number of countries, like France or Germany, that spend considerably less.''
I believe that a significant factor in high health care spending and poor health care results is the high rate of obesity in the United States. The O.E.C.D. report states that the adult obesity rate in the United States is 33.8 percent, considerably higher than rates in Western Europe and Japan. 
A government initiative to reduce the national obesity rate would go a long way toward improving Americans' health. One approach would be a federal tax credit for fitness-related expenditures like gym memberships.
ERROL C. ISENBERG Sunrise, Fla., Oct. 30, 2011
To the Editor:
One of the major problems in controlling health care costs in the United States is the expectation that we will use maximum resources to prolong life, regardless of its quality. We maintain individuals on mechanical ventilation, dialysis and other life support even when they have a terminal malignancy or end-stage organ failure and these treatments are futile.
Typically this level of care is demanded by family members of an unconscious patient, often overriding the expressed wishes of the patient, even in the presence of an advance directive.
Europeans are less likely to subscribe to the belief that extraordinary inpatient care is warranted for the terminally ill. Rather, they believe that care in familiar surroundings with family and friends at home or in a hospice facility with comfort measures is more appropriate to allow the patient to die in peace and with dignity.
ALAN S. KATZ Merion Station, Pa., Oct. 30, 2011
The writer is a pulmonologist.
To the Editor:
Regarding Ezekiel J. Emanuel's article pointing out that the United States spends almost 50 percent more per patient than second-ranked Norway and twice as much as France:
Your Oct. 29 front-page article ''Sports Medicine Said to Overuse a Popular Scan'' noted that M.R.I.'s ''are easily misinterpreted and can result in misdiagnoses leading to unnecessary or even harmful treatments.'' As a rheumatologist, I am aware that M.R.I.'s for patients with knee pain, especially in those over 50, will almost always reveal an abnormality of questionable significance in a cartilage or ligament. Except for an acute injury, surgical arthroscopic treatment is unlikely to result in improvement.
The costs for unnecessary and useless procedures for diagnosis and treatment must be controlled with strict guidelines for their use. There will be anguished cries of ''rationing'' from specialty societies and patient groups, but I see no other tenable way to start to control medical costs.
LONNIE HANAUER West Orange, N.J., Oct. 30, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''U.S. Economy Picks Up Pace, Averting a Stall'' (front page, Oct. 28):
While the nation saw a 2.5 percent growth in the economy last quarter, a major part of the increase in consumer spending is for health care. As robust as health care industries are, they must serve consumers better by delivering value for the dollar, not just cost.
Consumers are going deeper into debt on health care, whose costs continue to rise well beyond the rate of inflation. At the same time, a recent Commonwealth Fund report shows no significant progress in quality of care, access to care and patient-centered outcomes.
Health care spending should not be the driver for our recovery. In fact, reducing health care spending is essential to our country's economic well-being. Payment reform, more efficient and reliable delivery systems, and better information for doctors and patients about effectiveness of medical interventions are what we need to improve care and hold down costs -- which would be good for both consumers and for businesses.

HEADLINE: Pursuing Self-Improvement, At the Risk of Self-Acceptance

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
SOMETIMES I get tired of always striving to be better -- of knowing there are ways, endless ways, I can improve myself or members of my immediate family.
When I feel really down, I think of how far we have to go. We could, for example, start our own vegetable garden, use that homegrown produce to make delicious and healthy meals and compost the leftovers in the composter we don't yet have. Then we could turn off -- or even throw out -- the television and read to each other from the classics while sitting in our hand-carved chairs.
It's not going to happen. Not that any one of those ambitions is impossible. They are just not a priority. Still, at various times they feel as if they should be (except maybe the hand-carved chairs).
Self-improvement is a deeply embedded American trait, something other cultures find both admirable and amusing. The notion that we can constantly make ourselves better is, in theory, a great idea. 
But when does it become too much?
''There's a tendency to seek and seek and seek and never find,'' said Kristen Moeller, creator of the Web site selfhelpjunkie.com. (The motto? ''Stop Waiting. Start Living.'') ''It becomes one more addiction.''
It's not that trying to find ways to improve ourselves is a bad thing -- not at all. ''A man's reach should exceed his grasp,'' the poet Robert Browning wrote. But when we're constantly reaching rather than occasionally being satisfied with what we have in front of us, that's a recipe for perpetual dissatisfaction.
''We grew up with the idea that we can do anything,'' said Hollee Schwartz Temple, a professor of law at West Virginia University and co-author of ''Good Enough Is the New Perfect'' (Harlequin, 2011). ''But we took that to mean that we have to do everything. And many women took it as you have to do everything perfectly.''
Ms. Temple and her co-author, Becky Beaupre Gillespie, a former journalist, surveyed about 1,000 mothers in their 30s and 40s nationwide and interviewed about 100 for their book. They found that the women broadly fell into two categories: ''never enoughs'' and ''good enoughs.''
Never-enough women felt they had to be the best at everything and often agreed with the sentiment that ''I need to be a superstar even if it kills me,'' Ms. Temple said.
Those in the good-enough category were, as is self-evident, fine with not being the best as long as they felt they were doing pretty well. But more important than how these women described themselves was how they described their lives.
''The never-enoughs more often described their marriages as poor, or even a disaster,'' Ms. Temple said. ''The good-enoughs were more satisfied and happier in their marriages. And they were just as likely to advance in their careers as the never-enoughs.''
None of this may seem particularly new. You can't have it all. Perfection is the enemy of the good. But the struggle to find the balance between stagnation and stress -- sinking into a rut or racing on the hamster wheel -- resonates even more now in these economically down times, when even your best efforts don't seem to be reaping the rewards you expected.
''In our culture, there are so many different messages about being successful, and we try to implement all of them,'' Ms. Gillespie said. ''We need the courage to choose which definition of success we want.''
And the courage to realize that we may explore and seek, but there are often no answers -- or not the ones we want, said Ms. Moeller, who wrote the book ''Waiting for Jack'' (Morgan James Publishing, 2010) about her attempts to get in contact with Jack Canfield, author of ''Chicken Soup for the Soul'' (Heath Communications Inc., 1993). The book's title and theme refer to her realization that she, like so many people, was waiting for someone to provide the answers instead of looking inside herself.
''It's natural for a lot of people to search for something more,'' Ms. Moeller said. ''Or something happens and they want to make sense of it.''
But we can't go around with the idea that ''one day I'll arrive; one day I'll be whole,'' she said. ''It's an illusion that one day I'll be fixed.''
Such constant searching, she said, leads to a sense that you're waiting to live your life rather than living it. Or you'll feel that you're always falling short, because rarely is the road to self-improvement easy or straightforward, and it's certainly not the same for everyone.
On her blog, Ms. Moeller listed, somewhat tongue in cheek, the signs of a self-help junkie, including these:
''You could own a small island in the Caribbean for the amount of money you have spent on seminars, retreats, coaches, workshops and books, and yet you are still not satisfied.''
''After each course you take, you claim that you now know that you are perfect just as you are, but then you hear about this new course that really sounds perfect and you secretly think, maybe this one will be IT.''
Trying to figure out ways to make ourselves better is nothing new. Dale Carnegie's seminal ''How to Win Friends & Influence People,'' was first published in 1936. The first 12-step program, Alcoholics Anonymous, began a year before that in 1935.
This striving for self-improvement and the belief that we can all achieve success if we just work hard enough and figure out the right path, has political, not just personal, ramifications.
David Brooks, a New York Times columnist, wrote in a 2003 Op-Ed page column that Americans ''always had a sense that the great opportunities lie just over the horizon, in the next valley, with the next job or the next big thing,'' adding, ''None of us is really poor; we're just pre-rich.''
That idea that we can all potentially occupy the executive suite is one of the reasons that Americans have been less ready than some other cultures to protest income inequality, said Daniel Letwin, an associate professor of history at Pennsylvania State University.
But Occupy Wall Street and its offshoots may indicate a sea change.
''Clearly, throughout U.S. history there's been two competing streaks among Americans -- acceptance of, even admiration for the wealthy, when people buy into notions of fluid mobility and equal opportunity, and indignation when the inequalities of wealth and power become too grotesque, when the prospects for ordinary people stall no matter how hard they're trying, and the system seems rigged,'' Professor Letwin said.
Occupy Wall Street can be seen both as a rebellion and as an acknowledgment that most of us won't ever reach the pinnacles of power -- and perhaps don't even want to, Ms. Temple said.
The reality, she said, is ''a lot of people are finding that 'I don't want to aspire to what I always thought I wanted to aspire to.' ''
Of course, I still hope one day to grow the beautiful tomatoes and tasty zucchini and cook up lovely meals with my homegrown bounty. It's not an impossible dream. But I'll put aside the composting for now and leave the television where it is. After all, as we've learned, there's no point in pushing this self-improvement thing too far.

HEADLINE: Feeling Insecure

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
11/4/11 Updated with fuller results.
Just 17 percent of Americans say they are better off financially than they were last year at this time, according to a new Bankrate.com survey. Thirty-one percent consider themselves worse off and 49 percent say they are financially about the same as a year ago. 
Greg McBride, senior financial analyst for Bankrate.com, cited the weak economy, sluggish housing sector and a volatile stock market in the results: ''Americans' feelings about their savings, debt and net worth continue to erode,'' he said in a statement.
Bankrate.com's Financial Security Index fell in October to 92.8 from 93.9 and is now at its second-lowest level of the year. (Any reading below 100 indicates feelings of less financial security relative to 12 months ago.)
The study was conducted in October by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, using landline and cellphone interviews with 1,000 adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points. The full survey can be viewed here.
In other findings, just 11 percent of Americans are more comfortable with the amount they have in savings now compared with one year ago, and 45 percent are less comfortable.
Only 20 percent of Americans are more comfortable with their debt now, a figure that has dropped every month since June, and 27 percent are less comfortable.
Nineteen percent of Americans report higher net worth than one year ago, while 30 percent report lower net worth.
The survey found that older Americans have been hit hard by the economic turmoil. Thirty-one percent of Americans from ages 50 to 64 say they feel less secure in their jobs, and 14 percent consider themselves more secure.
In addition, 56 percent in that age group say they feel less comfortable with how much they have in savings, while only 5 percent are more comfortable.
One bright spot (for waiters, at least): 70 percent said their tipping habits haven't changed due to the economy.
Do you feel your financial situation is better or worse than it was a year ago?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

 BODY:
8:15 P.M. (Sundance) MAD BASTARDS (2011) In this debut feature shown at the Sundance Film Festival, where it was a nominee for the grand jury prize, T J (Dean Daley-Jones, above), a hotheaded former prisoner, hitchhikes to a town in northwestern Australia in search of his estranged 13-year-old son, Bullet (Lucas Yeeda). There he meets a policeman, Texas (Greg Tait), who has started a group in which Aboriginal men can discuss their problems. The movie, written and directed by Brendan Fletcher, was filmed with mostly Aboriginal nonactors. The soundtrack features the Pigram Brothers, an indigenous folk-blues band from Broome, also in the northwest. ''It feels authentic,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times.
10 A.M. (Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network) EURO-NO! HERE WE GO AGAIN Neil Cavuto reports on the most recent developments in the economic meltdown in Greece. He will also interview Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington, and Fred Tomczyk, chief executive of TD Ameritrade Holding, the online broker, about how the European Union's debt problems could affect the United States economy. 
NOON (13) RICHARD HEFFNER'S OPEN MIND In the first of two episodes, Ira Millstein, a senior partner at the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges in New York, discusses how he responds to students at Columbia and Yale universities when they press him about the country's financial crisis.
6 P.M. (MTV) TRUE LIFE: I'M OCCUPYING WALL STREET The Emmy-winning documentary series follows three young people for two weeks as they participate in the Occupy Wall Street movement in Zuccotti Park in New York, exploring the daily realities of the demonstrators' living conditions and the motivations that drive them.
8 P.M. (Logo) THE LEGACY OF BRENDAN BURKE This documentary examines the life of the son of Brian Burke, now the president and general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team. Brendan followed in his father's footsteps to become a hockey manager at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. In 2007 he told his family that he was gay, and in 2009 informed his team, a story that was leaked on ESPN.com, leading to widespread public support and a discussion of homophobia in the hockey world. Brendan died in a car crash on Feb. 5, 2010. His funeral was attended by the Maple Leafs' full roster. During the 2010 Olympic Winter Games, the United States national men's ice hockey team, for whom his father was the general manager, wore dog tags inscribed ''In Memory of Brendan Burke.''
8 P.M. (Hallmark) LOVE'S CHRISTMAS JOURNEY (2011) After her brother (Greg Vaughan) goes missing, a young widow (Natalie Hall) finds herself in charge of his children.
8 P.M. (Lifetime) THE PASTOR'S WIFE (2011) In this adaptation of a true story, Rose McGowan (left, with Michael Shanks) plays Mary Winkler, the wife of Matthew (Mr. Shanks), a minister in Selmer, Tenn., who in 2006 was found fatally shot in his home. Mary was soon named the prime suspect in his murder. But why would a wife in a seemingly idyllic marriage shoot her husband and leave him to die?
9 P.M. (BBC America) BEDLAM In this season finale, Molly (Ashley Madekwe) is haunted by the image of a burning man, forcing Ryan (Will Young) to come to her aid. Then things get intimate. Kate (Charlotte Salt), meanwhile, faces a crisis as she wrestles with her conscience. And Jed (Theo James) confronts a terrible secret from the history of the mental hospital turned luxury apartment building as he tries to make contact with his mother. In ''The Graham Norton Show,'' at 10, Mr. Norton chats up James McAvoy, Joanna Lumley and John Bishop, and the Arctic Monkeys perform.
9 P.M. (CUNY) THE STRANGER (1946) Orson Welles directed and stars in this melodrama about a Holocaust mastermind living incognito as a schoolteacher in a Connecticut town after World War II. When a Nazi hunter from the United Nations War Crimes Commission (Edward G. Robinson) arrives, the stage is set for disaster. The film, written by Anthony Veiller, comes off as ''a bloodless, manufactured show,'' Bosley Crowther said in The Times. ''The atom-bomb newsreels on the same bill are immeasurably more frightening.''
10 P.M. (Planet Green) BORN DEALERS Each winter Jerry Pasternak and his son Jeremiah scour the state of Florida for kitschy Americana at low prices. In the summer they sell their ''mantiques'' at Antique and Unique, their shop in Rockland, Me. This latest entry into the collectibles genre begins as Jeremiah decides to open a Florida store against his father's advice.

HEADLINE: Anxious Over Jobs and Europe, Wall St. Falls for Week

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Liz Alderman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks dipped on Wall Street after sinking in Europe on Friday as the Group of 20 nations ended a summit meeting with seemingly little headway in resolving the debt crisis in the euro zone.
The declines pushed equities markets to cumulative losses for the week, with indexes in the United States shedding about 2 percent or more. The latest jolt came from the meeting in France of G-20 leaders, who wrapped up their talks without commitments of money to prop up Europe's bailout fund. And in Greece, Prime Minister George A. Papandreou survived a confidence vote early Saturday local time, after calling off a referendum on Greece's new rescue deal with its international creditors.
While the debt crisis in Europe has unsettled global financial markets for more than a year, analysts were also watching on Friday for any insight the monthly jobs report in the United States could provide on the pace of the nation's recovery. 
But that report from the Labor Department did little to improve sentiment, showing that employers in the United States added 80,000 jobs in October, slightly below economists' forecasts, compared with 158,000 jobs in September.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, closed down 2.4 percent. The German DAX was down 2.7 percent and the CAC 40 in Paris was down 2.25 percent. The FTSE 100 index in London ended the day 0.3 percent lower.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down about 0.6 percent, or 7.92 points, at 1,253.23. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5 percent to 11,983.24 and the Nasdaq composite index was down 0.4 percent to 2,686.15.
Financial stocks fell 1.3 percent in the United States, among the worst performing sectors.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 10/32, to 100 25/32, and the yield fell to 2.04 percent from 2.07 percent late Thursday.
As the euro zone crisis has developed, the markets have sometimes swung erratically, building gains one day and wiping them out the next. The three main Wall Street indexes finished last week up more than 3 percent.
But that gain started to be tested on Monday, then fell further when Greece said it would put the terms of its planned bailout to a public vote. Stocks managed to squeeze out some gains on Wednesday and Thursday, but fell flat on Friday.
In addition, a bankruptcy filing this week by MF Global in the United States raised concerns about the exposure of financial institutions in the United States to the debt problems in Europe. And borrowing costs in Europe for the most troubled economies have been rising again to worrying levels.
Guy LeBas, the chief fixed-income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott, said investors were ''watching their backs'' for other troubled financial institutions.
One move that emerged from the G-20 meeting, however, was Italy's decision to have the International Monetary Fund monitor its belt-tightening efforts.
Italian bonds, among the most pressured, have hit yield levels that signify the most expensive 10-year money the country has borrowed since switching to the euro. The rising borrowing costs make it even more difficult to reduce the overall debt load.
On Friday, the yield on 10-year bonds in Italy climbed again to 6.35 percent, up from 6.18 percent.
''Looking ahead, while Greece is front and center now, the core problem for the euro zone is how to mitigate contagion to Italy,'' said currency strategists from Brown Brothers Harriman in a research note.
The euro was at $1.3770 on Friday, down from $1.3812 on Thursday.
In addition to Europe and the economic data in the United States, investors have also been scrutinizing corporate reports, which in recent weeks have somewhat steadied the American market.
On Friday, all of the major sectors in the broader market were lower, but some companies seemed resistant to the declines.
Starbucks, for example, posted fiscal fourth quarter earnings that beat estimates, and was the most widely traded stock of the consumer companies, propping them up as a group, which fell less than 1 percent. Its shares rose 6.7 percent, to $44.19.
Genworth Financial was one of the few to rise in the financial sector. Its shares rose $7.19, more than 16 percent, after it reported strong third-quarter earnings.

PERSON: John R. Opel 

HEADLINE: John R. Opel, Who Made I.B.M. a Colossus, Dies at 86

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
John R. Opel, who presided over I.B.M. in its final period of dominance in the information-processing industry and oversaw the company's move into personal computers, died on Thursday in Fort Myers, Fla. He was 86.
His death was confirmed by Jeff Wickham, a son-in-law, who declined to disclose the cause. 
Mr. Opel (pronounced OH-pel) joined I.B.M. as a salesman in 1949, as the computer age was just dawning, and served as the company's chief executive from January 1981 until January 1985.
A year after he took the top post, the Department of Justice dropped its 13-year-old antitrust lawsuit against I.B.M., freeing the company to compete more aggressively.
Compete it did. Revenue nearly doubled during Mr. Opel's tenure, to the point that by the end of it, competitors were publicly complaining that I.B.M. was too powerful. In 1983, Time magazine featured Mr. Opel on its cover with the headline ''The Colossus That Works.''
But things changed soon after Mr. Opel left office. In the late 1980s and early '90s, I.B.M. went through a painful period of cutbacks as the computer business underwent huge changes. Small computers based on microprocessors and using standardized software increasingly took over from centralized machines using proprietary hardware and software, I.B.M.'s stock in trade.
I.B.M. itself helped spur the shift when it introduced its first personal computer in 1981, a project started under the previous chief executive, Frank T. Cary, but completed by Mr. Opel.
I.B.M. did not design everything itself. In an effort to make an inexpensive machine that could get to market quickly, it used a microprocessor from Intel and operating system software from Microsoft.
The machine was a hit, making desktop computing acceptable to corporate America and becoming the industry standard.
But competitors realized they could essentially make copies of the machine using Intel chips and Microsoft software. The power in the computer industry shifted to Intel and Microsoft, and hardware became a low-price commodity. I.B.M. eventually sold its PC business and some other hardware operations, and now focuses on software and services.
John Roberts Opel was born on Jan 5, 1925, in Kansas City, Mo., and grew up in Jefferson City, Mo., where his father ran a hardware store. He majored in English at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., fought in the Philippines and in Okinawa in World War II and earned a master's of business administration degree from the University of Chicago in 1949.
Mr. Opel then weighed two job offers -- one to rewrite economics textbooks and the other to take over his father's hardware business, according to an appreciation of Mr. Opel that I.B.M. posted on its Web site.
To mull things over, he took a fishing trip with his father and a family friend. The friend happened to work for I.B.M., and he offered Mr. Opel a job as a salesman in central Missouri. At the time, in 1949, I.B.M. was selling electric typewriters and accounting equipment and just starting to introduce electronic calculating machines.
In 1959, Mr. Opel became an executive assistant to Thomas J. Watson Jr., the company's chief executive. He rose rapidly, taking positions in manufacturing and public relations, among other departments. He managed the introduction of the seminal System 360 mainframe computer in 1964.
Mr. Opel was often viewed as the quintessential I.B.M. man, adhering to the company's deep traditions with his emphasis on the customer and impeccable dress and a certain reticence with outsiders.
''He was a very client-centric, client-focused person,'' said Nicholas M. Donofrio, a former executive vice president at the company. ''He would constantly remind us of that.''
But I.B.M. also began departing from tradition under Mr. Opel. In addition to introducing a personal computer, the company moved into telecommunications, in part through the acquisition of the equipment maker Rolm. It acquired a stake in Intel, mainly to shore up Intel against Japanese competition. And it revamped its own manufacturing to allow it to compete better against the Japanese.
Time magazine's article in 1983 quoted an I.B.M. board member as describing Mr. Opel as ''plain vanilla, but good plain vanilla.'' He rarely granted interviews or spoke about his private life.
But insiders said he was thoughtful and well read. ''He was as much at home in bird watching and poetry as he was in managing the boardroom,'' said Patrick A. Toole, a former senior vice president.
After stepping down as I.B.M.'s chief executive, Mr. Opel remained chairman until May 1986 and a board member until 1993.
He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Carole; five children, Robert, Julie Conlee, John E., Nancy Wickham and Mary Porteus; and 15 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: U.S. Adds a Modest 80,000 Jobs; Rate Drops to 9%

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Could have been worse.
That was the reaction on Friday to the government report that the nation's employers added just 80,000 jobs in October. While the pace was not exactly robust, it was better than over this summer, when monthly hiring fell to 20,000. Upward revisions in the report for September and August gains contributed to the sense that the economic picture was a little less bleak.
''The underlying momentum of the economy is better now than we thought it was a few months ago,'' said Augustine Faucher, the director of macroeconomics at Moody's Analytics. ''We're doing O.K., even if we're not doing great. The odds of a double-dip recession are lower, at least.'' 
But even without a second recession, frustration over the sluggish recovery could impede President Obama's re-election chances.
The administration is still haunted by its overly optimistic predictions, made in January 2009, of what the economy would look like once Congress passed a $787 billion stimulus package. White House economics advisers predicted that the stimulus would bring unemployment down to 6 percent by the end of this year and close to 5 percent by the end of 2012. Instead, unemployment dipped slightly to 9 percent in October from 9.1 percent, about where it has been all year long. The Federal Reserve is projecting about 8.6 percent for next year.
While the Congressional Budget Office and other nonpartisan organizations have said, again and again, that the recession and recovery would have been even worse without government intervention, Republican presidential contenders argue that today's weak economy proves that fiscal stimulus cannot create jobs.
The Obama administration has taken the opposite tack, arguing that the economy needs more, not less, government assistance.
''What I take from this report is that the economy is moving in the right direction, but it's not moving there fast enough, and this is why the administration proposed the American Jobs Act,'' said Alan B. Krueger, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
The job gains in October were just barely enough to keep up with population growth, so they did not substantially reduce the backlog of 14 million unemployed workers. As a result, the unemployment rate is still about double what it was in the year before the recession began, 4.6 percent.
''It will take years for the U.S. job market to return to its prerecession glory,'' said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics.
Economists and politicians typically view the monthly jobs number as a crucial indicator of the nation's economic health. But with so many potential game changers on the horizon in Europe and at home, the latest report may say little about what Americans should expect.
The fate of Greece has been up in the air for about a year and a half, and this week the political wrangling has been particularly tumultuous in Athens. If the European bailout deal falls through for Greece, the effects could spread to other heavily indebted countries like Italy and perhaps set off another global financial crisis.
''The outlook ahead remains for modest growth, but risks remain to the downside without a convincing resolution of the euro zone crisis, which is conspicuously absent at present,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight.
Mitigating these worries, however, is the case of MF Global, an American financial services company that filed for bankruptcy this week after making bad investments in European markets. The bankruptcy of the relatively small firm was taken in stride.
''We had a primary dealer file for bankruptcy this week without seeing any of the waves from 2008 related to Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers,'' said John Ryding, the chief economist at RDQ Economics, referring to two bigger financial firms whose collapses helped send global financial markets into a tailspin.
Another potential wild card is Congress's panel on deficit reductions, the so-called supercommittee. Talks have stalled, and the committee has less than three weeks before an alternative (and more draconian) plan might kick in.
If government spending cuts are put into effect too quickly, they could be a severe drag on the economy and even derail the fragile recovery, economists have said. Governments at various levels have been steadily paring back, and have laid off, on net, 323,000 workers in the last year.
There are other domestic policy unknowns, too. Congress has not yet decided whether to renew a 2 percent payroll tax cut and federal extensions of unemployment benefits -- both set to expire in January. Many economists support the measures.
Even if shocks like these do not materialize, the economic outlook is still troubling.
Among the biggest challenges is the army of millions of Americans who have been out of work for months or even years.
The average time an unemployed worker has been pounding the pavement is unusually high, at 39.4 weeks, just shy of the all-time high of 40.5 weeks recorded in September. People who have been out of work for longer spells have significantly more trouble getting rehired, for complicated reasons, including stigma and the deterioration of skills.
''In interviews, they say they're concerned that my base of skills has been antiquated because of this employment gap,'' said Sarah Hoppe, 43, a former account manager in Toledo, Ohio, who was laid off in July 2009.
''I tell them I have a good mind and an infinite capacity to learn,'' she said, but employers still pass her over. ''It's absolutely demoralizing.''
In addition to the upward revisions to previous job growth numbers, there were a few other positive signs in the latest jobs report.
Employment in temporary help services rose slightly. Employers often use temp workers before taking the plunge and hiring permanent staff.
Hourly earnings also rose 5 cents, after a gain of 6 cents in September.
The length of the average workweek, however, remained flat at 34.3 hours, where it has been for about a year. Companies usually work their existing employees harder before hiring additional workers, so the stagnant workweek is not a particularly good sign for job growth.

HEADLINE: Corzine Out As Search For Funds Continues

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED; Azam Ahmed, Kevin Roose and Peter Lattman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The missing customer money at MF Global is still missing.
On Friday, funds from the bankrupt brokerage firm suddenly surfaced at JPMorgan Chase. Washington and Wall Street, for a moment, were hopeful it was the money they had been searching for all week.
But then, just as quickly, nearly everyone agreed it was not the missing money, and the hunt was on again. 
While MF Global has more than $2 billion in accounts at JPMorgan, regulators had previously accounted for those funds, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. Federal officials estimate that roughly $600 million has been misplaced or misused or has disappeared altogether, two of the people said.
The revelation - and the sharp reversal - is the latest debacle in the bankruptcy of MF Global.
Adding to the drama, the firm's chief executive, Jon S. Corzine, the former Democratic governor of New Jersey and head of Goldman Sachs, resigned early Friday. In a more surprising development, Gary Gensler, head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, will no longer participate in the investigation due to his long acquaintance with Mr. Corzine, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
It is just the beginning. Regulators are still camped out at the brokerage firm's Midtown Manhattan headquarters, poring over the books. Exchange officials are transferring customer accounts to other brokerage firms. And company executives are helping to close the firm.
The process of winding down MF Global will be long and arduous. The courts continue to sort through the mess at Lehman Brothers, more than three years after the investment bank filed for Chapter 11.
''It's going to be complicated when you have a multibillion-dollar company,'' said Professor J. Samuel Tenenbaum, the director of the Investor Protection Center at Northwestern University School of Law. ''That just doesn't happen overnight. It would be nice to think that you can get this done quickly, but that would be fanciful.''
The demise of MF Global can be traced to risky bets on European sovereign debt.
Soon after joining the firm in 2010, Mr. Corzine moved to transform the sleepy brokerage firm into a full-service investment bank in the mold of his former employer, Goldman. He aggressively bought up the bonds of troubled economies like Italy, Ireland and Spain, betting that the Continent would not let the countries default on their loans.
As the sovereign debt crisis dragged on this summer, regulators noticed the risky bets and pushed the firm to hold more capital against the investments. The move alarmed shareholders, clients and rating agencies, inciting a crisis of confidence. With the stock sliding, the firm searched desperately for a suitor.
But the missing money proved the death knell for MF Global.
Before dawn on Monday, the firm uncovered a nearly $1 billion hole in its customer accounts. The startling discovery scuttled a last-minute deal to sell part of the business to Interactive Brokers Group, a Connecticut rival. Out of options, MF Global filed for bankruptcy that morning.
Within hours, regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, started investigating MF Global and the missing money. The Federal Bureau of Investigation joined the fray on Tuesday. Federal authorities worried that MF Global had violated a basic principle in this business: customer assets must be kept separate from company funds.
As the scrutiny intensified, Mr. Corzine was said to have hired Andrew F. Levander, a prominent criminal defense lawyer. Mr. Levander, the chairman of Dechert, has represented other Wall Street executives including John Thain, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch. Mr. Corzine has retained two bankruptcy lawyers from the firm Perkins Coie to represent him in the civil Chapter 11 proceedings.
Neither Mr. Corzine nor MF Global have been accused of any wrongdoing. MF Global says the shortfall is temporary, as additional money will flow in from banks and clearinghouses.
In resigning on Friday, Mr. Corzine ended what was supposed to be his grand return to Wall Street after nearly a decade in politics. The company said that he would not seek his $12 million in severance.
''I feel great sadness for what has transpired at MF Global and the impact it has had on the firm's clients, employees and many others,'' Mr. Corzine, 64, said in a statement. ''I intend to continue to assist the company and its board in their efforts to respond to regulatory inquiries and issues related to the disposition of the firm's assets.''
Mr. Gensler, head of the C.F.T.C., decided Thursday to step back from the inquiry, and the following day he did not participate in an agency briefing on MF Global; Mr. Gensler had worked for Mr. Corzine while both were at Goldman Sachs in the 1990s.
As regulators try to untangle the books, customers, whose accounts were frozen on Monday, are waiting to get their money back. The CME Group, the exchange where MF Global did business, is transferring client funds to other brokerage firms, including R.J. O'Brien and ABN Amro, people involved in the process said.
But customers won't be made whole - at least not yet.
Industry groups pushed for customers to receive about 70 percent of their cash, according to the people involved in the process. But because roughly $600 million hasn't been found, clients will only get on average 60 cents on the dollar, court filings show.
The situation puts customers, including individual investors, hedge funds and big companies, in a financial bind. Until the money surfaces, many clients will have to come up with extra cash to maintain their positions, or they will be forced to liquidate their trades, potentially at a loss.
It could take some time for the money to materialize, assuming it does.
With scarce information, even regulators and industry insiders are grasping for answers. The situation was underscored by the brief elation following media reports that the missing money might have turned up.
But, it hadn't. JPMorgan, which confirmed MF Global had accounts with the bank, said in a statement ''that it does not have any information as to whether any such balances are related in any way to the 'missing' customer funds.''

HEADLINE: Political Memo: Missed Jobs Forecast in 2009 Resonates in Campaign

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
A year out from Election Day: an eon in political time, sufficient to alter circumstances substantially for or against either party. But Friday's tepid jobs report brings a fresh reminder of the stubborn difficulty President Obama and his team face in overcoming one of their most enduring mistakes, one made before he even took office.
Ten days prior to Mr. Obama's taking the oath of office in January 2009, his economic team released a report outlining the estimated benefits of the $775 billion stimulus plan he was seeking. The projections were quite specific. The stimulus legislation passed just a few weeks later at about the size the White House had sought. Had all gone as promised by the report, the unemployment rate right now would have been around 6.5 percent, heading down to around 6 percent by the end of this year and a little over 5 percent at the end of next year. 
The Labor Department announced Friday that the unemployment rate for October was 9 percent, down from 9.1 percent a month earlier, and that job growth for the month was just 80,000, nowhere near the rate necessary to drive joblessness toward anything like 6 percent. The Federal Reserve has already projected that the unemployment rate will be at least 8.5 percent at the end of next year, meaning the next presidential term would start with a higher rate than the 7.3 percent Mr. Obama inherited when he took office.
The gap between the projections his team made in early 2009 and the grim reality of the last three years has produced a substantively debatable but politically powerful argument for Republicans. It has helped rally conservative opposition to most of Mr. Obama's subsequent agenda, and going into the thick of the presidential race it has become the primary basis not only for the Republican case against a second Obama term but also for the most intensive conservative assault in decades on Keynesian economics and the role of government.
Sometimes in factually exaggerated ways, Republicans on the campaign trail are using the busted projections to assert that the stimulus bill failed, that government cannot create jobs and that it is time for less spending rather than more.
''He has proven for once and for all that government spending will not create one job,'' Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said of Mr. Obama at one Republican presidential debate, adding: ''Keynesian policy and Keynesian theory is now done. We will never have to have that experiment on America again.''
Mitt Romney's economic plan highlights the chart in the 2009 Obama report showing the projected path of the unemployment rate following the stimulus and an additional line showing the (much higher) actual unemployment rate. Other than its caution about significant margins of error, Mr. Romney's plan states, the Obama projections ''failed to fulfill the predictions of its authors and their White House sponsor'' and make clear that Mr. Obama's approach has not worked.
The two parties would no doubt be engaged in a spirited ideological debate over economic policy right now even if that early 2009 report had gotten it exactly right.
And for those interested in the underlying economics, there's a persuasive case that the report actually did not get it all that wrong. While the report seriously underestimated the severity of the recession and therefore the job losses the nation would suffer in 2009, it was proven right in its basic point that the stimulus plan would yield substantial job-creation compared to doing nothing. In other words, it was correct in projecting a significant, positive impact on jobs from the stimulus spending, but wrong in its assumptions of the depths of the job-loss hole the stimulus was trying to fill.
Despite repeated Republican claims to the contrary, the stimulus bill created at least hundreds of thousands of jobs, according to nearly all nonpartisan analysts, including the Congressional Budget Office.
But it's impossible to compress the nuance onto a bumper sticker. As a political matter, Republicans have used the shortfall relative to the projections to establish a narrative that the stimulus failed, and with it Mr. Obama's presidency. To the White House's intense frustration, the chart showing the early 2009 projections has become the centerpiece of the closing Republican argument against Mr. Obama's re-election and against the economic policies his party stands for, including the jobs package Congress is debating and largely rejecting now.
''It's the most destructive non sequitur in the history of economic policy,'' said one of the authors of the report, Jared Bernstein, who was economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. until earlier this year. ''Somehow because we got the forecast wrong, they don't have to do anything to help the unemployed.''
''The fact that the recession was deeper than we and the majority of other forecasters realized at the time is no reason for Congress to give up on helping the jobless,'' he said. ''If anything the numbers suggest that we should still do more.''
Christina Romer, who served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers and was the report's other main author, has similarly called for additional stimulus measures, and the White House has labored to produce counternarratives to offset the damage from the 2009 projections.
But so far the White House arguments, while sound on the merits, have been largely defensive in nature and hardly inspiring politically: The economy's condition three years ago was much worse than anyone realized. Without the stimulus job losses would have been much worse. If nothing further is done to address the problem, it's the fault of the Republicans.
The best hope now for the White House may be convincing voters not to judge Mr. Obama based on those nearly three-year-old projections of how the stimulus would work, but instead on whether the economy is substantially improving from a year ago, when unemployment peaked at 10.1 percent.
The jobless rate is down more than a full percentage point since then, not a small improvement. Friday's jobs report held mixed signals about the economy's strength. But there are not many months left for Mr. Obama to persuade the nation to measure his performance by a different benchmark.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: With a Book, the Last Democrat in the White House Tries to Help the Current One

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR

 BODY:
Last summer, as Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton celebrated the former president's 65th birthday with a party at their rented Hamptons home, talk among their guests turned to President Obama's travails over the debt crisis and doubts about his re-election. ''I'm really trying to help him,'' the white-haired former president said, shaking his head, ''but he seems to have lost his narrative.''
Starting Tuesday, that help will take its most public form yet, in the form of a new book by Mr. Clinton, titled ''Back to Work,'' that makes a case for confidence in government and Mr. Obama's jobs bill. The book marks a new and somewhat warmer stage in the two men's rivalry and relationship, one that could benefit Mr. Obama. The awkward twist: the former president has been so frustrated at what he sees as the current one's failure to explain his economic policies that he has literally decided to write his own version of the story. ''He both sells it and wants them to sell it more,'' said John Podesta, a former Clinton chief of staff who also advises the current administration. 
The differences between the two leaders go to the very bedrock of personality and temperament. Mr. Obama has discipline that Mr. Clinton can barely dream of; Mr. Clinton excels precisely where Mr. Obama struggles (at economic storytelling and attracting white working-class voters). Their divide began long before Mr. Obama's 2008 primary battle with Mrs. Clinton, now the secretary of state. In 1996, the new Illinois state senator criticized Mr. Clinton's move to the center, called his campaign ''disturbing'' and said his convention was ''for sale''; Mr. Clinton returned the favor by endorsing Representative Bobby Rush, Democrat of Illinois, whom Mr. Obama had challenged.
There has been no recent heart-to-heart talk for the two men, say their aides, no confessional moment about the ill will generated during the 2008 campaign. Instead, they have improved their bond through a series of mutual allies -- Mrs. Clinton, but also Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., their chief mediator -- brief but positive meetings, and shared beliefs.
The Obamas have never invited the Clintons for dinner at the White House, but there have been other encounters like a recent golf game and an impromptu joint briefing room appearance in 2010 and a private 2011 meeting in the Roosevelt Room that generated an energy-efficiency initiative. They are fundamentally united on policy issues, which helps. ''The policy has reinforced the personal,'' said Gene Sperling, a top economic adviser to both administrations, who briefed the eager former president on the jobs bill when Mr. Obama announced it.
At home in Chappaqua, N.Y., Mr. Clinton spends over an hour a day ''studying the economy,'' as an aide put it, meaning clipping newspaper articles and reading obscure government reports. ''I think he thinks to himself, 'God, this is what I would do' '' in response to the grim circumstances, a former Clinton economic official said.
''Back to Work'' is a classic Clinton talkathon, zooming from job-creation ideas to a complaint about something he saw on Bill Maher's show. He expresses sympathy for Mr. Obama, but his private critique comes through as well: incredulity that the president and Democratic leaders did not raise the debt ceiling during the 2010 lame-duck session; bafflement that many beneficiaries of Mr. Obama's policies ''didn't even know about'' his actions; and frustration about the lack of a powerful Democratic message in the midterm elections.
He said that he and Mr. Biden failed to persuade the Democratic National Committee to send out talking points back then. (''We appreciate his insights and his advocacy,'' David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's chief strategist, said in an interview on Friday.)
Mr. Clinton decided to write the book, an aide said, after he campaigned in the midterm elections and met voters who thanked him for explaining the administration's policies in a way they had never understood before. He appeared at 130 campaign events, he notes, without adding that Mr. Obama was criticized by fellow Democrats for not doing enough.
Mr. Clinton has never gone light on self-celebration: his birthday party last month was a three-day star-studded Hollywood celebration (the Hamptons one was just a prelude). ''Back to Work'' is his latest attempt at legacy building. Last week, at a rosy retrospective of Clinton-era economic policy mounted by his foundation, the former president and his aides, including some who serve in the Obama administration, tried hard, several admitted later, to salute the former president's record of balanced budgets and job growth without damning the current one's.
Almost every speaker stipulated that Mr. Obama's challenges -- the worst economic slump since the Great Depression, and Republicans even less willing to yield than they were in the 1990s -- were far greater than Mr. Clinton's.
And yet the slickly produced program, including videos and handouts with titles like ''Looking Back at President Clinton's Achievements for What We Can Learn from Them Today,'' seemed like an implicit rebuke to Mr. Obama: the 42nd president bested Republicans in a budget showdown, far outperformed his own economic projections, slammed the unemployment rate down to 3.9 percent and stuck to an economic message.
Still, Mr. Clinton finds the beleaguered President Obama of 2011 easier to sympathize with than the rising star of 2008, aides and friends say. In September, the ex-president defended Mr. Obama at a private memorial service for Howard Paster, his former Congressional liaison. ''I get tickled when I hear people talk about how President Obama should do this, that or the other thing,'' he said. ''We had a mostly Democratic Congress, and we were committed to reversing trickle-down economics and we could only pass the plan by one vote in the House and Senate.''
Mr. Obama and his aides, meanwhile, have little choice but to put up with the former president's reminders of his achievements, because of the hard political reality: Mr. Clinton can potentially help them a lot in 2012. ''Clinton does something that's almost unique in American politics, which is talk to the middle,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic political consultant.
For the record, Mr. Obama won the recent golf competition, Mr. Clinton's friends acknowledge. The photographs from the excursion tell the same story the friends do about the outing: the older president is open-mouthed and gesticulating. The younger one looks like he would rather just play golf, but he is patiently listening anyway.

HEADLINE: The Best Perk In Politics

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
We have been hearing a lot about important politicians and private jets.
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas seems to have spent his entire career as governor aloft on someone else's dime. In India, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh was recently charged with sending a jet to buy her a new pair of sandals in Mumbai, although perhaps we should leave that one to the Indians. Free private-plane travel figures in the upcoming John Edwards trial, but when you're arguing about who paid to keep your secret mistress and love child out of the public eye while you were running for president and your wife had terminal cancer, the airfare is the least of it.
So, Rick Perry. 
This week in The Times, Mike McIntire reported that as governor, Perry had received $1.3 million worth of free flights in private jets from corporate executives and wealthy donors. Some of them involved trips to Washington to lobby on behalf of matters of interest to the plane owners.
This is the same Rick Perry who recently told The San Francisco Chronicle that he was the sort of leader who could go to Washington and ''take a wrecking ball, a sledgehammer -- whatever it takes to break up the good-old-boy corporate lobbyist mentality that is putting this country's future in jeopardy.''
On a mission like that, wouldn't you expect him to fly coach?
Let me tell you just one story about Rick Perry's hatred of the good-old-boy corporate mentality. There is a hugely rich real estate titan in Texas named Bob (No Relation) Perry who was a very big donor to conservative causes and everything having to do with the Rick Perry gubernatorial career. (No Relation) Perry also had a problem, which was, like all the pressing concerns of extremely wealthy Texans, solely involved with the future development of the state economy and the common good.
(No Relation)'s particular policy-oriented issue was that people were filing lawsuits when they discovered the new homes they had just purchased were full of mold.
Really, it was a big problem. Extremely bad for economic growth. And the governor had a solution. Perhaps he worked it out while lounging, with his feet up, in the leather seats of other people's corporate jets. In 2003, he pushed for the creation of the Texas Residential Construction Commission to settle the mold disputes, saving everyone a great deal of time and litigation expense. Governor Perry then filled said commission with members who were well versed in the issues they would be deciding because of the fact that they were representatives of the housing industry. One of them was (No Relation)'s general counsel.
It is really, really hard to horrify the Texas State Legislature, but this thing did, and the lawmakers got rid of it in 2009.
So you can see that Rick Perry is a man of the people. Unless they have mold.
The free plane rides don't seem to have shattered any Texas ethics laws, most of which are of the foam-rubber persuasion. And you have to admit: private jets are the best. When you get to the airport, they're waiting for you. You can keep your shoes on. Nobody tells you to turn off your Kindle until the plane has reached cruising altitude. It's the one rich-person perk I truly, desperately envy.
''I envy the single malt scotch as well, but the plane's right up there,'' said Craig McDonald of Texans for Public Justice, an estimable nonprofit research group that specializes in following the money. Texans for Public Justice has done a couple of reports about Perry's travel gifts, one of which I fell in love with when I saw the phrase ''Flatonia sausage magnate Danny Janecka.'' Also, there was a story about how the Texas Motor Transportation Association paid $14,580 to fly Perry and his family to the Rose Bowl, when the University of Texas was playing in 2006. A gubernatorial spokesman told The Dallas Morning News that the governor was on official business hosting a barbecue to try to persuade California companies to relocate to the Lone Star State.
The whole private jet thing is even more seductive for elected officials than the rest of us because A) politicians always think their time is exceedingly valuable, and B) they tend to be very tall. Long ago, I interviewed Senator Lowell Weicker (6'6'') of Connecticut when he was running for re-election, and I asked him about an opponent's charge that he always flew first class.
''Look at these legs!'' Weicker bellowed, sticking his feet out at me.
And Perry is really, really large. He would actually resemble a superhero were it not for his tendency to break into giggles during a presidential campaign speech.
The free corporate jet thing does have an understandable allure. Plus, you don't have to check your wrecking ball and sledgehammer.

HEADLINE: Opposites, Obama and Sarkozy Attract, if Uneasily

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
CANNES, France -- Just a few hours after the United Nations Security Council authorized military action against Libya in March, President Obama placed a call to the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy.
Before Mr. Obama could begin discussing the next steps, Mr. Sarkozy, who had argued furiously to persuade his reluctant American ally to begin airstrikes on the forces of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, interrupted him. ''Stop,'' Mr. Sarkozy said, according to Obama administration officials. ''Barack, I just want to tell you that I am proud to be your friend. I am proud of what we are doing.''
Mr. Obama does not speak French, so he reached for Spanish. ''Nicolas,'' he said, ''you and I are muy simpatico.''
The reality is a little less sunny. The two men brush up against each other as often as not. One is diminutive and often emotional, given to pounding on tables and gesturing with his hands to make a point, tugging on his lapel when he struts into a room. In contrast to his demeanor, he dresses like an undertaker, in dark suits and dark ties. 
The other is tall, lanky and poker-faced, rarely given to emotional displays; he enters a room and wants to get straight to the point. He favors brightly colored ties in blue, red and orange.
Mr. Sarkozy is a right-leaning (by European standards) law-and-order conservative who is increasingly unpopular in France, which normally leans left. And the French left lionizes Mr. Obama, a Democrat who still has a high approval rating -- in France, if not in the United States.
On Thursday, Mr. Obama raised many eyebrows here in Cannes at the Group of 20 economic summit meeting when he joked that he was confident that Giulia -- Mr. Sarkozy's newborn daughter with his wife, the Italian-born Carla Bruni-Sarkozy -- ''inherited her mother's looks rather than her father's, which I think is an excellent thing.'' Mr. Sarkozy smiled, but the Gallic blogosphere was not amused.
While Mr. Sarkozy admires Mr. Obama, he also considers him ''cold,'' he has often said, and he resented not having been invited to Washington until long after his German and British counterparts. But the two presidents have worked at their relationship, with Mr. Obama finally inviting Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Bruni-Sarkozy to a private dinner at the White House in March 2010.
Both men are facing difficult re-election battles. Mr. Sarkozy's test comes more than six months before Mr. Obama's, with the first round in late April.
If the euro crisis has been an increasingly annoying drag on the American economy, and on Mr. Obama's re-election hopes, it has proved a mixed blessing for Mr. Sarkozy. Always energetic, impatient and quick-witted, he is liked best by the French when he is mastering a crisis.
His main presidential rival, Francois Hollande of the Socialist Party, leads in the polls, but he has never been a cabinet minister. Mr. Hollande, however, has been careful to be vague on most policy goals. He is effectively immune from being attacked as a hard-left ideologue.
So Mr. Sarkozy has been presenting himself, at the Group of 20 meeting, during the Libyan uprising and in the euro crisis, as the man of the moment, whose talents and leadership fit the challenges in a way his opponents could never match.
In that sense, his partnership with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is vital because the two are seen as driving Europe's response to the economic crisis.
But dragging Mrs. Merkel into a gradually larger role for Germany and European institutions has been hard work. In the nickname for the French-German couple -- ''Merkozy'' -- lies the rub. Mrs. Merkel figuratively wears the pants in the couple; no one speaks of them as ''Sarkel.''
Mr. Sarkozy complained at a news conference about the responsibilities of the job, trying to manage the euro as well as France. ''It's not a very pleasant position to be in power right now,'' he said. ''But it is a necessary one.''
Mr. Hollande criticized Mr. Sarkozy on Friday, describing him as a ''facilitator'' rather than ''a real player in financial regulation.''
''Europe appears in a position of weakness,'' Mr. Hollande said. ''The responsibility is in the governance of the euro zone for the last 18 months, that's to say, Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel.''
Mr. Obama's presence and support provide an important boost to Mr. Sarkozy, who wants to be seen as a major player in the world. Mr. Obama has reasons to be grateful, too, because Mr. Sarkozy has brought France back fully into NATO, has continued to provide troops in Afghanistan and helped lead in Libya.
The relationship has irritants, but mostly because French and American interests are not always the same.
The last time the two met, at the United Nations General Assembly in September, their collision was more public. Minutes after Mr. Obama declared his opposition to a Palestinian bid for statehood, Mr. Sarkozy shocked American officials by urging the General Assembly to upgrade the Palestinians to observer status.
But in some sense they need each other to win re-election. Mr. Obama needs Mr. Sarkozy to press for a euro zone solution, and Mr. Sarkozy needs the coattail effect of a rock-star president.
So on Friday, the two men attended a joint military commemoration in Cannes, standing coatless in a cold rain, praising French-American friendship and military comradeship, from the two world wars to Libya, as soldiers from both countries were in attendance. The two then happily walked together, shaking the hands of excited citizens.
Mr. Obama also sat with Mr. Sarkozy for a joint interview with French television, a rare honor for a visiting head of state. The Socialists immediately attacked the interview as an unpaid political advertisement.
American officials say Mr. Obama was happy to support his French counterpart because he simply likes him. ''He gets a kick out of him,'' one official said. Unlike most meetings between Mr. Obama and world leaders, during which each leader drones on from dry written ''talking points,'' Mr. Obama and Mr. Sarkozy plunge right in with each other without sugar-coating.
Mr. Obama visited Paris in 2008 during a European tour when he was a senator from Illinois and the likely Democratic presidential nominee. Mr. Sarkozy welcomed him at the Elysee Palace with an arrival ceremony befitting a head of state, and then practically endorsed him. ''If he is chosen, then France will be delighted,'' Mr. Sarkozy said.
On Friday, Mr. Obama returned the favor -- on French national television.

HEADLINE: Romney Debt Plan Includes Medicare Overhaul and Social Security Changes

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney, in a speech before a conservative group here on Friday, offered his most detailed plan yet to cut government spending and lower the federal debt, including an overhaul of Medicare and significant changes to Social Security.
Speaking at the Americans for Prosperity Foundation's annual meeting, Mr. Romney said his plan would cap spending at 20 percent of gross domestic product by 2016, and would require $500 billion a year in spending cuts. To accomplish this, Mr. Romney explained, he would eliminate all nonessential government programs, including Amtrak, return federal programs like Medicaid entirely to the states and improve the productivity and efficiency of the federal government. He would also immediately cut all nonsecurity discretionary spending by 5 percent across the board. 
Mr. Romney's proposal for Medicare is similar to the hotly debated plan that Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, introduced in April. Mr. Ryan's plan would replace Medicare and offer payments to older Americans to buy coverage from the private market.
Mr. Romney's proposal would give beneficiaries the option of enrolling in private health care plans, using what he, like Mr. Ryan, called a ''premium support system.'' But unlike the Ryan plan, Mr. Romney's would allow older people to keep traditional Medicare as an option. However, if the existing government program proved more expensive and charged higher premiums, the participants would be responsible for paying the difference.
He presented his plan as offering more choice -- though younger Americans would need to be prepared to possibly pay more, for instance, depending on which plan they selected.
''Younger Americans today, when they turn 65, should have a choice between traditional Medicare and other private health care plans that provide at least the same level of benefits,'' he said. ''Competition will lower costs and increase the quality of health care.''
He concluded, ''The future of Medicare should be marked by competition, by choice, and by innovation, rather than by bureaucracy, stagnation and bankruptcy.''
His plans for Social Security did not include any privatization plans, which some of his Republican presidential rivals support. Instead, ''for the next generation of retirees, we should slowly raise the retirement age,'' he said. ''And finally for the next generation of retirees, we should slow the growth of benefits for those that have higher incomes.''
Americans for Prosperity was co-founded and financed by David H. Koch. Mr. Koch, a billionaire who, along with his brother, Charles, runs Koch Industries, sat at a table in the front row at the meeting. Mr. Romney received a lukewarm welcome, with only tepid applause throughout, rising for an ovation only when he promised to repeal ''Obamacare,'' the president's health care legislation.
''I should have started with that line,'' he said.
Mr. Romney previewed his speech at a town-hall-style forum Thursday evening in Exeter, N.H., and he also laid out the basics of his overall vision in an op-ed column in USA Today.
''Tomorrow's Medicare should give beneficiaries a generous defined contribution and allow them to choose between private plans and traditional Medicare,'' Mr. Romney wrote. ''And lower-income future retirees should receive the most assistance. I believe that competition will improve Medicare and the coverage that seniors receive.''
Democrats wasted no time in attacking Mr. Romney's plan, saying that not only would it effectively end Medicare and Medicaid, but also that his tax cuts would disproportionately benefit the wealthy.
''Romney apparently operates under the false assumption that we can just cut our way to prosperity,'' James Kvaal, the policy director for Obama for America, said in an e-mail. ''In recent months, he has embraced extreme ideological approaches like Representative Paul Ryan's budget plan and the 'cut, cap and balance' proposal. He would return American families to the failed economic policies that contributed to the years of rising inequality, stagnant wages and eroding middle-class security.''
Republicans also criticized the plan, including Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who said in a news release that Mr. Romney's refusal to rule out future government bailouts put him at odds with true fiscal conservatives.
''While Mr. Romney continues to put Wall Street over Main Street, Rick Perry is a real fiscal conservative whose economic plan ends Washington and Wall Street bailouts, cuts taxes and federal spending and balances the budget by 2020,'' said Ray Sullivan, a Perry spokesman, in an e-mail statement.
In his speech, Mr. Romney repeated what seems to be his new mantra -- ''making government simpler, smaller and smarter'' -- and cast the issue of spending cuts in moral terms.
''We cannot with moral conscious borrow trillions of dollars that can only be repaid by our children,'' he said. ''We cannot so weaken our economic foundation that we jeopardize our ability to preserve freedom.''
As he did Thursday night, he also contrasted his time running companies in the private sector with how Solyndra, a solar power company that received government funds and is now facing bankruptcy and scandal, was run.
''They had robots that whistled Disney songs, I'm not kidding,'' Mr. Romney marveled. ''They had what was described as spa-like showers, with liquid crystal displays that told you what temperature the water was.''
''When I get to the White House -- hopefully -- no one will need to teach me how to balance budgets,'' he said. ''I've been doing that for 35 years.''

HEADLINE: For China's Party Elite, A Breath of Fresh Air

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Edy Yin contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Membership in the upper ranks of the Chinese Communist Party has always had a few undeniable advantages. There are the state-supplied luxury sedans, special schools for the young ones and even organic produce grown on well-guarded, government-run farms. When they fall ill, senior leaders can check into 301 Military Hospital, long considered the capital's premier medical institution.
But even in their most addled moments of envy, ordinary Beijingers could take some comfort in the knowledge that the soupy air they breathe on especially polluted days also finds its way into the lungs of the privileged and pampered. 
Such assumptions, it seems, are not entirely accurate.
As it turns out, the homes and offices of many top leaders are filtered by high-end devices, at least according to a Chinese company, the Broad Group, which has been promoting its air-purifying machines in advertisements that highlight their ubiquity in places where many officials work and live.
The company's vice president, Zhang Zhong, said there were more than 200 purifiers scattered throughout Great Hall of the People, the office of China's president, Hu Jintao, and Zhongnanhai, the walled compound for senior leaders and their families. ''Creating clean, healthy air for our national leaders is a blessing to the people,'' boasts the company's promotional material, which includes endorsements from a variety of government and corporate leaders, among them Long Yongtu, a top economic official who insists on bringing the device along for car rides and hotel stays. ''Breathing clean air is a basic human need,'' he says in a testimonial.
In some countries, the gushing endorsement of a well-placed official would be considered a public relations coup. But in China, where resentment of the high and mighty is on the rise, news of the company's advertising campaign is stirring a maelstrom of criticism. ''They don't have to eat gutter oil or drink poisoned milk powder and now they're protected from filthy air,'' said one posting on Sina Weibo, the country's most popular microblog service. ''This shows their indifference to the lives of ordinary people.''
News that Chinese leaders are largely insulated from Beijing's famously foul air comes at a time of unusually heavy pollution in the capital. In recent weeks, the capital has been continuously shrouded by a beige pall and readings from the United States Embassy's rooftop air monitoring device have repeatedly registered unsafe levels of particulate matter.
But those very readings, posted hourly on Twitter or through an iPhone app, have prompted a public debate over whether the Chinese government is purposely obscuring the extent of the nation's air pollution. Unlike the American Embassy readings, Chinese environmental officials do not publicly release data on the smallest particulates, those less than 2.5 micrometers, which scientists say are most harmful because they are able to penetrate the lungs so deeply. Instead, government data covers only pollutants larger than 10 micrometers -- a category that includes sand blown in from the arid north and dust stirred up from construction sites.
Environmental officials prefer to focus on air quality improvements of recent years, largely achieved by replacing coal-fired stoves with electric heaters and closing heavy industry in and around the capital. Driving restrictions have slightly eased the environmental injury of the 700,000 new vehicles that last year joined the capital's jammed roadways.
But when pressed, those same officials acknowledge that their pollution metrics willfully ignore the smaller particles, much of them generated by car and truck exhaust. In fact, the American Embassy's monitor has become an unwelcome intrusion into China's domestic affairs, according to a diplomatic cable released this year by WikiLeaks, which said a Foreign Ministry official had requested that the Americans stop publicizing the data.
The director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a nonprofit organization in Beijing, said many government officials feared that publicly revealing such data could stymie development or dent the image of cities that had been trumpeting their environmental bona fides.
''I don't agree with this philosophy,'' said the director, Ma Jun. ''The government's more urgent priority should be to warn the public when the air quality is dangerous so people susceptible to poor air quality, like children or the elderly, can make decisions to protect their health.''
The government does appear to be moving in that direction. In September, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said it planned to amend the nation's air quality standards to include the smallest particulates, although it has not released a timetable for adopting the new standards.
Officials in Beijing, however, are apparently not quite ready to embrace it. In response to criticism over the heavy smog of recent weeks, a spokesman for the city's environmental protection bureau, Du Shaozhong, assured the public that they should feel secure in the government's own readings, which termed the city's air ''slightly polluted'' even as the embassy monitor found it so hazardous that it exceeded measurable levels. ''China's air quality should not be judged from data released by foreign embassies in Beijing,'' he said.
According to the Broad Group's Web site, it did not take much to convince the nation's Communist Party leaders that they would do well to acquire the firm's air purifiers, some of which cost $2,000. To make their case, company executives installed one in a meeting room used by members of the Politburo Standing Committee. The deal was apparently sealed a short while later, when technicians made a show of cleaning out the soot-laden filters. ''After they saw the inklike dirty water, Broad air purifier became the national leaders' appointed air purifier!'' the Web site said.

HEADLINE: Van der Sar Stepping Out of Nets for a Run

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER BELAC


HIGHLIGHT: The former goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar ran a clinic for children on Friday in Harlem. On Sunday, he will run the New York City Marathon. 

 BODY:
PUB-DATE: May 21, 2008
After a career that spanned two decades, Van der Sar has not wasted time in getting the most out of the freedom of retirement. On Friday he teamed with the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation to participate in a coaching clinic with a few dozen New York City children, which culminated in them trying their luck against the gangly Dutchman from the penalty spot. 
Van der Sar's work with Laureus, however, was not the only reason he is in New York this weekend. On Sunday, Van der Sar, along with Prince Pieter-Christiaan van Oranje of the Netherlands, will run the New York City Marathon to raise money for the Laureus Foundation Netherlands. 
"It's going to be a great experience. I've heard a lot about it," Van der Sar said. "I took some time, of course, to prepare and did some 7Ks. Hopefully it's going to be enough and the crowd can get me through it."
While marathon running is not that common among retired soccer players, Van der Sar has also begun to explore other more traditional post-soccer careers. 
"I did some work with [the Dutch broadcaster] NOS and I'm still doing some commercial stuff for Manchester United," Van der Sar said. "And I'm fulfilling a sports management course in Holland to maybe get going with coaching."
On the coaching front, Van der Sar looked right at home Friday as the children lined up to take penalties against him. In this penalty shootout, however, there were no head games or pointing to a corner. Rather, Van der Sar congratulated those who scored and gave words of encouragement to those who missed. 
Still a smile crossed his face when he harkened back to that memorable night in Moscow and the Champions League final. Chelsea famously prepared for the possibility of penalties by hiring an economist to study Van der Sar's tendencies.
"It's not just luck," he said. "Nowadays you can make sure you get a lot of information and make sure you're well prepared."
Although his biggest career triumph came via a penalty shootout with United, some of his most heartbreaking losses came with the Netherlands. Despite an abundance of talent, the Dutch always seem to come up short in major tournaments.
"That's the thing everybody says, 'You know, you've got to win something'. But listen, we only have 16 million people; it's not a lot," he said. "Maybe in World Cup '98 we should have done better and we lost in the semifinals, and also in Euro 2000, when we lost to Italy."
And while some retired players may question whether they could still be on the field helping their former teams, Van der Sar sounded content with his decision to retire and had nothing but plaudits for the current direction of the club.
"I'm lucky I managed to stay there for six years; I had a great time," he said. "From the moment I got there it fit like a glove. Now they got some younger players in, so they need some adjustment of course. So hopefully that can take this year, and after all it's going to be a great team."
As for his thoughts on his successor at United, David de Gea, Van der Sar was confident the 20-year-old Spaniard would be successful.
"I've followed some games for United and he had some problems in the beginning," Van der Sar said. "But I think he's a young player that has quality and he's growing every game he plays."

HEADLINE: Gingrich Tailors Message at Iowa G.O.P. Dinner

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Newt Gingrich promoted his electability against President Obama and went out of his way to praise the other second-tier candidates at a dinner. 

 BODY:
DES MOINES, Iowa -- With two months to go before the Iowa caucuses, Newt Gingrich appeared to help his chances on Friday night at the Ronald Reagan dinner, this state's marquee G.O.P. fundraiser, winning wide applause with his proposal to challenge President Obama to unmoderated three-hour-long Lincoln-Douglas style debates.
He said for the first time that if he were to win the Republican nomination, and Mr. Obama did not agree to a series of seven long debates, he would follow the president around to every campaign stop he made to rebut his speeches.
"From that day forward, for the rest of the campaign, the White House will be my schedulers," said Mr. Gingrich, who was the last of five Republican candidates to speak.
The dinner, which drew almost 1,000 of the state's most important party activists , did not include the two front-runners in recent Iowa polls, Herman Cain, who is struggling in a sexual harassment controversy, and Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. Both chose not to attend.
And all five candidates steered clear of any reference to the accusations swirling around Mr. Cain.
Instead, it was an opportunity for this second tier of candidates, at least as measured by recent polls, to stand out from the pack in hopes that more support will coalesce behind them before Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses on Jan. 3.
Mr. Gingrich -- who raised about $1 million in October, or 25 percent more than the entire third quarter, according to his spokesman R.C. Hammond -- is trying to rebuild momentum after turning off many G.O.P. voters earlier this year amid a series of campaign missteps. He appeared to tailor some of his speech around the idea that he has electability in a race against the president.
Yet he also went out of his way to praise the other four candidates who spoke at the dinner -- Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry, Ron Paul and Rick Santorum -- and declared that "we only have one opponent: That's Barack Obama."

And he gently chided Mr. Romney -- whose spokesman said he had a scheduling conflict -- and Mr. Cain for not attending. "I would have said nice things about them, but we'll skip over that."
The other candidates sought to strike familiar tones from their campaign stump speeches.
Ron Paul, the Texas congressman, decried loose monetary policy, said there was no need to have the Department of Education, and espoused a noninterventionist foreign policy. 
"We don't need more weapons, we need a wiser foreign policy," he said. "We do not need to be the policeman for the world."
"We need to mind our own business, end these wars and start bringing our troops home," he added.
Mr. Perry, the Texas governor, promised as he often has to "break up the Washington establishment" by such means as halting earmarks and instituting an optional flat tax. 
Michele Bachmann, the Minnesota congresswoman, spoke of the importance of religion and limiting government spending.
She pledged to be a nominee who says, "Stop, no more, let's hold on to this great magnificent gift that's never before been seen in the history of mankind, this place called liberty."
Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, won applause when he touted his successful effort to campaign in all 99 counties in Iowa. He highlighted what he said was his plan to "strengthen American families" and "make sure we have strong marriages" in the United States. He also cited his years on Capitol Hill "focused like a laser beam" on the threat he said was posed by Iran.
A crowd gathered around Mr. Gingrich after the speech. Stephen Quist, head of the 800-member college Republicans at Iowa State University, said Mr. Gingrich helped himself "by far the most."
"He changed the rhetoric a bit," Mr. Quist said, "and tried to act as a uniter."
Craig Williams, a member of the state Republican central committee who said he hadn't endorsed anyone yet, agreed, saying the former speaker "hit a home run tonight."

HIGHLIGHT: The 2012 presidential race and the deficit reduction committee are featured topics on the Sunday shows this week. 

 BODY:
With reports that Herman Cain was accused of sexual harassment in the 1990s dominating the news cycle, the Sunday talk shows are focused on the 2012 presidential race. But that's not all: With less than three weeks left for the Congressional panel tasked with deficit reduction to come up with more than $1 trillion in savings, lawmakers weigh in on whether the committee can beat the buzzer.
House Speaker John A. Boehner joins ABC's "This Week" to talk about the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction and the partisan divide in Congress. Can the parties work together to help the economy? And what does he think of the Republican field? Then, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice discusses her memoir, "No Higher Honor."
NBC's "Meet the Press" is talking 2012. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. will appear to discuss his candidacy. Bill Richardson, former New Mexico governor and 2008 Democratic presidential candidate, and Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, will also join the conversation.
Representative Ron Paul of Texas also makes a Sunday appearance to discuss his candidacy. He will be on "Fox News Sunday." Then, two House Budget Committee members - Representative Heath Schuler, Democrat of North Carolina, and Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho - will talk about the large, bipartisan group that is urging the deficit reduction committee to "go big" and cut more than $4 trillion from the deficit.
Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Republican of Texas, join CNN's "State of the Union." Mr. O'Malley will weigh in on state-level strategies to propel President Obama to re-election, while Ms. Hutchinson discusses Mr. Cain, her former gubernatorial primary opponent Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and the deficit reduction committee.
CBS's "Face the Nation" amassed a panel of Republican strategists to talk about the Republican presidential field on Sunday: Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney; Ed Gillespie, former chairman of the Republican National Committee; Kevin Madden, Mitt Romney's press secretary during his 2008 campaign; Ed Rollins, who stepped down from running Representative Michele Bachmann's campaign a couple months ago; and Ken Blackwell, a supporter of Mr. Perry.
Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California and member of the deficit reduction committee, will be on Bloomberg's "Political Capital." In addition to being on Fox, Mr. Simpson also joins Bloomberg.
C-Span's "Newsmakers" hosts Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and House minority whip, who will discuss the deficit reduction committee and his opposition to revisiting a balanced budget amendment right now.
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles addresses a series of issues, including Occupy LA and his support for Mr. Obama's re-election campaign on Univision's "Al Punto."
And Representative Frederica Wilson, Democrat of Florida, joins TV One's "Washington Watch" to talk about her state's strict voter identification laws.
Hungry for more? If the economy stalls next year, how would that affect Mr. Cain's chances of beating Mr. Obama? How would a sluggish economy affect Mr. Romney's odds? Based on Nate Silver's models, this interactive graphic displays each Republican candidates' chances of winning the popular vote based on G.D.P. growth, Mr. Obama's approval rating and the candidate's ideology.

HEADLINE: The Politics of Austerity

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: The new embattled partisan environment allows conservatives to pit taxpayers against tax consumers, those dependent on safety-net programs like welfare, disability benefits and food stamps. 

 BODY:
The economic collapse of 2008 transformed American politics. In place of shared abundance, battles at every level of government now focus on picking the losers who will bear the costs of deficit reduction and austerity.
Fights in Washington are over inflicting pain on antagonists either through spending cuts or tax increases, a struggle over who will get a smaller piece of a shrinking pie. This hostile climate stands in sharp contrast to the post-World-War II history of economic growth. Worse, current income and employment trends suggest that this is not a temporary shift.
The year 2008 marked the emergence of a Democratic Party driven by surging constituencies of minorities, single women and voters under 30. The flowering of this coalition, manifested in the election of President Obama and in continued Democratic control of Congress, was quickly followed by developments affirming the activist, redistributive state: the enactment of a $787 billion economic stimulus bill, passage of the $900 billion health care reform act and rising demand for food stamps, unemployment compensation and Medicaid.
From the vantage point of Republicans, the newly empowered Democratic Party was determined to institutionalize government expansion through oversight of the financial sector, broadening access to medical care and federally mandated environmental regulation. As the national debt grew from $10.6 trillion when Obama took office to $13.7 trillion on Election Day 2010, the stage was set for a conservative revival. Conservatives successfully shifted the focus of American politics to the twin themes of debt and austerity - with a specific attack on means-tested entitlement programs.
The Republican Party, after winning back control of the House in 2010, has reverted to the penny-pinching of an earlier era, the green eyeshade Grand Old Party of Herbert Hoover and Robert Taft, advocating a "root canal" approach to governance evident in the first budget passed by the Republican-controlled House - the Paul Ryan "path to prosperity" budget with $4 trillion in cuts - and the subsequent Aug. 2 debt ceiling agreement.
The new embattled partisan environment allows conservatives to pit taxpayers against tax consumers, those dependent on safety-net programs against those who see such programs as eating away at their personal income and assets.
In a nuanced study, "The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism," the sociologist and political scientist Theda Skocpol and her colleagues at Harvard found that opposition to government spending was concentrated on resentment of federal government "handouts." Tea Party activists, they wrote, "define themselves as workers, in opposition to categories of nonworkers they perceive as undeserving of government assistance."
In a March 15 declaration calling for defunding of most social programs, the New Boston Tea Party was blunt: "The locusts are eating, or should we say devouring, the productive output of the hard working taxpayer."
The conservative agenda, in a climate of scarcity, racializes policy making, calling for deep cuts in programs for the poor. The beneficiaries of these programs are disproportionately black and Hispanic. In 2009, according to census data, 50.9 percent of black households, 53.3 percent of Hispanic households and 20.5 percent of white households received some form of means-tested government assistance, including food stamps, Medicaid and public housing.
Less obviously, but just as racially charged, is the assault on public employees. "We can no longer live in a society where the public employees are the haves and taxpayers who foot the bills are the have-nots," declared Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin.
For black Americans, government employment is a crucial means of upward mobility. The federal work force is 18.6 percent African-American, compared with 10.9 percent in the private sector. The percentages of African-Americans are highest in just those agencies that are most actively targeted for cuts by Republicans: the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 38.3 percent; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 42.4 percent; and the Education Department, 36.6 percent.
The politics of austerity are inherently favorable to conservatives and inhospitable to liberals. Congressional trench warfare rewards those most willing to risk all. Republicans demonstrated this in last summer's debt ceiling fight, deploying the threat of a default on Treasury obligations to force spending cuts.
Conservatives are more willing to inflict harm on adversaries and more readily see conflicts in zero-sum terms - the basic framework of the contemporary debate. Once austerity dominates the agenda, the only question is where the ax falls.
Still, conservatives have a tendency to overestimate public support for their agenda and consequently to overreach: recall the two government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996; the 1998 Clinton impeachment; and the Ryan budget, which gave Democrats a recent victory in upstate New York.
 Most signs point toward a relentless continuation of struggle in the context of austerity. Congress faces self-imposed deadlines of Nov. 23 and Dec. 23 to approve a deficit reduction of $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion over 10 years, or accept across-the-board cuts of $1.2 trillion.
Democratic strategists privately worry that many voters see reduced spending as a threshold issue that candidates must meet. "Our message - 'We want fewer budget cuts, more taxes' - is all that voters are getting right now," said one strategist involved in presidential and Congressional campaigns. "It doesn't sell."
Republicans are playing with fire, though, when they threaten American standing in the world, as they did in provoking Standard & Poor's downgrade of the United States' credit rating to AA+ from AAA in August. Confidence in Congressional Republicans fell 36 points after the debt ceiling debacle, compared with a 22-point drop for Mr. Obama.
While the outcome of the election exactly one year from today remains uncertain, the prospects for economic growth, with prosperity reaching beyond corporations and Wall Street to the electorate at large, are dim. The two main sources of new jobs, government and health services, face substantial fiscal constraints. Technology continues to make skilled jobs "tradable," that is, exportable to lower-wage countries, and corporations are making productivity gains through automation, not new hiring.
In many respects, austerity feeds on itself. If the country needs to invest in education and rebuilding infrastructure to regain competitiveness, as many economists of varying ideological stripes argue, those initiatives are in large part precluded in a political environment that places top priority on deficit and debt reduction. Retrenchment, in effect, becomes a noose, choking off prospects for growth.
Thomas B. Edsall, a professor journalism at Columbia University, is the author of the forthcoming book "The Age of Austerity: How Scarcity Will Remake American Politics." A version of this article was printed in the Sunday Review on Nov. 6, 2011.

HEADLINE: A Protest Reaches a Crossroads

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY and COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
THE signs seemed to point toward the end of Occupy Wall Street. The day after the city stripped the protesters encamped in Lower Manhattan of their generators and fuel, the Northeast was hit with a bone-chilling snowstorm that blanketed their tents and tarps with sleet and ice, and left at least one protester hospitalized for hypothermia. Yet the encampment at Zuccotti Park endured.
Seven weeks in, the protest has become a fact of life in New York City, a tourist draw to rival ground zero, and a teachable moment for parents. Its slogan, ''We are the 99 percent'' is a staple of the popular discourse.
More than $500,000 in donations has flowed to the protesters in Lower Manhattan, while labor unions and elected officials have come to their aid. Marches and occupations that have sprung up nationwide have served as a national microphone for the cause. 
And yet, winter looms and authorities in other cities have been cracking down on encampments, sometimes violently. The mayor's patience with the occupation seems to be wearing thin, and local residents have tired of the headaches associated with the protest. An influx of outsiders to the park, meanwhile, has threatened the protesters' ability to organize.
More broadly, the protest's leaderless and nonhierarchical structure raises the question of how effective it can be. The demonstrators have yet to proffer clear demands and have rejected any involvement in electoral politics. And it remains to be seen what will become of the action should they lose their foothold at Zuccotti Park.
If the question used to be ''What do they want?'' it has shifted in recent days to ''How long will it last?''
Trouble in the Camp
When protesters first unrolled sleeping bags and blankets in Zuccotti Park on the night of Sept. 17, only a few dozen people spent the night. Now, upward of 200 people -- students, veterans, train-hopping travelers -- stay overnight in the sprawling encampment of tents and tarps that covers the granite expanse of the park. Sleeping in Zuccotti once was evidence of a deep commitment to Occupy's politics, but now, some people seem to be there mainly for the donated clothes and free food.
A few have gotten into fights or have been accused of assaults, including Tonye Iketubosin, a 26-year-old man from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, who frequented the park for about a week and whom the police charged on Wednesday with sexually abusing an 18-year-old woman in a tent there. On Thursday, a Florida man was arrested after being accused of punching a protester in the eye.
Many protesters say the lawless visitors constitute a tiny fringe and are not representative of the movement, which, they say, has espoused nonviolence and mutual aid. Some have suggested moving the kitchen area and the comfort station out of the park to discourage freeloaders from congregating there.
But there are concerns that even if the criminal and antisocial elements are a small minority, they are becoming visible enough to tarnish the image of the entire group.
''We have a serious problem with hangers-on,'' said Patrick Bruner, 23, a protester and spokesman. ''We're trying to bring people into the fold instead of willfully excluding them.''
The assimilation tactic has only partly worked, as some visitors have resisted inclusion. Several protesters said they believed that the group could rise to the challenge of keeping the park safe, just as they took it upon themselves to scrub it in mid-October when its owner, Brookfield Office Properties, complained that the area had not been washed in weeks and the city threatened to evict the protesters.
But that task has been complicated because Zuccotti Park is obliged through an agreement with the city to remain open 24 hours a day. The protesters can no more forbid certain visitors than the police can ban the protesters.
Hero Vincent, 21, who is from North Carolina and is a member of the park security team, said he had begun offering a blunt opinion when discussing how to handle such people.
''If you are coming here, contribute something,'' he said. ''If you want to spread poison, go somewhere else.''
Toll on the Neighborhood
On Monday, a group of four local government officials sent a letter to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, insisting that he address the rising tensions in Lower Manhattan.
Some protesters were still using the streets as toilets, they complained. Drumming was disturbing nearby residents. Long lines of barricades were making the sidewalks feel as congested as cattle drives. The city should enforce noise and sanitation laws more strictly, the letter said, and take the barricades down.
But should it kick the protesters out? Adamantly no.
''The quality of life needs to be solved but should not be an excuse by those unsympathetic to the message or the protesters' First Amendment rights,'' one of the letter's authors, State Senator Daniel L. Squadron, said.
That conflicting message mirrors the neighborhood's deeply mixed feelings about the protest. Community Board 1, which represents the area, recently passed a resolution to support Occupy Wall Street. Loving the protesters and hating the problems that have accompanied them ''are not mutually exclusive,'' said the community board chairwoman, Julie Menin.
''Half the residents are completely out of their minds and need Occupy Wall Street to leave immediately,'' said Patricia L. Moore, who lives near Zuccotti Park and also leads the Quality of Life Committee for the community board. ''And half are residents who came to the last meeting and said, 'Welcome to the neighborhood.' ''
Ms. Moore said that most of the residents' complaints were less about Occupy Wall Street's presence than about getting the city to make life better for the protesters and the neighborhood.
''It's not about getting them out,'' Ms. Moore said of the protesters. ''It's about public officials doing their jobs.''
Officials said they were responding. A police spokesman said several summonses had been issued. Marc LaVorgna, a spokesman for City Hall, said the city was working closely with the community to address its complaints. On Wednesday, most of the barriers in the area were taken down, though some went back up when it seemed the protesters might march.
As for bathroom access, though the city had long been saying that portable toilets could not be installed on the sidewalks because there was too much foot traffic in the area, Occupy Wall Street announced on Friday that it had reached a deal for 24-hour access to a loading dock in the area where three portable bathrooms would be installed, along with round-the-clock security.
Not all residents embrace the protesters. Several people who live nearby and said they supported Occupy's overall message said they nevertheless believed that the group had overstayed its welcome.
But Mark Scherzer, a lawyer who lives and works near the protest site, said Occupy Wall Street had become a scapegoat for broader neighborhood issues. The near-constant drilling of bedrock by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was worse than any drumming, he said, and the need for bathroom facilities had mushroomed before the protesters arrived.
''While O.W.S. has brought more people to the neighborhood,'' he wrote in response to the officials' letter, ''so has the 9/11 Memorial. All of them need to use toilets.''
'We're All Leaders'
Perhaps most puzzling to outsiders, and maddening for the police and City Hall, has been the protest's lack of official leaders.
''Leaderless is a funny word; we don't have leaders, yet we're all leaders,'' said Jackie DiSalvo, who is on the protest's labor outreach working committee and teaches English at Baruch College. ''It doesn't have a single hierarchical leadership, but there are a lot of people exerting leadership over what's going on.''
The template for Occupy Wall Street was cast in its earliest days, when activists gathered in Lower Manhattan in early August in response to a call from the Canadian magazine Adbusters. At first, the initial meeting was dominated by a traditional protest group, with banners and speeches. But a small group of people broke off and sat in a circle on the grass a short distance away. David Graeber, an anarchist and anthropologist who teaches at Goldsmiths, University of London, was among them. The ''horizontals'' as Mr. Graeber called them, reject a top-down ''vertical'' leadership structure.
At that meeting and the subsequent ones, everyone was free to talk, and a facilitator moderated the discussion, a format that has continued for Occupy's nightly meetings. Decisions required talking until, Mr. Graeber said, a consensus that ''most people like and everybody else can live with'' was reached.
As the protest's numbers swelled, this devotion to ensuring that everyone was heard resulted in unwieldy meetings lasting hours.
One night in mid-October, hundreds of people had gathered, trying to agree on whether to buy brewing equipment, coffee and tea. Queries were fired from the crowd:
Would it be fair-trade coffee?
Could they avoid using disposable cups?
How would they chill the milk and cream?
An hour later, the same proposal was still being debated.
''Can't we just make a decision?'' a young protester whispered to his girlfriend.
Recently, the protesters voted to revamp the process: the general assembly would still decide broader issues, but representatives of smaller groups would form a ''spokescouncil'' to handle day-to-day operations. The change was voted on last weekend. Some opponents feared that the general assembly would lose power. Others worried that small groups would gain a disproportionate voice.
''Mikhail Bakunin warned us of the hierarchy of bureaucrats,'' one participant cautioned the group, citing the 19th-century Russian anarchist.
''We really are trying to arrive at a solution right now; otherwise there are endless meetings,'' someone replied.
A few minutes later, more than 90 percent of the group voted for the new framework.
The protesters say the horizontal structure must remain. And far from being weaknesses, they say, their lack of hierarchy and the absence of concrete demands have helped fuel their growth.
''It has allowed Occupy Wall Street to pop up in all these different cities where the occupations, the needs and the populations are different,'' said Willie Osterweil, 25, one of the protest's first organizers.
Not having leaders has also made the movement difficult for authorities to pin down. When Brookfield Office Properties sent in workers to distribute fliers detailing new rules banning sleeping bags and tents, the protesters folded the fliers into origami. When the police wanted to communicate their demands, the protesters gave them no face or body to negotiate with. When the police entered the park in the protest's early days, the protesters followed them with cameras and lights, calling their photographers ''the coparazzi.''
''The police are absolutely actors in this theater production,'' said Justin Wedes, a protester who has worked with the culture-jamming pranksters the Yes Men. ''They are onstage with us, and the world is who is watching.''
Question of History
But will the world continue to pay attention if wintry weather or an influx of outsiders or a city-ordered eviction results in the protesters' losing Zuccotti Park, their physical and symbolic heart?
Or as Marshall L. Ganz, senior lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School at Harvard, put it, ''Is it a moment or is it a movement?''
For all the symbolism now attached to it, the park's selection was almost accidental. Protesters had originally zeroed in on Chase Manhattan Plaza, at the foot of a soaring skyscraper on William Street, for their encampment. But after discussion of the choice on a listserv, fences suddenly appeared around the space. Zuccotti was one of a few possible locations, selected more or less on the fly on the day the protest began.
''We marched up Broadway and held a general assembly there and decided it was nice,'' Mr. Osterweil said of the group's arrival.
Some academics say that while the occupation of the park was a good tactic, it is time to move beyond it.
''It's not a tactic that puts any pressure on the 1 percent,'' Jeff Goodwin, a sociology professor at New York University, said. ''It's inconceivable that the movement can get what it wants without engaging legislatures.''
The protesters have made it clear that they have little interest in electoral politics, though. Several said they became embittered after campaigning and voting for President Obama, only to be repeatedly let down.
Mr. Graeber, whose most recent book is ''Debt: The First 5,000 Years,'' an examination of barter systems, is credited with suggesting that ''we are the 99 percent'' become the rallying cry for the movement. He described many of the protesters' view in an e-mail: ''Both parties govern in the name of the 1% of Americans who have received pretty much all the proceeds of economic growth, who are the only people completely recovered from the 2008 recession, who control the political system, who control almost all financial wealth.''
History has not always been kind to leaderless protests. David S. Meyer, a professor of sociology and political science at the University of California at Irvine, said that in the past, grass-roots groups with similar democratic structures -- the movement against nuclear power, Students for a Democratic Society, and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee -- followed one of two paths. ''It falls apart, or it gets seized by disciplined factions from within,'' he said.
''All made big gains,'' he added. ''But they couldn't survive their success.''
Yet some grass-roots movements have had potency. Doug McAdam, a sociology professor at Stanford University, noted that most groundswell uprisings did not have an organized central structure, among them the civil rights movement, the modern women's movement and, more recently, the Tea Party. He said the protest could inspire a more concrete movement. ''Successful movements start out as expressions of anger, and then quickly move beyond that,'' he said. ''It's very difficult for opponents to control or repress a movement that has many heads.''
The group's supporters, meanwhile, are waiting for the protesters' next move -- whatever it may be. ''We don't know what we're supporting yet,'' said Ed Ott, former executive director of the New York City Central Labor Council. ''But what I'm learning is that 60-year-olds don't make revolutions; 20-year-olds do.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the Occupy Wall Street protests being at a crossroads misstated the surname of a senior lecturer in public policy at Harvard, who commented on the protest. He is Marshall L. Ganz, not Glanz. The article also misstated a topic of debate among protesters. They discussed fair-trade coffee, not ''free-trade'' coffee.

HEADLINE: Women On Pedestals

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
I WAS waiting for the other shoe to drop.
It didn't take long.
''Mademoiselle!'' Andre Leon Talley barked at a young woman fondling a black cutout ankle boot. ''That is too dominatrix for you!''
She turned a gimlet eye on the vast Vogue editor sprawled resplendently in a chair, wearing a Frank Sinatra pork-pie hat, a maroon shirt and trousers from Marrakesh, and a Paloma Picasso burnt-velvet vintage scarf. 
''I want to be a dominatrix,'' she told him, before dropping the boot, which was pounced on by a pride of women prowling like big cats about to tear into an antelope on Animal Planet.
If you thought the recession had dampened interest in luxury accessories, you didn't see the women lined up after daybreak at the Warwick Hotel on Thursday. A room there was the scene of one of New York's most feral anthropological tableaus: the biannual Manolo Blahnik sample sale. Talley has been ringmaster of this sartorial circus for three years running.
Not since Cinderella's stepsisters mutilated their feet to squeeze into that glass slipper have women leveled such fierce desire at footwear. At last fall's sale, two women dumped their babies on Manolo employees in the lobby as they sped into the room.
Inside, a thousand pairs of shoes are heaped on tables in plastic bags. Some scofflaws wear old shoes, leave them on a table, and sneak out with new ones.
I stopped by the 10 1/2 table to look for a Christmas present for a friend. ''Have you seen any flats?'' I asked a woman avidly pawing through the pile.
''If I find them,'' she snapped, ''I won't tell you.''
One young man, a lawyer, braved the female crowd to hunt for heels for his girlfriend. ''Bonus points,'' he said slyly.
Shea Collins, an attractive brunette with a British accent, stopped by Talley's chair to prove she had the moxie to stride around Manhattan in five-inch stilettos. She lifted her prim gray coat to show him pantyhose with a trompe l'oeil garter belt.
He let out a shriek of delight, before turning to a lovely twenty-something to say her water snake knee-high boots were a ''must.'' ''They're made from some kind of fish scale,'' he said. ''That's sort of sustainable, sort of green.''
In a sumptuous book celebrating his 20th anniversary, Christian Louboutin explained the eternal erotic allure of high heels: ''It's because it gives the woman's foot the same curve'' and arch ''as pleasure does'' in the boudoir.
Blahnik once told The New Yorker's Michael Specter that during his lonely childhood in the Canary Islands, he captured lizards and made shoes for them out of tinfoil saved by his mother from her Camel cigarette cartons. Now the designer makes shoes out of reptiles.
Talley, who calls Blahnik ''a surrogate brother,'' presides like a French king, demanding ''raffinement,'' oblivious to the cognitive dissonance of his size 15 1/2 black New Balance sneakers with Velcro straps.
''You don't want Pepto Bismol pink or Tweety Bird yellow,'' he announces, surveying the stacks of heels. ''I love anything with black sequins.'' Or mink pom-poms.
He calls out to a woman in white daisy sandals, ''Sexy at the ocean!'' and nods to another in black marabou slingbacks: ''Marlene Dietrich in 'Morocco.' ''
He instructs a lady trying on brown boots: ''That white saddle stitching will fit right in in Rockland County, sweetie -- suburban chic!'' (She was indeed from Rockland County.) He likes a pair of navy suede chevalier boots that a New York Post writer is wriggling into. ''Very Toulouse-Lautrec in a bordello.'' When she can't get them zipped, he shakes his head: ''Your calves are too fat. Stop going to the gym so much.''
He separates a single woman from a pair of S&M stilettos. ''They will help you get a night,'' he cautions, ''not a boyfriend.''
He crisply orders a woman to step away from some fringed boots -- ''Annie Oakley is not 'in' this year'' -- and shoos another away from plain black boots. ''You can go to L. L. Bean for that,'' he snips. But he urges a third to risk some white Mongolian lamb boots mounted on shiny white patent leather: ''Oh baby, you've got the hot little body for cheerleader boots. Wear them in Gstaad or St. Moritz.''
She murmurs that she doesn't have that life. He bellows, ''Darling, those boots will get you that life!''
A glamorous 75-year-old in a fedora looking at leopard-print stingray d'Orsays confides to Talley: ''Twenty years ago I got on an elevator in d'Orsay pumps and I was engaged the next day.''
A young woman approaches Talley to snap a picture of his scarf for her blog, and he is alarmed that she doesn't know that Paloma is Pablo's daughter.
''I'm from Kansas,'' she wails.
When a woman challenges Talley, he accuses her of wearing ''mass-market platforms'' into the sale. Another attempts to defy his negative edict, noting that ''Kelly Bensimon has these shoes.''
At that, he bristles, reminding all the women teetering and strutting on their pedestals: ''I AM NEVER WRONG.''

HEADLINE: In Portland, Where Blazers Reign, Lockout Leaves Void

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Ore. -- A short walk from the Rose Garden, the home of the Portland Trail Blazers, a few customers trickled into the Spirit of '77 sports bar after it opened Thursday afternoon. They ordered pints of beer, hot dogs and other snacks. Some played a mini basketball game as hockey games blared on the large televisions.
The only thing missing was the Blazers, who were supposed to play their home opener Thursday against the Denver Nuggets. If the game had not been canceled because of the N.B.A. lockout, hundreds of fans would have been at the bar in Blazers jerseys, downing food and drinks before heading to the arena, or hunkering down to watch the game on television. 
With the lockout in its fifth month and every game in November wiped out, cities like Portland are getting a taste of life without their hometown basketball team. While fans in New York, Chicago or Dallas can turn to the N.F.L. and the N.H.L., the lack of N.B.A. games has left a larger-than-normal void in places like Portland, Salt Lake City and Oklahoma City, where basketball is pretty much the only professional game in town during the winter. The lockout has started to pinch local businesses that depend on the teams, as well as city and state governments that rely on the tax revenue generated by players, teams and fans.
''This is terrible,'' said Timothy Davey, who runs the Spirit of '77, which refers to the year that the Blazers won their only N.B.A. title. ''Our vitality is at stake.''
Accurate figures on how much money is being lost because of the N.B.A. lockout are hard to come by. But in Portland, fans, businesses, the Blazers and visiting teams spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a game during the season at hotels, restaurants, shops, rental-car agencies and so on. Television networks also sell advertising for the games. Some of that money will never be spent if November's games are not made up, or if more games are canceled.
The owners and players resumed negotiations Saturday night for the first time since talks broke down again Oct. 28. The Blazers' owner, Paul Allen, was among those at the bargaining session, which was guided by the federal mediator George Cohen.
Davey said his bar did good business during University of Oregon football games, N.F.L. Sundays and college basketball tournaments and bowl games. Although the Timbers made a splash this year in their first season in Major League Soccer, they did not qualify for the playoffs.
But nothing matches the Blazers. Davey said sales were at least three times higher on days when they were playing compared with ordinary nights, and 80 of the bar's 100 busiest days in the past year were on Blazers game days, at home or on the road. He often hires more staff on those dates to keep up with the crowds.
Davey also has a lot riding on the Blazers because the bar is close to the arena, an area that lacks pedestrian traffic when there are no events.
''Not having the Blazers bums people out,'' Davey said.
The potential effect in Portland is worrying enough that Mayor Sam Adams joined 13 other mayors with N.B.A. teams in their cities in sending a letter to Commissioner David Stern and Billy Hunter, the executive director of the players union, urging them to settle their differences.
Some of the money generated by Blazers games would have no effect on the local economy. Players, for instance, spend parts of their salaries out of state. But the income taxes on those salaries are not being collected. Neither are the 6 percent ticket tax and the fees generated by the three arena parking lots, which together generate about $77,000 a game.
That income, adding up to more than $3 million over the course of a season, goes into the Spectator Facilities Fund, which pays off the bonds issued to build and maintain stadiums and arenas in the city. Portland has a reserve fund, but if the entire season is lost, the fund will have to be built up again.
Hundreds of people who work in parking lots and concession stands and as ushers during Blazers games will not see their lost income replaced. Booster groups from local high schools and charities that run concession stands in the arena to raise money will also be left out.
''Just because there isn't much of a macroeconomic effect doesn't mean there aren't a lot of people hurt,'' said Patrick M. Emerson, who teaches economics at Oregon State.
A variety of companies that do business with the Blazers have also lost income. Paul Zimmerman, the president of Office Products Northwest, has a sponsorship with the team that includes signs at the Rose Garden. In return, the team buys office supplies from his company. Orders from the team were down 18 percent from August to October compared with the same period last year.
''When you're not as active, you use less toner, less paper, fewer pens, so many things that are reduced,'' said Zimmerman, who employs 37 people.
In a city where water-cooler talk revolves around Brandon Roy's knees, Greg Oden's health or the prospects for the new point guard Raymond Felton, fans are learning to cope. Eric Levine, a high school teacher who shares season tickets with a friend, has had to explain to his son why basketball is not on television.
''There's definitely a gap, but we're powerless,'' he said. ''We're a one-horse town without a horse.''
David Rubin, whose family has had season tickets since the Blazers' second season in 1971, said he would usually spend opening night with his brother, meeting him downtown, where they would park their cars and eat dinner before taking the light rail to the arena. Instead, he said, he was going to spend it watching reruns on television at home.
If there is a silver lining, it is that fans will receive refunds. For many, that money will come in handy.
''I may have a little extra money to throw into my I.R.A.,'' said Kevin Flink, who has shared season tickets with his sister-in-law for more than 30 years. ''In light of the economy, I'm prepared to move on.''
Even the longtime fan Diane Snedecor -- a minor celebrity because she holds up a sign that says ''I Love This Game!'' -- said she would get over the loss of games.
''Portland needs jobs, so I don't like that part of it,'' she said of the workers who are affected by the lockout. But, she added, ''for me, it's entertainment, so I can take a year off.''

HEADLINE: Closing the Girl Gap

GIVE me an ''S''! Give me a ''T''! Give me an ''E''! Give me an ''M''! Yaaaaay STEM!
O.K., that's not exactly what was said last summer at a cheerleading camp on the Southern Illinois University Carbondale campus. But that was the hoped-for spirit as dozens of kinesthetically gifted girls in ponytails savored their first taste of college life -- three days at Southern Illinois perfecting their pyramids and pikes, sipping Starbucks in the student center, staying up late texting friends at home and across the room.
If all goes according to the university's new recruitment plan, hosting camps for middle and high school cheerleaders serves a higher purpose: to help shrink a longtime gender disparity at Southern, a leafy campus of more than 20,000 students about five hours south of Chicago.
At most colleges and universities, women outnumber men -- at 57 percent nationally. But Southern finds itself among a smattering of campuses with a few too many good men: women make up just 44 percent of undergraduates. And over all, only about 30 percent of Southern's students in STEM fields -- science, technology, engineering and math -- are women. 
Flanking the cheer camp director at an evening pep rally last summer, two university recruiters tossed out beach balls and pumped up Justin Bieber's ''Baby,'' whipping an already raucous crowd into a frenzy of gleeful shrieking. They passed out raffle prizes to the girls who had diligently completed ''Saluki V.I.P.'' information cards. Within 24 hours, the office of admissions had created for each an individualized Web page so recruiters could keep in touch, encouraging the girls to visit Carbondale and, ultimately, apply for admission.
''The idea is that any pre-college-age group of girls who are visiting the university should be in touch with our recruitment staff, not in a heavy-handed way, but as an opportunity to get the message out that coming to S.I.U. can transform their lives,'' says Rita Cheng, the university's new chancellor and first woman in the post.
While the gender disparity dates back more than two decades -- in 1991, women represented just 41 percent of the student body -- officials have also been alert to a drop in overall enrollment of roughly 5 percent over the past few years. One of Ms. Cheng's first tasks was to roll out a recruitment overhaul in summer 2010 aimed at all-girl high schools and camps. This semester, almost half of incoming freshmen are women.
Still, men dominate, especially in some of the university's most well-regarded programs -- just 10 of 171 students in aviation management, for example, are women. This is happening as a growing chorus of educators and officials at the Department of Education make pointed efforts to steer young women to STEM majors.
''These P.R. efforts at universities may get a few girls from the cheer camp to apply, but the real trick is to get them interested way before then,'' suggests Patricia Albjerg Graham, a professor of the history of American education at Harvard. ''We need to change the culture for little girls who are growing up now, and start expecting them to not only 'get' math and science, but to do well, take more A.P. classes, and join the math and science club.''
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is lopsidedly male (37 percent of all students are women), dispatches female students to schools to share their enthusiasm for STEM and hosts a math contest for young girls that awards $25,000 to the winner.
''The real issue is women are falling out of STEM fields all along the pipeline, starting in middle school and high school,'' says Stuart Schmill, dean of admissions. ''To increase gender balance, it's all a matter of getting the right story out about science and engineering to young women, that it's not about sitting at a desk doing math all day.''
At M.I.T., he says, ''we don't have to go beating the bushes'' to attract women applicants. Indeed, for undergraduate programs this fall, 5,466 women applied, of which 16 percent were admitted. But more than twice the pool, 12,443, was male. Only 7 percent were admitted. Mr. Schmill is firm that there is no admissions advantage in gender.
''The applicant pool for women is more self-selecting,'' he says. ''The women who are interested are very passionately interested.''
While Southern Illinois University, too, insists it pays no heed to gender in admissions, at Carnegie Mellon ''there is no question that we do consider gender in fields like computer science and engineering, where women are critically underrepresented,'' says Michael A. Steidel, director of admissions. For example, there is no shortage at Carnegie Mellon of wonky men who delight in writing computer code in their spare time, but only 18 percent of freshman applications to the computer science program for this fall came from women.
Women@SCS supports academic, social and professional opportunities for women in computer science at the university. Carol Frieze, director of the group, says the percentage of female majors there peaked in 2000 at 39 percent. ''But of course, the dot-com bubble burst, and applications dropped for both men and women,'' she says. By 2007, the number of female majors had fallen to just 20 percent. But with word out that computer science is weathering the ailing economy, interest is climbing, Ms. Frieze says. This year women represent 32 percent of incoming computer science majors, and a quarter of undergraduates in the field.
Texas A & M, which began accepting women in the 1960s, is now 47 percent female. While some parity carries into the fields of biology, chemistry and math, the number of women drops significantly in engineeering, which is 80 percent male.
To keep its statistics even, Texas A & M officials reach out to girls as young as sixth grade with gender-specific programs like ''Expanding Your Horizons,'' one-day workshops held on campus to immerse middle schoolers in hands-on science experiments. In one physics lesson, for example, teams create devices that will slow the velocity of a falling egg and cushion it from breakage when dropped from the balcony of the science building.
''It would be great if the girls decide they want to go to Texas A & M someday, but most of all, we hope they are getting the bigger picture that going to college isn't scary and terrifying, and they start to think, 'I can do that,' '' says Nancy Magnussen, director of the university's Educational Outreach and Women's Programs. Recruiters here also seek out promising girls at cheerleading, softball and basketball camps held on campus, says Karan L. Watson, executive vice president and provost at Texas A & M.
Undergraduate ''big sisters'' keep tabs on student interests. When the collegiate chaperones encountered a group of girls who were unable to pry themselves from watching a collection of ''C.S.I.'' DVDs, recruiters tracked down a woman forensic science professor to drop by to deliver an impromptu lecture in the dining center. And for a group of visiting girls addicted to ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' a sociology professor was dispatched to a pizza party to chat about her ethnographic research on fandom.
Officials at Texas A & M, like those at Southern Illinois, acknowledge that they frequently find themselves assuring parents of prospective students that their daughters will be safe on campuses made infamous for partying and incidents that have spun out of control. For years, tens of thousands of revelers fueled by alcohol would party in the streets of downtown Carbondale on Halloween Devil's Night, which was banned by the city in the late 1990s. Similarly, after the Aggie bonfire claimed the lives of 12 students at Texas A & M in 1999, the autumn tradition celebrating the school's football team was abolished.
''We are a fairly conservative school, but we have had our raucous moments, and there are parents who question what kind of influences their daughters will find on campus,'' Ms. Watson says.
At the Southern Illinois cheer camp, the recruiter Tedgie Hennel had greeted the girls' parents upon arrival, helping them lug pillows, suitcases and bags of junk food up to the dorm rooms in Neely Hall.
''Parents who were in college during the 1970s and 1980s will ask me, 'Is Southern still a big party school?' And when I tell them, 'No, it's really not,' some of them laugh and say, 'You can't fool me,' '' Ms. Hennel says. ''So I ask them, 'Who did you hear that from, our current students or other parents?' And then I invite them to come back down for a visit with their daughter.''
At the camp, Ms. Hennel's unflagging school pride was put to the test. Not a single girl showed up for her specially scheduled one-hour afternoon tour of the campus. And alas, college was not on their radar, especially when there were free water bottles and T-shirts. ''I really liked the Chinese food in the dining center,'' one girl said about what impressed her at Southern. Said another: ''It seems fun and exciting, but it's the first college I've visited.''
But a few months later, Ms. Hennel's efforts appeared to be paying off, or at least held a glimmer of hope. All three of the seniors who attended the cheer camp from nearby Du Quoin, a hardscrabble town of 6,100, applied and have already received letters of acceptance. Still, the young women are veering toward nursing and physical therapy, fields usually dominated by women.

HEADLINE: Quinn, Portrayed as Bumbling and Indecisive, Deserves a More Respectful Hearing

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
Pat Quinn seems to have a cloud hovering above him, even when he is the bearer of good tidings.
There was Governor Quinn on Thursday morning, inside a Red Line el stop at 35th Street and the Dan Ryan Expressway, to announce impressive financial help for desperately needed Chicago Transit Authority improvements.
But he seemed as upbeat as Jackie Gleason portraying Maish, the conniving but kind-hearted boxing manager in the film version of ''Requiem for a Heavyweight,'' who looks out a coffee shop window and forlornly mumbles, ''I'm in Pittsburgh and it's raining.'' 
It was pouring as Mr. Quinn and Mayor Rahm Emanuel surfaced together, a mismatched political Mutt and Jeff linked only by dour personas.
These days, they seem headed in opposite directions.
The Missile exhibits Navy Seal-like focus, early command of a complex bureaucracy and mastery of a docile press, while Mr. Quinn seems the indecisive Hamlet as he mostly produces fumbles and policy fistfights.
It's fortunate that the governor is more thick-skinned. The mayor is peeved when he doesn't get his way, even venting privately when docile aldermen have the audacity to question cuts for libraries.
Mr. Quinn might climb atop the Hancock Center if he took things quite as personally, given his legislative defeats and evolving caricature as gadfly-turned-bumbling executive.
Yet one can stipulate to an untidy tenure so far and still wonder if a bit more credit is due, especially given forces Mr. Quinn confronts and the arguable moral content in his flailing.
For starters, there is Michael Madigan, the House speaker and the Viceroy of Springfield, who acts as if he has been assigned by a faraway monarch to run a colonial government.
Mr. Madigan, whose penchant for power appears to exceed any love of policy, runs rings around Mr. Quinn. Since the exit of the shrewd James Thompson, the Republican governor from 1977 to 1991, his influence has been imperial.
So Mr. Madigan sticks it to Mr. Quinn, a fellow Democrat, every chance he gets, with bad blood dating at least to Mr. Quinn's successful 1980 push for a constitutional amendment abolishing multimember districts.
Mr. Quinn tries to stand his ground.
He vetoed debatable electricity legislation, instead of just raising doubts about the diminished regulatory oversight it would bring. He also had the audacity to suggest that legislators were bought off by the industry, notably ComEd and Ameren.
According to the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform, ''smart grid'' backers outspent opponents, four to one, and legislators who voted in favor of the bill received an average of $7,616 in contributions from the industry since January. Mr. Quinn declined to be rolled by insider politics, and his veto was overridden in what may prove a Pyrrhic victory for the backers.
With the sprawling casino bill, the governor has made clear that it allows too much gambling. He's probably on the mark there, too.
Will he have the Missile-like political skills to get his legislative way, given the byzantine nature of both chambers? You would probably be far better off betting on Theo Epstein, the new Cubs boss.
Meanwhile, Chicago's financial exchanges, an important economic force, seek tax breaks in a too-common game of corporate coercion. States get played off one another as the aggrieved company declares, ''Give us what we want or we'll skip town!''
Mr. Quinn doesn't close the door, but he insists that any help come with economic relief for the working poor through an increase in the earned-income tax credit. It's a refrain one doesn't hear much these days, and certainly little among the propertied class at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or Board of Trade.
And then there is Mr. Quinn, a practicing Catholic, up against his church.
His administration told Catholic Charities that it would eliminate its foster-care and adoption contracts because the church refused to adhere to the state's new civil unions law. Further, he's spurning Cardinal Francis George, a dogmatic and polarizing figure, and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops by presenting an abortion rights group's leadership award to a rape victim who has become a victims' advocate.
Even Mr. Emanuel might concede that the guy has chutzpah.
As I left the wind-swept Red Line stop, I ran into Jackie Grimshaw, a transit authority board member and longtime community organizer-activist. She has known Mr. Quinn since their days as young bucks with Gov. Dan Walker in the mid-1970s.
''He's still the populist he was back then, with the same basic bottom-line value system, looking out for the little guy,'' Ms. Grimshaw said.
That sounds quaint to Springfield's hard-bitten crowd. But there are worse reflexes.

HEADLINE: In Mayoral Election, Chinese-Americans' Growing Power Is on Display: Web of connections and bitter rivalries take center stage.

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH. 
gshih@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Astella Kung, 64, is known as the unofficial mayor of Grant Avenue, the heart of San Francisco's Chinatown. A short woman who speaks in a nasally Cantonese dialect, she is the owner of Ming Kee Game Birds, a dingy shop crammed with chickens, ducks and pigeons in wire-mesh cages.
Ms. Kung moved to Grant in 1971, a 24-year-old newlywed with $50 in her pocket.
''We came with nothing and just wanted to make money; we never thought of politics,'' said Ms. Kung, smiling. ''But 10 years ago, when China began growing strong, I thought maybe we would have a Chinese mayor soon.'' 
On Tuesday, that day will most likely arrive, the realization of a major power shift in San Francisco politics.
The mayor's race includes five Chinese candidates in the field of 16, including interim Mayor Ed Lee. If Mr. Lee wins, as polls predict, he will be the first elected Chinese mayor of Old Gold Mountain -- the name given to San Francisco by Chinese immigrants who first came here more than 150 years ago.
Nearly one-quarter of San Francisco's population is Chinese, according to the latest census. As more affluent immigrants have settled in the city, joining an older generation whose economic fortunes continue to rise, the community's political power has soared.
Three of 11 seats on San Francisco's Board of Supervisors are occupied by Chinese-Americans, including its president, David Chiu, a mayoral candidate. For the first time, Chinese voters are returning absentee ballots at a higher rate than the city average, heralding what may be a record turnout, election officials said.
Chinese-Americans ''never had a horse in the race before; now they have five,'' said David Lee, director of the Chinese American Voter Education Committee, a nonpartisan organization dedicated to voter registration. (He is not related to the mayor.)
But with that progress, there have been growing pains. In many ways, the mayor's race has pulled back the curtain on how Chinese politics is played in San Francisco, revealing the infighting, bitter rivalries -- some dating back to China -- and a tradition of patronage and guanxi, or strategic relationships.
The daily tit-for-tat dramas between leading Chinese politicians and their supporters -- allegations of fraud and fecklessness that were once fodder for hushed gossip over morning porridge -- have suddenly become topics in English-language newspapers and on the evening news.
Some Chinese residents said they were embarrassed by the messy campaign. At the Geen Mun Activity Center on Stockton Street on a recent Saturday, May Woo, 67, finished folding a red paper lantern with a half-dozen women in her crafts group.
''The candidates are not talking about schools or the economy; all you hear is attack, attack, attack,'' Ms. Woo, a retired domestic worker, said in Cantonese. ''A candidate breaks wind in public and suddenly it's a scandal. What an embarrassment for the Chinese!'' Ms. Woo's friends burst into laughter and cheers.
Chinatown remains the center of political life for San Francisco's Chinese community. The neighborhood, still one of the city's most popular tourist attractions, has been called a gilded ghetto. Two-thirds of its 14,500 residents do not speak English. One-third live in poverty, often in single-room-occupancy hotels with communal baths and kitchens.
Since the 1860s, the Six Companies -- the umbrella organization of family associations whose members share the same surname -- enforced order over Chinatown politics. In a city where Chinese were once required to pay a $2.50 monthly tax and William Randolph Hearst's Examiner stoked fears of ''yellow peril,'' the associations provided jobs, legal assistance and protection from white ''anti-coolie'' gangs.
Over the past three decades, the family associations have ceded influence to hundreds of community organizations run by politically savvy, American-educated activists and social workers.
Ed Lee came out of that world. Born in Seattle, the son of an immigrant restaurant owner, he began his career as a tenant lawyer at the Asian Law Caucus, a Chinatown-based legal and civil rights organization. He agreed to become interim mayor in January after Gavin Newsom was elected lieutenant governor.
In an interview, Mr. Lee said he was proud to take the job in part because of the Chinese community's difficult past.
''This city had laws on the books that prevented Chinese immigrants from voting, from owning property,'' he said. ''There were physical and social restrictions -- and hurt -- placed on coolies. All of that has resonated in my mind.''
But, in Mr. Lee's rise from obscure city bureaucrat to mayor, some Chinese residents say they detect a disturbing trend. Chinatown power brokers have aligned themselves with traditional politicians and business interests, these critics say, creating a relentless political machine for Mr. Lee.
Over the past several weeks, Chinatown has served as the stage for a political war between supporters of Mr. Lee and supporters of Leland Yee, a state senator. For years, Mr. Yee has feuded with Rose Pak, the powerful head of the Chinatown Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Lee's chief political patron.
There have been allegations in news reports for months that Mr. Lee's nascent administration was tainted by pay-to-play politics involving Ms. Pak and former Mayor Willie Brown, another prominent backer of Mr. Lee.
Resentment over Mr. Lee's ascendance -- and the tactics employed by Ms. Pak on his behalf -- is particularly fierce at the Yee family association, in an ancient building on Waverly Place in Chinatown, behind bright red double doors.
''Is this a dictatorship or an open government?'' said Larry Yee, the association president, raising his voice over the clacking of mah-jongg tiles. In a windowless back room, a faded campaign banner for Mr. Yee was taped to the wall.
''You come all the way to America and you get this?'' Mr. Yee said.
But outside Chinatown, the campaign is playing out differently.
In neighborhoods like Visitacion Valley and the Richmond, younger Chinese immigrants are transforming entire city blocks as they watch the political theater play out.
Nelson Liang, a Visitacion Valley barber, said campaign workers frequently asked if they could put up their signs in his shop. But Mr. Liang said that more important things needed his attention, like making money.
''To the Chinese, you succeed if you have skills, if you work hard,'' Mr. Liang said, shaking his head. ''But politics is different. You need to have tricks. You need to be dirty.''
Mr. Liang, whose barbershop is situated between Salvadoran and Hong Kong-style bakeries on San Bruno Avenue, is part of a wave of younger Chinese-Americans who have left Chinatown's insular culture to seek opportunities in other parts of San Francisco and the Bay Area.
This transformation is even changing the ways people communicate.
The patois of the Taishan region of the Guangdong Province -- the ancestral home of the majority of Chinese immigrants in San Francisco and the family associations -- is fading from use. And while Cantonese remains the most frequently heard Chinese dialect, Mandarin is now common in the Richmond and Sunset districts. Increasingly the rolling tones of Shanghainese and even the flat dialect of Sichuan natives can be heard as well.
Two Harvard-educated candidates -- Mr. Chiu, the board president, and Phil Ting, the assessor-recorder -- are widely viewed as the political faces of this generation.
Mr. Chiu, 42, can appear more comfortable touring South of Market tech companies than sitting through the lush banquets that underpin Chinatown political life. ''It's often easy for some elected officials to gravitate to one community or another,'' Mr. Chiu said in an interview. ''I'm running to represent all of San Francisco.''
L. Ling-chi Wang, a professor emeritus of Ethnic Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and a longtime Chinatown activist, said candidates like Mr. Chiu and Mr. Ting were untainted by Chinatown's internecine politics and will benefit as the Chinese community continues to evolve. Mr. Wang is supporting Mr. Chiu.
''They're young; they're idealistic; they're not corrupted,'' said Mr. Wang, who has criticized both Mr. Yee and Ms. Pak.

COLOMBIAN REBELS A DANGER
DESPITE LEADER'S DEATH
The killing of the top commander of Colombia's largest guerrilla group dealt what might be the most severe blow yet to the four-decade-old insurgency, but security experts said that the rebels still had the ability to regroup and carry on the fight. Elite Colombian forces had been hunting the commander, Alfonso Cano, since he took over the Revolutionary Armed Force of Colombia three years ago, before they found him near a rebel camp in the remote southwest.

CLASH OF THE CRICKETS
Countless members of the Gryllus bimaculatus clan, also known as field crickets, have faced off in China's alleys this fall in a uniquely Chinese blood sport whose provenance extends back more than 1,000 years. Cricket fighting was banned during the Cultural Revolution, but like many once-suppressed traditions it is undergoing a revival, spurred on by a younger generation eager to embrace genuinely Chinese pastimes. Page 6 
MLADIC'S HEALTH SHAPES TRIAL
As the extent of Ratko Mladic's health problems has become more apparent after five months in custody in The Hague, court officials worry that they may well shape the case against their most high-profile defendant. In the past month the former Bosnian Serb general has been treated for lingering pneumonia, which included a week in the hospital, the court has said. Page 12
PERSECUTION IN KYRGYZSTAN
Nearly a year and a half after ethnic clashes ripped through this former Silk Road trading hub, ethnic Uzbeks, who suffered the brunt of the violence, face arbitrary arrest and often horrific abuse at the hands of predominantly ethnic Kyrgyz authorities, victims and local and international rights groups say. Government officials mostly deny reports that Uzbeks suffer unfair treatment. Page 12

RISKS SEEN IN PERRY PLAN
FOR SWITCH TO PENSIONS
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who has long been a vocal critic of Social Security, outlined a plan last month that he said would preserve the program ''for all generations of Americans.'' But one part of his plan -- to let state and local government workers opt out of Social Security -- could add risk to their retirements while sapping money from the system. The proposal runs counter to the recommendations made by some high-profile, bipartisan debt reduction commissions. PAGE 18
CARIBOU AND BASKETBALL
The boys at Tikigaq School in Point Hope, Alaska, have won the Class 2A Alaska State Basketball Championship each year since 2009, which is all the more remarkable because Tikigaq, isolated on a spit in the Chukchi Sea, has fewer than 60 students in high school and its teams must sometimes fly for 12 hours to play a game. Page 18
STUDY FAVORS DOLLAR COINS
Some House Republicans, eager to pare government spending, are suggesting that the dollar bill be eliminated and replaced with a coin. A recent study said the government could save about $5.5 billion over 30 years if it phased out dollar bills, which last about three years on average, and replaced them with dollar coins, which can circulate for three decades before they become worn out.

BURDENING CHILDREN
WITH A FLAWED POLICY
A shift in the rules by the city's Administration for Children's Services could wind up shortchanging families who need subsidized care. A more disturbing aspect of the changes, though, is the prospect that many children could lose their care altogether because of the formula the agency is using to determine need. Big City. Page 1

N.F.L. PLACEKICKERS BECOME
CAN'T-MISS PERFORMERS
Less than halfway through the 17-week N.F.L. schedule, place-kickers have made 45 field goals of 50 yards or longer, putting them on pace to obliterate the record of 66 long-range field goals set in 2008, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. It is an indication of a sea change that has revolutionized kicking as completely as the current crop of quarterbacks is rewriting passing records. Page 4
HISPANICS A RARITY IN N.F.L
Victor Cruz, a wide receiver for the Giants, is one of only a few players in the N.F.L. with a Hispanic background. When the team faces New England this weekend, another player of Puerto Rican descent, the Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, will be on the field. But both players are quick to say that football still had a long way to go in matching baseball and basketball in popularity among Puerto Ricans. Page 1

Radcliffe is an outlier who radically changed the way women trained and raced, piling on the mileage and speed in workouts and setting a blistering pace from the starting gun, writes Jere Longman.

REBUILDING WRIGLEY FIELD
In hiring Theo Epstein as new team president, the Chicago Cubs are hoping he can do for them what he did for the Boston Red Sox. But the team's interest goes beyond what Epstein, as general manager, produced on the field for Boston. What also intrigues the Cubs is that his tenure in Boston saw a transformation of Fenway Park from a beloved, but frayed baseball landmark into an amenity-laden cash cow. Page 5

Jeff Greenfield may have written a book called ''The World's Greatest Team: A Portrait of the Boston Celtics, 1957-69,'' but he grew up a Knicks fan. ''I have fond memories of Harry (the Horse) Gallatin, whose rebounding skills presaged Dave DeBusschere, and the ball-handling of Sweetwater Clifton, the first black ever signed to an N.B.A. contract,'' he wrote in an e-mail. Greenfield, who reviews Harvey Araton's ''When the Garden Was Eden,'' added: ''I am much less devoted to the N.B.A. than in years past, probably because of the decade of Knick ineptitude, the ticket prices and, more broadly, a style of play across much of the league that calls into question the definition of a 'team sport.' (One passing thought: the Knicks' ownership is a powerful case for a confiscatory pre-mortem inheritance tax.)'' 
In the late '60s, Greenfield was a speechwriter for Robert F. Kennedy: ''Working for R.F.K. remains the shaping experience of my life, because of both the man and the times. You can chalk it up to youthful enthusiasm, but in his relentlessly cleareyed approach to public dilemmas, he remains the most compelling public figure I've ever seen.'' Greenfield eventually turned to journalism, working for decades at ABC, CNN and CBS. Sizing up the current presidential campaign, he wrote: ''I take fiendish delight in watching my overcaffeinated colleagues proclaim the startling, astonishing, breathtaking rise and fall of . . . whoever it is this week. It reminds me of a carful of kids in the back seat, demanding of their parents as the car pulls out of the driveway, 'Are we there yet?' We're not. Let somebody vote, for heaven's sake. Also, no president has ever been re-elected in the face of this economic atmosphere (and don't tell me about F.D.R. in '36, because things were way better than in '32). Does that mean Obama can't win? No, it doesn't. We're not there yet.''

HEADLINE: A King of Connections

BYLINE: By EVELYN M. RUSLI

 BODY:
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.
THEY come for his money. They come for his advice. They come -- duh -- for his connections.
But mostly they come, with all the elanof Dorothy on her way to Oz, for a chance at some face time with Reid G. Hoffman, the start-up whisperer of Silicon Valley.
Mr. Hoffman made his name and fortune as the co-founder of LinkedIn, the social network that went public five months ago. But he has also emerged as something else -- -- as the man whom Internet entrepreneurs call when they dream of becoming the next, well, Reid Hoffman.
Want to brainstorm about new technology? Build a business? Raise a cool million -- or billion? Mr. Hoffman is a man to see. If he can't help, he probably knows someone who can. He is, as you might expect, a seriously linked-in guy. 
On this particular day in July, a rising entrepreneur named Brian Chesky has come calling. Mr. Chesky, the co-founder of Airbnb, an online service that matches people looking for vacation rentals with those with rooms to rent, wants some pointers about expanding into China.
Mr. Hoffman, 44, leans back in his chair. Then he lets fly: Airbnb will need a team in China, a robust Chinese-language platform, Web filters to keep Beijing happy, he says. It might also need a joint venture partner. He rattles off a few names.
It's noon, and this is the third of nine meetings that Mr. Hoffman has scheduled today. He is trying not to sneak a peek at his smartphone -- or, rather, his four smartphones. He fields upward of 400 e-mails a day, not counting all the stuff that streams in via Facebook, Twitter and, naturally, LinkedIn, where he had 2,536 connections at last count.
These days, Mr. Hoffman finds himself, a bit to his own surprise, at the center of the social media universe. He has a second full-time job as a partner at Greylock, the venture capital firm. He serves on the boards of eight companies, including Zynga, the hottest game company on the Web, and Mozilla, of Firefox fame. He is also involved in three nonprofits.
Oh, and there's that little company called LinkedIn, which, as of Friday, was worth about $7.9 billion in the stock market. Amid all the meetings and messages and tweets, Mr. Hoffman, the executive chairman, must persuade Wall Street that LinkedIn will prosper and that its lofty valuation is not just another sign of Internet mania.
For the moment, Mr. Hoffman seems to give off a golden aura, at least to many in Silicon Valley. Everyone wants a piece of him.
''He's the first stop for every hot deal,'' says David Siminoff, a technology investor.
Gina Bianchini, the founder of the Internet start-ups Ning and Mightybell, says: ''He's like an early warning system for something great in Silicon Valley.''
Cyriac Roeding, the founder of Shopkick, a mobile shopping app that has been bankrolled by Greylock, adds: ''I've never made a significant move, decision, without consulting him.''
Hearing Mr. Hoffman wax philosophical about technology, it's easy to understand why so many here seem to view him as something of a yoda. When he talks about ''scale'' -- Internet-speak for having enough people use a network to make the network actually useful -- he often invokes Archimedes, the great mathematician and inventor in ancient Greece.
According to lore, Archimedes created a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade to pump water against gravity: the Archimedes screw. Mr. Hoffman urges his followers to find their own levers and devices to encourage people to adopt their technologies. Entrepreneurs, he says, often spend too much time creating products and too little figuring out how to get people to use them.
Archimedes is reputed to have said that, given a lever big enough and a place to stand, he could move the world.
''It's not really quite true, once you understand Newtonian physics, but it is an accurate metaphor,'' Mr. Hoffman says. ''Build a compact piece of work with the right leverage, and you can solve a very big problem.''
LONG before LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman was just another kid in California obsessed with playing games. He grew up in Berkeley, bright and precocious, despite B's and C's in middle school. His father, William Hoffman, a real estate lawyer, recalls that his son always showed remarkable focus.
When Reid was 5, for instance, his father read to him from ''The Lord of the Rings'' before bed.
''Apparently, I wasn't reading fast enough,'' William Hoffman recalls. ''Whenever I picked up the book, the bookmark moved further and further ahead.''
When he was 12, Reid Hoffman arrived unannounced one Friday at offices of Chaosium, the game maker behind RuneQuest, the fantasy role-playing game first published in 1978. He thrust a manual, marked with his suggestions in red ink, into the hands of a game developer.
The man leafed through the pages and asked Reid if he wanted something else to do. He nodded -- and reported to work that Monday. A few weeks later, he received his first paycheck, for $127.
''It changed my father's view of what I was doing,'' Mr. Hoffman recalls. ''He realized I could make a living out of this.''
Mr. Hoffman was basically indulging his obsession for games, or, more specifically, his fascination with multiplayer game mechanics, and the way that social systems come together. The question of what brings people together still fascinates him.
In 1985, Mr. Hoffman enrolled at Stanford, where he majored in symbolic systems, the study of the relationship between computing and human intelligence. He soon befriended a fellow student, Peter Thiel, who would go on to found PayPal. Mr. Thiel, a libertarian, describes Mr. Hoffman as standing on the opposite end of the political spectrum -- ''politically, kind of a socialist,'' he says.
But the two became close and often spent hours debating politics, economics and philosophy. One time the topic was a quotation from Margaret Thatcher: ''There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families.''
Mr. Hoffman vehemently disagreed.
''He believed Thatcher's maxim was wrong,'' Mr. Thiel recalled. ''Reid was always interested in creating communities.''
In 1990, Mr. Hoffman went to Oxford as a Marshall scholar to pursue a master's degree in philosophy. He seemed headed toward a career in academia.
''I had this aspiration to participate in society as a public intellectual,'' he said. His thesis explored the limitations of thought experiments. By his winter term, he realized that life as a professor would, in many ways, feel confining.
Again, the issue was one of scale.
''When you write a scholarly work, it tends to be understood by very few people, and has one publication point over time,'' he said. ''But when you build a service, you can touch millions, to hundreds of millions of people directly.''
WHEN Netscape went public in 1995, in a defining event for the Web, Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Thiel were watching. Mr. Hoffman had a hunch that the social media were going to be huge, along with gaming companies that had social media embedded in their DNA.
His gut was right, but his first foray into social media flopped. In the summer of 1997, he started SocialNet, one of the first networks of its kind. It largely focused on online dating and matching up people with similar interests, like golfers who were looking for partners in their neighborhood.
To lure users, SocialNet partnered with an Arizona newspaper. The partnership yielded two customers in the first month.
''We had it completely wrong,'' Mr. Hoffman said. The ability for a product or service to go viral, he learned, must be built into the way that the product or service works.
Frustrated, he left SocialNet in 1999 and joined Mr. Thiel at PayPal.
PayPal was wrestling a host of challenges, and Visa and MasterCard didn't know whether to view it as an ally or an enemy.
As an executive vice president, it was up to Mr. Hoffman to manage external relations. ''He was the firefighter in chief at PayPal,'' Mr. Thiel says. ''Though that diminishes his role because there were many, many fires.''
Mr. Hoffman emerged as a connector and high-level strategist. He packed his schedule with meetings, charmed credit card companies and soothed the regulators.
PayPal survived, and when the company went public, in 2002, Mr. Hoffman and many of his colleagues became multimillionaires.
Mr. Thiel splurged on a Ferrari. Mr. Hoffman wanted to buy an Audi but instead invested his newfound riches in one of the first solar panel companies to come out of Silicon Valley, Nanosolar, and bought an Acura instead.
''I started to think about the value of money,'' he says. ''I thought if I only had $75,000, would I rather invest in a luxury car or make a play in changing the world?''
Nanosolar became a multibillion-dollar enterprise.
SILICON VALLEY has long since gone Hollywood. Everyone from Lady Gaga to Ashton Kutcher invests in tech start-ups nowadays. Bravo is rumored to be casting for a reality show here.
But Mr. Hoffman remains decidedly unglamorous -- a nerd's nerd. He is wide at the waist and fluffy at the top, with a slightly disheveled heap of hair. His uniform is frumpy, even by the valley's standards. He still drives the same metallic green Acura.
Today, LinkedIn, the professional social network, is a rising giant, a monument to the emergence of the social Web. Founded in 2002, the company has ballooned to more than 1,700 employees. It has more than 135 million registered members across 200 countries. It has turned a profit in six of the last seven quarters.
Mr. Hoffman, the start-up shepherd, is now helping his friends find their way to the public markets. He is a close adviser to Groupon's 30-year-old chief executive, Andrew Mason, and a board member of Zynga. Groupon went public last week and its stock soared, giving the company a market value of almost $17 billion. Zynga is expected to go public by year-end.
Despite such euphoria, it wasn't always clear that LinkedIn would survive. The first year was the darkest. At the time, Friendster was the most popular social network, and by comparison, LinkedIn, a platform built on business connections, seemed dull. Mr. Hoffman was a relentless evangelist, but he had his doubts.
''One of the things I thought of every week was, 'What happens if we don't make this? How do we die gracefully?' '' he said.
It took five years for the company to turn its first profit. Mr. Hoffman struggled to steer his own company even as he mentored others. In 2003, Sequoia Capital, an early backer of Google, invested $4.7 million. One of its partners, Mark Kvamme, joined LinkedIn's board.
The moves were a coup for LinkedIn, but the relationship was strained at times, according to several people close to Mr. Hoffman. And during the early years, he and Mr. Kvamme occasionally locked horns.
''Reid is not a business-running kind of guy,'' says Mr. Siminoff, the tech investor. ''He likes to take off his shoes, think of the world broadly and not worry about corporate spend and margins.''
But as the economy deteriorated in 2008, more people joined LinkedIn for its premium job and recruiting services. Mr. Hoffman, who had briefly ceded his role as chief executive to Dan Nye, a former Intuit executive, took back the top job, with the intent of finding another C.E.O. Within months he hired Jeff Weiner, a Yahoo veteran.
Several years wiser, Mr. Hoffman -- as the executive chairman -- focused on his strengths: product and high-level strategy. It also gave him time to accept a job at Greylock.
Today, Mr. Hoffman splits his time between Greylock's offices on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif., and LinkedIn's headquarters here in Mountain View. Again, he senses that a new Web is stirring. In the same way that social media redefined the Internet, he sees another tectonic shift on the horizon.
This one, he believes, will be driven by data. Mr. Hoffman has been investing in companies that are data-driven or starting to work with data in interesting ways. For instance, even though two Greylock investments, Shopkick and Groupon, focus on retailing, both aggregate a huge volume of information on user spending habits. LinkedIn, too, has been trying to leverage the data on its site by, for example, making it more searchable.
IN Silicon Valley, it's often said that the founder is the start-up. Friends of Mr. Hoffman describe him as a walking version of LinkedIn -- data-intensive, straightforward, useful. In some ways, Mr. Hoffman and his company face similar challenges.
LinkedIn, which has soared in value, is under increasing pressure to perform. Though its membership has roughly doubled annually for each of the last seven years, many wonder if the company can possibly sustain its momentum. LinkedIn can't afford a bad quarter: one miss could hobble the company, analysts say, by slamming its share price and encouraging its best engineers to jump to the Next Hot Thing.
''The problem is, most people are not like Reid,'' said Joichi Ito, the director of M.I.T. Media Lab, who has known Mr. Hoffman for many years. ''Most people waste their time, so the question is, can a work-oriented site become extremely popular, when many people are not as invested in productivity?'' Mr. Hoffman himself is feeling the squeeze. But he tries not to pay attention to the markets and says he has checked LinkedIn's stock price only six times since May.
''The thing I'm working on with LinkedIn in is to create something massive and effective; the strategy horizon is three to five years,'' he said.
The public markets may be less patient. Meanwhile, he also has to answer to his investors at Greylock, who are likely wondering whether he can keep the hits coming. His reputation is an advantage, but also a liability. He is so busy trying to filter out the noise that he has little down time at all -- at most, a few hours on Friday and Saturday evenings. This past August, he went to Austria for his first real vacation since 2002, the year he founded LinkedIn.
Before he left, even the hyperkinetic Mr. Hoffman conceded that he could use a break -- at least a small one. ''I'm functioning at 60 percent capacity,'' he said.
Correction: November 13, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, misidentified the country where he vacationed in August. It is Austria, not Australia.

At age 5, Reid would enjoy when his father read ''The Lord of the Rings'' to him at bedtime -- but he regularly moved ahead by himself when Dad didn't read fast enough.

HEADLINE: Culture Shock

BYLINE: By TOM BARTLETT and KARIN FISCHER

 BODY:
This article is a collaboration between The New York Times and The Chronicle of Higher Education, a daily source of news, opinion and commentary for professors, administrators and others interested in academe. Tom Bartlett is a senior writer at The Chronicle covering ideas and research; Karin Fischer is a senior reporter covering international education.
DOZENS of new students crowded into a lobby of the University of Delaware's student center at the start of the school year. Many were stylishly attired in distressed jeans and bright-colored sneakers; half tapped away silently on smartphones while the rest engaged in boisterous conversations. Eavesdropping on those conversations, however, would have been difficult for an observer not fluent in Mandarin. That's because, with the exception of one lost-looking soul from Colombia, all the students were from China. 
Among them was Yisu Fan, whose flight from Shanghai had arrived six hours earlier. Too excited to sleep, he had stayed up all night waiting for orientation at the English Language Institute to begin. Like nearly all the Chinese students at Delaware, Mr. Fan was conditionally admitted -- that is, he can begin taking university classes once he successfully completes an English program. He plans to major in finance and, after graduation, to return home and work for his father's construction company. He was wearing hip, dark-framed glasses and a dog tag around his neck with a Chinese dragon on it. He chose to attend college more than 7,000 miles from home, Mr. Fan said, because ''the Americans, their education is very good.''
That opinion is widely shared in China, which is part of the reason the number of Chinese undergraduates in the United States has tripled in just three years, to 40,000, making them the largest group of foreign students at American colleges. While other countries, like South Korea and India, have for many years sent high numbers of undergraduates to the United States, it's the sudden and startling uptick in applicants from China that has caused a stir at universities -- many of them big, public institutions with special English-language programs -- that are particularly welcoming toward international students. Universities like Delaware, where the number of Chinese students has leapt to 517 this year, from 8 in 2007.
The students are mostly from China's rapidly expanding middle class and can afford to pay full tuition, a godsend for universities that have faced sharp budget cuts in recent years. But what seems at first glance a boon for colleges and students alike is, on closer inspection, a tricky fit for both.
Colleges, eager to bolster their diversity and expand their international appeal, have rushed to recruit in China, where fierce competition for seats at Chinese universities and an aggressive admissions-agent industry feed a frenzy to land spots on American campuses. College officials and consultants say they are seeing widespread fabrication on applications, whether that means a personal essay written by an agent or an English proficiency score that doesn't jibe with a student's speaking ability. American colleges, new to the Chinese market, struggle to distinguish between good applicants and those who are too good to be true.
Once in the classroom, students with limited English labor to keep up with discussions. And though they're excelling, struggling and failing at the same rate as their American counterparts, some professors say they have had to alter how they teach.
Colleges have been slow to adjust to the challenges they've encountered, but are beginning to try new strategies, both to better acclimate students and to deal with the application problems. The onus is on them, says Jiang Xueqin, deputy principal of Peking University High School, one of Beijing's top schools, and director of its international division. ''Are American universities unhappy? Because Chinese students and parents aren't.''
''Nothing will change,'' Mr. Jiang says, ''unless American colleges make it clear to students and parents that it has to.''
WENTING TANG is quick to laugh, listens to high-energy bands like Red Jumpsuit Apparatus and OK Go, and describes herself on her Facebook page as ''really really fun'' and ''really really serious.'' Ms. Tang, a junior majoring in management and international business, speaks confident, if not flawless, English. That wasn't always the case. When she applied to the University of Delaware, her English was, in her estimation, very poor.
Ms. Tang, who went to high school in Shanghai, didn't exactly choose to attend Delaware, a public institution of about 21,000 students that admits about half its applicants -- and counts Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. among prominent graduates. Ms. Tang's mother wanted her to attend college in the United States, and so they visited the offices of a dozen or more agents, patiently listening to their promises and stories of success.
Her mother chose an agency that suggested Delaware and helped Ms. Tang fill out her application, guiding her through a process that otherwise would have been bewildering. Because her English wasn't good enough to write the admissions essay, staff members at the agency, which charged her $4,000, asked her questions about herself in Chinese and produced an essay. (Test prep was another $3,300.)
Now that she can write in English herself, she doesn't think much of what the employees wrote. But it served its purpose: she was admitted, and spent six months in the English-language program before beginning freshman classes. And despite bumps along the way, she's getting good grades and enjoying college life. As for allowing an agent to write her essay, she sees that decision in pragmatic terms: ''At that time, my English not better as now.''
Most Chinese students who are enrolled at American colleges turn to intermediaries to shepherd them through the admissions process, according to a study by researchers at Iowa State University published in the Journal of College Admission.
Education agents have long played a role in sending Chinese students abroad, dating back decades to a time when American dollars were forbidden in China and only agents could secure the currency to pay tuition. Admission experts say they can provide an important service, acting as guides to an application process that can seem totally, well, foreign. Application materials are frequently printed only in English. Chinese students often are baffled by the emphasis on extracurriculars and may have never written a personal essay. Requiring recommendations from guidance counselors makes little sense in a country where few high schools have one on staff. Many assume the U.S. News & World Report rankings issue is an official government publication.
But while there are certainly aboveboard agents and applications, other recruiters engage in fraudulent behavior. An administrator at one high school in Beijing says agents falsified her school's letterhead to produce doctored transcripts and counterfeit letters of recommendation, which she discovered when a parent called to complain about being charged a fee by an agent for documents from the school. James E. Lewis, director of international admissions and recruiting at Kansas State University, says he once got a clutch of applications clearly submitted by a single agent, with all fees charged to the same bank branch, although the students came from several far-flung cities. The grades on three of the five transcripts, he says, were identical.
Zinch China, a consulting company that advises American colleges and universities about China, last year published a report based on interviews with 250 Beijing high school students bound for the United States, their parents, and a dozen agents and admissions consultants. The company concluded that 90 percent of Chinese applicants submit false recommendations, 70 percent have other people write their personal essays, 50 percent have forged high school transcripts and 10 percent list academic awards and other achievements they did not receive. The ''tide of application fraud,'' the report predicted, will likely only worsen as more students go to America.
Tom Melcher, Zinch China's chairman and the report's author, says it's simplistic to vilify agents who provide these services. They're responding, he says, to the demands of students and parents.
Thanks to China's one-child policy, today's college students are part of a generation of singletons, and their newly affluent parents -- and, in all likelihood, both sets of grandparents -- are deeply invested in their success. At Aoji Education Group, a large college counseling company based in China, one of the most popular services is the guaranteed-placement package: apply to five colleges and get your money back if you're not accepted at any of your choices. ''If a student isn't placed, we've got screaming, yelling parents in the lobby,'' says Kathryn O'Hehir, who works in the company's American admissions department in Beijing. ''They don't want their money back. They want their kid in an Ivy League school.''
Students in China's test-centric culture spend most of their high school years studying for the gao kao, the college entrance exam that is the sole determining factor in whether students win a coveted spot at one of China's oversubscribed universities. So it's not unusual for those who want to study in the United States to spend months cramming for the SAT and the Test of English as a Foreign Language, or Toefl, which most campuses require for admission.
Patricia J. Parker, assistant director of admissions at Iowa State, which enrolls more than 1,200 Chinese undergraduates, says students have proudly told her about memorizing thousands of vocabulary words, studying scripted responses to verbal questions and learning shortcuts that help them guess correct answers.
She has seen conditionally admitted students increase their Toefl scores by 30 or 40 points, out of a possible 120, after a summer break, despite no significant improvement in their ability to speak English. Her students, she says, don't see this intense test-prepping as problematic: ''They think the goal is to pass the test. They're studying for the test, not studying English.''
Ms. Parker estimates she contacts the Educational Testing Services, the nonprofit group that is in charge of the Toefl, every other day during the admissions season to investigate suspicious scores. Like many educators, she would like to see changes to make it harder to beat the exam.
At Kansas State this fall, several Chinese students showed up for classes but did not match the security photos that were snapped when they supposedly took the Toefl months earlier. E.T.S. says it takes additional precautions, such as collecting handwriting samples to reduce the chance that students will hire someone to slip in, in their stead, after breaks. If cheating is found, E.T.S. policy is to cancel a score, but the organization won't say how often that happens, and where. Kansas State, too, won't comment on disciplinary measures, but it has named a committee to draft a policy on dealing with fraud on the Toefl. Says Mr. Lewis, the international admissions director, ''It's very hard, sitting here at a desk in the U.S., to judge what's fraudulent.''
DURING this past September's orientation on the University of Delaware's Newark campus, Scott Stevens, director of the English Language Institute, stood on stage in front of a mostly filled theater. Behind him, on a large screen, was a stock photo of two white college students seated at desks. The male student was leaning over to look at the female student's paper. ''We are original, so that means we never cheat!'' Dr. Stevens told the audience of primarily Chinese students, mixing compliments and warnings. ''You are all very intelligent. Use that intelligence to write your own papers.''
Dr. Stevens has worked at the language institute since 1982. As the program has swelled in the last few years, the institute has outgrown its main building and expanded to classroom space behind the International House of Pancakes on the campus's main drag. Watching Dr. Stevens over the course of a day, it's clear that he is a man with more tasks than time. It's also clear that he's proud of his well-regarded institute and that he cares about students. He gives out his cellphone number and tells them to call any time, even in the middle of the night, if they need him.
But he is candid about the challenges Delaware is facing as the population of Chinese students has grown from a handful to hundreds. Confronting plagiarism is near the top of the list. Dr. Stevens remembers how one student memorized four Wikipedia entries so he could regurgitate whichever one seemed most appropriate on an in-class essay -- an impressive, if misguided, feat. American concepts of intellectual property don't translate readily to students from a country where individualism is anathema. (In the language program, Dr. Stevens says there has been no surge in formal disciplinary actions, as instructors prefer to handle questions of plagiarism in the classroom.)
Just as an understanding of authorship is bound up in culture, so are notions of authority. ''It's not simply the language and culture but the political element as well,'' he says. ''We're well aware that the Chinese are raised on propaganda, and the U.S. is not portrayed very positively. If you've been raised on that for the first 18 years of your life, when it comes down to who they trust -- they trust each other. They don't particularly trust us.''
Instead of living with a randomly selected American, Dr. Stevens says, some freshmen will pay their required housing fees but rent apartments together off campus, a violation of university rules. And they rarely attend voluntary functions at the institute. At a gathering this summer, of the nearly 400 students from 40 countries, about 10 were from China. Also, according to Dr. Stevens, students regularly switch classes to be with their countrymen, rather than stay in the ones they've been assigned by their advisers.
One of those advisers is Jennifer Gregan-Paxton. Dr. Gregan-Paxton, program coordinator of the business school's office of undergraduate advising, says she is impressed by the work ethic and politeness of her students from China. They regularly bring her and other professors small gifts to show their appreciation; on a single day recently, she received a folding fan, a necklace and a silk scarf. She's not surprised that they would want to stick together. ''Even if there were Chinese students who wanted to break out of their pack,'' she says, ''they wouldn't necessarily get the warmest reception.''
For example, Ms. Tang, the marketing major, recalls one class in which, she says, the professor ignored her questions and only listened to American students. Also, while working on a group project in a sociology class, she says she was given the cold shoulder: ''They pretend to welcome you but they do not.'' The encounters left a deep impression. ''I will remember that all of my life,'' she says.
Last fall, Kent E. St. Pierre was teaching an intermediate accounting class with 35 students, 17 of them from China. Within a couple of weeks, all but three of the non-Chinese students had dropped the course. Why did the American students flee? ''They said the class was very quiet,'' recalls Dr. St. Pierre, who considers himself a 1960s-style liberal and says he's all for on-campus diversity. But, he agrees, ''It was pretty deadly.''
In many schools across Asia, vigorous give-and-take is the exception. No doubt, as Dr. St. Pierre points out, if you were to place Americans into a Chinese classroom they would seem like chatterboxes.
Despite the unfamiliar learning style, the average grades of Chinese students at Delaware are nearly identical to other undergraduates'. That may, in part, reflect China's strong preparation in quantitative skills, which holds them in good stead in math-intensive programs like business and engineering, two of the most popular majors for Chinese students and ones in which mastery of English is less crucial. Indeed, some of China's undergraduates are strong enough to land spots at the nation's most selective institutions; Harvard had about 40 in the 2010-11 academic year.
But some professors say they have significantly changed their teaching practices to accommodate the students. During quizzes, Dr. St. Pierre now requires everyone to leave their books at the front of the classroom to prevent cheating, a precaution not taken during any of his two decades at Delaware. And participation counts less, so as not to sink the grades of foreign students. In the past, he required members of the class to give two or three presentations during the semester. Now he might ask them to give one. ''I've had American students saying they don't understand what's being said in the presentations,'' he says. ''It's painful.''
Robert Schweitzer, a professor of finance and economics, frets about using fairly basic vocabulary words. ''I have students say, 'I don't know what 'ascending' means,' '' Dr. Schweitzer says. ''Did they get the question wrong because they don't know the material or because they don't know the language?''
If professors struggle to understand the students, the reverse is also true.
Damon Ma is in the language center's so-called bridge program, which means his English was good enough that he could start taking regular classes even though he hasn't finished with the language program. Mr. Ma is very enthusiastic about studying in the United States, something he's dreamed about doing since he was a boy, and he is conscious of the academic contrasts between the two countries.
''Everything is copying in China,'' Mr. Ma says. ''They write a 25-page paper and they spent two hours and they got an A.''
He was nervous about taking his first university class -- an introduction to ancient Chinese history -- and, a few weeks into the semester, was still wrestling with the language barrier. ''I understand maybe 70 percent,'' he says. ''I can't get the details, the vocabulary.''
Many arrive at Delaware expecting to take English classes for just a few months, but end up spending a year or more at the language institute, paying $2,850 per eight-week session.
Chuck Xu and Edison Ding have been in Delaware's English program for a full year. Their English is, at best, serviceable, and they struggle to carry on a basic conversation with a reporter. Mr. Ding says he paid an agent about $3,000 to prep him for standardized exams, fill out his application and help write his essay in English. What was the essay about? Mr. Ding doesn't recall.
Mr. Xu just completed the program and is now enrolled in freshman classes. Mr. Ding has yet to pass the final stage and hopes to begin regular classes in the spring.
About 5 percent of students in the language program flunk out before their freshman year. In addition, Chengkun Zhang, a former president of Delaware's Chinese Students and Scholars Association, has known students who simply got frustrated and returned home. ''I know a couple of students who have complained to me,'' he says. ''They think that the E.L.I. program is doing nothing more than pulling money from their pockets.''
THE university's push to attract more foreign students is part of the ''Path to Prominence,'' a plan laid out by Delaware's president, Patrick T. Harker. When Dr. Harker came to Delaware five years ago, less than 1 percent of the freshman class was international. He knows firsthand about the classroom challenges because he has taught a freshman course each year. ''They're very good students that struggle with American idiom and American culture,'' he says. Dr. Harker says he's aware that applications from China aren't always what they seem to be. He notes, though, that it's a problem lots of universities, not just Delaware, are grappling with.
But Dr. Harker rejects the notion that the university's recruiting effort in China is mainly about money. ''The students from New Jersey pay, too,'' he says. ''For us it really is about diversity.''
Still, the majority of Delaware's international undergraduates are Chinese, an imbalance Louis L. Hirsh, the university's director of admissions, says he's working to change. Delaware is trying to make inroads into the Middle East and South America, he says.
For colleges that want to go global, and quickly, a natural place for recruiting efforts is China.
When Oklahoma Christian University decided to jump into international admissions, it hired three recruiters and sent them to China. ''China was the market we decided to target,'' says John Osborne, Oklahoma Christian's director of international programs, ''because it was just so large.'' Today, the university, which admitted its first foreign student in 2007, has 250 overseas undergraduates, a quarter of whom are from China.
Indeed, if universities turned on the recruiting spigot in China expecting a steady trickle of students, they've gotten a gusher instead. Ohio State received nearly 2,900 undergraduate applications from China this year. Mount Holyoke College could have filled its entire freshman class with Chinese students. A single foreign-college fair in Beijing this fall drew a crowd of 30,000.
The very size of the market can make it daunting and difficult to navigate. While many American colleges have long-established connections with universities in China, pipelines for generations of graduate students, most do not have strong relationships with the country's high schools. When only a few of the very best students went abroad, it was easy enough for colleges to focus their efforts on a handful of elite secondary schools, but now admissions officers must familiarize themselves with potentially thousands of schools to find a good fit. That's tough for American recruiters who only visit once or twice a year.
Some universities, including Delaware, have hired agents overseas, a practice that is banned in domestic recruiting, and this year has been at the center of a debate within the National Association for College Admission Counseling. Though the agents act as universities' representatives, marketing them at college fairs and soliciting applications, that's no guarantee that colleges know the origin of the applications, or the veracity of their grades and scores.
For those on the ground, there's deepening concern that American colleges have entered China without truly understanding it.
Not long ago, Tom Melcher of Zinch China was contacted by the provost of a large American university who wanted to recruit 250 Chinese students, stat. When asked why, the provost replied that his institution faced a yawning budget deficit. To fill it, he told Mr. Melcher, the university needed additional students who could pay their own way, and China has many of them.
''Do I think the budget squeeze is driving the rush to international?'' Mr. Melcher says. ''Unfortunately, yes.''
At Delaware, officials are trying new strategies. They've started a program that pairs Chinese and other international students with mentors to help ease their transition to American academic life. In addition, the English Language Institute runs workshops for faculty members who have Chinese students in their classes. Other institutions are also rethinking their approach. Valparaiso University, in Indiana, has started a special course to give international students on academic probation extra help with English and study skills.
There are ways to improve the admissions process as well, including interviewing applicants in person to get a sense of their actual English abilities and to discover more about their academic backgrounds beyond test scores. A handful of institutions, including the University of Virginia, have alumni and students interview prospective students, either in the home country or via Skype, and the Council on International Educational Exchange, a nonprofit group, has begun offering an interview service. Such changes are welcome to some educators on the ground. Mr. Jiang, the deputy principal in Beijing, believes oral interviews could give colleges a better sense of students' readiness for an American classroom.
Some universities, too, are hiring outside evaluators to review transcripts or are opening offices in China with local staff members who can spot the application red flags that colleges are missing. But interviewing and thoroughly evaluating every applicant, considering the deluge, would be an enormous and expensive undertaking.
For officials like Dr. Stevens, who has been dealing with international students for nearly three decades, Chinese undergraduates are like a code he's still trying to decipher: ''How can we reach them? How can we get them to engage?''
''That,'' he says, ''is something that keeps me up at night.''

HEADLINE: Term No. 10? Why Not, A Mayor Asks

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
CHARLESTON, S.C. -- This is a town that cherishes tradition.
The first buildings went up in 1670. The opening shots of the Civil War were fired here. It had a community-based historic preservation organization before any other American city.
So it seems hard to imagine that on Tuesday voters would deny Joseph P. Riley Jr., 68, a 10th term as mayor. 
He has already been in office 36 years. As far as people who keep track of these things can tell, that is longer than any other sitting city mayor in the country. It is certainly longer than some of the people who plan to vote for him have been alive.
''It's like shrimp and grits,'' said Sean Brock, one of the city's best chefs and a supporter. ''We just grew up with him. He's just always been mayor.''
Although people who pour coffee, run dress shops and teach school here laugh when someone suggests that he might lose the race, Mr. Riley says he is campaigning as vigilantly as he has for all the other races.
''You run hard and don't take one vote for granted,'' said the mayor, a lifelong Democrat and a supporter of President Obama.
He has lost only one political race in his life, when he ran for governor in 1994 and was defeated in the primary.
Still, there are indications that the mayoral race might not be a slam-dunk.
Mr. Riley, who makes $162,816 a year, is taking criticism for his relationship with the state port authority and the cruise ship industry over how many new vessels will be allowed to disgorge tourists into the historic city.
There is discussion in the local news media of ''Riley fatigue.'' Citizens for a Better Charleston, a group using new campaign laws to remain anonymous, has been campaigning aggressively against him. And the number of votes Mr. Riley has received has been steadily dropping since 1995, figures that are being used by his opponents to show a decline in support but could also indicate that voters simply do not show up to vote because Mr. Riley's victories have seemed inevitable.
This year, voter turnout matters in this city of 120,000. To win, a candidate needs to get more than half the votes. If no one does, the top two candidates will face each other in a runoff on Nov. 22.
''He's scared,'' said William Dudley Gregorie, a city councilman who is likely to pose the toughest competition. (The other candidates are David Farrow, a journalist; Joshua Kennedy, a restaurant manager; and Craig Jelks, a history teacher.)
Mr. Gregorie retired from a job with the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and ran against the mayor in 2007. He pulled in 29 percent of the vote, largely tapping African-American voters and appealing to people who felt economically disadvantaged.
Mr. Gregorie characterizes Mr. Riley as a Southern version of an old-school politician who has a built an empire doling out favors in return for political support.
''He is using all kinds of big-boss tactics like Chicago,'' Mr. Gregorie said.
Ask Mr. Riley if he is scared or if he sees himself as some kind of iron-fisted political kingpin, and he laughs. ''Well, he's wrong on all of that,'' Mr. Riley said.
Polite, trim and disciplined, Mr. Riley has been called an argument against term limits by political writers. He does not see himself as a career politician.
''It's an opportunity for me for work and no different than someone working as a journalist or a physician or working in any profession,'' he said. ''You have a job that's worthwhile, and you believe it's important and interesting. I haven't wanted to stop, and the voters haven't told me to stop.''
Mr. Riley has made attentiveness to the quality of life of those voters a hallmark of his reign.
He is proud of the city's top credit rating and its high ranking on lists of the best cities to visit. He is well versed in the language of drainage and traffic, two issues he says he hears about often.
In 2002, he started a new division of Municipal Court called Livability Court. It gives residents with complaints about barking dogs and parking a forum separate from a court docket filled with assaults and drug crimes.
And every month, he hosts ''mayor's night in.'' Those who sign up get about five minutes of one-on-one time in his office. He likens it to the open-door approach that President Abraham Lincoln took.
''A leader needs to understand the hearts of his or her people,'' he said.
Last week, the hearts of the people seemed to lean against large trucks parking on a neighborhood street. Constituents also wondered if the mayor would support outlining buildings in the historic district with lights at Christmas.
When office hours were over, the mayor jumped in his Prius and headed to a homeowners' association meeting, where he discussed the city's plans to add bicycle lanes.
Then, after a short meeting with his campaign team, he headed home to his wife, with whom he has raised two sons. And it is there where one might find the real secret to his political success.
The mayor does not take work home, preferring a simple dinner and perhaps a good book on history. He tries to keep weekends free, too, limiting the numbers of banquets and parades he attends.
''To be an effective leader and have energy, you need time for repose,'' he said. ''My citizens want me to have a clear head and have energy and be fresh and be creative and not become a robot or some machine that goes around shaking hands and attends everything.''

HEADLINE: Are We There Yet?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS. 
MICHELLE HIGGINS writes the Practical Traveler column.

 BODY:
SURELY they could spare a little milk, right?
But when John and Mary Rose Lin of Jersey City ran out of milk for their 18-month-old twins on a recent Continental flight from Newark to Maui, the flight attendant onboard refused to give them more. That particular beverage, the Lins recall being told, was for coffee, not children. ''I was not asking for a full bottle, just a cup,'' said Mrs. Lin, noting that she even offered to pay for the milk.
It was the low point of an otherwise arduous trip. Her children are active, and efforts to allow them to move around the cabin were not welcomed by the plane's staff. They were told to head back to their seats when they lingered near the rear galley; letting the children stretch their legs in the aisle was also not an option. ''Not a lot of people sympathize with your situation,'' said Mrs. Lin of the 12-hour ordeal. ''If you feel like someone is going to help you, chances are no one will.'' 
The misery of air travel is no surprise to anyone who has boarded a domestic flight in the last five years. As airlines have maximized capacity and slashed services, passengers have learned to brace themselves for packed planes, stuffed overhead bins, harried flight attendants and fees for everything from pretzels to pillows. On top of that, delays and cancellations are up.
For families, however, the costs and the inconveniences are compounded. At a time when resorts, cruise lines and tour operators are courting junior guests as if they were celebrity V.I.P.'s, flying with children has become an increasingly costly, ''Survivor''-like ordeal. Baggage fees? Start multiplying. Early boarding? Probably not. Hoping to sit together? Don't count on it (unless you've paid extra). A few empty seats where a child can spread out and nap? Good luck with that!
It wasn't always like this, of course. In the golden age of flying in the 1960s and '70s -- the one now being so lovingly burnished by ABC's ''Pan Am'' -- families could expect to be the first ones on the plane. They would then be greeted by smiling flight attendants bearing miniature pilot wings for children who would be treated to a tour of the cockpit before settling into their seats. And even as recently as a few years ago families could count on a handful of common courtesies like boarding before other passengers, landing a roomier seat in the first row of coach, bringing certain strollers on board, and even being able to get milk on board.
''We used to carry five to six cartons of milk on each flight for coach,'' said Elaine Sweeney, 58, a flight attendant with American for more than 30 years. But that was five or so years ago. Now, she said, after 9 a.m. there is no milk in coach on her flights -- just two pint-size cartons in first class, where cookies are served. ''So do we give it to a child in coach or a first-class passenger that has paid full fare?'' she asked. ''Quite the conundrum.'' (American, by the way, says it stocks food and beverages based on individual markets.)
To traveling families, the erosion of such niceties is just an indirect way of suggesting they take the bus.
Not so, counter the airlines, it's a matter of resources. American carriers have lost about $55 billion over the course of the past decade, according to the Air Transport Association, as operational costs, like fuel and employee benefits, have outpaced revenues. Making up for those losses has meant cutting benefits and adding fees for everyone. (This year, most domestic airlines are on track to eke out their fourth year of modest profits since 2000.)
And while we may miss the golden days of air travel, flights cost less now than they did then. Adjusting for inflation, the average round-trip domestic fare in 1979 was $559.31; last year it was $316.31. For families, in particular, that is a meaningful difference. More than anything else, said Michael Boyd, president of the Boyd Group International, an aviation consultancy, ''families generally travel based on price.''
Given the current economic climate and families' desire for cheap flights, Mr. Boyd doesn't expect things to improve soon. At best, he said, airlines ''treat families like everybody else.''
''If you get a good flight attendant they might help you warm the bottle,'' he continued. ''Other than that you're on your own.''
So for anyone planning to brave the indifferent skies with children this season, here are a few of the major sticking points and tips on how to navigate them.
Why Is Everyone Else
Boarding First?
As little as four years ago, some airlines were still routinely calling families to board first. The idea was that getting children on early was not just a courtesy for families -- who got extra time to settle in -- but a benefit that improved boarding for everyone. The policy has been declining over several years, and now, with early boarding a privilege people can pay for, it is rare to find someone who has been invited to board first as part of a family. (Airline representatives all say that they allow families to board, if not first, then at least before coach passengers paying regular fare, but anecdotal reporting suggests otherwise.)
WHAT FAMILIES CAN DO The only way to guarantee early boarding for your family is to buy it. Check with the airline to see what they offer. Short of that, explain to the gate agents why you would like to preboard and see if they can help. If necessary, refer to their preboarding policies (see accompanying article) for backup. Or give up any hope of using your overhead bin and board last with the idea of keeping restlessness to a minimum.
My Kids Are Seated
Five Rows Behind Me!
Planes are flying mostly full most of the time thanks to major capacity cuts over the past decade; during peak travel times empty seats are even harder to come by. For families this means that it is increasingly difficult to get seats together, a particular gripe for those who, like Sierra Black, have found themselves jockeying for seats onboard.
Last February, US Airways placed Ms. Black and her two children, ages 5 and 2, in the center seats of three different rows in different parts of the plane for a five-hour flight to Tucson -- an experience Ms. Black chronicled in a series on her blog, ChildWild. After a flight attendant insisted that the family take their assigned seats -- which caused the children to cry since they were separated from their mother and sitting between strangers -- Ms. Black ultimately managed to commandeer seats for the three of them together, but only after the entire plane had boarded.
''Even if I wanted to leave my 2-yr-old in row 26 while I kicked back with a paperback up in row 5, I kind of think I shouldn't be allowed to,'' Ms. Black wrote on her blog. ''Doesn't the airline have a responsibility, for the safety of all its passengers, to keep young kids with their caregivers?''
Responding, Todd Lehmacher, a US Airways spokesman, wrote in an e-mail, ''We are sympathetic to families traveling together and make every effort to accommodate their request.'' But, he added, ''We also have to weigh the needs of our other customers.''
When flights were less full, flight attendants say, reseating passengers so that a family could sit together wasn't a problem. Now, if any open seats are left at all, they are usually the middle ones, making it difficult to persuade other passengers to swap seats -- a task flight attendants are not required to do.
WHAT FAMILIES CAN DO First, book as early as possible so more seats are available. If you cannot find seats together, call the airline and ask an agent to make a note on your reservation indicating which family members are minors, recommends Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and co-founder of Atmosphere Research Group, based in San Francisco. ''If for some reason the airline changes planes or the seating configuration changes,'' he said, ''families usually get priority.''
If nothing comes of that, check back with the airline one to three days before departure, when seats for customers with disabilities are often released. If those seats are not taken, they are released to other passengers.
And, of course, you can throw money at the problem. Most airlines now put a price tag on the most desirable seats, which may remain available when the rest of coach is sold.
''It's almost like you're forced into it,'' said Carla Caccavale Reynolds, a public relations executive from New York and mother of four, who paid $70 extra a head for herself, her husband and three of her children to sit together on a packed JetBlue flight from New York to Aruba for at total of $350 on top of the tickets. (The 8-month-old traveled on her lap.) ''The only seats available were the ones that cost extra,'' she said. But faced with the prospect of sitting apart, ''I said, 'fine, just do it,' '' she said.
'If You Don't Bring It,
We Don't Have It'
No one should be surprised at having to take food on board (or pay for it), in addition to basic supplies, but some families, like the Lins, who were refused milk for their twins, are startled to discover just what isn't available.
Mary Clark, a spokeswoman for Continental, the airline the Lins were flying, said the family's experience wasn't typical, and that the airline offers a ''variety of complimentary beverages on all of our flights, but occasionally a specific selection may not be available due to customer demand.''
Families aren't the only ones affected by the new austerity. Flight attendants, too, miss the days when they could give people pretty much what they needed. ''I remember the days when we had lemonade in the summer, hot chocolate in the winter,'' said Beth Donnelly, a veteran flight attendant with American Airlines who began her career in 1977 on Braniff International Airways. ''We had the wings and coloring books, baby food and diapers. Families would come on first and get settled in.''
Now, she said, ''it's hurry, hurry, hurry. Poor people, now if you don't bring it, we don't have it.''
WHAT SHOULD FAMILIES EXPECT AND DO? Even when airlines offer food onboard, often the thing you want is sold out. To ensure that your family has what it needs, take it yourself.
Keep in mind that baby formula and food, breast milk and juice are allowed ''in reasonable quantities'' exceeding the usual 3.4 ounces required by security according to the Transportation Security Administration.
Consider buying perishables like milk post-security and asking a flight attendant to put those items on ice. Or bring something like Parmalat or Horizon Organic's eight-ounce low-fat milk boxes which can be stored at room temperature until opened.

Does It Have to Be This Way ?
For Americans used to domestic flights, the first taste of a foreign airline can be a head-turner. Eric Lorge, a media studies professor who regularly visits Los Angeles from Europe, was flying American before he tried Air Tahiti Nui from Los Angeles to Paris with his wife and three children, all under the age of 5. He liked that they would often get priority boarding as a family, but what won him over was the way the flight attendants handled his daughter when she was sick. ''They kept bringing warm washcloths and water and asking if we needed anything.'' His experience with United States carriers? ''I try to avoid them if at all possible.''
Not all foreign airlines roll out the red carpet for families. In 2004 Malaysia Airlines banned children under the age of 2 from traveling in first-class sections on its Boeing 747 jets. Next year, when it is expected to get the first of its Airbus A380 superjumbo jets, the airline will extend the ban to them as well. But the services offered to families by most foreign carriers, which can range from baby sitters in waiting areas to automatic 25 percent discounts (see accompanying article), far exceed those offered by American counterparts.
To be sure, a handful of family courtesies remain on domestic flights, including checking a stroller and car seat at no charge. Children under the age of 2 can fly free on a parent's lap within the United States. And most airlines will allow children to sit in an approved car seat if there is the space for it onboard. On overseas flights American carriers tend to offer families more amenities -- bassinets for infants, pillows, blankets and the occasional child's meal -- because they are competing with foreign airlines.
But why can't all flights within the United States strive for those foreign flourishes?
''It comes down to one thing, and one thing only: cost,'' said Mr. Harteveldt, of the Atmosphere Research Group. ''With travelers so focused on saving money, airlines simply can't afford to offer the amenities foreign flag airlines offer. In addition, U.S. airlines have higher labor costs than many foreign-flag airlines, leaving them with less margin to offer kid-friendly amenities.''
Some travel experts believe that airlines are missing an opportunity by not catering to families. Joanne Gardner, owner of the Travel Specialist travel agency in Wheaton, Ill., where nearly half of her business is planning family vacations, estimates that 25 to 35 percent of her clients actively avoid flying. ''People really dislike the whole experience,'' she said, from the baggage fees to having to bring on their own food. ''Clients are preferring to take trains, rent a car or drive on their own.''
So far, this doesn't seem to have the airlines worried. Only a few airlinestrack the number of families flying with children. Those that do say they haven't noticed any change. ''There's plenty more passengers where you came from,'' said Mr. Boyd, the Colorado aviation consultant, summarizing the airlines' stance: ''We don't have to fight over it right now.''
But at least one person would like a reason to get on a plane again. Two-and-a-half years ago Kari Dilloo, communications manager for Bing Travel, the Microsoft search site, took her then 3-month-old twins on a 90-minute flight from Seattle to Salt Lake City. Nothing terribly bad happened, but there was so little support from the airline and other passengers that they've opted for road trips ever since.
''I already had low expectations,'' said Mrs. Dilloo, who had spent months planning the trip and asking friends for tips. ''But they dropped even more.'' If there was an airline that catered specifically to families, she added, ''we'd fly them.'' Is Your Airline Child-Friendly?
Like all coach passengers, families are increasingly forced to pay up if they want any onboard perks. Here's a look at what families can expect from a range of American carriers on domestic flights.
American
PREBOARDING No. Families who want to board earlier can ask the gate agent or pay $10 a person to guarantee a spot in the first boarding group in coach.
SEATING Bulkhead seats toward the front of coach are reserved for elite passengers or sold as ''preferred seats'' 24 hours before departure for a fee starting at $4.
KIDS' MEALS Sells a number of ''kid-friendly choices'' like $10 turkey sandwiches with chips.

Discounts, Diapers and Birthday Cakes: Life on Foreign Carriers
International routes generally tend to have more child-friendly perks, like children's meals and bassinets, but some airlines go above and beyond the basics, providing everything from child-size headsets to children's meals that are served before adults'. Here's a look at what lengths some foreign carriers go to for families on international flights.
Air New Zealand
Activity packs that feature ''Jet Cadet'' cartoon characters are available for children ages 3 to 11 on long-haul flights, as are limited quantities of disposable diapers, drinking cups and formula. Children's meals include scrambled eggs, fruit salad and cereal for breakfast and spaghetti and meatballs for dinner. And its SkyCouch, a trio of economy-class seats that can be turned into one large, sofalike bench by tucking the armrests back and lifting the leg rests, offers families more flexibility. Costs: $100 to $150 on top of ticket prices for a family of three from Los Angeles to London or Auckland.
Air France
Kids' meals, including pre-sliced meat and fish for easy eating, cookies and jars of baby food are available on flights of two and a half hours or more if ordered in advance. For children between 2 and 11, discounts of 33 percent are offered on some long-haul flights. Finger puppets, colored pencils and activity books are also offered onboard.
Air Transat
This Canadian charter company was the winner of the Family Friendly Airline Award, presented by the Kids First Fund earlier this year. It offers dedicated family airport counters at Canadian gateways, courtesy strollers in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, and Air Transat Kids Club for 2- to 11-year-olds who live in Canada. Kids Club members receive priority bag handling, free seat selections (normally between 15 to 70 Canadian dollars, about the same in U.S. dollars, depending on seat and route), a surprise from the crew when flying on their birthday, and entry into two yearly drawings for family vacations to Walt Disney World or Paris. All children traveling from Canada to Florida receive an activity book featuring the airline's mascot, AirNest.
British Airways
In addition to specially designed ''carrycots'' and infant seats for children up to 2 years old, the airline supplies Skyflyer activity packs for children under 12 on all flights over three hours long. The ''feed kids first'' policy is designed to ensure that parents can eat in peace. One thumbs down: The carrier began charging $:25 (about $40) for seat assignments in coach two years ago or roughly $160 extra for a family of four. Families who don't pay for seat assignments will get seats three days before departure. ''If the group cannot be seated together, each child will be seated with an adult at least,'' according to the airline Web site.
Cathay Pacific
Children 3 to 6 years old are referred to as Junior V.I.P.'s and offered packs with activity books and games. Diapers and Mustela diaper cream are offered to parents with infants. Children's meals are served with colorful cutlery.
Emirates Airline
Children 12 and under receive backpacks with a children's magazine, puzzles, games, coloring pencils, a child-size sleeping mask and a stuffed animal. Jarred baby food and children's menus with items like macaroni and cheese, chicken nuggets, pasta and veggie burgers are available on every flight, and the bulkhead row at the front of coach, where bassinets are located, is reserved exclusively for passengers traveling with infants. Children receive kid-size headsets to use with the seatback television screens offering 27 children's channels, 36 Disney classic movies, and other movies for youngsters each month. Birthdays are marked with a special cake and Polaroid picture if the airline is notified in advance.
Etihad Airways
First- and business-class lounges in Abu Dhabi are staffed with nannies in dedicated family rooms. Onboard, children receive a kids' pack with activity books and stickers and can choose from several video games, eight child-friendly movies or a children's channel.
Lufthansa
Its child-vetted children's menu includes animal-shaped entrees. Themed onboard souvenirs are periodically offered to children (this month it was a Halloween flashlight). And English-speaking airport guides can be hired through the Lufthansa Family Service at its hubs in Frankfurt or Munich for a fee of 55 euros (about $76) for a family of five.
Virgin Atlantic
Children receive backpacks with coloring books, toys, sunglasses, hats and other surprises. Children's meals, which must be reserved in advance, include chicken fingers and pizza served with child-size cutlery and a side of a fruit, vegetable, yogurt or string cheese. Children 2 to 12 pay 75 percent of the adult fares. Bulkhead seats are specifically reserved for parents with infants, and specially designed infant cots and chairs are available for children up to 3 years old. A limited supply of diapers, bottles and baby food are also offered onboard.

HEADLINE: In the School of Innovation, Less Is Often More

BYLINE: By NICOLE LAPORTE

 BODY:
SINCE the 1980s, the United States has increasingly depended on other nations for shrimp production. As scientists have struggled to find a way to increase yields, they have turned to a technology in which shrimp are farmed indoors in large, rectangular tubs of water, laid out side by side.
But this method, known as ''raceways'' technology, does not produce enough seafood to be very cost-effective. That's because only so many tubs can fit in a confined space, requiring a huge facility to produce a large number of shrimp. Given the limitations, importing shrimp has remained far cheaper than farming them here. 
Agricultural experts were stymied until Addison L. Lawrence, a scientist at the Texas AgriLife Research Mariculture Laboratory, had an idea so simple that it was revolutionary: Why not stack the tubs on top of one another?
And so was born the concept of ''super-intensive stacked raceways,'' an innovation that makes it possible to produce up to one million pounds of shrimp annually per acre of water, compared with the 20,000 pounds produced by natural ponds, and the 50,000 pounds produced by the original raceways system, Dr. Lawrence said. The technology is to be used in a production facility starting next year.
Despite the fact that Dr. Lawrence labored on his invention for close to a decade, he acknowledges that the idea behind it was as ''simple as heck.''
''Anything that is really good and patentable is as simple as can be,'' he says.
The logic may seem counterintuitive at first. After all, we tend to associate innovations, particularly technological ones, with many whiteboards' worth of impossible-to-decipher code and scientific theorems that only the most advanced minds can comprehend. Yet talk to those advanced minds and they'll inevitably tell you: Keep it simple.
''Simplicity is always something to strive for,'' says Steven J. Paley, an inventor who holds nine patents and is the author of ''The Art of Invention: The Creative Process of Discovery and Design.'' ''Most people just try and come up with a solution. It is much easier to add complexity than to work and discover simplicity. I think people do know this, but it's hard.''
John Maeda, president of the Rhode Island School of Design and author of ''The Laws of Simplicity,'' echoes that notion.
''It's everyone's instinct to want more,'' Mr. Maeda says. ''We're programmed to want more food, just in case we won't have a chance to eat tomorrow. So we eat a lot today. More is safety. More is when you're at the checkout counter and there are more features.'' But, he says, people ultimately don't want all the extras: ''At the point of desire you want more, but at the point of daily use, you want less.''
But what does ''simple'' mean, exactly? Obvious? Consisting of only a few parts?
Mr. Paley defines the term as ''doing the most with the least.'' He points to the paper clip as an example. ''All it is is a wire with three bends in it. It relies on the twistable properties of the wire.
''Something like that, who would have thought about it?'' Mr. Paley asks. ''But once you see it: Ah! So obvious.''
Still, a simple invention can also be deceptively complex, or made up of nuanced details, which is often what makes it valuable -- not to mention patentable and, hopefully, commercial.
The Xerox copy machine, for example, is based on the ''single, simple principle of static electricity,'' Mr. Paley says. Inside the machine is a drum, charged with static electricity, that attracts toner particles. Yet the mechanics of actually building a copier were such that it took 22 years for the first Xerox machine to hit the market, in 1960.
For Dr. Lawrence, the ''simple'' idea of stacking the tubs would work only if he could figure out how to make them lighter. In the original raceways design -- the name is inspired by the circulating water in the tubs, which resembles horses on a racetrack -- there was three to five feet of water in each tub, making them too heavy to stack. (The tanks, which Dr. Lawrence describes as looking like ''big, overgrown hog troughs,'' are 50 to 150 yards long, and 3 to 5 yards wide.) So, in 2000, he asked himself whether he could raise shrimp in much shallower water.
He recalled what happened next: ''I went up to the engineering school. I said, 'O.K., what is my maximum water depth that I can have, where it would be economical to stack the raceways?' ''They said, 'You can't get over 12 inches of water.' Reason being, the deeper the water, the weight goes up so much that you lose the structural support.''
A year later, Dr. Lawrence conducted his first shallow-water experiments, discovering that the shrimp could grow in as little as four inches of water.
''I said: 'Wow.' It was so unbelievable to me. So I spent the next four to five years conducting experiment after experiment, testing it in different ways, to confirm to myself that this approach was economical and could be done.''
Finally, in 2008, he applied for a patent -- currently pending -- for a system in which the computer-monitored tubs are filled with six to eight inches of water, and stacked seven high. In the meantime, Royal Caridea, a start-up seafood production company, has bought worldwide licensing rights to the system and is expected to break ground on a production facility in 2012. Dr. Lawrence predicts that, in time, every major metropolitan area will ''have a shrimp farm right next to it'' and that there will be no more reason to rely on imports.
''And all I did was reduce the water depth,'' he said, chuckling. ''Now is that complicated?''

HEADLINE: The Gridlock Where Debts Meet Politics

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT; Suzanne Daley contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With Greece struggling to form a government that can force harsh austerity measures onto a weary public, Europe is in usual form, taking a couple of steps toward solving its fiscal crisis and then a couple of steps backward. Washington, meanwhile, is hoping that the latest deficit-reduction committee in Congress can succeed where others have failed.
This cycle of bureaucracy and gridlock has been repeating itself for months now. It is tempting to blame feckless politicians on both sides of the Atlantic, and that would not be entirely wrong. 
But the frailty of politicians is not the full story. The fact is that most of the industrialized world -- Europe, the United States, Japan, too -- is in a difficult economic bind. There are no simple solutions that would quickly win the approval of citizens if only politicians were willing to try them.
Most voters in these places have yet to come to grips with the notion that they have promised themselves benefits that, at current tax rates, they cannot afford. Their economies have been growing too slowly, for too long, to pay for the coming bulge of retirees.
''The U.S. and Europe have to make hard choices because of two things: slower growth and aging populations,'' said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. ''Europe's choices are even harder than America's, because the prospects for growth are more dubious.''
By the end of last week, as the Greek Parliament took a big step toward approving a European deal to reduce the country's debt, some reasons for hope had emerged. Yet the main dynamic had not changed.
Europe still has not set aside enough money to cover its debts, with Italy now presenting the most immediate problems, many economists say. In the United States, a special Congressional deficit committee appears to be making little progress, and some members of Congress have even begun talking about undoing the automatic Pentagon cuts set to take place if the committee deadlocks.
On the most basic level, affluent countries are facing sharply increasing claims on their resources even as those resources are growing less quickly than they once were.
The increasing claims come from the aging of the population, while the slowing growth of available resources comes from a slowdown of economic expansion over the last generation. A complex mix of factors, varying by country, has slowed growth, and the slowdown has been exacerbated everywhere by the worst financial crisis and global recession in 70 years.
The combination has left Europe and the United States with frustrated populations that still have more sacrifices ahead. ''These are very difficult moral issues,'' said Benjamin Friedman, an economic historian at Harvard. ''We are really talking about the level at which we support the elderly retired population.''
As Simon Tilford, chief economist of the Center for European Reform, a research group in London, said, ''Countries will face tougher choices.''
In the United States, the debates center on whether to let government grow as the population ages and whether the affluent, who have done very well in recent decades, should pay more taxes. In Europe, the issues revolve around whether to shrink government, which is bigger than it is here, and whether well-off northern countries like Germany should support poorer countries, like Greece and Italy, which also suffer from fiscal irresponsibility.
Everywhere, though, the debate is about much more than just partisan advantage or the next election. It is a philosophical debate.
''The country's in such bad shape, and people wish Congress would do something about it,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said in an interview last week. ''And we have a big difference of opinion about what ought to be done.''
He added, ''That is what we do here -- we have big debates about the future of the country.''
Of course, politicians have also exposed themselves to legitimate criticism. Mr. McConnell and his fellow Republicans have blocked a short-term jobs bill proposed by President Obama that has broad support from independent economists, and for the most part they have failed to level with voters about cuts to Medicare, Social Security and the military that a no-new-taxes pledge would require. Democrats, including Mr. Obama, have vowed not to raise taxes on households making less than $250,000, which seems impossible without larger benefit cuts than Democrats have acknowledged.
Polls, however, suggest that there is little political advantage in explaining the reality of future budget math. ''Everybody thinks, 'My taxes are going to fund somebody else's social programs,' '' Mr. Eichengreen said, ''making people even more resistant to solutions.''
Playing to those sentiments, the presidential contenders in the United States and France seem unlikely to force austerity upon angry voters.
The United States and Europe still have more than enough resources to solve their problems. They are among the richest societies the world has ever known, benefiting from skilled work forces, the rule of law and political freedoms that often help produce economic innovations. The United States also continues to benefit from low interest rates, a signal of the bond market's confidence.
Yet the United States and Europe face the risk that their problems will feed on each other. Recent economic stagnation may make voters and policy makers unwilling to make hard choices, and the political paralysis might then worsen the economy by creating new financial turmoil. In an article in the current issue of the journal The National Interest, Mr. Friedman named this problem the ''no-growth trap.''
In the short term, this trap takes the form of resistance to emergency measures, like Germany's distaste at bailing out more profligate countries, which may increase deficits. ''The central paradox of financial crises,'' Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said before leaving for the Group of 20 meetings in Europe last week, ''is that what feels just and fair is the opposite of what's required for a just and fair outcome.''
Longer term, the trap is created by resistance to the higher taxes and reduced benefits necessary to return countries to financial stability. The resistance is understandable, given how weak income growth has been in the past decade, but it is not sustainable.
With Europe facing a series of debt decisions in the coming weeks and the Congressional deficit committee closing in on its Nov. 23 deadline, it is tempting to predict that policy makers will have to start making some big decisions soon. Then again, if history is a guide, they may well find ways to put off those decisions yet again.

THE BARBARIAN NURSERIES
By Hector Tobar
422 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $27
The literature of Los Angeles must discern shadows in the sunshine if it hopes to transcend mere entertainment. Hector Tobar knows this. A native of the city, Tobar knows the dark and the light, the high and the low; he knows the spas and the salvage shops, the wrought iron and the barbed wire; he knows the West Side, the Valley and downtown -- and he has put it all into his big new novel, ''The Barbarian Nurseries.'' Mercifully, Hollywood did not make the cut.
The mixed-race couple at the story's center is Maureen and Scott Torres-Thompson. Maureen is a Midwestern transplant who, despite a habit of chewing at the ends of her ginger hair, is the picture of composed elegance. Scott is a Stanford-educated software millionaire born of humbler beginnings. Half Mexican (English is his mother tongue), he is by all appearances the embodiment of the American dream. But social ascendancy has come at a price: he is estranged from his father, whose advice -- ''Never hang your hat where you can't reach it'' -- he has pointedly ignored. 
Scott and Maureen live high on a hill in a gated community. So much in their palatial home is overwrought, as if to compensate by excess for impoverishments nonmaterial. The children's room is jampacked with exquisite toys -- an Art Deco mobile dangles planets of colored glass, pop-up books produce dragons and castles -- but nowhere is their affluence more vividly displayed than in the tropical garden, the book's central, potent image. Here, banana trees and lush ferns thrive. Such profusion in the arid air of Southern California, a climate better suited to cactuses, owes its survival to Pepe, the Mexican gardener responsible for its maintenance. A foot-wide stream gushes forth with a flick of a switch. ''La petite rain forest,'' Maureen has taken to calling it, a formulation that carries the whiff of cultural snobbery (Pepe would say pequena).
No novel that purports to tell the truth about Los Angeles can avoid the theme of artifice. How fitting it is that the house with a fake stream in its fake tropical garden is situated on a street with a fake Spanish name. Paseo Linda Bonita is, we learn, a redundancy. (Translation: Beautiful Pretty Street.) Scott and Maureen don't speak much Spanish, and their employees don't speak much English. Communication between employer and employee is limited to facial expressions, hand signals and a crude Spanglish that fails to express all but the most rudimentary notions. Communication between Maureen and Scott is strained, too. Maureen can't comprehend why her mild-mannered husband would punch a wall, and he resolutely declines to explain. Scott is given to moody silences, and encourages the attentions of a junior programmer at an outfit called Elysian Systems.
The tribulations of Scott and Maureen receive compassionate attention here, but it is Araceli, their live-in maid, who commands the author's primary sympathies. So too, ours. Much of the potency of ''The Barbarian Nurseries'' comes from our knowledge, as privileged readers, of Araceli's thoughts and feelings, disclosures that bring forth some of its freshest imagery. We learn of her girlhood home in Mexico City, where she awoke to the sound of her mother sweeping the patio with a bundle of slender branches that played a percussive song: ''Clean-clean, clean-clean, clean-clean.'' We learn that she attended art school at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, but economic hardship prevented her from continuing her studies; now, she constructs and hangs from her ceiling weird sculptures like the Garbage Phoenix, a menacing assemblage of colored plastic forks and knives scavenged from her employers' parties. At one such party, we find her distributing a tray of sopes and other hors d'oeuvres to Scott and Maureen's friends. The proximity of her homeland is felt in the sangrias they throw back, the taquitos they consume and the sopes' ingredients (tomatoes, avocados and Oaxaca cheese: ''the colors of the Mexican flag''). Many of the partygoers are, like Scott and Maureen, mixed-race couples, but when one among them drunkenly voices his grievances about Mexicans in Los Angeles, an awkward silence ensues: ''They avoided discussing race, as if the mere mention of the subject might cause their fragile alliances to come apart. 'Mexican' was a word that sounded harsh, somehow.''
The moment passes, the party resumes. The expression Araceli wears is as /buttoned-up as her filipina, a boxy uniform that renders her silhouette shapeless. She remains, in the eyes of her employers and their friends, inscrutable, unknowable.
Social and racial conflict assume a larger dimension when Araceli is accused of a crime, setting into motion a plot that brings about the collision of people from radically different worlds. The charge is child endangerment, child abuse or kidnapping, depending on whose opinion is solicited in Child Protective Services, law enforcement or the network news, and media frenzy feeds an institutional over/reaction that culminates in an Amber Alert.
What did Araceli do? Let it only be said that it was una mala comunicacion.
Tobar, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist at The Los Angeles Times, writes with authority about the machinations of Orange County-versus-Los Angeles municipal politics, and exhibits a seismographic sensitivity to the tensions along the fault lines of his cultural terrain. A story of scandal in a metropolis fraught with racial friction may elicit comparisons with Tom Wolfe's ''Bonfire of the Vanities,'' and though both may be classified as social novels, aiming to depict how contemporary society shapes our consciousness, the kinship is superficial. Both authors are alert to the absurdities of American culture, but the characters in Tobar's metropolis do not yield readily to caricature.
The plight of an immigrant in Los Angeles was the focus of Tobar's first novel, ''The Tattooed Soldier,'' and ''The Barbarian Nurseries'' broadens the scope, extending across social classes and over Mexico's porous border. The strength of this book is to be found in its sympathetic portrayals of people who struggle to find a common language yet persist in misunderstanding one another. The author devotes considerable effort to inhabiting his characters' inner lives. While characters' thoughts, presented in italics, invite us into emotional states of being (''No one here admires me, no one looks up to me'') they fail to convince when we sense the author smuggling in thematic exposition (''How can we live in such a big world, where hooded sweatshirts and baby ballerina dresses circulate from north to south, from new to old, from those who pay retail to those who pay for their clothes by the pound?''). More assured is the author's use of imagery to provide glimpses of psychological depth. After Araceli disappears, Maureen searches for a photograph to assist the police in her capture. The only one she can find shows Araceli in the background, her figure dim and blurred, suggesting ''something furtive about its subject, as if she were already in flight when it was taken.'' Tobar's portraits, acute and humane, render his characters intelligible. His illuminations become our recognitions. h

HEADLINE: America's Deadly Dynamics With Iran

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER. 
The chief Washington correspondent of The New York Times.

 BODY:
COMMUTING to work in Tehran is never easy, but it is particularly nerve-racking these days for the scientists of Shahid Beheshti University. It was a little less than a year ago when one of them, Majid Shahriari, and his wife were stuck in traffic at 7:40 a.m. and a motorcycle pulled up alongside the car. There was a faint ''click'' as a magnet attached to the driver's side door. The huge explosion came a few seconds later, killing him and injuring his wife.
On the other side of town, 20 minutes later, a nearly identical attack played out against Mr. Shahriari's colleague Fereydoon Abbasi, a nuclear scientist and longtime member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Perhaps because of his military training, Mr. Abbasi recognized what was happening, and pulled himself and his wife out the door just before his car turned into a fireball. Iran has charged that Israel was behind the attacks -- and many outsiders believe the ''sticky bombs'' are the hallmarks of a Mossad hit.
Perhaps to make a point, Mr. Abbasi, now recovered from his injuries, has been made the director of Iran's atomic energy program. He travels the world offering assurances that Iran's interest in nuclear weapons is peaceful. 
Even for the Iranian scientists who get to work safely, life isn't a lot easier. A confidential study circulating through America's national laboratories estimates that the Stuxnet computer worm -- the most sophisticated cyberweapon ever deployed against another country's infrastructure -- slowed Iran's nuclear progress by one to two years. Now it has run its course. But there is no reason to believe the attacks are over.
Iran may be the most challenging test of the Obama administration's focus on new, cheap technologies that could avoid expensive boots on the ground; drones are the most obvious, cyberweapons the least discussed. It does not quite add up to a new Obama Doctrine, but the methods are defining a new era of nearly constant confrontation and containment. Drones are part of a tactic to keep America's adversaries off balance and preoccupied with defending themselves. And in the past two and a half years, they have been used more aggressively than ever. There are now five or six secret American drone bases around the world. Some recently discovered new computer worms suggest that a new, improved Stuxnet 2.0 may be in the works for Iran.
''There were a lot of mistakes made the first time,'' said an American official, avoiding any acknowledgment that the United States played a role in the cyber attack on Iran. ''This was a first-generation product. Think of Edison's initial light bulbs, or the Apple II.''
Not surprisingly, the Iranians are refusing to sit back and take it -- which is one reason many believe the long shadow war with Iran is about to ramp up dramatically. At the White House and the C.I.A., officials say the recently disclosed Iranian plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States -- by blowing up a tony Georgetown restaurant frequented by senators, lobbyists and journalists -- was just the tip of the iceberg. American intelligence officials now believe that the death of a Saudi diplomat in Pakistan earlier this year was an assassination. And they see evidence of other plots by the Quds Force, the most elite Iranian military unit, from Yemen to Latin America.
''The Saudi plot was clumsy, and we got lucky,'' another American official who has reviewed the intelligence carefully said recently. ''But we are seeing increasingly sophisticated Iranian activity like it, all around the world.'' Much of this resembles the worst days of the cold war, when Americans and Soviets were plotting against each other -- and killing each other -- in a now hazy attempt to preserve an upper hand. But Iran is no superpower. And there are reasons to wonder whether, in the end, this shadow war is simply going to delay the inevitable: an Iranian bomb or, more likely, an Iranian capability to assemble a fairly crude weapon in a matter of weeks or months.
For understandable reasons, this is a question no one in the Obama administration will answer publicly. To admit that Iran may ultimately get a weapon is to admit failure; both George W. Bush and Barack Obama vowed they would never let Iran achieve nuclear arms capability, much less a bomb. Israelis have long argued that if Iran got too close, that could justify attacking Iran's nuclear sites. Reports in Israel last week suggested that such a pre-emptive attack is once again being debated.
The worries focus on renewed hints from top Israeli officials that they will act unilaterally -- even over American objections -- if they judge that Iran is getting too close to a bomb. (It is worth noting that they have made similar noises every year since 2005, save for a brief hiatus when Stuxnet -- which appears to have been a joint project of American and Israeli intelligence -- was doing its work.)
To many members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government -- and, by the accounts of his former colleagues, to the Israeli leader himself -- the Iran problem is 1939 all over again, an ''existential threat.''
''WHEN Bibi talks about an existential threat,'' one senior Israeli official said of Mr. Netanyahu recently, ''he means the kind of threat the United States believed it faced when you believed the Nazis could get the bomb.''
Israelis worry that as Iran feels more isolated by sanctions and more threatened by the Arab Spring, which has not exactly broken Tehran's way, it may view racing for a bomb as the only way to restore itself to its position as the most influential power in the Middle East. The fate of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi may strengthen that impulse.
''One should ask: would Europe have intervened in Libya if Qaddafi had possessed nuclear weapons?'' the Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak, said on army radio last week, referring to the Libyan leader's decision to give up his program in 2003. ''Would the U.S. have toppled Saddam Hussein if he had nuclear weapons?''
To many in the Obama administration, though, the Iranian threat seems more akin to 1949, when the Soviets tested their first nuclear device. That brought many confrontations that veered toward catastrophe, most notably the Cuban Missile Crisis. But ultimately the Soviets were contained. Inside the Pentagon and the National Security Council, there is a lot of work -- all of it unacknowledged -- about what a parallel containment strategy for Iran might look like.
The early elements of it are obvious: the antimissile batteries that the United States has spent billions of dollars installing on the territory of Arab allies, and a new Pentagon plan to put more ships and antimissile batteries into the Persian Gulf, in cooperation with six Arab states led by Saudi Arabia. It was the Saudi king who famously advised American diplomats in the cables revealed by WikiLeaks last year that the only Iran strategy that would work was one that ''cut off the head of the snake.''
The big hitch in these containment strategies is that they are completely useless if Iran ever slips a bomb, or even some of its newly minted uranium fuel, to a proxy -- Hezbollah, Hamas or some other terrorist group -- raising the problem of ascertaining a bomb's return address. When the Obama administration ran some tabletop exercises soon after coming to office, it was shocked to discover that the science of nuclear forensics was nowhere near as good in practice as it was on television dramas. So if a bomb went off in some American city, or in Riyadh or Tel Aviv, it could be weeks or months before it was ever identified as Iranian. Even then, confidence in the conclusion, officials say, might be too low for the president to order retaliation.
The wisdom of a containment strategy has also taken a hit since the revelation of the plot to kill the Saudi ambassador. Emerging from a classified briefing on the plot, a member of Congress said what struck him was that ''this thing could have gotten Iran into a war, and yet we don't know who ordered it.'' There is increasing talk that it could have been a rogue element within the Quds Force. If so, what does that say about whether the Iranian leadership has as good a hand on the throttle of Iran's nuclear research program as Washington has long assumed?
That issue may well come to a head this week after the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear watchdog that has been playing a cat-and-mouse game with Iran's nuclear establishment for a decade now, issues what may be one of its toughest reports ever.
IF the leaks are an accurate predictor of the final product, the report will describe in detail the evidence the I.A.E.A. has amassed suggesting that Iran has conducted tests on nuclear trigger devices, wrestled with designs that can miniaturize a nuclear device into the small confines of a warhead, and conducted abstruse experiments to spark a nuclear reaction. Most likely, the agency will stop short of accusing Iran of running a bomb program; instead, it will use the evidence to demand answers that it has long been refused about what it delicately calls ''possible military dimensions'' of the nuclear program.
Much of the work on those ''possible military dimensions'' is done, the I.A.E.A. believes, by scientists who have day jobs at Iran's major universities, including one just across the street from what is believed to be the nuclear project's administrative center. Among the scientists was Mr. Abbasi, the survivor of last November's bomb attack, who was named in 2007 to the United Nations' list of Iranian scientists subject to travel bans and economic sanctions because they were believed to be central to the bomb-development effort.
Mr. Abbasi, according to people familiar with the I.A.E.A.'s investigation, worked on calculations on increasing the yield of nuclear explosions, among other problems in manufacturing a weapon. He was a key scientist in the Iranian covert nuclear weapons program headed by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, an academic and strong supporter of Iran's nuclear weapons program. For the past decade, Mr. Fakhrizadeh has run programs -- with names like ''Project 110'' and ''Project 5,'' they seem right out of a James Bond movie -- that the West believes are a shell game hiding weapons work. Suspicions have been heightened by Iran's refusal to allow him or his colleagues to be interviewed by the United Nations' nuclear inspection teams. And since last year's attacks -- and another this past summer -- Mr. Fakhrizadeh has gone completely underground.
No one expects the United Nations' revelations of the evidence to prompt more action against Iran. Most governments have had access to this evidence for a while. The Iranians will say it is all fabrication, and because the agency will not reveal its sources, that charge could stick. The Chinese and the Russians have already protested to the I.A.E.A. head, Yukiya Amano, that revealing the evidence will harden Iran's position. They oppose any new sanctions.
While the Obama administration may act unilaterally to shut down transactions with Iran's central bank, officials concede that the only economic step that could give the mullahs pause would be a ban on Iranian oil exports. With oil already hovering around $93 a barrel, no one in the administration is willing to risk a step that could send prices soaring and, in the worst case, cause a confrontation at sea over a blockade.
For all the talk about how ''all options are on the table,'' Washington says a military strike isn't worth the risk of war; the Israelis say there may be no other choice. But they have said ''this is the last chance'' every year since 2005.
All of which raises the question: how much more delay can be bought with a covert campaign of assassination, cyberattacks and sabotage?
Some more, but probably not much. It has taken the Iranians 20 years so far to get their nuclear act together -- far longer than it took the United States and the Soviets in the '40s, the Chinese and the Israelis in the '60s, the Indians in the '70s, and the Pakistanis and the North Koreans in more recent times. The problem is partly that they were scammed by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani who sold them his country's discards.
The assassination and the sabotage have taken a psychological toll, making scientists wonder if every trip to work may be their last, every line of code the beginning of a new round of destruction. Stuxnet was devilishly ingenious: it infected millions of computers, but did damage only when the code was transferred to special controllers that run centrifuges, which spin at supersonic speed when enriching uranium. When operators looked at their screens, everything looked normal. But downstairs in the plant, the centrifuges suddenly spun out of control and exploded, like small bombs. It took months for the Iranians to figure out what had happened.
But now the element of surprise is gone. The Iranians are digging their plants deeper underground, and enriching uranium at purities that will make it easier to race for a bomb. When Barack Obama was sworn into office, they had enough fuel on hand to produce a single weapon; today, by the I.A.E.A.'s own inventory, they have enough for at least four. And as the Quds Force has shown, sabotage and assassination is a two-way game, which may ratchet up one confrontation just as Americans have been exhausted by two others.

HEADLINE: Leaving Iraq, U.S. Fears New Surge of Qaeda Terror

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and ERIC SCHMITT; Michael S. Schmidt reported from Baghdad, and Eric Schmitt from Washington. Zaid Thaker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- As the United States prepares to withdraw its troops from Iraq by year's end, senior American and Iraqi officials are expressing growing concern that Al Qaeda's offshoot here, which just a few years ago waged a debilitating insurgency that plunged the country into a civil war, is poised for a deadly resurgence.
Qaeda allies in North Africa, Somalia and Yemen are seeking to assert more influence after the death of Osama bin Laden and the diminished role of Al Qaeda's remaining top leadership in Pakistan. For its part, Al Qaeda in Iraq is striving to rebound from major defeats inflicted by Iraqi tribal groups and American troops in 2007, as well as the deaths of its two leaders in 2010.
Although the organization is certainly weaker than it was at its peak five years ago and is unlikely to regain its prior strength, American and Iraqi analysts said the Qaeda franchise is shifting its tactics and strategies -- like attacking Iraqi security forces in small squads -- to exploit gaps left by the departing American troops and to try to reignite sectarian violence in the country. 
The group, which has also been known as Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, has shown surprising resilience even as its traditional supply lines of foreign fighters through Syria have been disrupted by the turmoil in that country, American intelligence officials say. It conducts a little more than 30 attacks a week, carries out a large-scale strike every four to six weeks, and has expanded its efforts to recruit Iraqis, leading to a significant increase in the number of Iraqi-born suicide bombers.
''I cringe whenever anybody makes a pronouncement that Al Qaeda is on its last legs,'' said Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, the American military's top spokesman in Iraq. ''I think one day we are going to look around and say it's been a long time since we have heard from Al Qaeda, and maybe then we can say it is on its last legs.''
The Qaeda affiliate's nascent resurgence has helped fuel a debate between some Pentagon officials on one side, who are seeking a way to permit small numbers of American military trainers and Special Operations forces to operate in Iraq, and some White House officials on the other, who are eager to close the final chapter on a divisive eight-year war that cost the lives of more than 4,400 troops.
Iraqi analysts express fears that ties between Al Qaeda and members of the former ruling Baath Party may be re-forming. ''The government is afraid from an alliance between Qaeda and Baath precisely in this time, after the American withdrawal from Iraq,'' said Ehssan al-Shemari, a political science professor at Baghdad University. ''The security issue is the biggest challenge for the government in the next stage.''
According to General Buchanan, there are 800 to 1,000 people in Al Qaeda's Iraq network, ''from terrorists involved in operations to media to finance to fighters.'' A document released by the military in July 2010 said Al Qaeda had about 200 ''hard core'' fighters in Iraq. The weak Iraqi economy is providing a large pool of young and vulnerable recruits, analysts say.
A Defense Department official familiar with the Qaeda affiliate said that the group's leaders and foot soldiers are Sunni Arabs from central, western and northern Iraq. While some may have been affiliated with the Baath Party in Saddam Hussein's government, analysts say, they were not involved at high levels of the government or military. Foreigners make up only a small percentage of the organization's membership base.
Over the summer, the Qaeda branch in Iraq tried to ignite sectarian bloodletting with a series of coordinated attacks across the country and the execution of 22 Shiite pilgrims from the city of Karbala who were traveling through Anbar Province, an area once controlled by Al Qaeda.
In the days after the pilgrims were killed, security forces for the local government in Karbala conducted raids in Anbar, arrested several people and took them back to Karbala. The raids infuriated local leaders in Anbar, who threatened to respond with violence. But the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki frantically intervened. The acting defense secretary traveled to Anbar to meet with local leaders, and ultimately one of the local leaders threatened a lawsuit, a once unthinkable way of resolving a dispute in Iraq.
The Maliki government's ability to tamp down the tensions encouraged many Iraqi and American officials that the Iraqis would be able to defuse sectarian tensions without the Americans looking over their shoulders.
The raids underscored the group's shifting tactics. The Qaeda affiliate here ''has eschewed efforts to control territory and impose governance -- initiatives that left it extremely vulnerable to counterinsurgency techniques -- and adopted a more traditional terrorist model built on an underground organization and occasional large-scale attacks,'' according to a study in August by Brian Fishman, a counterterrorism analyst at the New America Foundation, a nonpartisan research group.
Although the United States is withdrawing all but a handful of its remaining 33,000 troops, leaving a few to guard the American Embassy, both governments are discussing a continuing military partnership. Among the main American goals is for the Iraqi government to approve a contingent of American Special Forces that would train and assist Iraqi security forces, according to two American officials
The White House announced Friday that President Obama will meet with Mr. Maliki on Dec. 12 to discuss the continuing ''strategic partnership'' between the United States and Iraq.
Senior American officials say that intelligence sharing between American and Iraqi forces, which officials from both countries credit with reducing the number of attacks by half over the past two years, will be significantly diminished after the troops leave.
The officials are particularly concerned about the nighttime abilities of the Iraqi special forces, who relied on the Americans for intelligence on the location of insurgents, helicopter transportation and other counterterrorism missions at night.
''It won't be as clean as when we were helping them do it,'' said an American official who was briefed on Middle Eastern militaries. ''You will probably have raids go wrong, wrong house, wrong target. It is not like Al Qaeda will have a free hand to do whatever it wants. But the Iraqis will do things that we would have advised them not to do,'' and their ability to target insurgents will be reduced, the official said.
As the support from the American military is waning, the State Department, which will have a big presence in Iraq in years to come, is increasing its efforts to help the Iraqis target Al Qaeda.
Last month, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton designated the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri, as a special global terrorist and posted a $10 million reward for information on his whereabouts. Few Iraqis had heard of Mr. Badri, but he was among the first terrorists to eulogize Osama bin Laden after he was killed in May, and he pledged to conduct 100 attacks in Iraq to avenge Bin Laden's death. Mr. Badri, also known as Abu Dua, has kept a low profile since assuming control of the group after raids last April killed the organization's previous two leaders.
Al Qaeda in Iraq has focused its attacks on Iraqi security forces, but senior American officials have also expressed fears that the group may export its violence. In May, two Iraqi refugees living in Bowling Green, Ky., were charged with trying to send sniper rifles, Stinger missiles and money to the Qaeda affiliate in their home country. Neither of the men, Waad Ramadan Alwan, 30, and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, 23, was charged with plotting attacks within the United States. A federal sting operation prevented the weapons and money from going to Iraq.
The new director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Matthew G. Olsen, warned in testimony to Congress last month that Al Qaeda in Iraq was increasingly likely to attempt attacks outside the country. He cited a video the group released in January calling on individuals to attack students and infrastructure in the West.

HEADLINE: Telling Americans To Vote, or Else

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. GALSTON. 
A senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

 BODY:
Washington
JURY duty is mandatory; why not voting? The idea seems vaguely un-American. Maybe so, but it's neither unusual nor undemocratic. And it would ease the intense partisan polarization that weakens our capacity for self-government and public trust in our governing institutions.
Thirty-one countries have some form of mandatory voting, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. The list includes nine members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and two-thirds of the Latin American nations. More than half back up the legal requirement with an enforcement mechanism, while the rest are content to rely on the moral force of the law. 
Despite the prevalence of mandatory voting in so many democracies, it's easy to dismiss the practice as a form of statism that couldn't work in America's individualistic and libertarian political culture. But consider Australia, whose political culture is closer to that of the United States than that of any other English-speaking country. Alarmed by a decline in voter turnout to less than 60 percent in 1922, Australia adopted mandatory voting in 1924, backed by small fines (roughly the size of traffic tickets) for nonvoting, rising with repeated acts of nonparticipation. The law established permissible reasons for not voting, like illness and foreign travel, and allows citizens who faced fines for not voting to defend themselves.
The results were remarkable. In the 1925 election, the first held under the new law, turnout soared to 91 percent. In recent elections, it has hovered around 95 percent. The law also changed civic norms. Australians are more likely than before to see voting as an obligation. The negative side effects many feared did not materialize. For example, the percentage of ballots intentionally spoiled or completed randomly as acts of resistance remained on the order of 2 to 3 percent.
Proponents offer three reasons in favor of mandatory voting. The first is straightforwardly civic. A democracy can't be strong if its citizenship is weak. And right now American citizenship is attenuated -- strong on rights, weak on responsibilities. There is less and less that being a citizen requires of us, especially after the abolition of the draft. Requiring people to vote in national elections once every two years would reinforce the principle of reciprocity at the heart of citizenship.
The second argument for mandatory voting is democratic. Ideally, a democracy will take into account the interests and views of all citizens. But if some regularly vote while others don't, officials are likely to give greater weight to participants. This might not matter much if nonparticipants were evenly distributed through the population. But political scientists have long known that they aren't. People with lower levels of income and education are less likely to vote, as are young adults and recent first-generation immigrants.
Changes in our political system have magnified these disparities. During the 1950s and '60s, when turnout rates were much higher, political parties reached out to citizens year-round. At the local level these parties, which reformers often criticized as ''machines,'' connected even citizens of modest means and limited education with neighborhood institutions and gave them a sense of participation in national politics as well. (In its heyday, organized labor reinforced these effects.) But in the absence of these more organic forms of political mobilization, the second-best option is a top-down mechanism of universal mobilization.
Mandatory voting would tend to even out disparities stemming from income, education and age, enhancing our system's inclusiveness. It is true, as some object, that an enforcement mechanism would impose greater burdens on those with fewer resources. But this makes it all the more likely that these citizens would respond by going to the polls, and they would stand to gain far more than the cost of a traffic ticket.
The third argument for mandatory voting goes to the heart of our current ills. Our low turnout rate pushes American politics toward increased polarization. The reason is that hard-core partisans are more likely to dominate lower-turnout elections, while those who are less fervent about specific issues and less attached to political organizations tend not to participate at levels proportional to their share of the electorate.
A distinctive feature of our constitutional system -- elections that are quadrennial for president but biennial for the House of Representatives -- magnifies these effects. It's bad enough that only three-fifths of the electorate turns out to determine the next president, but much worse that only two-fifths of our citizens vote in House elections two years later. If events combine to energize one part of the political spectrum and dishearten the other, a relatively small portion of the electorate can shift the system out of all proportion to its numbers.
Some observers are comfortable with this asymmetry. But if you think that today's intensely polarized politics impedes governance and exacerbates mistrust -- and that is what most Americans firmly (and in my view rightly) believe -- then you should be willing to consider reforms that would strengthen the forces of conciliation.
Imagine our politics with laws and civic norms that yield near-universal voting. Campaigns could devote far less money to costly, labor-intensive get-out-the-vote efforts. Media gurus wouldn't have the same incentive to drive down turnout with negative advertising. Candidates would know that they must do more than mobilize their bases with red-meat rhetoric on hot-button issues. Such a system would improve not only electoral politics but also the legislative process. Rather than focusing on symbolic gestures whose major purpose is to agitate partisans, Congress might actually roll up its sleeves and tackle the serious, complex issues it ignores.
THE United States is not Australia, of course, and there's no guarantee that the similarity of our political cultures would produce equivalent political results. For example, reforms of general elections would leave untouched the distortions generated by party primaries in which small numbers of voters can shape the choices for the entire electorate. And the United States Constitution gives the states enormous power over voting procedures. Mandating voting nationwide would go counter to our traditions (and perhaps our Constitution) and would encounter strong state opposition. Instead, a half-dozen states from parts of the country with different civic traditions should experiment with the practice, and observers -- journalists, social scientists, citizens' groups and elected officials -- would monitor the consequences.
We don't know what the outcome would be. But one thing is clear: If we do nothing and allow a politics of passion to define the bounds of the electorate, as it has for much of the last four decades, the prospect for a less polarized, more effective political system that enjoys the trust and confidence of the people is not bright.

HEADLINE: Is the Era of the Motorcycle Over?

BYLINE: By FREDERICK SEIDEL. 
The author of the poetry collections ''Ooga-Booga'' and, most recently, ''Poems, 1959-2009.''

 BODY:
ARE motorcycles passe? Are they sort of over? I ask as a rider of two-wheel Italian beauties that go very fast, gracefully streamlined subsonic technology from the Ducati factory in Bologna. I own two sport bikes and two racers. I ride racing motorcycles on the street. One of my motorcycles is capable of nearly 200 miles an hour. I write prose about motorcycles. I write poems about motorcycles.
So I ask with some authority. Are motorcycles -- even superb and lovely Italian motorcycles from the land of Donatello and Bertolucci -- being replaced as love objects, as arm candy, by other more contemporary show-off desirables? 
Electronic ones. Mostly made by Apple.
The iPhone 4S, the iPad 2, the 11-inch and 13-inch thin, light MacBook Air computers -- these are the sleek gorgeousness young people go on about, have to have, and do have, in the millions. These machines, famous for the svelte dignity of their designs -- and of course, far less expensive than a motorcycle -- are a lens to see the world through and to do your work on. It's their operating speeds that thrill. Young people cut a bella figura on their electronic devices.
Now, of course, it is not just the young who buy Apple products. I lay emphasis on the young, particularly young men, because they are the ones who might otherwise be buying motorcycles, and aren't, at least not at all in the numbers they did before the economic downturn. The great recession was disastrous for motorcycle sales around the country, especially, it seems, for sport bikes, the ones that perform with brio but have no practical point to make. In other words, they are not bikes to tour on, they are not a comfortable way for you and a companion -- wife or partner or friend -- to travel to work or to a distant campground. You can do it, but it's not ideal. Young riders were not buying motorcycles of any kind, and especially, it seems, not sport bikes.
Or, to say it another way, it's as if the recession induced a coma in all the potential new motorcyclists, and in so many of the already experienced motorcyclists, from which they woke changed, changed utterly, and found themselves standing in line outside an Apple store, patiently waiting to buy the latest greatness.
They are buying a slice of what Apple does -- and how it does it -- and how it looks doing it. They are buying function but, just as important, they are buying glamour. The device enhances the buyer's sense of self. It helps the person think and at the same time not think. Once, not so long ago, motorcycles did the same thing.
In a few days, at the International Motorcycle Show in Milan, Ducati will introduce a radically new sport bike called the Panigale, after Borgo Panigale, the neighborhood on the outskirts of Bologna where the Ducati factory is. The Ducati people are being secretive about how the Panigale will look and how it will perform. But there have been spy photos of the bike being tested on the Mugello circuit, with the former World Superbike champion Troy Bayliss aboard, and plenty of rumors and speculation about the tech specs.
We know this much. It will make brave hearts beat faster. It will weigh less than its predecessor. It will have a new sort of frame. It will have an ingenious new exhaust system. It will handle. It will be fast. It will be beautiful. How many Ducati followers -- the Ducatisti -- will have to have one? Some.
Oh, for the days -- not so long ago -- when a boy's world would have fallen to its knees before a new Ducati design.
In Dallas, at Advanced Motorsports, his motorcycle dealership, Jeff Nash, a gentleman and one of the great Ducati racebike tuners in America, and a racer himself, deplores the passivity of the young who would rather be home with their iPads playing computer games than astride the red-meat lightning of an 1198 Superbike blazing down a Texas highway making that unmistakable growling deep Ducati sound. Mr. Nash would go further.
Better to be out in the air astride just about any motorcycle alive!

HEADLINE: A Tradition of Giving, From the Famous and the Unknown

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
The language of that first appeal in The New York Times was somewhat florid by today's standards, but it packed the desired punch. ''Fathoms deep beneath the exhilaration and joyousness of Christmas,'' it began, ''there is a world of desolation and hunger which few of the dwellers in light and air have had time or chance to realize.''
The headline, rendered in capital letters on the front of the Sunday magazine, had the resonance of a different age, as well: ''SANTA CLAUS, PLEASE TAKE NOTICE! HERE ARE NEW YORK'S 100 NEEDIEST CASES.'' But it, too, delivered a clear message.
Case No. 1 was a frills-free account of a family beset by tuberculosis, the father declared insane and the mother struggling to hold things together on $5 a week. Case No. 68 told of a 12-year-old girl who, upon her mother's death, had to take care of her ''shiftless father and a large family of brothers and sisters.'' 
One after another, the stories unfolded -- of families devastated by poverty or illness or death, of children forced prematurely to assume the burdens of adulthood -- all the way to Case No. 100, about an elderly widow in poor health whose four children ''lack for food and clothing.''
That quorum of misery on Dec. 15, 1912, was the birth of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, a campaign that enters its 100th year on Sunday and continues until early 2012. Through good times and bad, the fund's mission has not wavered, and its essentiality is underlined in the present economy, mired in a long slump.
As the story goes, the seed for the annual appeal was planted on Christmas Day 1911, when the newspaper's publisher, Adolph S. Ochs, took a walk after polishing off a turkey dinner. He happened upon a man who was down on his luck, and gave him a few dollars.
That encounter put the publisher in a reflective mood about the nature of charity. Helping a stranger had given himself a sense of satisfaction. Might that feeling, he wondered, be the basis for a city's good will?
Mr. Ochs tested out this thought the next year by sending a reporter to private welfare agencies in New York to gather stories about the poor. He believed that a collection of short articles -- without figurative violins playing in the background -- could stir charitable impulses.
Looking back, it is clear that his theory was borne out. People have been moved to ease one another's pain through a campaign whose scale has vastly changed across the decades. The first appeal motivated 117 contributors to send in a total of $3,630.88, roughly equivalent to $81,000 in today's dollars. The 2010-11 campaign drew 10,457 gifts worth $6,061,024.
Altogether over the years, the Neediest Cases Fund has inspired 1,106,842 donors to give $194,538,024.42. A special 9/11 Neediest Cases Fund created in 2001 after the terrorist attacks generated 66,717 gifts worth $62,383,112.24.
''We're aware of many campaigns like this that other newspapers run, but we're not aware of any that preceded this one,'' said Michael Golden, president of the Neediest Cases Fund. ''It's become a civic obligation to us and one the paper is proud of.''
The nature of need may have changed -- tuberculosis is no longer a scourge -- but poverty is eternal. In New York City, census figures show, 20 percent of the population, or more than 1.6 million people, live below the federal poverty line.
With times as bad as they are, it is not just the destitute who can use a helping hand.
''We're getting more middle-class people requesting assistance,'' said Desiree L. Dancy, vice president of the Neediest Cases Fund. ''These would be people who for the very first time in their lives are asking for help.''
The fund works with seven agencies that provide the actual assistance. The Times covers administrative costs. These agencies have been partners in this endeavor for decades, some from the very beginning. They are Brooklyn Community Services, Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, the Children's Aid Society, the Community Service Society of New York, the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies and UJA-Federation of New York.
They help people like Alfredo Santiago, whose vision started to fail in the early 1990s. At the urging of friends, Mr. Santiago began an art therapy class with assistance from UJA-Federation. Now, his artwork, which has been exhibited in galleries, is a source of income. The fund went far to make that possible. ''I didn't even think I would get to this point myself,'' he said.
Over the years, there have been notable milestones. Annual contributions crossed the million-dollar threshold in 1970. In 2002, the millionth gift arrived: $100 from Jim and Lore Herrmann of Forest Hills, Queens, regular contributors who fled the Nazis in the 1930s.
In terms of dollars, the high point was reached in 2001, with contributions of nearly $9.8 million. Individual gifts peaked at 17,238 in 1968. That figure has been hard to top, lately more than ever.
For the 100th campaign, Mr. Golden said, every dollar that is received above last year's total of slightly more than $6 million will be matched with a 50-cent contribution from the fund's endowment. That special contribution will be capped at $1 million, he said.
Who donates to the campaign? Typically, Ms. Dancy said, people who ''place New York near and dear to their hearts.''
They have included plenty of famous people, among them Paul McCartney, John McEnroe, E. L. Doctorow, Alan Alda and Barbara Walters. Paul Newman, who died in 2008, was uncommonly generous, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars in profits from his Newman's Own line of food products. But at the heart of the appeal are people whose names never appear in boldface: a boy who gives a dollar that he earned shoveling snow; a woman who sends a check equivalent to what she saved from having quit smoking; fourth graders who donate the dollars they made doing odd jobs.
One of the more unusual gifts came in 1989 from Allen Meltzer, then an inmate at the Allenwood federal prison in Pennsylvania. His contribution: 50 cents. ''This is all I am able to send at this time,'' he wrote. ''I hope someone will at least get a hot bowl of soup out of it.'' (Mr. Meltzer, convicted of a drug charge, was released in 1992.)
Then there are people like Fred Jacobson of Manhattan. He has been a steady contributor since his graduation from Yale University in 1960.
Over the past half-century, ''almost every aspect of our way of life has changed,'' Mr. Jacobson said in a handwritten note accompanying his gift last year of $250.
''But the need to support those less fortunate,'' he said, ''is unchanging.''

HEADLINE: Can Egypt Overcome Its P.R. Problem?

BYLINE: By JOSHUA HAMMER

 BODY:
WHEN the Arab Spring spread to Egypt on Jan. 25, culminating in the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak 17 days later, it brought an electrifying sense of achievement and -- as travelers and tour operators know all too well -- an unwelcome side effect: the crippling of Egypt's tourism industry, the country's major source of revenue and jobs.
A total of 14.8 million tourists came to Egypt last year, feeding $13 billion into the economy. But the number of visitors fell by 80 percent in the first month after the revolution, and the industry will probably finish this year down 25 percent, according to the tourism ministry. That is a loss of more than $3 billion.
''We canceled all of our departures for the spring,'' said Tom Armstrong, the director of communications for Tauck Tours, which normally runs a dozen high-end trips to Egypt annually. Now, with the high season just beginning, ''business is coming back, but it's not back to what we've enjoyed historically,'' he said. 
''In the long term we're optimistic,'' he added, noting that the government's ''aggressive'' promotion has helped restore a measure of confidence.
Those efforts have included TV advertising, news media junkets and a marketing push at tourist fairs in Europe, the United States and elsewhere. Mounir Fakhri Abdel Nour, the minister of tourism and former head of Egypt's largest opposition party, said he spent much of last spring and summer ''doing everything feasible to bring back the tourists,'' including appearances throughout the Middle East and Europe to spread the word that the country is safe. A lobbying campaign succeeded in getting the southern Egyptian city of Aswan selected as the host last month of the World Tourism Day ceremony, an important industry event.
''Not a single tourist has been hurt, or had any problem since the 25th of January,'' Mr. Abdel Nour said. In the midst of the revolution, banners in Tahrir Square, he said, ''were asking tourists not to leave, and promising that they will be protected, which tells you to what extent Egyptians value tourism.''
In the United States, tour companies like Abercrombie & Kent say they are seeing an increase in interest, particularly among first timers taking advantage of low prices, politically aware travelers who wish to show support for Egyptian democracy and returnees interested in exploring newly accessible sites like the Avenue of the Sphinxes in Luxor, a 1.7-mile path linking the Temple of Luxor with the Temple of Karnak, scheduled to be fully renovated this fall.
Abercrombie & Kent ran all nine of its scheduled tours in Egypt in October. All were at close to their capacity of 20 to 24 people each, said Pamela Lassers, the company's media-relations director. Dozens of tours scheduled through New Year's 2012 are nearly full, she said, and the company has added two new departures next year for its family tour ''Pyramids, Mummies and Temples.''
Tauck and Abercrombie & Kent have filled their Facebook pages with testimonials from recent visitors to Egypt, many of whom cite the absence of the usual crush at the Pyramids, the Sphinx and the Egyptian Museum; and the ''optimistic spirit'' and ''good mood'' of the people. ''Right now is a great time to visit,'' a visitor wrote in September. ''It's not crowded and there are incredible deals out there.''
Abercrombie & Kent guides have begun incorporating recent events into their itineraries. ''There are lots of people who want to see the effects of the revolution,'' Ms. Lasser said.
Yet assuring travelers that Egypt is safe can be a challenge. Recent events have shown that the rebound of the tourism industry will depend on political stability, which remains elusive. In late June, clashes between protesters and the police around Tahrir Square left hundreds of people injured. In September, the killings of five Egyptian security officers by Israeli forces in the aftermath of a militant attack on the Egypt-Israel border touched off a mob assault on the Israeli Embassy in Cairo. Three Egyptians were killed and more than 1,000 were injured. And last month, 24 Coptic Christians were run over by military vehicles or shot dead during a protest in Cairo.
Rami Girgis, Abercrombie & Kent's product manager for Egypt and North Africa, who just returned from Cairo, said, ''The security forces are visible everywhere, not only tourist police, but the army.''
EVEN so, Mr. Armstrong of Tauck said that clients ''are calling, expressing interest mixed with a little bit of concern'' that protests or other disturbances could disrupt opening hours or force some museums and sites to close.
Some tourism officials and tour operators are promoting Alexandria, which saw Coptic protests in October but nothing close to the violence of Cairo, as a safer bet. The Mediterranean city, founded by Alexander the Great in 331 B.C., has never been a big draw for modern Westerners. Preservationists and the Egyptian government have been trying to change that in recent years.
In 2002, the new Library of Alexandria opened on the Corniche near the site of its predecessor, which was built in the third century B.C. and burned during Caesar's siege in 48 B.C. The library, a huge glass-and-steel disc that slopes sharply toward the Mediterranean Sea, has won accolades for its ambitious design and innovations like the Espresso Book Machine, which can reproduce almost any volume, complete with color covers and glue bindings, in minutes.
City officials are also planning for the world's first underwater museum, which would offer glimpses of sphinxes, ancient shipwrecks and fragments believed to be from the Pharaos of Alexandria lighthouse, one of the seven ancient wonders of the world.
Sarah Nabil, public relations manager for the Four Seasons Hotel Alexandria, said the city had been preparing for a major influx of Western and Middle Eastern tourists before the revolution. ''It was supposed to be starting this year, and of course it didn't happen,'' she said.
First came the deadly New Year's Day bombing of Saints Church by radical Islamists affiliated with Al Qaeda. Then the revolution hit. As in Cairo, the police withdrew and prisoners escaped en masse; violent clashes erupted. Tourists fled the city and, except for Arab and North African visitors, they have largely stayed away.
Ms. Nabil said that citywide plans to upgrade hotels and restaurants are on hold. ''The city was starting to be on a higher level, and that's all been delayed,'' she said.
Everyone in Egypt, from Ms. Nabil to the protesters in Tahrir Square to government officials, depend on foreign visitors thinking of Egypt as a safe place. So far, that has been as much of a challenge as establishing a full-fledged democracy.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Nov. 6 about the effect of the uprising in Egypt and its aftermath on tourism there misstated part of the history of the Library of Alexandria, built in the third century B.C. The library was burned during Caesar's siege in 48 B.C., though the amount of damage is unknown. It was not burned by the Romans in 30 B.C.

HEADLINE: Wanted: Worldly Philosophers

BYLINE: By ROGER E. BACKHOUSE and BRADLEY W. BATEMAN. 
Roger E. Backhouse, a professor of economic history at the University of Birmingham, and Bradley W. Bateman, a professor of economics at Denison University, are the authors of ''Capitalist Revolutionary: John Maynard Keynes.''

 BODY:
IT'S become commonplace to criticize the ''Occupy'' movement for failing to offer an alternative vision. But the thousands of activists in the streets of New York and London aren't the only ones lacking perspective: economists, to whom we might expect to turn for such vision, have long since given up thinking in terms of economic systems -- and we are all the worse for it.
This wasn't always the case. Course lists from economics departments used to be filled with offerings in ''comparative economic systems,'' contrasting capitalism and socialism or comparing the French, Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon models of capitalism. 
Such courses arose in the context of the cold war, when the battle with the Soviet Union was about showing that our system was better than theirs. But with the demise of the Soviet Union, that motivation disappeared. Globalization, so it is claimed, has created a single system of capitalism driven by international competition (ignoring the very real differences between, say, China and the United States). We now have an economics profession that hardly ever discusses its fundamental subject, ''capitalism.''
Many economists say that what matters are questions like whether markets are competitive or monopolistic, or how monetary policy works. Using broad, ill-defined notions like capitalism invites ideological grandstanding and distracts from the hard technical problems.
There is a lot in that argument. Economists do much better when they tackle small, well-defined problems. As John Maynard Keynes put it, economists should become more like dentists: modest people who look at a small part of the body but remove a lot of pain.
However, there are also downsides to approaching economics as a dentist would: above all, the loss of any vision about what the economic system should look like. Even Keynes himself was driven by a powerful vision of capitalism. He believed it was the only system that could create prosperity, but it was also inherently unstable and so in need of constant reform. This vision caught the imagination of a generation that had experienced the Great Depression and World War II and helped drive policy for nearly half a century. He was, as the economist Robert Heilbroner claimed, a ''worldly philosopher,'' alongside such economic visionaries as Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx.
In the 20th century, the main challenge to Keynes's vision came from economists like Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, who envisioned an ideal economy involving isolated individuals bargaining with one another in free markets. Government, they contended, usually messes things up. Overtaking a Keynesianism that many found inadequate to the task of tackling the stagflation of the 1970s, this vision fueled neoliberal and free-market conservative agendas of governments around the world.
THAT vision has in turn been undermined by the current crisis. It took extensive government action to prevent another Great Depression, while the enormous rewards received by bankers at the heart of the meltdown have led many to ask whether unfettered capitalism produced an equitable distribution of wealth. We clearly need a new, alternative vision of capitalism. But thanks to decades of academic training in the ''dentistry'' approach to economics, today's Keynes or Friedman is nowhere to be found.
Another downside to the ''dentistry'' approach to economics is that important pieces of human experience can easily fall from sight. The government does not cut an abstract entity called ''government spending'' but numerous spending programs, from veterans' benefits and homeland security to Medicare and Medicaid. To refuse to discuss ideas such as types of capitalism deprives us of language with which to think about these problems. It makes it easier to stop thinking about what the economic system is for and in whose interests it is working.
Perhaps the protesters occupying Wall Street are not so misguided after all. The questions they raise -- how do we deal with the local costs of global downturns? Is it fair that those who suffer the most from such downturns have their safety net cut, while those who generate the volatility are bailed out by the government? -- are the same ones that a big-picture economic vision should address. If economists want to help create a better world, they first have to ask, and try to answer, the hard questions that can shape a new vision of capitalism's potential.

HEADLINE: In State Care, 1,200 Deaths and Few Answers

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
For James Michael Taylor, an evening bath became a death sentence.
Mr. Taylor, who was 41 and a quadriplegic, had little more ability than a newborn baby to lift his head. Bathing him required the constant attention of a staff member at the group home for the developmentally disabled where he lived, near Schenectady, N.Y.
One summer night in 2005, a worker lowered Mr. Taylor into the tub, turned on the water and left the room. Over the next 15 minutes, the water slowly rose over his head. He drowned before anyone returned.
Joan Taylor, his mother, remembers the words her husband said as dirt was shoveled onto their son's grave. 
''This is the last time they're going to dump on you,'' he told his dead son.
James Taylor's death was no aberration.
In New York, it is unusually common for developmentally disabled people in state care to die for reasons other than natural causes.
One in six of all deaths in state and privately run homes, or more than 1,200 in the past decade, have been attributed to either unnatural or unknown causes, according to data obtained by The New York Times that has never been released.
The figure is more like one in 25 in Connecticut and Massachusetts, which are among the few states that release such data.
What's more, New York has made little effort to track or thoroughly investigate the deaths to look for troubling trends, resulting in the same kinds of errors and preventable deaths, over and over.
The state does not even collect statistics on specific causes of death, leaving many designated as ''unknown,'' sometimes even after a medical examiner has made a ruling.
The Times undertook its own analysis of death records and found disturbing patterns: some residents who were not supposed to be left alone with food choked in bathrooms and kitchens. Others who needed help on stairs tumbled alone to their deaths. Still others ran away again and again until they were found dead.
Mr. Taylor was hardly the only resident to drown in a bathtub. Another developmentally disabled man at a house run by the same nonprofit organization drowned in a tub four months earlier.
Through a Freedom of Information request to the State Commission on Quality of Care and Advocacy for Persons With Disabilities, The Times obtained data for all 7,118 cases of developmentally disabled people -- those with conditions like cerebral palsy, autism and Down syndrome -- who died while in state care over the past decade.
The data from the agency, which is responsible for overseeing treatment for the developmentally disabled, included only the broad ''manner'' in which people died -- by homicide or suicide, accidents or natural causes.
By far the biggest category, other than natural causes, was ''unknown,'' accounting for 10 percent of all deaths in the system.
The records suggested problems in care may be contributing to those unexplained deaths. The average age of those who died of unknown causes was 40, while the average age of residents dying of natural causes was 54.
The Times reviewed the case files of all the deaths not resulting from natural causes that the commission investigated over the past decade and found there had been concerns about the quality of care in nearly half of the 222 cases.
The records also showed that problems leading to deaths rarely resulted in systemwide steps, like alerts to all operators of homes, to prevent mistakes from recurring. Responses were typically limited to the group home where a resident died.
At homes operated by nonprofit organizations, low-level employees were often fired or disciplined, but repercussions for executives were rare. At state-run homes, it is also difficult to take action against caregivers, who are represented by unions that contest disciplinary measures.
New York relies heavily on the operators of the homes to investigate and determine how a person in their care died and, in a vast majority of cases, accepts that determination. And the state has no uniform training for the nearly 100,000 workers at thousands of state and privately run homes and institutions.
The value of analyzing death records for problems in care that could be prevented through alerts or training has been well established, and is encouraged by the federal Government Accountability Office.Officials in Connecticut, for example, noticed four choking deaths in 2006, the first year the state published such data. They developed a statewide program -- two days of initial training and a refresher course every two years thereafter. The state has had just one choking death since 2007. New York has had at least 21 during that same period.
''It's incredibly important,'' said Terrence W. Macy, commissioner of the Department of Developmental Services in Connecticut. ''If everybody knows you study it this hard and you have this level of detail, it's going to have an impact.''
There is no question that it can be extremely challenging to care for the developmentally disabled, a population that includes some people who are fragile and immobile and others who are unruly and inclined toward violence. But the problems in the New York system appear especially troubling given that the state spends $10 billion a year caring for the developmentally disabled -- more than California, Texas, Florida and Illinois combined -- while providing services to fewer than half as many people as those states do.
Lawsuits are relatively rare after the deaths of developmentally disabled people in New York, in part because economic damages are difficult to prove, given that the victims are seldom employed. And sometimes families are simply grateful to the group home for years of care for their relative.
This year, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo forced the commissioners of the two agencies that oversee the developmentally disabled to resign amid a Times investigation of group home workers who were beating and abusing residents.
In interviews, the officials who replaced them acknowledged problems with how the state tracks and seeks to prevent untimely deaths.
Courtney Burke, the commissioner of the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities, which operates and oversees thousands of group homes, acknowledged that her agency suffered from a lack of transparency and what she called ''a culture of nonreporting.''
''One of the things I'm seeking to do,'' she said last month, ''is have better data on those deaths.''
A Recurring Problem
One evening last year, a large piece of London broil was left marinating in the refrigerator of a state-run group home in the hamlet of Golden's Bridge, in Westchester County.
The kitchen was supposed to be locked overnight. As in many homes for the developmentally disabled, residents known to be at risk for choking were not allowed to be left alone with food. But the kitchen was open during the early morning of June 5, 2010. No one noticed as Cynthia Dupas left her bedroom, opened the refrigerator and bit off a chunk of raw beef. She collapsed outside her bedroom and died. She was 51.
Hers was hardly an isolated case. A quarter of the 222 death files reviewed by The Times involved a person choking to death. And given the state's poor recordkeeping, the actual number of choking deaths is likely larger. The deaths often occur when residents try to eat food too quickly; physical limitations also play a role. Some of the fatalities came in quick succession:
At a home near the Finger Lakes in 2001, a resident died after stuffing down a steak that was left on the kitchen counter after dinner, in violation of safety guidelines for several residents.
Four months later, Maxwell Chanels died at a Schenectady-area group home after being left alone to eat a steak. A nonprofit group that cared for Mr. Chanels during the day had determined he was a choking risk who required mealtime supervision, but a second nonprofit agency that ran the group home where he lived had no such protections in place. He was 66.
Less than two weeks later, Virgil Macro was served a breakfast that had not been prepared according to a meal plan devised to keep him from choking. Staff members at his Dutchess County group home also failed to supervise him while he ate. He was 39.
In each case, the response suggested by the Commission on Quality of Care was mostly limited to the place where the death occurred. Workers who made mistakes were disciplined. Some employees in the home, or the local area, were retrained.
But other states take broader action.
In 2006, Ohio officials recognized an increase in choking deaths and issued a statewide alert.
A year later, California officials noticed a similar rise in one part of the state and began an educational program that reduced deaths.
A lack of standards and accepted definitions of basic terms also leads to deadly confusion.
Terms like ''bite-size'' and ''chopped,'' which are key to defining what is safe for a person to eat, can be left open to interpretation by the staff at a given institution or group home.
The Commission on Quality of Care regularly asks individual homes to revisit those definitions, but the state has not resolved varying interpretations.
In contrast, Connecticut's training materials, which the state credits with sharply reducing choking deaths, precisely define such terms with photographs and dimensions.
State officials in New York cannot even agree on how many people are dying. The Office for People With Developmental Disabilities says 933 people in state care died in 2009. The Commission on Quality of Care says 757 did. Neither agency could explain the discrepancy.
Outside experts said they were particularly puzzled that records maintained by the state would list the cause as ''unknown'' in more than 700 deaths over the past decade, and wondered how hard state officials had tried to determine what happened.
Bruce Simmons was one of the many people the state had listed as dead of unknown causes. But a review of the records from the state's own investigation reveals what occurred. He lived in a group home in Cortland, N.Y., which kept him under tight supervision around food because of his history of stealing food and choking. But the nonprofit group that took care of him during the day decided that was not necessary, and he choked to death in November 2008. He was 52.
Lapses in Fire Safety
All that is left of the house at 1534 State Route 30 in the Adirondack town of Wells is a grassy field and an empty driveway.
More than two and a half years ago, the house, home to nine developmentally disabled residents, burned to the ground, killing four of them.
The fire revealed shortcomings in staff training and safety standards. And the home's evacuation plans were based on unrealistic expectations that developmentally disabled residents would be able to flee in an emergency.
Large institutions for the developmentally disabled are built much like hospitals, with extensive fire safety measures. The group home had some safety features, like sprinklers in parts of the house, but was permitted to meet building codes akin to those of homes with able-bodied residents who know they should flee from a fire.
Yet though the Wells fire took place in March 2009, the state has not undertaken a broad review of whether group homes, which now care for a vast majority of the state's developmentally disabled, have appropriate safety modifications to protect residents who often do not understand that they are in danger.
The fire at the house, known as Riverview, occurred in the early morning, starting in a trash can on a screen porch and spreading rapidly up vinyl siding into the attic of the L-shaped, one-story residence.
An automatic alarm call was made at 5:25 a.m. to a monitoring company. The protocol established by the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities required that the company call the group home before notifying the Fire Department, which wasted minutes and violated state fire standards. By 5:30, the local fire company was dispatched, alerting Ken Hoffman, a firefighter who lived across the street and rushed over to help.
When Mr. Hoffman arrived, all nine residents were still inside, but he and two staff members helped most of them evacuate. Then one resident fell, distracting the two staff members as three residents wandered back into the burning house, according to state records.
There were further complications. The state had not informed local fire officials about the presence of the group home, leaving them ill prepared.
''There was no contact,'' said Peter Byrne, a Rockland County fire safety official who was on the panel of experts convened by the state after the fire. ''If I roll into a single-family dwelling at 2 or 3 in the morning, I'm expecting mom, dad and 2.3 kids, whatever the average is, not 11 challenged individuals.''
Credible investigations were performed -- one by a local grand jury, one by the State Office of Fire Prevention and Control, and another by the panel that included Mr. Byrne.
But a follow-up review undertaken by the two agencies most responsible for the developmentally disabled -- the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities and the Commission on Quality of Care -- included questions like whether residents' day-to-day medical care needs were being met.
The questions ''were not germane to the fundamental questions posed by the Wells fire -- what was the cause of the fire and what can we do in the future to prevent such fires from occurring in such a tragic manner,'' Roger Bearden, the new head of the commission, said in an interview.
Like most group homes in New York, the Riverview house was required to meet residential building codes, which are less than stringent.
There were no sprinklers in the attic at the house, or on the screen porch where the fire started. Records showed that the building's original plans required fire retardant materials on the porch ceiling and that a planned barrier wall in the attic was abandoned during construction.
While the house was required to meet standards from the National Fire Protection Association, an interview with a top association official suggests that while the standards are open to interpretation, the house could have been more robustly protected.
''There's been an unresolved question about why a sprinkler wasn't provided on that porch area,'' said Robert E. Solomon, a fire safety expert at the association who served on the state panel.
''Our standards would have probably put a sprinkler on that porch area where that fire occurred,'' he said, which could have prevented the fire from spreading.
The Riverview case also underscores widespread problems in how fire drills at group homes have been conducted. The Times reported in March that a whistle-blower warned a senior state official in 2008 that drill records were being routinely faked or implausibly speedy evacuation times were being claimed. State investigators found that was the case at the Riverview house.
The staff also seemed unprepared; time was spent battling the fire with an extinguisher instead of evacuating residents. The grand jury convened by the district attorney of Hamilton County noted that fires were common in group homes, adding, ''It would be a grave mistake to view Riverview's tragedy as an isolated incident.''
Some steps have been taken since the fire: tighter rules guiding new construction, bringing in outside supervisors for fire drills and outside experts for inspections. But Ms. Burke's agency did not say when it would review whether other homes in the system might also be lacking fire safety features sufficient enough for developmentally disabled residents.
After several weeks of inquiries from The Times, Ms. Burke said she would reconvene the state panel that investigated the fire. Mr. Hoffman said he could not shake the memory of the fire.
''It's still something that comes back to my mind on a weekly basis,'' he said. ''We lost four neighbors that night.''
A System's Failure
No one told Joan Taylor, after her son James died in August 2005, that there had been a similar bathtub drowning four months earlier.
Or that the other drowning, like her son's, took place at a group home operated by a local chapter of the New York State ARC, the nation's largest nonprofit organization serving the developmentally disabled.
In both cases, there had been concerns that ARC had too few staff members to supervise the developmentally disabled residents.
Dalton Lacomb died at the ARC home in Malone, N.Y., in April 2005, after being left alone in a bath for up to 20 minutes. The house had 11 residents and one overnight staff member on duty. The state recommended hiring more employees, but backed off after discussions with ARC management.
The death ''wasn't related to staffing levels,'' Lester G. Parker, executive director of the Adirondack ARC, which oversees the Malone house, said in an interview. ''It was related to a staff person clearly and significantly neglecting their duties.''
Mrs. Taylor had pushed for an increase in staffing at her son's group home near Schenectady, where three workers looked after eight severely developmentally disabled residents.
ARC officials in Schenectady declined to comment. After Mr. Taylor drowned, the organization's only significant response was to fire his caregiver.
''The guy who left James unattended is the scapegoat, and the agency really took no responsibility from the top,'' Mr. Taylor's sister, Patricia Taylor, said.
Marc Brandt, ARC's statewide leader, acknowledged that no broad changes were enacted after the drownings, but said it was up to the state, not his organization, to take action.
''If they see anything that is wrong, they've always let us know,'' he said.
Mr. Taylor's mother has been a fierce advocate for people with developmental disabilities for decades.
Mrs. Taylor, 86, started a parent group, lobbied in Albany and was appointed to the capital-area Board of Visitors of the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities. She is most proud of helping get legislation passed in 2002 that gave parents control over end-of-life decisions for the developmentally disabled. ''I was insulted I couldn't make that decision for my son, who I wanted to die with dignity,'' she said.
On a recent day, as Mrs. Taylor sat on the back porch of her apartment at a retirement home in Saratoga Springs, wearing tennis shoes and shorts, she leafed through the guestbook from her son's funeral, filled with 300 signatures, including those of local elected officials.
''I don't know if my kid died with dignity or not,'' she said.
She grew up on Long Island and trained as a nurse; her late husband, Robert, was an engineer with General Electric. She knew something was wrong with James, their youngest child, when he was still a baby. Suspecting he could not hear, she slammed cupboard doors near their infant son, and he did not flinch.
She got a much greater shock after a doctor told her, ''Your son is mentally retarded.''
Doctors recommended that he be institutionalized. Mrs. Taylor resisted, but she had five other children. Dealing with James, her sixth child -- quadriplegic, sleepless and with the intellectual capacity of a 3-month-old -- filled her days and nights.
Eventually, she felt she had no choice.
''I will never forget that day,'' Mrs. Taylor once wrote in an essay. ''My husband and I woke up that morning both fighting back the tears. I dressed James in his very best suit and we drove the 30 miles back to the institution and left him there.''
''We both cried all the way home,'' she said. ''I thought it was the worst day of my life.''
She has done advocacy work with ARC and Mr. Brandt over the years, and calls him ''a saint,'' but she is angry about what happened to her son.
Her daughter said it was because of her mother's advocacy work that Mr. Taylor's death received attention.
She worries about the developmentally disabled who die and have no family around to push for answers for them.
''These deaths are marginalized because these sort of people are not valued by society,'' Patricia Taylor said.
When she was in the fourth grade, she dreamed of taking her brother and running away with him, protecting him. She finds it hard to accept that no one was able to protect him after he grew up.
''I believe that God put these people here for a purpose, because if we didn't have them to look after, we would lose our humanity,'' she said. ''How would we know compassion? It says in the Bible, do ye so unto the least of my brothers. I think that's what it's all about.''

HEADLINE: Dreadful Debut For Subaru

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
RUST IN PEACE
WHAT WAS IT? The Subaru 360 was a 2-cylinder microcar briefly imported in the late 1960s.
WHAT WAS THE POINT? Frankly, it's hard to tell. For some reason, absent a fuel crisis or any perceptible shift away from the bloated cars popular at the time, the auto entrepreneur Malcolm Bricklin struck a deal with Subaru's parent to bring over the tiny, 25-horsepower, less than 1,000-pound underachiever. 
SLOW GOING Consumer Reports reported that it took an ''agonizing'' 37.5 seconds to reach 50 m.p.h. (A standard 0-to-60 test wouldn't have been possible, given the top speed of 56 m.p.h.)
THE COMPANY SAID Early advertisements, titled ''Happy Talk From Subaru,'' promoted the car's 66 m.p.g. fuel economy and $1,200 price. A promotional film was direct and refreshingly honest: ''We call it cheap and ugly,'' said the narrator, who also pronounced the name Su-BAH-ru.
THE CRITICS SAID In a 1969 review, Road & Track magazine agreed that the 360 was ''a car of uncommon ugliness,'' adding that ''it is a little humiliating to be gone off and left by an elderly lady in a Chevy II who doesn't even know she's racing.'' But Consumer Reports' grim evaluation probably did more to doom the 360 in America. After rating the car ''not acceptable'' and detailing a long list of shortcomings -- for example, ''its bumpers were virtually useless against anything more formidable than a watermelon'' -- the magazine concluded, ''It was a pleasure to squirm out of the Subaru, slam the door and walk away.''
WHAT'S IT WORTH? A 360 in Grand Rapids, Mich., said to be in running condition, was recently advertised on eBay for $1,300. ROB SASS

HEADLINE: Occupy Chicago Inspires Some South Side Groups

BYLINE: By DON TERRY. 
dterry@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
As more than 1,500 supporters of the Occupy Chicago movement prepared to march through the Loop recently, Willie J. R. Fleming, a neighborhood organizer from the South Side, grabbed a bullhorn and wedged his way to the head of the mostly white crowd.
Mr. Fleming, who was followed by a group of blacks and Latinos that he said he had brought ''from the 'hood,'' raised the bullhorn into the mild late-October night and shouted, ''This is what democracy looks like!'' 
''I made sure we were up there,'' he said, ''because I wanted the media to see that people of color were represented in the march and the movement. I wanted to remove the tools of division.''
For Mr. Fleming, co-founder of the Chicago Anti-Eviction Campaign, the Occupy movement is ''heaven sent,'' partly because it has done something he and many of his black, white, Asian and Latino colleagues in the city's grass-roots organizing community have struggled to do over the years: focus public attention on poverty and rising economic inequality.
''It has given us a platform,'' Mr. Fleming said.
Groups with names and acronyms that have gone mostly unnoticed until now -- STOP (Southside Together Organizing for Power), FLY (Fearless Leading by the Youth), the Immigrant Youth Justice League and Blacks in Green, among others -- have long worked the neighborhoods, and they hope to seize on the momentum that the Occupy movement is creating.
''Any movement is preceded by people doing hard work for years,'' said Will Tanzman, 29, co-executive director of SOUL (Southside Organized for Unity and Liberation), an interracial religion-based group. ''Given the situation in the country, something was bound to catch fire at some point.''
While local organizers applaud and support the Occupy movement and its daily protests at the doorstep of American financial centers -- from Wall Street to LaSalle Street and beyond -- they say they will continue to concentrate their efforts and resources in the neighborhoods.
''The neighborhood is where the impact of the economic crisis is most visible, most real, most painful,'' said Elce Redmond of the South Austin Coalition.
For more than a year, FLY, a group composed mostly of black teenagers, has been leading a fight to have the University of Chicago Medical Center reopen its Level 1 trauma center. FLY is the youth wing of STOP.
The trauma center campaign started shortly after one of FLY's founding members, a young man, was wounded in a drive-by shooting at 61st Street and Cottage Grove Avenue, a few blocks from the medical center. But he was transported 10 miles away to Northwestern Memorial Hospital because the South Side hospital had closed its trauma center in 1988 for budgetary reasons. He died at Northwestern.
FLY organized a protest on Halloween night that attracted about 200 demonstrators -- including teenagers dressed as zombies, residents from a nearby low-income housing development and a contingent of University of Chicago students -- to march through the school's Hyde Park campus and demand that the trauma center be reopened.
Before the interest generated by Occupy Chicago, only a few University of Chicago students had participated in the group's demonstrations. This time, Occupy Chicago supporters joined FLY organizers and students who spent weeks knocking on dorm doors, said Matt Ginsberg-Jaeckle, 29, a STOP organizer.
''I must have knocked on 70 doors,'' said Darius Lightfoot, 19, a leader of FLY.
Neighborhood organizers said the experience at the university made them optimistic about the coalition-building possibilities of Occupy the Hood, an offshoot of the Occupy movement, which some observers contend has lacked diversity so far.
''Chicago is a city of neighborhoods, and that's what we are going to organize -- the neighborhoods,'' said Brittney Gault, 25, a representative for Occupy the Hood. ''But we're also going to continue to work with and support Occupy Chicago.
''This is a crisis. Everybody has to fight back.''
Ms. Gault spent much of Saturday at demonstrations on the South Side (Occupy Bronzeville) and then on the West Side (Occupy Austin), protesting banks' foreclosure policies.
An interracial group of about 25 protesters gathered last weekend on the steps of Pat Hill's graystone at South 38th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue. Ms. Hill, a retired police officer and executive director of the African American Police League, is fighting to keep her home, which is in foreclosure.
''Just the fact that we could send out press releases that say there are neighborhood Occupy groups, we got all three local TV stations,'' said Loren Taylor, 50, a supporter of Occupy the Hood. ''I'm not sure if something like that would have happened to that degree without Occupy.''

HEADLINE: Get Me Something in Economy Size

BYLINE: By JOYCE COHEN

 BODY:
COMPARING his cost of living to his standard of living, Brad Hock concluded it was no longer worthwhile to live, rent-free, at home with his parents and endure a tedious commute. So he set out to buy a place in Manhattan, aiming to spend as little as possible.
Since his graduation from Colgate in 2009, Mr. Hock had been making an hourlong MetroNorth commute from and to northern Westchester County. His first job, in investment management, had 9-to-5 hours. The office was conveniently located in the Graybar Building, right at Grand Central.
A year ago, he began a job as a financial analyst at Estee Lauder cosmetics, working on product pricing. His new office was a 20-minute walk uptown from Grand Central. He worked long hours in a job involving ''tight deadlines and reports that would be shown tomorrow,'' he said. 
After the ride home, Mr. Hock, now 24, often did not make it to his gym, which closed at 10 p.m. ''I felt I could be spending my time more wisely,'' he said. He calculated the value of his commuting time at $25 an hour -- $50 a day, $1,000 a month. So he would come out ahead if he spent $1,000 or less a month on housing.
Mr. Hock was averse to renting. Rent would rise over time, whereas traditional mortgage payments would not. And mortgage rates were low -- in some cases lower than the interest rates on his student loans. Besides, renting was ''not creative enough,'' he said. ''It was too easy.''
He was inspired by his elder brother, Chris, who graduated last year from dental school and bought a co-op near his Bronx workplace.
Mr. Hock and his sister, Lindsey, who had just graduated from college, considered hunting for a place together. But ''pretty quickly I realized two-bedrooms were out of the picture,'' Mr. Hock said, ''and even pretty much one-bedrooms were, too.''
He e-mailed several agents advertising low-priced listings. Isa Goldberg of Bellmarc, who often works with low-budget buyers, replied with detailed questions about his preferences.
Mr. Hock wanted a place within walking distance of work, or at least near a subway. In his price range, below $300,000, condominiums were scarce, so he zeroed in on co-ops.
A fifth-floor walk-up on East 54th Street had a French door that partitioned off a sleeping area from a windowless kitchen and living area. The listing price, originally $329,000, was down to $295,000. Maintenance was around $670.
Mr. Hock wondered, fleetingly, if he could share this place with his sister. ''Maybe one of us could live in the kitchen space,'' he said. Then again, maybe not. (His sister now rents in Chelsea with roommates. The walk-up is still for sale.)
On 77th Street near First Avenue, a small studio, also on a high floor, was priced at $240,000, down from $305,000. Maintenance was around $550. This one was nicely renovated, but Mr. Hock preferred something cheaper, even if it needed work. And the location seemed distant from the rest of the city. (The studio is now in contract for $235,000.)
Mr. Hock kept looking. He saw loft beds and Murphy beds, space-hogging fireplaces, layouts with few options for placing furniture. One place had a mirrored folding door that concealed the kitchen. But ''nothing really jumped out at me and said: This is below market value,'' he said.
In his rock-bottom price range, the choices were dismal. They all had ''certain factors that limit their marketability, be it the view, the size or the condition,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ''Or the amenities in the buildings are very limited, with not even a washer-dryer in the basement.''
But a ground-floor unit on a pretty West 20th Street block in Chelsea looked promising. It had big windows and high ceilings. The price, originally $350,000, was now $340,000, with maintenance around $570.
''I thought the design was great for a small space,'' Mr. Hock said. It was the nicest place he'd seen, but it was just too pricey. He considered borrowing money from his grandparents, but was uncomfortable doing so. (The co-op sold for $285,000 after nearly a year.)
''I basically said, if I am going to do this, I would rather go for a little bit less and do it on my own,'' he said. Increasingly concerned about his ability to meet a co-op board's financial criteria, he dropped his budget to $225,000 or less.
''I don't think Brad wanted to scare me about his price point,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ''It took me a bit of understanding to realize how little he was planning to spend.''
The listing agent for the Chelsea place, Nanette Shaw of Bellmarc, mentioned that another interested person had moved to Tudor City, the landmark co-op complex in the far East 40s. If someone preferred Tudor City to such a lovely apartment, Mr. Hock thought, he had to see it.
Tudor City's tiny studios were priced in the low $200,000s, but one, all of 203 square feet and advertised as a ''small studio'' that ''needed work,'' was just $199,000. Maintenance was a little more than $400. The seller, who had been subletting the place, could no longer do so, according to the building's policy.
The paint was peeling, and the closet shelves sagged. But Mr. Hock knew he could easily fix those things himself.
''When someone renovates, a lot of that cost is labor,'' he said. ''If I could save on the labor cost, I might get a positive return on my investment.''
Mr. Hock offered $170,000. The seller dropped to $181,000. Mr. Hock's final offer was $175,000. Negotiations stalled. Ms. Goldberg was certain the deal was off. But the seller finally agreed, probably because ''there wasn't much advantage to holding on to it for another $20,000,'' she said.
Mr. Hock moved in over the summer, after spending about $3,500 on renovations that included painting, tiling and a new light fixture. He has a two-burner electric stove and an under-the-counter refrigerator. He furnished his studio with a glass table, two chairs, and a foldout sofa bed. His one closet is deep and well organized.
He isn't bothered by the courtyard view, the periodic ventilation noise from below, or the clicking of high heels in the tiled hallway.
Among his many calculations: Moving to the city increased his cost of living by about $500 a month, or $6,000 a year. But assuming his apartment appreciates at an annual rate of 2 percent, it will be worth another $3,500 in a year. So the actual cost-of-living increase for the year -- $6,000 minus that $3,500 -- works out to only $208.33 a month.
And, sure enough, his monthly outlay is under $1,000, $957.50, to be exact, not including the tax benefits provided by his mortgage.
''Standard of living is kind of subjective,'' he said. But ''my social life has improved tremendously.'' Instead of sitting on the train, he can go running, work out at the gym or visit friends. He walks to the office.
''I also feel very stable,'' he said. His friends with market-rate rentals face steep increases. ''I hear from my friends, 'I don't know what I am going to do next year for housing,' '' he said. Buying the cozy studio ''was probably the best decision I've ever made.''

HEADLINE: Alms From China

 BODY:
As soon as European leaders agreed on yet another plan to stabilize their finances, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France was on the phone to his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, to persuade him to invest in the rescue. Klaus Regling, head of the new financial bailout fund for the euro zone, went to Asia to drum up support. 
China has $3 trillion-plus in foreign exchange reserves, about a quarter invested in European bonds. But it is not only unseemly for wealthy Europeans to be looking for alms from China, it is bad policy. Beijing would undoubtedly try to use its financial leverage to silence European criticism of its cheap currency or its abysmal human rights record. That is too high of a price to pay.
What makes this particularly misguided is that the European Union does not need the money. The main roadblock to fixing its mess is a lack of political will to use the resources it has. At $1.4 trillion, its entire bailout fund would amount to just over 10 percent of the euro area's G.D.P. Rich European countries -- Germany notably -- have ample access to finance. German 10-year bonds are yielding less than 2 percent. Money doesn't get any cheaper than that.
China, with hundreds of millions of people who earn less than $2 a day, should be spending a lot more at home to build a much needed social safety net. And it should remove the financial distortions -- like artificially low interest rates -- that encourage ordinary Chinese to save too much and spend too little.
China's predatory trade policies -- subsidizing exports through an artificially cheap currency and credit; appropriating foreign intellectual property; placing illegal export bans on raw materials to give domestic companies unfair advantage -- are all of the world's economic problems. Europe and the United States should be pressing Beijing to change its ways, not giving it more power to resist.
It is true that rescuing Europe will be costly, weighing on European budgets and diverting resources from other priorities. But allowing China to pay for Europe's bailout would prove even costlier.

HEADLINE: Cain and Gingrich Meet For a Congenial Debate

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
THE WOODLANDS, Texas -- The rancor that defined much of the last week on the Republican presidential campaign trail subsided a bit here on Saturday night, as Newt Gingrich and Herman Cain basked in each other's company and the warm embrace of the Texas Tea Party for what was styled as an old-fashioned issues-focused debate.
The challenges facing the Cain campaign over the last week, as it struggled to deal with revelations of sexual harassment accusations made against Mr. Cain while he was head of the National Restaurant Association in the late 1990s, were not addressed at all. 
The event, formally titled the Cain-Gingrich Debate 2011, was actually a fund-raiser held in a cavernous hotel ballroom north of Houston that was packed with 1,000 people. It felt more like a conservative love-in, with each candidate going out of his way to compliment the other and shower praise on the audience.
After Mr. Gingrich took a few minutes to answer a question on Medicare, saying that there was need for radical change, Mr. Cain was to offer a rebuttal.
''I'm supposed to have a minute to disagree with something that he said, but I don't,'' Mr. Cain said to some chuckles and applause. ''I believe, as Speaker Gingrich believes, that we can't reshuffle Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security; we must restructure.''
When one opportunity for a clash did emerge, it was quickly set aside. ''I'm going to sidestep the temptation to talk about '9-9-9,' '' Mr. Gingrich said after Mr. Cain brought up his signature economic plan, which would replace the tax code with a 9 percent flat tax on individuals and corporations while adding a 9 percent national sales tax. They focused more on what they had in common. ''We are the two most radical candidates,'' Mr. Gingrich said as Mr. Cain looked on, approvingly.
And so it went, for roughly two hours in a style modeled after the legendary Lincoln-Douglas debates during the Illinois Senate campaign of 1858. The meeting was meant to be a departure from the flashy fast-paced format of the candidate encounters so far this campaign season.
Mr. Cain did take some time to take a swipe at the news media when the two men were encouraged by the hosts to ask questions of each other. Mr. Gingrich said he would deliver ''a softball'': What has been the biggest surprise Mr. Cain has faced on the campaign trail?
''The nit-pickiness of the media,'' Mr. Cain said. ''If there is a journalistic standard, a lot of them don't follow it.''
Over a standing ovation, he continued, ''There are too many people in the media who are downright dishonest.''
(On Friday, the Cain campaign said it was considering legal action against Politico, the news Web site that broke the story of the sexual harassment accusations.)
In substance and tone, the meeting could not have been more different from the recent debates among the candidates running for the Republican presidential nomination, during which sharps attacks have flown in all directions.
The topic on Saturday night was entitlements, and the format was largely unmoderated, with Mr. Cain and Mr. Gingrich seated at a small round table and free to speak as long as they liked.
Both said they favored giving block grants to the states for Medicaid and welfare programs. Mr. Cain said unemployment benefits should shrink over time. Mr. Gingrich said any such benefits should be tied to mandatory training programs.
''We must go from an entitlement society to an empowerment society, which means we help people help themselves,'' Mr. Cain said.
Over all, Mr. Gingrich seemed to earn more hearty and spontaneous applause for his answers than did Mr. Cain, who took a pass on one question to let Mr. Gingrich ''go first,'' as he said. He also used some of his time to take a second shot at answering a question that he acknowledged he did not address well on the first try.
But the most sustained and seemingly heartfelt cheers of the night came when Mr. Cain was urged to ask a question of Mr. Gingrich.
''Mr. Speaker, if you were vice president of the United States,'' Mr. Cain said, pausing for effect as the crowd roared. ''What would you want the president to assign you to do first?''
Mr. Gingrich smiled broadly, turned red in the face and laughed. The debate ended.
''I thought it was great, and the punch line at the end was fantastic,'' said Bob Bailie, 76, a mechanical engineer who said he would love to see a Gingrich-Cain ticket. ''I think those two are a great team.''

HEADLINE: The Politics of Austerity

BYLINE: By THOMAS B. EDSALL. 
Thomas B. Edsall, a professor of journalism at Columbia University, is the author of the forthcoming book ''The Age of Austerity: How Scarcity Will Remake American Politics.''

 BODY:
The economic collapse of 2008 transformed American politics. In place of shared abundance, battles at every level of government now focus on picking the losers who will bear the costs of deficit reduction and austerity.
Fights in Washington are over inflicting pain on antagonists either through spending cuts or tax increases, a struggle over who will get a smaller piece of a shrinking pie. This hostile climate stands in sharp contrast to the post-World-War II history of economic growth. Worse, current income and employment trends suggest that this is not a temporary shift.
The year 2008 marked the emergence of a Democratic Party driven by surging constituencies of minorities, single women and voters under 30. The flowering of this coalition, manifested in the election of President Obama and in continued Democratic control of Congress, was quickly followed by developments affirming the activist, redistributive state: the enactment of a $787 billion economic stimulus bill, passage of the $900 billion health care reform act and rising demand for food stamps, unemployment compensation and Medicaid. 
From the vantage point of Republicans, the newly empowered Democratic Party was determined to institutionalize government expansion through oversight of the financial sector, broadening access to medical care and federally mandated environmental regulation. As the national debt grew from $10.6 trillion when Obama took office to $13.7 trillion on Election Day 2010, the stage was set for a conservative revival. Conservatives successfully shifted the focus of American politics to the twin themes of debt and austerity -- with a specific attack on means-tested entitlement programs.
The Republican Party, after winning back control of the House in 2010, has reverted to the penny-pinching of an earlier era, the green eyeshade Grand Old Party of Herbert Hoover and Robert Taft, advocating a ''root canal'' approach to governance evident in the first budget passed by the Republican-controlled House -- the Paul Ryan ''path to prosperity'' budget with $4 trillion in cuts -- and the subsequent Aug. 2 debt ceiling agreement.
The new embattled partisan environment allows conservatives to pit taxpayers against tax consumers, those dependent on safety-net programs against those who see such programs as eating away at their personal income and assets.
In a nuanced study, ''The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism,'' the sociologist and political scientist Theda Skocpol and her colleagues at Harvard found that opposition to government spending was concentrated on resentment of federal government ''handouts.'' Tea Party activists, they wrote, ''define themselves as workers, in opposition to categories of nonworkers they perceive as undeserving of government assistance.''
In a March 15 declaration calling for defunding of most social programs, the New Boston Tea Party was blunt: ''The locusts are eating, or should we say devouring, the productive output of the hard working taxpayer.''
The conservative agenda, in a climate of scarcity, racializes policy making, calling for deep cuts in programs for the poor. The beneficiaries of these programs are disproportionately black and Hispanic. In 2009, according to census data, 50.9 percent of black households, 53.3 percent of Hispanic households and 20.5 percent of white households received some form of means-tested government assistance, including food stamps, Medicaid and public housing.
Less obviously, but just as racially charged, is the assault on public employees. ''We can no longer live in a society where the public employees are the haves and taxpayers who foot the bills are the have-nots,'' declared Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin.
For black Americans, government employment is a crucial means of upward mobility. The federal work force is 18.6 percent African-American, compared with 10.9 percent in the private sector. The percentages of African-Americans are highest in just those agencies that are most actively targeted for cuts by Republicans: the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 38.3 percent; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 42.4 percent; and the Education Department, 36.6 percent.
The politics of austerity are inherently favorable to conservatives and inhospitable to liberals. Congressional trench warfare rewards those most willing to risk all. Republicans demonstrated this in last summer's debt ceiling fight, deploying the threat of a default on Treasury obligations to force spending cuts.
Conservatives are more willing to inflict harm on adversaries and more readily see conflicts in zero-sum terms -- the basic framework of the contemporary debate. Once austerity dominates the agenda, the only question is where the ax falls.
Still, conservatives have a tendency to overestimate public support for their agenda and consequently to overreach: recall the two government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996; the 1998 Clinton impeachment; and the Ryan budget, which gave Democrats a recent victory in upstate New York.
Most signs point toward a relentless continuation of struggle in the context of austerity. Congress faces self-imposed deadlines of Nov. 23 and Dec. 23 to approve a deficit reduction of $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion over 10 years, or accept across-the-board cuts of $1.2 trillion.
Democratic strategists privately worry that many voters see reduced spending as a threshold issue that candidates must meet. ''Our message -- 'We want fewer budget cuts, more taxes' -- is all that voters are getting right now,'' said one strategist involved in presidential and Congressional campaigns. ''It doesn't sell.''
Republicans are playing with fire, though, when they threaten American standing in the world, as they did in provoking Standard & Poor's downgrade of the United States' credit rating to AA+ from AAA in August. Confidence in Congressional Republicans fell 36 points after the debt ceiling debacle, compared with a 22-point drop for Mr. Obama.
While the outcome of the election exactly one year from today remains uncertain, the prospects for economic growth, with prosperity reaching beyond corporations and Wall Street to the electorate at large, are dim. The two main sources of new jobs, government and health services, face substantial fiscal constraints. Technology continues to make skilled jobs ''tradable,'' that is, exportable to lower-wage countries, and corporations are making productivity gains through automation, not new hiring.
In many respects, austerity feeds on itself. If the country needs to invest in education and rebuilding infrastructure to regain competitiveness, as many economists of varying ideological stripes argue, those initiatives are in large part precluded in a political environment that places top priority on deficit and debt reduction. Retrenchment, in effect, becomes a noose, choking off prospects for growth.
This is an excerpt from Campaign Stops, a political opinion blog that will run for a year, beginning today.

HEADLINE: For Clues to U.S. Stocks, Look at Greek Bonds

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
IT'S come to this. For day-to-day guidance on the likely direction of American stocks, there's an unlikely contrarian indicator: the battered Greek bond.
''You've got to keep your eyes on Greece, if for no other reason than that everyone else is,'' said Richard Bernstein, formerly the chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch and now the proprietor of his own firm and a fund manager for Eaton Vance.
Mr. Bernstein says his main focus right now is actually American stocks, which he favors for fundamental reasons: they are relatively cheap, he says, given the earnings they are likely to produce over the next decade. But for the short term, those virtues are often being overlooked by investors, so as a guidepost for Wall Street he has been looking at an unlikely benchmark, the Greek 10-year note. 
It has had little intrinsic connection to the American stock market in the past, as Mr. Bernstein is quick to acknowledge. But it has been a perversely contrarian signal of late. As the European rescue plan for Greece appeared at times to unravel last week, Greek 10-year notes hit new lows, falling to less than 30 percent of their nominal value -- a 70 percent discount. As the price dropped, the American stock market often rose.
''A decade ago, you'd have thought I was crazy if I told you there was a connection'' between American equities and the fixed-income market in Greece, Mr. Bernstein says. Recently, though, there does seem to have been at least a loose correlation, he says, because American banks, both directly and indirectly, are exposed to the debt of Greece and other troubled European countries.
And the ups and downs of the Greek crisis have provided the impetus for the risk-on, risk-off trading that has dominated financial markets worldwide.
Quite often these days, the tone on Wall Street has been set by the frantic efforts to stave off a financial calamity in Europe. The uncertainty has been buffeting the American economy as well, as Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last week.
''Most notably,'' Mr. Bernanke said, ''concerns about European fiscal and banking issues have contributed to strains in global financial markets, which are likely to have adverse effects on confidence and growth.'' He added that the Fed remained ready to intervene further, if needed.
Despite these problems, Mr. Bernstein says, investors should be focusing on the handsome profits that American companies are churning out. But he says it's understandable that people are fixated on the immediate crisis in Greece. So he turns to the Greek bond as a back-of-the-envelope indicator. What's his logic?
As he sees it, the sinking market price for those bonds tells him that the Greek bailout deal, if it holds together, will be extremely ''bullish short term for banks,'' and therefore ''bullish short term for the stock market in the United States, too.'' But in the slightly longer term, however, it will also be bearish for both. Why?
A ''voluntary'' 50 percent haircut -- or discount -- for those bonds was part of the fragile settlement worked out by European leaders late last month. The current market price amounts to a much higher de facto discount of about 70 percent, so if the European settlement holds, it will be a ''very good deal'' for bond holders -- that is, banks, he said -- and bank shares have often dominated the American stock market.
Slightly longer term, though, the pricing discrepancy implies that the European deal does not adequately account for the reduced value of Greek debt.
''Ultimately, the markets will be skeptical about any deal like this, because the debt has not been written down sufficiently,'' he says. ''It's bearish longer term because it suggests that this crisis isn't close to being over.''
Because prospects for a short-term settlement of the crisis grew shakier in the last week, he says, the implications of the sinking Greek bond may not be translatable into anything more than extreme volatility for global markets. He says the festering European crisis will probably make American stock markets ''quite volatile'' for some time, despite what he considers excellent prospects for American companies.
For fixed-income investors, meanwhile, the prospects are likewise not entirely positive, in the view of Kathy A. Jones, fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab. The Fed ''will be keeping interest rates very low for some time to come'' on government bonds, she says. And in response to an economic slowdown and to the financial crisis in Europe, the European Central Bank lowered interest rates last week.
This environment, she says, ''creates real dilemmas for individual investors,'' who will need to decide whether to accept these rates or take on additional credit risk in an effort to get higher yields.
''Unfortunately, there are no easy solutions,'' she said.
Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, says he believes that Treasury yields have already bottomed and are beginning to edge upward. The 10-year Treasury note is likely to breach 3 percent by the end of the quarter, he says, though he observes that the Fed appears to be ''preparing the way'' for further unorthodox policies aimed at keeping rates low and stimulating the economy.
He believes that it makes sense to buy some high-yield bonds. ''The market for these securities got hammered so hard in anticipation of recession'' that the prices are very attractive, he says.
Like Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Minerd is bullish on American stocks. He says he believes that the economy will muddle along, ''and that it will actually turn out to perform better than the market has anticipated,'' driving stocks higher.
Still, high volatility is part of his outlook, too, in large part because of the crisis in Europe.
''We've reached a stage where we all understand that a train wreck of some sort is coming,'' he says. ''The question is what will the wreck actually look like, how much damage will it do, and the markets have already priced in a lot of damage.''
As far as the Greek crisis goes, he says, there appears to be worse to come, though it may not be as bad as the market anticipates.

HEADLINE: Moneyball U

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ. 
Alan Schwarz is an education reporter for The Times and author of ''The Numbers Game: Baseball's Lifelong Fascination With Statistics.''

 BODY:
WATCHING a baseball telecast may not be the best way to learn basic probability.
Let's say Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees and his .313 career batting average stride to the plate after 20 straight at-bats without a hit. Sports Announcer No. 1 will invariably discuss how Jeter is in a slump, suggesting that, because of some problem either physical or mental, his chance of getting a hit is somewhere less than his usual 31 percent. And then, right on cue, Announcer No. 2 will giddily agree -- ''Yeah, Marv, Derek's definitely due!'' -- with the ''due'' implying that Jeter has gone hitless for so long that his chances now are somehow greater than his innate 31 percent.
Welcome to ''Bert and Ernie Teach Probability,'' America's less storied national pastime.
At colleges and universities, however, baseball and other sports have become fertile grounds for teaching formal statistics to otherwise wary undergraduates. Pascal's triangle helps explain why the favored team often loses the World Series. Expected values develop rather unexpected value when they unmask football coaching blunders. And when it comes to Bell curves, which would you rather plot -- your school's N.C.A.A. basketball scores, or snowfalls in Saskatoon? 
As society gets ever more data driven and risk aware, formal statistics are becoming increasingly relevant. Probability has revolutionized finance, polling and, yes, even the running of sports franchises; popular culture has embraced stat geeks through television shows (''NUMB3RS'') and best-selling books (''Freakonomics''). As Brad Pitt evangelizes the power of probability in this fall's hit movie ''Moneyball,'' you know that numbers have earned a seat at the cool kids' table.
Some courses, like Stanford's Stats 50 (''Mathematics of Sports'') and Ohio State's Stat 201.01 (''Statistics in the Sports World''), overtly declare their use of batting averages and winning streaks. Most, however, give students a pleasant surprise after class starts, when they sit down and realize they have entered Moneyball U.
''Intro Stat as a course is frustrating because students don't care about the things you talk about -- economics, politics -- but everyone can relate to sports in some way, either as participant or fan,'' says Jim Albert, author of the 2003 textbook ''Teaching Statistics Using Baseball'' and a professor of statistics at Bowling Green State, in Ohio. ''The students are interested, and that's all we're looking for. They're willing.''
Adds Jim Cochran, who uses baseball statistics to teach both entry-level probability and advanced Operations Research at Louisiana Tech: ''You want them to demand data, to look for evidence, to test hypotheses. You have students who would otherwise not come close to this discipline. It's very valuable.''
While traditional what-if situations involving dice rolls and poker hands remain a staple, sports offers dozens of real-life games every day that generate scads of data begging to be examined. Flipping a coin twice is a mundane thought experiment; having Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns attempt two free throws with a game on the line is like watching ESPN in the classroom.
That was the example Justin Kimmel of James Madison University, in Virginia, used recently while teaching his Math 220 ''Elementary Statistics'' class. Nash, Professor Kimmel explained, had made 90 percent of his free throws over 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association, so it was fair to assume that the probability of his making any free throw was 0.9. When he steps to the line for two shots, how often would he make both?
Professor Kimmel scribbled on the blackboard all the relevant rules, how the chance of two such events occurring is the product of their respective probabilities, and in the end Nash made both shots 81 percent of the time. The crowd didn't exactly cheer -- they were too busy taking notes -- but they did almost smile.
''It's a major reason I'm here in the class at all,'' said Micah Barbour, a freshman planning to major in political science. ''I love sports and sports is all about statistics. I've never had an opportunity where a class can take something and make it so real-life. It's cool to finally have fun in math.''
So, how many nine-hitter batting orders can a baseball manager make from 12 players? He has to choose the nine hitters, which he can do in 220 ways (hello, combination function), and then he can order those nine hitters in 362,880 ways (basic factorials), and the product is 79,833,600. Following a touchdown, when should a football coach attempt a two-point conversion rather than kick the almost guaranteed extra point? No cheating, class -- take the quiz yourself.
More complicated questions are tackled in higher-level courses. A mind-bending treasure named Simpson's paradox helps explain why the Cincinnati Reds, despite having the best record in the National League during the strike-split 1981 season, didn't make the playoffs. Linear regressions come alive when assessing whether passing yards or touchdowns are more important for N.F.L. quarterbacks. And Bayes's theorem, which helps assess the role of random chance in observed events, comes into play in topics ranging from drug testing to Ty Cobb's batting averages.
(Don't laugh. Carl Morris, former chairman of the Harvard department of statistics, wrote a seminal 1977 Scientific American article that painstakingly used Bayes's theorem to investigate whether luck played an outsize role in the three seasons in which Cobb hit above the magical .400 mark. It comes as no surprise that Professor Morris later used baseball and tennis extensively to teach his Quantitative Reasoning course at Harvard for many years, although he generally laid low with it: ''I don't go out of my way to advertise my baseball work,'' he once said, ''for fear people will have nothing to do with me as an academic.'')
David C. Carothers, chairman of the math and statistics departments at James Madison, says that some faculty members did have reservations about Professor Kimmel's extensive use of baseball in his introductory course. But, Dr. Carothers says, ''They hadn't thought about it very much, and hadn't been exposed to the wide range of hard-core things they could do.'' The course filled up almost immediately.
Alas, one concern was clear in the James Madison class: not every student likes sports, or knows the difference between a sacrifice fly and a roach bomb. When Professor Kimmel mentioned the oddity of how the last 14 opening coin flips in the Super Bowl have been won by the N.F.C., a young woman at a corner desk sheepishly asked, ''What's the N.F.C.?'' (It's the National Football Conference, one of the two conferences in American professional football.)
''The class is definitely teaching me sports as well, and is giving me something to talk about with my dad and guy friends,'' the student, Nicole Wilson, joked afterward, describing the mood of the class as more -- dare she say it? -- playful.
''So far I've had four college math classes, and I've disliked them all,'' said Brandi Jarrell, a junior sitting nearby. ''Except for this one.''
If sports statistics makes its way down to high school education, a woman hopes to be responsible. Christine Franklin, a professor at the University of Georgia, not only teaches prospective teachers how to teach statistics -- with sports a major source of examples -- but she also has collaborated on a new textbook coming out this winter, ''Statistical Reasoning in Sports,'' which is geared toward helping states adjust to the new Common Core mathematics standards.
''Before the Common Core, many states didn't have statistics in their standards -- now it's a big component,'' says Professor Franklin, who co-authored her textbook with Josh Tabor, a statistics teacher at Canyon del Oro High School in Oro Valley, Ariz. ''Teachers are going to have to teach statistics and many do not have the background. It motivates the teachers, too.''
To the professor who is credited with teaching the first course solely devoted to the study of sports statistics -- Math 1011 at Seton Hall University, 1988 -- this is a welcome development. Gabriel B. Costa is still teaching his class, now at the United States Military Academy at West Point, bringing statistics to skeptics and hoping for more.
''There's sports law, sports medicine, why not sports mathematics? Why couldn't you get a Ph.D. in sports statistics?'' Father Costa says. ''Fifty years ago, people weren't getting Ph.D.'s in kinesiology, either. Everything has its time and place. If this became a legitimate academic area, I'd be a happy man.''

HEADLINE: Risks Seen In Perry Plan For Switch To Pensions

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who has long been a vocal critic of Social Security, outlined a plan last month that he said would preserve the program ''for all generations of Americans.'' But one part of his plan -- to let state and local government workers opt out of Social Security -- could add risk to their retirements while sapping money from the system.
The proposal runs counter to the recommendations made recently by a couple of high-profile, bipartisan debt reduction commissions -- which called for shoring up Social Security, in part, by enrolling the nearly seven million state and local government workers who are not in the program. 
Mr. Perry, whose characterization of Social Security as a ''Ponzi scheme'' drew criticism from some of his rivals when he entered the Republican presidential race this summer, gave a speech last month in which he called for fixing the Social Security system by, among other things, once again allowing ''state and local governments to newly opt out of Social Security and instead allow their employees to pay solely into state or locally run retirement programs.''
''This has been done around the country, with better results,'' Mr. Perry said. ''We ought to allow it again.''
More than a quarter of state and local government workers do not currently participate in Social Security, though some now wish that they did. Some city workers in Central Falls, R.I., were never enrolled in Social Security, which saved both them and the city from the payroll tax that funds the program. The city filed for bankruptcy this summer and reduced their pensions by as much as half, to as little as $10,000 a year. Now they have no Social Security benefits to fall back on.
Public schoolteachers in Illinois do not participate in Social Security, and their pension fund is in precarious shape. Last year the fund reported having just 48 cents for every dollar of benefits it had promised, largely because the state had failed to pay the required amount of money into it for many years.
Lawmakers in Maine recently considered a proposal to enroll more of its government workers in Social Security, but discovered that the transition costs would be crushing.
Mr. Perry is taking a very different approach, saying the law should be changed back to the way it was before 1983, when state and local employers were allowed to join or leave the Social Security program as they wished. Legislation passed that year prohibited public employers from withdrawing from the program once they enrolled in it.
Letting public employees out of the program is only a small part of Mr. Perry's plan for Social Security. Many of his proposals, which include allowing younger workers to open individual savings accounts within Social Security and gradually raising the program's retirement age, are more common and have been debated at great length in recent years. His proposal for state and local government workers, though, comes in the midst of a national debate about the retirement benefits of public sector workers.
The potential risk that underfunded pensions pose to both workers and local taxpayers was one of the reasons that President Obama's bipartisan debt reduction commission -- led by Alan K. Simpson, a Republican former senator from Wyoming, and Erskine B. Bowles, a Democrat and former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton -- recommended enrolling all newly hired state and local government workers in Social Security after 2020.
Mr. Simpson said in an interview that the panel concluded that this would shore up the trust fund with payroll taxes and give workers in the most distressed pension plans something to fall back on. ''State and local plans are shot to hell,'' said Mr. Simpson, who added that he had not read Mr. Perry's plan and had not endorsed a Republican candidate for president.
Enrolling those workers in Social Security would have another benefit, the panel found: the payroll taxes that would be collected would close 8 percent of Social Security's projected 75-year shortfall. Social Security's last crisis was resolved in part by bringing the federal work force into the program in 1984.
Adding better-paid state and local workers like teachers and police officers, who make up most nonparticipants today, would give the federal system's solvency a bigger boost than might be expected. This is because Social Security is set up to shift money toward lower-income people. The better-paid newcomers to the program would tend to add more taxes during their working years, but would not draw out a commensurate amount when they retired.
Many public sector workers who are not in Social Security prefer to remain out of it because they see their pensions as a better deal.
Mr. Perry often points to the example of Galveston County in Texas as a place that opted out of Social Security in favor of a locally run savings plan. Herman Cain, the former pizza executive, has also spoken approvingly of the Galveston plan in several Republican presidential debates.
But they have not mentioned that the Galveston program is actually more expensive than Social Security. Social Security's contribution rate is 12.4 percent of payroll, with 6.2 percent coming from each worker and 6.2 percent coming from the employer. The Galveston plan's total contribution rate is 13.9 percent of the payroll, with 6.1 percent coming from each worker, and 7.8 percent from the county -- or, more specifically, its taxpayers.
And whether it provides a better benefit is open to debate. Studies of the Galveston plan have determined that it provides a better deal for some high-income workers, but a worse one for low- and middle-income workers. And its benefits are not protected from inflation, as Social Security's are.
Still, retirees there do not depend solely on that plan for their retirements; they are also enrolled in the Texas County and District Retirement System, which combines features of a 401(k)-type savings plan and a traditional defined-benefit pension plan.
The plan promises workers a 7 percent return on their contributions, as well as an employer ''match'' when they retire, usually at age 60. The board, made up of people appointed by the governor, has invested aggressively to meet that goal, including in its portfolio junk bonds, distressed-debt partnerships, private equities, commodities and a big assortment of hedge funds.
If a county comes up short, the state gives it the right to reduce its workers' benefits, said Amy Bishop, a spokeswoman. ''That's really the key,'' she said. ''They can lower those benefits.''

HEADLINE: The Problem With Flat-Tax Fever

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.

 BODY:
CLOSE watchers of presidential politics weren't surprised to see many of this year's Republican hopefuls proposing to replace the nation's progressive income tax with a flat tax. Such plans reliably surface every four years, and, just as reliably, sink without a trace.
That's not because the current tax system is far from the abominable tangle of complexity that candidates say it is. Actually, it's worse. Flat-tax proponents promise to sweep away that mess by imposing a single levy on every dollar earned. That change, many contend, would allow taxpayers to file their returns on postcards. And surveys suggest positive voter responses to several of the most recent proposals. 
Yet none will be adopted, for at least two reasons. One is that a flat tax would do nothing to make filing tax returns any simpler. But, more important, it would greatly exacerbate longstanding growth in income inequality.
One Republican candidate, Herman Cain, enjoyed widespread attention when he unveiled his ''9-9-9'' plan last month. The plan, as he described it, calls for three simple taxes, each with a 9 percent rate. The first is a tax on income, and the second, on goods bought, is essentially a sales tax. The third taxes business revenue. But because it deducts paid dividends and other nonlabor expenses, it amounts to a tax on wages.
Mr. Cain touted his plan's simplicity, and many voters were apparently impressed. In some surveys of potential Republican primary voters, he quickly captured the top spot held until then by Mitt Romney. Rick Perry, the Texas governor, responded with a flat-tax proposal of his own. At this point, Mr. Romney is the only top-tier Republican candidate without some variant of a flat-tax proposal. But give him time.
The contention that a flat tax would be simpler because it involves only a single rate is flatly wrong. The complexity of the current system has nothing to do with its multiple income brackets.
The hard step in figuring your tax bill is to compute your taxable income -- roughly, the amount you earn, less the myriad exemptions, deductions and various other offsets described in the 3.4-million-word code of the Internal Revenue Service. You'd also have to calculate your adjusted gross income under a flat tax. But once you've completed that step under either system, you consult the tax tables to see how much you owe. In the current system, the entries have multiple brackets and rates already built into them, so this step is no harder than it would be under the tables for a flat tax.
The much more serious concern is that a flat tax would reinforce the trends toward greater income inequality that have been seen over the last several decades. As documented by a recent Congressional Budget Office study, the top 1 percent of income recipients in the United States earned 275 percent more in 2007 than they did in 1979, adjusted for inflation, a period when the earnings of middle-income households grew by less than 40 percent. A flat tax would increase inequality by substantially reducing rates on the most prosperous households, while increasing them on low- and middle-income households.
According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, Mr. Cain's proposal would increase the annual tax bill of a typical family of four earning $50,000 a year by more than $4,000, but would reduce the taxes owed by a similar family earning between $500,000 and $1 million by almost $60,000. The center also estimated that families in the top one-tenth of 1 percent of households would enjoy an average annual tax reduction of nearly $1.4 million under the Cain plan. Similar distributional effects are common under all flat-tax plans, not just Mr. Cain's.
Rising inequality exacts a toll not just on those with lower incomes, but also on those much higher up the income scale. In their 2009 book, ''The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger,'' the British public health researchers Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett document a range of social ills that are reliably associated with increased income inequality, both over time within nations and at any particular moment across a broad range of countries. Countries and times with lower inequality fare better on virtually every published index of health, well-being and quality of life.
Those with the highest levels of inequality, like the United States, invariably score poorly on these indexes. And those same countries consistently experience higher rates of violent crime.
TO say that flat-tax proposals are problematic isn't to deny that our current tax system is profoundly dysfunctional. Every year, corporate lobbyists and other supplicants use campaign contributions and other inducements to persuade legislators to enact additional exemptions, deductions and other loopholes. Voters are justifiably angered by having to wade through this complexity, or by having to hire one of the nation's 1.2 million professional tax preparers to do so.
Although a flat tax won't be adopted, taxing consumption is actually a good idea. We should replace the progressive income tax with a simplified and much more steeply progressive tax on each household's annual consumption expenditure -- calculated as the difference between its income and its annual savings. But because half of the members of the Congressional ''supercommittee'' entrusted with cutting the deficit have pledged never to approve any new tax under any circumstances, that won't happen any time soon.
For the time being, then, our best bet is to do all we can to reduce the gratuitous complexity of our progressive income tax.
Correction: November 13, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Economic View column last Sunday, about Republican proposals for a flat tax, defined incorrectly adjusted gross income under the federal tax code. It is the amount earned, minus some expenses and deductions. It does not include other deductions, or exemptions. (Those items are accounted for in what is called taxable income.)

HEADLINE: Memories of the Bush Administration

BYLINE: By ALAN BRINKLEY. 
Alan Brinkley is the Allan Nevins professor of history at Columbia University and the author, most recently, of ''The Publisher: Henry Luce and His American Century.''

 BODY:
KNOWN AND UNKNOWN
A Memoir
By Donald Rumsfeld
Illustrated. 815 pp. Sentinel. $36
IN MY TIME
A Personal and Political Memoir
By Dick Cheney with Liz Cheney
Illustrated. 565 pp. Threshold Editions. $35
The administration of George W. Bush has already produced a remarkable body of contemporary history from a large group of talented journalists and writers -- Jane Mayer, Thomas E. Ricks, James Risen, Ron Suskind, Susan Faludi, Seymour M. Hersh, James Mann and many others. But in the last year, several members of the Bush administration have retaliated with books of their own. Among the most significant are former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's ''Known and Unknown'' and former Vice President Dick Cheney's ''In My Time,'' memoirs by perhaps the two most important figures (other than the president) in the years of terrorism and war. Both books have received mostly negative reviews -- largely deserved. Rumsfeld's book is dense and bloated, although modestly candid. Cheney's is clearly written (with help from his daughter Liz Cheney), but with the exception of its last chapters, dry, earnest and dull. None of this seems to have had much impact on their sales. Both spent time at the top of the best-seller lists. 
Political memoirs are normally unsurprising, but these two books are unusual for their defensiveness and occasional combativeness in the face of the broad popular contempt so many people expressed while Rumsfeld and Cheney were in office. The two men present similar arguments. Both rarely confess to making mistakes, though they often write sharply about others who have. But the most important question that these books raise is the one of their credibility.
That the two memoirs were published in the same year and are in many ways alike should not be surprising. Rumsfeld and Cheney have had a long and intimate relationship stretching back to the Nixon administration and into the present. But even before they met, they followed similar paths into politics and government.
Rumsfeld and Cheney were the sons of middle-class families -- Rumsfeld raised in Chicago, Cheney in Nebraska and Wyoming. Both attended public high schools, excelled in athletics and enrolled in prestigious colleges. Rumsfeld attended Princeton, where he was a successful athlete and a popular social figure. Cheney went to Yale, but after two unsuccessful years moved to the University of Wyoming, followed by graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin, where he hoped to get a Ph.D. in political science and become an academic.
Rumsfeld, who is nine years older than Cheney, became a member of Congress in 1962, while Cheney was still struggling through college. But in the early 1970s, their paths crossed, and they soon became close colleagues and friends. The relationship began when Cheney was a young, eager intern looking for a job in the Nixon White House. Rumsfeld -- having abandoned a brief career in Congress -- was director of the Office of Economic Opportunity. He hired Cheney as an aide -- the beginning of a Horatio Alger-like rise -- and their partnership shaped each other's careers for decades afterward. In the aftermath of Watergate, Rumsfeld became President Gerald Ford's chief of staff, and took Cheney with him as his ''stalwart assistant.'' When Rumsfeld was appointed secretary of defense in 1975, Cheney replaced him as Ford's chief. Both men were Republicans with conservative leanings. But for many years, during which they often served simultaneously, they seemed to many people to be smart, pragmatic, nonideological young men who fit well into the moderate Ford administration.
When Jimmy Carter became president in 1977, their paths diverged. Cheney was elected to Congress in 1978, where he remained throughout the Reagan administration. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush appointed him secretary of defense, where he became a competent and generally respected figure. Rumsfeld moved into the private sector and remained there for 24 years, while staying active in a wide range of public service committees and commissions.
After the first President Bush left office, Cheney also moved into the private sector, spending time at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington before becoming the C.E.O. of Halliburton, one of the largest oil and construction companies in the world, with connections to militaries in several countries. When George W. Bush chose him as his vice president in 2000, Cheney helped persuade the new president to name Rumsfeld as his secretary of defense. Following the election, there was considerable relief that Cheney and Rumsfeld would be serving the new president, given the doubts that were being voiced about Bush's capabilities. Even many Democrats were pleased that these competent, experienced figures would play a large role in the new administration.
Shortly before his election in 2000, when the vision of ''compassionate conservatism'' still seemed plausible, Bush said, ''I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, 'We do it this way; so should you.' '' But after the 9/11 attacks -- eight months into his presidency -- everything changed. ''We were embarking on a fundamentally new policy,'' Cheney recalled. ''We are dealing here with evil people.''
A group of Republican neoconservatives and other political and government figures quickly gathered not only to respond to the 9/11 attacks but also, as they saw it, to restore the nation's confidence and ideals. Cheney and Rumsfeld had privately deplored the decline of American power in the Nixon and Ford administrations during the Vietnam War. They saw in 9/11 an opportunity to revive American power and superiority, or as Cheney put it, to ''get it right this time.'' Much of what happened after the attacks would very likely have occurred no matter who was in charge -- the Patriot Act, the Department of Homeland Security, the building up of intelligence organizations and other changes. But from the start, Cheney and Rumsfeld began pushing for a much wider change, what the president called a ''war on terror.''
But what did a ''war on terror'' mean? For Cheney and many others, and eventually for President Bush, it seemed to mean only one thing -- a regime change that would send a message through the Middle East that, as Paul Wolfowitz predicted, would undermine radical regimes and build new ones more consistent with American /ideals. Although it was reasonably clear that no political regime had organized the 9/11 attacks, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Bush came to believe that the regime most in need of destruction was Iraq, even though there was no evidence that the Iraqis had played any role in the terrorist events. By late 2002, the Iraq war was on a fast track, justified by Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction. There was resistance from some members of Congress, some United Nations investigators and some individuals in the State Department. But Cheney and Rumsfeld, who were among the most determined people in the administration to promote the assault on Iraq, were not deterred by the fact that the United States had never before launched a pre-emptive war. Their public argument was the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. But it soon became clear that there were no such weapons.
This discovery caused a political earthquake worldwide. The war now seemed to have no rationale at all, but Cheney and Rumsfeld quickly came up with new ones. Cheney in particular takes no responsibility for this remarkable failure of intelligence. Instead, he argues that the absence of weapons did not make Iraq any less dangerous, and perhaps more. As he often does throughout his book, he argues through others -- in this case, David Kay, who worked on the Iraq survey group that was sent to find W.M.D.'s. Cheney quotes him: ''I actually think what we learned during the inspections made Iraq a more dangerous place, potentially, than in fact we thought it was even before the war.'' Charles Duelfer, another survey group member, insisted (with no visible evidence) that ''Saddam wanted to recreate Iraq's W.M.D. capability . . . after sanctions were removed.''
Rumsfeld brusquely dismisses his failure to provide sufficient troops to avoid what soon became an out-of-control insurgency that continued for years. He responds in his book, as he did at the time, ''Stuff happens,'' a phrase he often used when confronted by failures. Among the stuff that happened was the absence of body armor in a highly dangerous country. Soldiers begged for it in vain for months during his occasional visits to Iraq. Rumsfeld's response was that we had to fight with the Army we had. He is still fighting on the cheap, defending himself with his favorite phrase -- ''known unknowns'' (which is even borrowed for the title of his book). It allows him to claim that it was all but impossible to determine what the military needed. But he also presents himself as realistic enough to understand that Bush's ''Mission Accomplished'' banner and his claim that ''major combat operations in Iraq have ended'' would ''haunt his presidency until the day it ended.'' And he is candid enough to admit that he should have realized that the war would be a long and difficult one, that democracy in Iraq would be unlikely and that the American administrator in Iraq, Paul Bremer, had led the country into chaos by recklessly and incompetently disbanding the Iraqi police and military, and the Baath Party government.
The fact of a war of choice was perhaps bad enough. But the Iraq war (and the Afghanistan war as well) were fought not just by weapons and battles. They were also fought by torture. Rumsfeld brushes away the charges of torture in his book by noting either that the Defense Department did not participate, or that the techniques it employed were ''legal and humane.'' Cheney, however, makes clear from the start that ''we would have to work 'the dark side if you will,' '' a statement he continues to defend in his book.
Cheney insists that the ''enhanced interrogation'' that he helped create was not torture. Waterboarding, he has said, was humane and effective because a few lawyers in the Office of Legal Counsel said so. Many of their colleagues were aghast, but they were mostly ignored and in some cases dismissed. Even some high-ranking military officers called waterboarding criminal torture. So did Senators John McCain (no stranger to torture) and Lindsey Graham, both Republicans. Cheney passingly mentions other forms of enhanced interrogation in his book, but he does not describe what they were. Nor does he make any mention of the many terrorist suspects who were turned over through ''extraordinary rendition'' to other countries, where there was no inhibition to using torture.
By 2006, the Bush administration was falling apart. The president's poll numbers were falling almost by the day. Democrats were on their way to winning majorities in both houses of Congress. Cheney -- the most powerful vice president in American history -- was becoming an increasingly lonely figure within the White House. Bush decided to make changes -- in large part because of the administration's incompetent response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. (In his book, Cheney blames the failure on Kathleen Blanco, the Louisiana governor, for dithering.) Among the dismissed, over Cheney's strong objections, was Rumsfeld. (The president timidly delegated Cheney to give him the news. Rumsfeld stepped down without complaint.) Cheney, of course, could not be fired as vice president. But he had now become the most toxic figure in the White House.
Cheney's chief of staff and enforcer, Scooter Libby, was accused of leaking the identity of Valerie Plame, a C.I.A. operative, whose husband had challenged the claim that Hussein was building nuclear weapons. Libby was later convicted of perjury. The president commuted his sentence, but as Cheney writes, ''I felt strongly that Scooter deserved a pardon, and I broached the subject on numerous occasions with the president.'' In the last weeks of Bush's presidency, he asked again and, when denied, says that the president had made a ''grave error''; he told Bush, ''you are leaving a good man wounded on the field of battle.''
That was not the only time Cheney was repudiated. In 2007, Cheney pushed hard to bomb a nuclear reactor in Syria. When the president asked who agreed with the vice president, no one, including the president, raised a hand -- a hard defeat for a man whom Karl Rove had long called ''management.'' ''I was a lone voice,'' Cheney pathetically writes. (The Israelis successfully bombed the Syrian reactor several months later.) By then, Cheney was one of the most unpopular political figures in America, often ridiculed as ''Darth Vader.'' The polls showed an approval rating of 13 percent.
Cheney did not take his loss of power easily, and the final chapters of his book are filled with bile and contempt. It was no secret that he had been a critic of Colin Powell through much of Powell's tenure as secretary of state. He writes that Powell was ''not only failing to support the president's policies'' but was ''openly disdainful of them.'' (Some people in the foundering administration believed that ''the president's policies'' were often Cheney's.) He ''was particularly disappointed in the way'' Powell ''handled policy differences. Time and again I heard that he was opposed to the war in Iraq. . . . But never once in any meeting did I hear him voice objection.'' And he was at least equally contemptuous of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. She had, he writes, ''made concession after concession to the North Koreans and turned a blind eye to their misdeeds.'' Cheney consistently complains about what he considered her weaknesses. He also goes after Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, claiming that he was often speaking ''for himself and not reflecting U.S. policy.'' By the end, he even seems to be disappointed with Bush himself -- a disappointment that was probably reciprocated. Although Cheney is cautious in his criticism of the president, it seems clear that he thinks Bush had slipped back into what the vice president calls a pre-9/11 mode.
Brent Scowcroft, Gerald Ford's and George H. W. Bush's national security adviser, said about the man he had worked with in two previous administrations: ''Dick Cheney I don't know anymore.'' What had turned this capable, pragmatic, respected figure into the harsh and belligerent man who seemed toward the end to believe that only he understood the world of his time? Part of it was that he had become ''really conservative,'' as he told President Bush when he was invited to join the ticket in 2000. Certainly, he was convinced that 9/11 had dramatically changed the world and had radically transformed America's role in it. And he was disturbed that so many people did not share his views. He also had serious heart problems through much of his life, which intensified during his tenure as vice president, and though he courageously fought to keep going, his poor health may have contributed to what Scowcroft considered his change.
The angry responses to Cheney's book are evidence of how embattled the Bush White House became in its last years, and how central Cheney's role was. Colin Powell has accused Cheney of taking ''cheap shots'' in his book. He has challenged Cheney's claim that he had forced Powell out of the State Department. Powell himself had long made clear that he would serve only four years, and he charged Cheney with lying. Powell also called Cheney's statements in the book ''the kind of headline I would expect to come out of a gossip columnist.'' He added, ''I think Dick overshot the runway.'' Rice responded to Cheney by describing his book as ''utterly misleading'' and an ''attack on my integrity.'' Even Donald Trump, in the aftermath of his preposterous hints that he would run for president, gave an interview in which he accused Cheney of ''lying.''
Together, Rumsfeld and Cheney served through many crises and many disasters. It is not surprising that in the turbulent post-9/11 years there would be contention, disappointment, failure, sniping and broken friendships. If they had written candidly about these battles, their books would be of real interest. Instead, both men have stuck to their defensive postures. Cheney said in a television interview that his book would have ''heads exploding all over Washington.'' For the most part, the explosions were tame. But perhaps the most remarkable explosion was one of Cheney's own statements. Toward the end of his book, he boldly describes the Iraq war -- one of the most disastrous events of recent decades -- as a great American triumph. The fiasco that nearly destroyed Bush's presidency was, according to Cheney, ''one of the most significant accomplishments of George Bush's presidency -- the liberation of Iraq and the establishment of a true democracy in the Arab world.'' If that statement isn't an ''explosion,'' it would be hard to know what is.

HEADLINE: Why a Fallen Angel Is a Centerfold

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH. 
A writer at large for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE celebrity blogs and the tabloid news sites like TMZ have been all aflutter over reports that Lindsay Lohan, before landing a new jail sentence last week for skipping court-ordered janitorial service at a morgue, managed to find time to pose nude for Playboy magazine for close to a million dollars. Then a couple of dissenting reports said Ms. Lohan had agreed to only partial nudity, which was a distressing comment on the economy these days. What have we come to when a million dollars no longer purchases the complete Montague? Back in the '50s, when Playboy was just getting started, the going rate for a centerfold shoot was $500. 
It now appears that Ms. Lohan, said to be nearly broke, did strip down to her birthday suit, hardly a big deal, since lots of us have already seen most of it before. Last year Ms. Lohan posed topless for German GQ, and in 2008 she appeared draped only in some diaphanous scarves for a New York magazine spread that attempted to recreate Bert Stern's famous ''Last Sitting'' of Marilyn Monroe. Just a little fossicking on the Internet -- better done at home than at work, by the way -- will turn up dozens of additional shots of her in various stages of dishabille. The same is true, of course, for Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian and Britney Spears. Getting naked is practically part of the job description. It was a sex tape that started Ms. Kardashian's celebrity career before she became even more famous for getting married on a TV special and then filing for divorce last week after just 72 days.
If you were a boy growing up in the late '50s or early '60s, the Playboy centerfold pages were a breath-catching revelation: they were the first -- and for years, most likely the only -- glimpse you were apt to get of an actual naked female. Now we live in an age when nothing is left to the imagination, when teenagers text one another with naked photos of themselves, and when staggering amounts of pornography are available free on the Web. By Internet standards, and even by the standards of the other X-rated men's magazines -- a dwindling and increasingly unprofitable business these days -- the Playboy photo spreads are practically chaste. So why on earth would anyone think some glossy magazine photos of Lindsay Lohan, about whom we already know far too much -- her D.U.I.'s and failed rehabs, her shoplifting, her electronic ankle bracelet, her stumbling around in nightclubs, etc. -- were worth a million bucks?
The answer is precisely all that tabloid baggage she drags with her, and the spectacular way she has managed to derail her career, even outdoing Britney Spears in this regard. Her history certifies her as genuinely scandalous, rather than merely naughty, and brings a measure of real-life messiness to pages otherwise devoted to pneumatic, girl-next-door types who seemed to have accidentally shed their clothing on the way back from the library or from doing chores on the farm.
In the '90s Playboy twice featured Shannen Doherty, a star on ''Beverly Hills, 90210,'' for pretty much the same reason: she was the Lindsay Lohan of her era, a hard partier who could reliably be counted on to get sloppy and belligerent in clubs. Another famous centerfold with trashy, real-world credentials was Jessica Hahn, who was invited into Playboy after confessing to an affair with the televangelist Jim Bakker.
But the amount of notoriety borne by Ms. Lohan goes way beyond anything imaginable back then, before the Internet had fully flexed itself, and verges on the tragic. She is, we need to remember, a very talented young actress -- or she used to be. She's in the news every day not for that, nor even just because she's such good copy, but because we apparently need every now and then to turn a celebrity into a freak, the way we did with Ms. Spears.
The point of our fixation on celebrities these days is mostly to erase the gap between the celebs and us mere mortals: by telling us about their spats, their weight problems, their wardrobe malfunctions, the tabloids let us imagine that they're regular folks. Back in the heyday of the studio system, when the point was the unknowableness -- the starriness -- of the stars, they handled things differently, and Ms. Lohan would have been kept on a much tighter leash.
MS. LOHAN began her public career as someone who was spunky and adorable, but at some point she became the other kind of celebrity: not the ones we envy and pretend to intimacy with, but the ones we cringe from even as we remain avid for the latest dirt, which causes the paparazzi to hound them more relentlessly. We need these people to feel superior to -- and maybe sorry for -- and to remind us that the whole system is a little creepy and that celebrityhood exacts a toll most of us would be unwilling to pay.
The people who are calling Ms. Lohan's shoot the ruination of her career have got it wrong. Ruination would have been if she had accepted a reported million-dollar offer from a company called FleshLight, which wanted to manufacture sex toys from a mold taken of her lower anatomy. You could argue that Playboy is actually a step in the right direction -- toward what passes for class and decorum these days -- and that she will now join the likes of Drew Barrymore, Kim Basinger, Joan Collins, Margaux Hemingway, Margot Kidder, and Katarina Witt, all of whom posed for Playboy without any damage to their reputations whatsoever.
And there's a chance the pictures could actually be good, even if, according to the latest Lohan gossip, Playboy was initially dissatisfied and wanted to re-shoot. Those photos in New York were eerily effective because there is something Marilyn-like about Lindsay Lohan; beautiful, gifted and a needy, immature basket case. In the original photos, taken just weeks before her death, Monroe is blowsy and tousled, probably a little drunk; Ms. Lohan looked frightened, aged beyond her years and full of yearning for who knows what. Another chance maybe, or her vanished youth.
For a million dollars it shouldn't be too hard to capture some of that expression again on film, and if, after reading the articles, you want to go back and look at the rest of her -- well, that's what skin magazines used to be for. The Playboy retouchers may even succeed in restoring her not to innocence, exactly, but to something like what she was before we started learning way too much about her.
Correction: November 13, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis on Nov. 6 exploring why the actress Lindsay Lohan could command nearly $1 million to pose nude for Playboy misstated the circumstances under which nude photos of the actress Charlize Theron appeared in the magazine in 1999. The pictures of Ms. Theron were sold to Playboy by a third party, prompting a legal dispute. She did not pose nude for the magazine.

HEADLINE: And Now for Something Different

BYLINE: By CAROL GIACOMO

 BODY:
With international attention focused on the worsening European debt crisis, the economic, trade and security challenges in Asia have gotten less attention. That could change this week when President Obama hosts the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in his home state, Hawaii, on Saturday, before heading to Australia and then to Bali for the East Asia Summit. 
The biggest issue for the United States is how to counterbalance an increasingly assertive China -- and reassure its increasingly nervous neighbors -- while trying to cajole and goad Beijing into being a more responsible world player.
Mr. Obama is expected to make a case for expanding and liberalizing trade with other Pacific Rim countries, a position that has been made more credible now that Congress has finally passed a free-trade agreement with South Korea. When he meets President Hu Jintao, he should press him again to raise the value of China's currency. The expected announcement of a new military basing agreement with Australia, the appointment of a full-time American negotiator on North Korea and efforts to resolve disputes over the South China Sea are intended to show that the United States is not ceding anything.
Competition with China is inevitable, but Washington will also need to work with Beijing if there is to be any chance of reining in the nuclear appetites of North Korea and Iran. While the words and symbols of summits matter a lot, this is the very essence of geopolitical strategizing -- and the work of years to come.

HEADLINE: Less 'He Said, She Said' In Sex Harassment Cases

BYLINE: By HILARY STOUT

 BODY:
A PUBLIC figure at the top of his game is suddenly tripped up by reports that he sexually harassed female employees. Whispers ensue, speculation abounds, details are unclear, his statements shift.
Here we go again.
Twenty years after Anita Hill testified against Clarence Thomas in televised Senate hearings on his nomination to the Supreme Court, sexual harassment in the workplace is again part of the national conversation, prompting outrage as well as dismissive eye-rolling.
The latest allegations -- that Herman Cain, the leading Republican presidential candidate in many recent polls, made inappropriate remarks to former employees -- may lead one to ask: Has anything really changed?
The climate certainly has. There are vastly more formal sexual harassment claims being made now than in 1991, although such claims have dropped sharply since about 2008, just after the Great Recession started. 
The accusations against Mr. Cain involve incidents that took place during his tenure as head of the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. Their disclosure comes after years of efforts by many employers to institute explicit anti-harassment policies, management workshops and sensitivity training programs. By 1998, according to Catalyst, a nonprofit that researches the status of women in the workplace, 95 percent of large employers in the United States had instituted sexual harassment grievance policies and 70 percent had training programs.
Those changes follow the enactment of a federal law allowing sexual harassment victims to seek damage awards as well as back pay and reinstatement. That law went into effect soon after the Thomas hearings in the Senate.
Employment lawyers say that such measures have made a difference in attitudes toward sexual harassment.
''Most people have come to learn that it is legally wrongful,'' said Judith Resnik, a Yale law professor who teaches about equality and adjudication. ''There clearly was an era, a long era, when sexualized requests and aggression were seen as part of many men's prerogatives in the workplace.''
There have been shifts in recent years in the types and numbers of sexual harassment claims. E-mail and texting often figure in claims investigations. With more employees openly gay, there has been a noted increase in same-sex incidents. And the dismal state of the economy may be making some victims of harassment less willing to speak up.
After a jump in the number of sexual harassment complaints made to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and to state and local employment agencies through the 1990s and early 2000s, formal sexual harassment claims have decreased.
Preliminary figures from the commission for the 2011 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, show that the total number of harassment charges filed with federal, state or local agencies was lower than in any fiscal year since 1991. Charges totaled 8,341 in the 2011 fiscal year, a substantial drop from 13,867 in 2008, 12,696 in 2009 and 11,717 in 2010. By contrast, claims shot up in the year after the Thomas hearings, from 6,696 in the 1991 fiscal year to 10,532 in 1992. By 1995, the total was 15,549, a level that held essentially steady till the early 2000s.
Whether the drop in charges reflects a decline in harassment incidents or some other influence is unclear. (The numbers do not take into account grievances handled internally by an employer or that go directly to the courts.)
Lawyers who represent plaintiffs say they believe that the decline in complaints is linked to the economy's weakness. ''I think there's absolutely no doubt that claims are going down because people are more reluctant to bring claims against companies in this economy,'' said Janice Goodman, a New York employment lawyer who specializes in anti-discrimination law. ''That is something those of us practicing in this area have all felt.''
At the same time, the types of sexual harassment cases have been shifting.
The portion of sexual harassment charges filed by men, for example, has grown markedly, from 9.1 percent of all charges in the 1992 fiscal year to 16.4 percent in 2010. The commission does not track the sex of those named in complaints as harassers, but anecdotal evidence suggests that many of these cases involve men complaining about unwelcome advances from other men. And the commission has filed lawsuits in a number of male/male sexual harassment cases in the last few years.
In 2009, the national restaurant chain Cheesecake Factory Inc. settled a sexual harassment suit filed by the commission in which six male employees of a restaurant in Chandler, Ariz., said they were groped and subjected to sexually charged comments by other men on the kitchen staff. The company agreed to pay $345,000.
Same-sex harassment is not limited to men. Fran A. Sepler, president of Sepler & Associates, a Minneapolis firm that investigates harassment claims on behalf of employers, says she has examined about a dozen cases in recent years involving women harassing women. Often the situations are not explicitly sexual, she said.
''I have seen women in great positions of authority who make assumptions that the women who work for them are their friends,'' she said. ''They share intimate information with them -- their marital relations, their sex lives, whether they think the delivery guy is hot. They go shopping with them, they go into the dressing room with them. These women, in their mind, are exempted because they consider it a friendship. But it is bad boundaries.''
THE wide use of online technology has altered the texture of some forms of harassment, and sometimes makes it easier to document abuse.
Steven Foster, president and C.E.O. of Business Controls, a Denver-based company that investigates harassment claims for employers, says he is astonished by what people will say over company e-mail or send over employer-paid cellphones. ''It's also made it a hell of a lot easier for organizations to investigate,'' he said. He cited a recent investigation by his firm, involving male and female colleagues, as typical.
They were exchanging e-mail on a work-related matter. The man wrote something that the woman found funny. She wrote back and called him a ''dork.'' He responded, ''I love you too.''
Then, according to Mr. Foster, the man grew bolder. His next note suggested that he and the woman should spend more time together. The woman wrote back to say they already spent a lot of time together. The man's messages became increasingly explicit, Mr. Foster said. The woman finally told him that she had heard enough. ''But the man kept peppering her with quick messages,'' saying things like ''We could go live on an island'' or ''We could have kids,'' Mr. Foster said.
''Eventually she sent an e-mail saying, 'This is inappropriate, you need to stop,' and went to H.R.,'' Mr. Foster said. After his firm investigated, he said, the man was disciplined.
If there had been no e-mail record, and the exchange between the two had just been in conversation, he said, the outcome of the case might have been very different.
Mr. Foster compared that case with Ms. Hill's accusations about Mr. Thomas's behavior two decades ago. While she made them on national television, she had no electronic record of Mr. Thomas's actual words. ''They were verbal communications and only two people in the room,'' he said. ''It was a different situation and even years later people are trying to unpack it.''

HEADLINE: Car Sales Legalized, Cubans Turn Rust Into Gold

BYLINE: By VICTORIA BURNETT

 BODY:
HAVANA -- Until a few weeks ago, Erik Gonzalez's decrepit car did little more than devour his tiny income. He spent hundreds of dollars fixing the car, a 30-year-old Moskvich that his grandfather passed down to him in 2000. Even when it worked, Mr. Gonzalez could rarely afford to buy gas.
Then, overnight, the Soviet-made rattletrap became his nest egg.
Mr. Gonzalez put the car up for sale last month when the government published rules allowing Cubans to buy and sell used vehicles freely for the first time in half a century. 
The axle may be wonky, the carburetor shot, the battery on its last legs and the headlights inoperable, but he believes his royal-blue Moskvich will fetch at least $5,500, a small killing for a waiter whose state salary -- before tips and extras -- is just $15 a month.
''This car has been bleeding me dry,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. ''Now it's an asset that I can sell, and do something else with the money.''
Like the new law permitting home sales going into effect this week, the changes headline President Raul Castro's efforts to remodel Cuba's hobbled economy and spur the private sector. After decades in which ownership of such big-ticket items was frozen, the efforts promise to flush money into the market at a time when Cuban officials are trying to stimulate private enterprise and move hundreds of thousands of workers off the public payroll.
''The state has no business getting involved in a matter between two individuals,'' Mr. Castro told the National Assembly last December, criticizing complex rules and ''irrational prohibitions'' that he said bred corruption.
''If I have a little car,'' he added, ''I have the right to sell it to whomever I want.''
But like several of Mr. Castro's other changes, the new law created a pocket of economic liberty in a market that remains tightly controlled. Cubans can purchase and own more than one used vehicle, and they will no longer lose their car if they emigrate.
However, the right to buy a new car is still limited to a narrow group of Cubans who earn some foreign currency, including doctors, artists, musicians, members of airline flight crews and the handful of Cubans who work at the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay.
''There's no logic to these rules,'' said Leopoldo, a taxi driver who works the road between Havana and Guira de Melena, about 20 miles away, in a shiny 1985 Tatra. He asked that his full name not be used because he feared angering the authorities.
''But there's no logic to anything in this country,'' Leopoldo added. ''They have kept so many restrictions in place for so many years, you wouldn't expect them to lift them all in one go.''
Still, the new rules have created a buzz on an island where owning a car is a rare privilege and the number of vehicles per capita is among the lowest in the hemisphere.
For-sale signs have begun appearing in car windows. Many people who had bought cars illegally are scrambling to validate the trade. And Revolico, Cuba's answer to Craigslist, is replete with people promising to pay tens of thousands for a used Hyundai or Kia.
But the tight grip on imports means cars will remain scarce and command eye-popping prices, whatever their condition, economists and car brokers say.
''A car that in another country you'd pay to destroy, you can sell here for $14,000,'' said Paul Gomez Valladares, a mechanic who was fixing the bushings on a 1996 Lada Combi in a workshop shaded by mango trees.
Previously, Cubans could only legally trade cars that predate the 1959 revolution, hence the iconic American cars that still cruise the island's roads. But those are only a small fraction of the nation's used cars.
Islanders bought and sold cars on the sly, but it was a risky business that put off people like Mr. Gonzalez and made buyers wary of paying large sums for a vehicle they would not legally own.
Emilio Morales, president of the Miami-based Havana Consulting Group, said the new rules -- like earlier decisions to let Cubans own cellphones and computers or work in the private sector -- simply legalized what many Cubans were already doing illicitly and would neither increase Cuba's antiquated stock of vehicles nor alleviate the country's crushing transportation problem. The move was intended to placate people, not stimulate the economy, Mr. Morales said.
''This is one of their political pressure valves,'' he said.
While Mr. Morales, a senior executive at the huge Cuban state-owned company Cimex until 2006, acknowledged that the government did not yet have the infrastructure to organize a full-scale car market, he argued that it was most likely also reluctant to unsettle a longstanding system of privilege that rewarded workers in certain sectors.
Tight controls on imports have produced a curious -- and sparse -- mix of traffic that reflects Cuba's communist history. Oldsmobiles and Plymouths that are relics of the country's capitalist past now operate as taxis, a lucrative niche in Cuba's budding private sector. Luxury S.U.V.'s, driven by foreigners or by the artists and musicians who belong to the new economic elite, zip past Soviet cars that in the 1970s and 1980s were used to reward good workers or loyal functionaries.
Despite decades of communist prohibitions, the capitalist instincts of those playing the car market seem to be thriving.
The state charges $28,000 for a new Hyundai Accent. But a Cuban lucky enough to get a permit to buy one can then resell it for about $10,000 more on the used-car market, according to one broker. The permit alone can sell on the black market for $4,000 to $10,000, according to car owners, mechanics and brokers.
''Prices here are absurd, but the street is what determines the price,'' said Alejandro, an aviation worker who is selling his 2008 Hyundai Accent for $30,000 but did not want to give his full name for fear of attracting attention. ''What you're paying for is not the car itself, it's the privilege of owning one.''
Such prices seem outlandish in a country where the average monthly wage is about $20 (though people receive free health care, education and other subsidies). But economists and brokers say there is a community of flush car buyers who receive money from relatives overseas, or from successful private businesses, farming or black market trade. Alexis, a broker near Havana, said more Cubans living overseas were buying cars in their relatives' names to use when they visited the island.
For Fidel Alfonso, who struggles to keep his 1949 Plymouth on the road, the enormous premium on a ''modern'' vehicle -- that is, one made in the past 10 to 15 years -- means he is condemned to forever drive a rust-bucket.
''I could sell this car, but all I could buy with the money would be something equally terrible,'' said Mr. Alfonso, who believes he could sell his car for about $4,500. ''Until the government allows us to buy new cars without restrictions, prices will be unrealistic.''
Mr. Gonzalez, the Moskvich owner, is not waiting to find out.
''It's a bubble,'' he said. ''I have to take advantage of it.''
He said he would use the proceeds to build a new kitchen and fix up his house in a gritty Havana suburb, and then put some money aside for a restaurant he hoped to open with friends.
''If the restaurant is successful, maybe in two or three years I could buy myself a new car,'' he said. ''Just not a Moskvich.''

HEADLINE: Our Reckless Meritocracy

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
HERE is a story about the promise of America. A boy grows up in rural Illinois, the grandson of a farmer who lost everything in the Great Depression. He goes to his small-town high school and then attends his state university, where he walks onto the basketball team and graduates Phi Beta Kappa. He does a stint in the Marine Corps Reserves, gets his M.B.A. and then goes to work for one of the Midwest's regional banks.
In a different era, he might have stayed there for the rest of his career. But he's lucky enough to be coming up in the 1960s and '70s, just as the WASP elite is fading and the big East Coast institutions are opening their doors to strivers from all over. So our Illinois farm boy climbs and keeps on climbing. 
He moves to New Jersey and goes to work for Goldman Sachs. He rises to become the company's C.E.O., and a millionaire many times over. He goes into politics, winning a term in the United States Senate and then getting elected governor of New Jersey. When Barack Obama wins the White House, he's discussed as a candidate for Treasury secretary. And when he loses his re-election bid, he returns to Wall Street as the head of a financial services company.
By now you may have guessed that I'm talking about Jon Corzine. If so, you probably know that his inspiring story has an unhappy ending -- for New Jersey, which faced an enormous budgetary mess when Corzine left office; for his latest Wall Street firm, MF Global, which filed for bankruptcy last week after somehow mislaying some $600 million in customer money; and for the former farm boy himself, who resigned on Friday in disgrace.
But this sudden fall from grace doesn't make Corzine's life story any less emblematic of our meritocratic era. Indeed, his rise, recklessness and ruin are all of a piece. For decades, the United States has been opening paths to privilege for its brightest and most determined young people, culling the best and the brightest from Illinois and Mississippi and Montana and placing them in positions of power in Manhattan and Washington. By elevating the children of farmers and janitors as well as lawyers and stockbrokers, we've created what seems like the most capable, hardworking, high-I.Q. elite in all of human history.
And for the last 10 years, we've watched this same elite lead us off a cliff -- mostly by being too smart for its own good.
In hereditary aristocracies, debacles tend to flow from stupidity and pigheadedness: think of the Charge of the Light Brigade or the Battle of the Somme. In one-party states, they tend to flow from ideological mania: think of China's Great Leap Forward, or Stalin's experiment with ''Lysenkoist'' agriculture.
In meritocracies, though, it's the very intelligence of our leaders that creates the worst disasters. Convinced that their own skills are equal to any task or challenge, meritocrats take risks than lower-wattage elites would never even contemplate, embark on more hubristic projects, and become infatuated with statistical models that hold out the promise of a perfectly rational and frictionless world. (Or as Calvin Trillin put it in these pages, quoting a tweedy WASP waxing nostalgic for the days when Wall Street was dominated by his fellow bluebloods: ''Do you think our guys could have invented, say, credit default swaps? Give me a break! They couldn't have done the math.'')
Inevitably, pride goeth before a fall. Robert McNamara and the Vietnam-era whiz kids thought they had reduced war to an exact science. Alan Greenspan and Robert Rubin thought that they had done the same to global economics. The architects of the Iraq war thought that the American military could liberate the Middle East from the toils of history; the architects of the European Union thought that a common currency could do the same for Europe. And Jon Corzine thought that his investment acumen equipped him to turn a second-tier brokerage firm into the next Goldman Sachs, by leveraging big, betting big and waiting for the payoff.
What you see in today's Republican primary campaign is a reaction to exactly these kinds of follies -- a revolt against the ruling class that our meritocracy has forged, and a search for outsiders with thinner resumes but better instincts.
But from Michele Bachmann to Herman Cain, the outsiders haven't risen to the challenge. It will do America no good to replace the arrogant with the ignorant, the overconfident with the incompetent.
In place of reckless meritocrats, we don't need feckless know-nothings. We need intelligent leaders with a sense of their own limits, experienced people whose lives have taught them caution. We still need the best and brightest, but we need them to have somehow learned humility along the way.

HEADLINE: Why Science Majors Change Their Mind

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW. 
Christopher Drew covers military technology for The Times.

 BODY:
LAST FALL, President Obama threw what was billed as the first White House Science Fair, a photo op in the gilt-mirrored State Dining Room. He tested a steering wheel designed by middle schoolers to detect distracted driving and peeked inside a robot that plays soccer. It was meant as an inspirational moment: children, science is fun; work harder.
Politicians and educators have been wringing their hands for years over test scores showing American students falling behind their counterparts in Slovenia and Singapore. How will the United States stack up against global rivals in innovation? The president and industry groups have called on colleges to graduate 10,000 more engineers a year and 100,000 new teachers with majors in STEM -- science, technology, engineering and math. All the Sputnik-like urgency has put classrooms from kindergarten through 12th grade -- the pipeline, as they call it -- under a microscope. And there are encouraging signs, with surveys showing the number of college freshmen interested in majoring in a STEM field on the rise. 
But, it turns out, middle and high school students are having most of the fun, building their erector sets and dropping eggs into water to test the first law of motion. The excitement quickly fades as students brush up against the reality of what David E. Goldberg, an emeritus engineering professor, calls ''the math-science death march.'' Freshmen in college wade through a blizzard of calculus, physics and chemistry in lecture halls with hundreds of other students. And then many wash out.
Studies have found that roughly 40 percent of students planning engineering and science majors end up switching to other subjects or failing to get any degree. That increases to as much as 60 percent when pre-medical students, who typically have the strongest SAT scores and high school science preparation, are included, according to new data from the University of California at Los Angeles. That is twice the combined attrition rate of all other majors.
For educators, the big question is how to keep the momentum being built in the lower grades from dissipating once the students get to college.
''We're losing an alarming proportion of our nation's science talent once the students get to college,'' says Mitchell J. Chang, an education professor at U.C.L.A. who has studied the matter. ''It's not just a K-12 preparation issue.''
Professor Chang says that rather than losing mainly students from disadvantaged backgrounds or with lackluster records, the attrition rate can be higher at the most selective schools, where he believes the competition overwhelms even well-qualified students.
''You'd like to think that since these institutions are getting the best students, the students who go there would have the best chances to succeed,'' he says. ''But if you take two students who have the same high school grade-point average and SAT scores, and you put one in a highly selective school like Berkeley and the other in a school with lower average scores like Cal State, that Berkeley student is at least 13 percent less likely than the one at Cal State to finish a STEM degree.''
The bulk of attrition comes in engineering and among pre-med majors, who typically leave STEM fields if their hopes for medical school fade. There is no doubt that the main majors are difficult and growing more complex. Some students still lack math preparation or aren't willing to work hard enough.
Other deterrents are the tough freshman classes, typically followed by two years of fairly abstract courses leading to a senior research or design project. ''It's dry and hard to get through, so if you can create an oasis in there, it would be a good thing,'' says Dr. Goldberg, who retired last year as an engineering professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and is now an education consultant. He thinks the president's chances of getting his 10,000 engineers is ''essentially nil.''
In September, the Association of American Universities, which represents 61 of the largest research institutions, announced a five-year initiative to encourage faculty members in the STEM fields to use more interactive teaching techniques.
''There is a long way to go,'' says Hunter R. Rawlings, the association's president, ''and there is an urgent need to accelerate the process of reform.''
The latest research also suggests that there could be more subtle problems at work, like the proliferation of grade inflation in the humanities and social sciences, which provides another incentive for students to leave STEM majors. It is no surprise that grades are lower in math and science, where the answers are clear-cut and there are no bonus points for flair. Professors also say they are strict because science and engineering courses build on one another, and a student who fails to absorb the key lessons in one class will flounder in the next.
After studying nearly a decade of transcripts at one college, Kevin Rask, then a professor at Wake Forest University, concluded last year that the grades in the introductory math and science classes were among the lowest on campus. The chemistry department gave the lowest grades over all, averaging 2.78 out of 4, followed by mathematics at 2.90. Education, language and English courses had the highest averages, ranging from 3.33 to 3.36.
Ben Ost, a doctoral student at Cornell, found in a similar study that STEM students are both ''pulled away'' by high grades in their courses in other fields and ''pushed out'' by lower grades in their majors.
MATTHEW MONIZ bailed out of engineering at Notre Dame in the fall of his sophomore year. He had been the kind of recruit most engineering departments dream about. He had scored an 800 in math on the SAT and in the 700s in both reading and writing. He also had taken Calculus BC and five other Advanced Placement courses at a prep school in Washington, D.C., and had long planned to major in engineering.
But as Mr. Moniz sat in his mechanics class in 2009, he realized he had already had enough. ''I was trying to memorize equations, and engineering's all about the application, which they really didn't teach too well,'' he says. ''It was just like, 'Do these practice problems, then you're on your own.' '' And as he looked ahead at the curriculum, he did not see much relief on the horizon.
So Mr. Moniz, a 21-year-old who likes poetry and had enjoyed introductory psychology, switched to a double major in psychology and English, where the classes are ''a lot more discussion based.'' He will graduate in May and plans to be a clinical psychologist. Of his four freshman buddies at Notre Dame, one switched to business, another to music. One of the two who is still in engineering plans to work in finance after graduation.
Mr. Moniz's experience illustrates how some of the best-prepared students find engineering education too narrow and lacking the passion of other fields. They also see easier ways to make money.
Notre Dame's engineering dean, Peter Kilpatrick, will be the first to concede that sophomore and junior years, which focus mainly on theory, remain a ''weak link'' in technical education. He says his engineering school has gradually improved its retention rate over the past decade by creating design projects for freshmen and breaking ''a deadly lecture'' for 400 students into groups of 80. Only 50 to 55 percent of the school's students stayed through graduation 10 years ago. But that figure now tops 75 percent, he says, and efforts to create more labs in the middle years could help raise it further.
''We're two years into that experiment and, quite honestly, it's probably going to take 5 to 10 years before we're really able to inflesh the whole curriculum with this project-based learning,'' Dean Kilpatrick says.
No one doubts that students need a strong theoretical foundation. But what frustrates education experts is how long it has taken for most schools to make changes.
The National Science Board, a public advisory body, warned in the mid-1980s that students were losing sight of why they wanted to be scientists and engineers in the first place. Research confirmed in the 1990s that students learn more by grappling with open-ended problems, like creating a computer game or designing an alternative energy system, than listening to lectures. While the National Science Foundation went on to finance pilot courses that employed interactive projects, when the money dried up, so did most of the courses. Lecture classes are far cheaper to produce, and top professors are focused on bringing in research grants, not teaching undergraduates.
In 2005, the National Academy of Engineering concluded that ''scattered interventions'' had not resulted in widespread change. ''Treating the freshman year as a 'sink or swim' experience and accepting attrition as inevitable,'' it said, ''is both unfair to students and wasteful of resources and faculty time.''
Since becoming Notre Dame's dean in 2008, Dr. Kilpatrick has revamped and expanded a freshman design course that had gotten ''a little bit stale.'' The students now do four projects. They build Lego robots and design bridges capable of carrying heavy loads at minimal cost. They also create electronic circuit boards and dream up a project of their own.
''They learn how to work with their hands, how to program the robot and how to work with design constraints,'' he says. But he also says it's inevitable that students will be lost. Some new students do not have a good feel for how deeply technical engineering is. Other bright students may have breezed through high school without developing disciplined habits. By contrast, students in China and India focus relentlessly on math and science from an early age.
''We're in a worldwide competition, and we've got to retain as many of our students as we can,'' Dean Kilpatrick says. ''But we're not doing kids a favor if we're not teaching them good life and study skills.''
WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE, in Massachusetts, one of the nation's oldest technological schools, has taken the idea of projects to heart. While it still expects students to push their way through standard engineering and science classes, it ripped up its traditional curriculum in the 1970s to make room for extensive research, design and social-service projects by juniors and seniors, including many conducted on trips with professors overseas. In 2007, it added optional first-year projects -- which a quarter of its freshmen do -- focused on world problems like hunger or disease.
''That kind of early engagement, and letting them see they can work on something that is interesting and important, is a big deal,'' says Arthur C. Heinricher, the dean of undergraduate studies. ''That hooks students.''
And so late this past summer, about 90 freshmen received e-mails asking if they typically received flu vaccines. The e-mails were not from the health services office, but from students measuring how widely flu spreads at different rates of vaccination. Two of the students had spent part of their freshmen year researching diseases and devising a survey. Now, as juniors, they were recruiting the newcomers to take part in simulations, using neon wristbands and stickers, to track how many of them became ''infected'' as they mingled during orientation.
Brenna Pugliese, one of the juniors and a biology major, says the two-day exercise raised awareness on campus of the need for more students to get the vaccine. ''I can honestly say that I learned more about various biology topics than I ever learned in any other class,'' she says.
Teachers say they have been surprised by the sophistication of some of the freshmen projects, like a device to harvest kinetic energy that is now being patented. But the main goals are to enable students to work closely with faculty members, build confidence and promote teamwork. Studies have shown that women, in particular, want to see their schoolwork is connected to helping people, and the projects help them feel more comfortable in STEM fields, where men far outnumber women everywhere except in biology.
Seventy-four percent of W.P.I. undergraduates earn bachelor's degrees within four years and 80 percent by six years.
Most of the top state research universities have added at least a splash of design work in the freshman year. The University of Illinois began this fall to require freshmen engineering students to take a course on aspirations for the profession and encourages them to do a design project or take a leadership seminar. Most technical schools push students to seek summer internships and take semesters off to gain practical work experiences. The hope is that the lure of high-paying jobs during an economic downturn will convince more students to stick with it.
Some private schools have also adjusted their grading policies to ease some of the pressure on STEM students. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has long given freshmen only ''pass'' or ''no record'' grades in the first half of the year while they get used to the workload. W.P.I. lets undergraduates take up to three classes for which no grade is recorded if they would have received less than a C. Any required courses would have to be repeated.
Ilea Graedel, a 20-year-old junior in aerospace engineering, says that policy provides ''a nice buffer if you want to try something new, like a class outside your comfort zone.''
But what really helps Ms. Graedel get through the rigors of STEM, she says, is hanging onto her aspirations. She grew up in a farming area in Washington State, the only student from her high school class of 26 pursuing a technology degree. She has wanted to be an astronaut since she was 3, when her mother took her to Boeing's Museum of Flight in Seattle and bought her a book called ''I Want to Be an Astronaut.''
The space program has been sharply cut back. Still, she says, ''I'm going to hold onto that dream very dearly.''

D. Burning down a nearby Papa John's.
Answers
1. (A) Ms. Kardashian reaped around $18 million in income and sponsorships for her August wedding to the N.B.A. player Kris Humphries, and remained married to him for 72 days. Thus, about $2,000 for each hour of wedded bliss. Noting the remarkable return on that investment, the nation of Greece immediately proposed.
2. (B) On ''The Colbert Report,'' Governor Huntsman demonstrated his fluent Chinese skills by asking Mr. Colbert to be his running mate, in Mandarin. But Chinese speakers translated his remarks as, ''I Really Want You to Do My Vice-America President.''
3. (D) Mr. Berlusconi's fourth album of original songs was to be released last year, but he's had to delay it, because of his country's financial troubles, and his being charged with various sex crimes. He says he still plans for his band Bunga Bunga to open for Chumbawumba in 2012.
4. (A) Mr. Perry's speech in Manchester, N.H., led many in the media to question whether he had a shot of courage before addressing the crowd. The group that hosted the event insisted that the governor was merely ''animated,'' as in, ''that guy is falling down animated.''
5. (A) Scientists at an Army lab have created a new beef jerky stick that contains as much caffeine as a cup of coffee to ''give even the sleepiest soldier that up-and-at-'em boost.'' Always on the cutting edge, Starbucks will soon release the Frothy Beefachino.
6. (D) Seems smart enough -- when business is struggling, eliminate the competition. So when a Florida Papa John's burned to the ground last week, police officers traced the fire to two young managers at a nearby Domino's -- who claimed they were only trying to increase profits and win the coveted ''arsonist of the month'' award.

HEADLINE: Can Anyone Really Create Jobs?

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is the cofounder of NPR's Planet Money, a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
The current economic downturn has been called a housing crisis, a financial crisis and a debt crisis, but the simplifying logic of the political season has settled on what is really more a result than a cause. We are now, according to nearly everyone running for office, in a jobs crisis. Every politician currently has a ''jobs plan,'' very often a list of vague proposals filled with serious-sounding phrases like ''budget framework'' and ''regulatory cap'' that are designed, for the most part, to mean both everything and nothing at all.
Starting this week, I'll be writing a regular column in the magazine that tries to demystify complicated economic issues -- like whether anyone (C.E.O.'s, politicians, people running for the presidency) can actually create jobs. The fact is that creating them in a far-too-sluggish economy is practically impossible in our current capitalist democracy. No corporate leader is rewarded for hiring people who aren't absolutely required. Most companies hire only when its workforce can no longer keep up with the demand for its products. 
Even with all the attention on hiring, the government's ability to create jobs is pretty dispiriting, no matter who is in charge. The most popular types of jobs programs involve state tax breaks or subsidies that seek to seduce a company from one state to another. While this can mean good news for ''business-friendly'' states like Texas, such policies don't add to overall employment so much as they just shuffle jobs around. This helps explain Rick Perry's claim that more than one million jobs were created under his watch in Texas while the rest of the country lost more than two million.
The federal government does something similar when it decides, for instance, to regulate oil drillers and subsidize windmill makers. Such a policy might help the environment but it just moves jobs from one sector to another without adding any. And while both Perry and Mitt Romney propose that further oil and gas drilling in the U.S. will transform the jobs picture, only 30,000 Americans work in oil and gas extraction, and about another 125,000 in support occupations. With more than 25 million Americans unemployed or underemployed, it's unlikely that any changes in that part of the energy sector would make a real dent.
One reason we have so few ideas about job creation is that up until recently, the U.S. economy had been growing so well for so long that few economists spent much time studying it. (They're trying to make up for it now. See this chart.) With no new theories, Democrats dusted off the big idea from the Great Depression, John Maynard Keynes's view that government can create jobs by spending a lot of money. The stimulus, however, has to be borrowed, and it has to be really, truly huge -- probably something like $1.5 or $2 trillion -- to fill the gap between where the economy is and where it would be if everyone was spending at pre-recession levels. The goal is to goad consumers into spending again. And President Obama's jettisoned $400 billion jobs package, hard-core Keynesians argue, is nowhere near what it would take to persuade them.
Many Republicans follow the more fiscally conservative University of Chicago School, which argues that Keynesian stimulus can't heal a sick economy -- only time can. Chicagoans believe that economies can only truly recover on their own and that policy interventions only slow the recovery. It's a puzzle of modern politics that Republicans have had electoral success with a policy that fundamentally asserts there is nothing the government can do to create jobs any time soon.
Of course, Romney, Perry, Herman Cain and the rest won't come out and say, ''If elected, I will tell you to wait this thing out.'' Instead, Republican candidates fill their jobs plans with Chicagoan ideas that have nothing to do with the current crisis, like permanent cuts in taxes and regulation. These policies may (or may not) make the economy healthier in 5 years or 10, but the immediate impact would require firing a large number of America's roughly 23 million government workers.
How bad might that be? The U.K., as part of its austerity measures, is in the process of firing about a half-million government workers under the notion that the private sector would be so thrilled by low taxes and less regulation that it will expand and snatch up all those laid-off public servants. But this plainly isn't happening. The British economy continues to grow slowly, if at all, and few former government workers have found new jobs in the private sector.
Keynesians and Chicagoans, however, do agree on two important points. First, in economics, unlike politics, there's no middle ground: You can't simultaneously cut and increase government budgets. The only shot we have at truly transforming our economy is a one-party sweep in the 2012 elections that would lead to radical legislative changes. Still, either path -- lots more debt or lots of fired government workers -- will only inflame more Americans.
The second area of agreement is the most important: an economy is truly healthy only when its people know how to make and do things that others will pay them a decent amount for. Jobs, in other words, are not the cause of a healthy economy; they're the byproduct. And that's another thing most national politicians know but will never say.
So perhaps instead of (or, at least, in addition to) arguing over plans that aren't going to happen, we should focus on what almost certainly will come true. The economy that emerges from this recession is going to be different. Without the distortion of a credit bubble, it is clear that far too many Americans don't know how to do anything that the world is willing to pay them a living wage for. No economic theory offers them easy salvation.
We don't need to become a nation of app designers. An economic downturn is a great time to learn things -- carpentry, say, or aerospace engineering -- that others will eventually pay for: high-school dropouts should get their degrees and a year of specialized training; high-school grads who can't afford a four-year school should get a community-college degree. Life will be tougher for liberal-arts majors if they don't get training in how to apply a humanities education. Those who can't find a job where they live should consider moving to places where there are more jobs than applicants -- the Dakotas, Nebraska, Wyoming.
When this crisis ends, we'll also be faced with other deep problems. Our tax code is a complex mess; we need a more effective education system; it's hard to picture a healthy United States in 2050 without some major change in health care. Unlike the short-term jobs crisis, these are areas where we can find compromise. Let's not do what we usually do by spending the bad times arguing over things that won't happen and the good times ignoring the things that should.

HEADLINE: I Do, Briefly

 BODY:
IN Hollywood, Monday's announcement from Kim Kardashian, that she had filed for divorce from the basketball player Kris Humphries, fell decidedly short of making a mark in the annals of short celebrity marriages. Seventy-two days is no record. Still, the hoopla served its purpose, in part, by advancing the plotline of the bride's reality show, ''Keeping Up With the Kardashians.''
The record books are full of other couples whose marriages dissolved before the wedding china got chipped. Carmen Electra and the rambunctious athlete Dennis Rodman were married in 1998 for nine days, which is 24 hours more than Michelle Phillips and Dennis Hopper endured as wife and husband in 1970. 
''It was a crazy period,'' Ms. Phillips said of her whirlwind eight-day marriage in an interview on TVOntario, an educational broadcasting network in Canada. ''I was caught up by Dennis's energy.''
Lisa Marie Presley and Nicolas Cage, and Renee Zellweger and Kenny Chesney toughed it out for three months and four months, respectively. Pamela Anderson and Kid Rock set a benchmark of 115 days.
At 19, Drew Barrymore spent all of six weeks wedded to a Welsh bartender. Britney Spears was 22 when she spontaneously married a childhood friend in Las Vegas. Ms. Spears filed for an annulment 55 hours later.
Even more abbreviated was the 1919 wedlock between Rudolph Valentino and the vaudeville actress Jean Acker. The couple reportedly parted ways six hours after the Los Angeles ceremony, when Ms. Acker locked the silent screen star out of their hotel room.
Celebrities may be prone to hasty nuptials, but the seven-month itch is not just a famous-person phenomenon.
''Marriages that end early are actually the norm in the United States,'' said Thomas Bradbury, a psychology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies how newlyweds handle the first several years following the wedding. ''The level of instability early on is relatively high, and most divorces happen in the first three years.''
Unlike Ms. Kardashian and Mr. Humphries, however, most couples do not have more than $50,000 worth of wedding gifts to return or divide. On Tuesday night, Ms. Kardashian somewhat settled the matter when she wrote on her blog, ''I'm so grateful to everyone who took the time to come to my wedding and I'll be donating the money for all the gifts to the Dream Foundation.''
As of Friday, the couple's wedding registry was still active on the Web site of Gearys Beverly Hills, where a Baccarat Cosmos vase could be bought for $7,850.
''I would recommend that they close off the registry because that doesn't make any sense,'' said the etiquette expert Peggy Post, a director of the Emily Post Institute who also writes the online Well-Mannered Wedding column for The New York Times. Ms. Post added that protocol called for Ms. Kardashian and Mr. Humphries to return their wedding gifts with thank-you notes.
Raoul Felder, a celebrity divorce lawyer in New York and the author, with Barbara Victor, of ''The Good Divorce: How to Walk Away Financially Sound and Emotionally Happy,'' anticipates a legal fallout for the estranged reality star and the athlete.
''Who knows the story on whether or not that ring was given to them for publicity purposes,'' said Mr. Felder, speaking of the 20.5-carat engagement ring Mr. Humphries proposed with back in May. ''I think there are lots of people sitting with lots of lawyers around the country, saying 'This marriage was supposed to be a commercial and economic enterprise, not a joke.' ''
Or, at the very least, a joke with a much longer punch line.

HEADLINE: Handicapping Obama 2012

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
Americans are usually forgiving when they vote a man into the White House and he wants a second term. Of the last eight elected presidents, all but two -- George H. W. Bush and Jimmy Carter -- got their four more years. Which is why the conventional wisdom long held that Barack Obama would most likely weather his midpresidency slump to win another term.
Then came the debt-ceiling debates of July and August, which seemed to crystallize Obama's vulnerabilities in a way that even the Democrats' midterm disaster of 2010 did not. It's probably because he handled the situation so poorly, simultaneously managing to annoy his base, frustrate swing voters, concede a major policy victory to Republicans and -- through the fear imported into the market by the brinksmanship in Congress and the credit-rating downgrade that followed -- further imperil the economic recovery. On Aug. 12, a week and a half after the debate ended in Congress, Obama's stock on Intrade, a popular political betting market, dipped below 50 percent for the first time. It has hovered just below the 50 percent threshold, usually at about 48 percent, ever since. 
Obama has gone from a modest favorite to win re-election to, probably, a slight underdog. Let's not oversell this. A couple of months of solid jobs reports, or the selection of a poor Republican opponent, would suffice to make him the favorite again.
Nevertheless, this is an unusual circumstance. Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, Clinton and both Bushes all looked like the favorite to win a year in advance of their re-election battles, either having strong approval ratings or good-enough ones accompanied by robust economic numbers. When we look at the last eight elected presidents, only Carter faced a situation worse than Obama's: approval ratings in the low 30s rather than low 40s, the likelihood rather than the mere possibility of a recession, a primary challenge rather than a clear path to renomination and a crisis in Iran rather than a string of foreign-policy victories.
The other seven had stronger fundamentals heading into the election year. This includes the elder Bush, who lost despite an extremely high approval rating and a disarrayed Democratic field (Mario Cuomo and others skipped the race at a time when Bush appeared unbeatable). It also includes Reagan and Clinton, who had grave problems early in their terms but who saw their numbers tick upward at the very moment in their presidencies that Obama's have continued to slide. None of this is news to the White House. Following the debt-ceiling debate, Obama's strategists started comparing their boss with the original comeback kid, Harry Truman -- an implicit concession that the president will most likely fight 2012 from behind.
The fundamental flaw with much of what passes for political analysis is the tendency to think small. I blame soccer moms for this. Not the moms themselves -- or their more rough-and-tumble companions from four years later, Nascar dads -- but the narrow worldview that these demographic labels represent. The sophomoric strategist thinks he can slice the American electorate into a million little pieces and make it more than the sum of its parts. The smart one recognizes our common bonds.
A recent example of the flawed type of thinking came in September, after Democrats lost a special election to fill Anthony Weiner's old seat in a Brooklyn district with a heavy concentration of Orthodox Jewish voters. There was much commentary about Obama's popularity among Jewish Americans and about what this could mean -- most importantly for his prospects in Florida.
Obama does indeed have a ''Jewish problem.'' Polls find that his standing among Jews has deteriorated: only about 54 percent of them approved of his performance in the most recent Gallup survey. But this is to be expected when a president has a 40-something approval rating. He also has a Hispanic problem and a problem among the white working class. He has a problem in Ohio and a problem in Florida and a problem in New Hampshire. He even has, to a mild extent, an African-American problem: Obama's approval ratings among black voters are still high, but down to about 80 percent from 90 percent.
All of these, however, are symptoms of Obama's larger problems, a set of three fundamental misgivings shared by much of the American electorate.
First, many of us understand that Barack Obama inherited a terrible predicament. We have a degree of sympathy for the man. But we have concerns, which have been growing over time, about whether he's up to the job. Second, most of us are gravely concerned about the economy. We're not certain what should be done about it, but we're frustrated. Third, enough of us are prepared to vote against Obama that he could easily lose. It doesn't mean we will, but we might if the Republican represents a credible alternative and fits within the broad political mainstream.
Each of these factors, in turn, can be quantified.
The first factor, Americans' performance reviews of Obama, can be measured through his approval ratings. The second factor, economic performance, can be measured through statistics like G.D.P. The third factor -- essentially, the ideological positioning of the Republican candidate -- is sometimes thought of as an ''intangible.'' But it can be measured too, and it matters a great deal.
As we get closer to the election and more data become available, we can indulge -- even encourage! -- greater complexity in the analysis. Figuring out how Obama is performing in individual states and how this translates to the Electoral College, for instance, requires a fair amount of attention to detail. But it is premature to do that now. Instead we should think big, and focus on the three fundamentals.
APPROVAL RATINGS
A president's approval rating at the beginning of his third year in office has historically had very little correlation to his eventual fate. In January 1983, Reagan had an approval rating of just 37 percent, but he won in a landslide. George H. W. Bush had a 79 percent approval rating in January 1991 and was soundly defeated. But voters start to think differently about a president over the course of his third year; they view him more on the basis of his performance and less on the hopes they had for him. These perceptions are sharpened by the beginning of the opposition party's primary campaign, which, of course, accentuates the negatives.
A president's approval rating toward the end of his third year, therefore, has been a decent (although imperfect) predictor of his chances of victory. Reagan saw his approval rating shoot up to 51 percent in November 1983 amid the V-shaped recovery from the recession of the previous year -- the first sign that he was headed for a big win. Obama's approval rating may have rebounded by a point or two from its lows after the debt-ceiling debacle -- but not by much more than that. In late October, it ranged between 40 and 46 percent in different polls and averaged about 43 percent.
There have been two presidents stuck with similarly low approval ratings a year in advance of the next election. Gerald Ford had a 44 percent approval rating a year before his loss to Carter. Johnson had a 41 percent approval rating in November 1967, and although he was eligible for another term, he opted not to run. His vice president, Hubert H. Humphrey, did, and he lost.
In fact, since 1944 (when approval ratings first became reliable), there have been five cases in which the incumbent party's president had an approval rating below 49 percent a year ahead of the election -- as Obama almost certainly will, unless he finds the cure for cancer after our issue goes to print -- and each time the incumbent party lost.
It would be possible, however, to draw some improper conclusions from this. The more robust way to analyze these data is not just to consider the winners and losers, but also their margins of victory or defeat. Ford and Humphrey (serving as Johnson's surrogate) may have lost their elections, but not by much -- Ford by just 2 points, and Humphrey by 1. The correct conclusion, then, is that other factors being equal, an approval rating in the low 40s a year before the election makes a president a slight but not overwhelming underdog.
If Obama's approval ratings were in the low 30s or worse instead of the 40s, that would be another story. The three presidents to fit this description -- Carter in 1979, George W. Bush in 2007 and Harry Truman in 1951 -- saw their parties take big defeats the next year. It would also be another matter if Obama's approval rating were closer to 50 percent. Of the six presidents to have approval ratings in that range a year ahead of the election -- Nixon, Clinton, Bush the younger, Truman in 1947 and Reagan in 1983 and 1987 (with Bush the elder running as his proxy in the latter case) -- all six won.
As you go farther up the approval-ratings chart, you begin to see exceptions to the rule: George H. W. Bush's approval ratings were still high in late 1991, but he lost. So were Bill Clinton's in 1999 and Dwight Eisenhower's in 1959, but their coattails were not strong enough to carry their vice presidents to victory. Thus, approval ratings have been a useful indicator but not an infallible one.
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
The direction of the economy over a president's fourth year is also a huge factor in his chances of re-election. Here, there is some good news and bad news for Obama.
The good news is that voters have short memories. If there are hopeful signs during an election year, they may be willing to forget earlier problems. Reagan, Nixon, Eisenhower and Truman all won despite recessions earlier in their terms. Moreover, voters' evaluations of the economy are relatively forward-looking. Even if the economy is below its full productive capacity -- as it was in November 1984 when the unemployment rate was 7.2 percent, and as it certainly was in 1936, when it was still around 17 percent -- voters may be willing to overlook this, provided it seems headed in the right direction.
The bad news for Obama is that he has already missed his opportunity for a V-shaped recovery, and the prospects for a U-shaped recovery seem uncertain. In October, a panel of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal forecast 2.3 percent G.D.P. growth (adjusted for inflation) in 2012, somewhat below the election-year average of 3 or 4 percent and only enough to provide for modest job creation.
Growth rates during an election year are a good but imperfect indicator of electoral performance. The two times that economic activity actually shrank during an election year, 1980 and 2008, the incumbent party lost badly. The two times that it grew by more than 6 percent, 1944 and 1972, it won overwhelmingly. But Eisenhower won a landslide in 1956 despite tepid 1.8 percent growth, and George W. Bush won in 2004 with only 2.9 percent. The economy grew about 5 percent in 1968, but that wasn't enough to save Humphrey.
Some political scientists have tried to explain these exceptions by resorting to an alphabet soup of economic indicators, conjuring obscure variables like R.D.P.I.P.C. (real disposable-personal-income per capita), which they claim can predict elections with remarkable accuracy. From the standpoint of responsible forecasting, this is a mistake. The government tracks literally 39,000 economic indicators each year. Although many (say, privately owned housing starts in Alabama) are obscure or redundant, perhaps two or three dozen of them are looked at regularly by economists.
When you have this much data to sort through but only 17 elections since 1944 to test them upon, some indicators will perform superficially better based on chance alone, the statistical equivalent of the lucky monkey from a group of millions who banged out a few Shakespearean phrases on his typewriter. Conversely, indicators like the unemployment rate have historically had almost no correlation with election results despite their self-evident importance. The advantage of looking at G.D.P. is that it represents the broadest overall evaluation of economic activity in the United States.
There is, however, another problem: economic forecasts are not very good. In fact, they are completely terrible. In November 1995, economists expected the economy to grow at 2.6 percent the next year; it actually zoomed upward by 4.4 percent. In November 2007, they expected it to grow at 2.5 percent, but it shrank by 3.3 percent, as the effects of the global financial crisis became manifest. Frighteningly enough, the margin of error on an economic forecast made a year in advance is about plus or minus 4 percent of G.D.P. Advance forecasts of election results must account for this uncertainty, either by expanding their own margins of error to accommodate it or by making their predictions conditional upon different economic situations (we will pursue the latter approach).
OPPONENT'S IDEOLOGY
The other major unknown is the identity of the Republican nominee. This year it could make an unusually large amount of difference. In recent polls against Mitt Romney, Obama's lead is just 1 percentage point -- but he leads Herman Cain by 8, Rick Perry by 11 and Michele Bachmann by 14.
At some point early next summer, head-to-head polls like these will become the most important predictors of the November result. But this far out they can be misleading and inaccurate. In a survey conducted in late September 1983, Ronald Reagan actually trailed Walter Mondale by 2 points, and in October 1991, George H. W. Bush led Bill Clinton 55 to 20.
In this case, though, the relative standing of the Republican opponents against Obama aligns neatly with their perceived ideology. Obama does worse against more moderate candidates like Romney -- and better against staunch conservatives like Perry and Cain.
Political scientists have long debated between two theoretical constructs of how Americans vote: one might be called the referendum model, and the other might be called the median voter model. In the referendum model, only the performance of the incumbent party's candidate matters: the opponents could nominate Lyndon H. LaRouche or Jesus H. Christ, and it wouldn't make much difference. In the median voter model, it is only the ideological positioning of the candidates that matters, and presidents are not evaluated on performance at all. As long as Jimmy Carter's political positions were closer to the center of the electorate than Ronald Reagan's (they probably were in 1980), who cared about an inflation rate of 12 percent or the hostage crisis in Iran?
Each of these models is ridiculous when taken to its logical extreme. But the evidence points on balance toward the referendum model (Carter lost in 1980, for instance). That is why our view of the fundamentals focuses on two performance-based indicators for the incumbent president -- approval ratings and economic growth -- but only one variable related to the opposition candidate.
Still, that one variable is an important one. In their book ''The Party Decides,'' the political scientist Marty Cohen and his colleagues estimated the ideological positioning of past opposition-party nominees based on a combination of objective indicators like Congressional voting records and surveys of presidential historians. I have translated Cohen's estimates to a scale that runs from 0 for an extremely moderate nominee to 100 for an extremely liberal or conservative one, with 50 representing the average.
Historically, this indicator has had a good deal of predictive power. When the incumbent party faced an opposition candidate with an extremism rating of 50 or higher, it won re-election in six out of eight cases. When it faced one with a rating of 50 or lower, meaning a more moderate nominee, it won just three times out of nine.
As with our other metrics, this one can be outweighed when the other fundamentals are not aligned with it. The moderate Thomas E. Dewey (who scored an 18) lost not once but twice. The very conservative Reagan (who came in at 85) won in 1980 because voters could find too few positives in Jimmy Carter's record. Electability exists along a spectrum and not in absolutes.
Still, if the performance-based factors are unkind to Obama, this one is potentially more favorable. I have estimated extremism scores for this year's Republican candidates by combining data from the three principal objective methods that are used to estimate ideology, one based on Congressional voting, one based on fund-raising contributions and the other based on voters' assessments of the candidates' ideology in polls. I then placed the Republicans onto the scale based on how their figures compared with past candidates. Here's how they stacked up:
Jon Huntsman 40 Mitt Romney 49 Herman Cain 60 Gary Johnson 63 Rick Santorum 64 Rick Perry 67 Newt Gingrich 68 Michele Bachmann 83 Ron Paul 96
As you can see, Romney's score of 49 is to the left of every Republican candidate except for Huntsman. But the G.O.P. as a whole has moved to the right, so Romney is about average in the broader scope of history.
The bigger problem for Republicans might come if they nominate a candidate further to Romney's right, like Perry, who has an extremism score of 67. The difference between Romney and Perry amounts to about 4 percentage points at the ballot booth. If conditions were otherwise very favorable (or very unfavorable) to Republicans, this wouldn't be enough to matter: an election that Romney would win by 10 points, Perry might win by 6. But an election that Romney might win by just 2 or 3 points, Perry could easily lose.
A THREE-FACTOR MODEL
By combining these factors -- approval ratings in the year before the election, G.D.P. growth during the election year itself and the ideology score of the opposition candidate -- we can come up with a forecast of next year's election. By design, it is not an exceptionally precise forecast. There are all types of factors that the model does not explicitly consider, among them the possibility of third-party candidates or differences between the popular vote and the Electoral College. Moreover, voter perceptions about the economy, or the ideological positioning of the candidates, may differ in practice from what the objective data say about them. Rather than pretending to have all the answers, the model knows how much it doesn't know and allows for a reasonably wide range of possible outcomes.
The model's error can be reduced, however, if we are willing to consider certain possibilities that fill in some of the blanks. We will evaluate four such scenarios here. They represent cases in which Obama is matched up against either a relatively moderate nominee like Romney or a more conservative one like Perry (who will be used as our guinea pig despite Herman Cain's recent rise in the polls). Further, they represent cases in which the economy either slips into recession or instead beats expectations and grows by 4 percent next year (each has about a one-in-three chance of happening). A multitude of other situations are possible -- but these are the paradigmatic cases. And they produce vastly different results.
CASE STUDY NO. 1: ROMNEY AND STAGNANT ECONOMY Obama approval rating in November 2011: 43% G.D.P. growth in 2012: 0% Probability of winning the popular vote: Romney: 83%, Obama: 17%
We begin with the worst of these situations for Obama: Mitt Romney is the Republican nominee, and economic growth, rather than continuing along sluggishly, comes to a halt (perhaps the debt dominoes have fallen in Europe). Under these assumptions, Obama would only have a 17 percent chance -- about one in six -- of winning a majority of the popular vote.
His chances are slim enough in this case that if I woke up next November to discover that we would have four more years of Obama, I might ask whether there was some sort of October surprise: ''Mitt in Torrid Affair With Filipina Housekeeper.'' Subhead: ''Illegal Immigrant Got Free Romneycare.'' Then I might ask if Sarah Palin had run on the Tea Party ballot line and taken 6 percent of the vote.
In a more normal election, an Obama victory would have resulted from some combination of three factors. The first two are arguments that we might expect to see as part of Obama's campaign, and which are viable even under this worst-case scenario. The third is simply an observation.
First, Obama may have some untapped potential in highlighting his foreign-policy wins. The killing of Osama bin Laden did not produce a lasting bounce in the polls. But -- sorry to be so gauche -- killing the world's most wanted terrorist will make for a nice sound bite. Meanwhile, the NATO intervention in Libya reached a successful if bloody outcome, and the troops are coming home from Iraq. The White House has not done a good job of turning the discussion to foreign policy, and it has to be careful that in doing so it does not appear to be ignoring the economy. But foreign policy matters to voters, and Obama will have a marketing budget of hundreds of millions of dollars to get the message right.
Second, the overall unpopularity of the Republican Party could rub off on Romney, who will have to endorse most of its platform. Only 35 or 40 percent of voters take a favorable view of the G.O.P., which has not improved at all from 2006 or 2008. The Republicans in Congress are less popular still and have an agenda with some prickly bits -- like Paul Ryan's plans to privatize Social Security -- that Romney could have a hard time distancing himself from.
All of this, probably, would not be enough to save Obama. Romney is a skilled debater, a cautious candidate and a smart man -- exactly what you want when the fundamentals otherwise favor you. Under these conditions, in fact, Obama would be as likely to lose by double digits as to win the popular vote.
Still, the White House would be able to make some credible arguments and Obama might have an outside chance at an upset. But how does it get around the problem of the economy?
The observation: even if the economy goes into recession again, voters might not care much about the difference between slow growth and no growth. Some 80 percent of voters already think we're in a recession. They are not happy about it, but expectations are so low that a sort of fatigue may have set in about further bad news.
In practice, voters may think about the economy as falling into one of three basic categories -- Good, Bad and Getting Better -- rather than along a continuum. Obama would benefit if he could make a credible case for Getting Better, something he would not be able to do in this situation. But since he's already unable to make that case now -- remember ''Recovery Summer''? -- it's plausible that a deterioration in the numbers would not hurt him as much as an acceleration of growth might help him. Beating Romney with 0 percent growth would not be easy, but it might not be that much more difficult than beating him with 2 percent growth (also no piece of cake, of course).
CASE STUDY NO. 2: ROMNEY AND IMPROVING ECONOMY Obama approval rating in November 2011: 43% G.D.P. growth in 2012: 4% Probability of winning the popular vote: Romney: 40%, Obama: 60%
Obama would be far better off if he could make the Getting Better case. Imagine, as before, that Romney is the nominee. But rather than going into recession, the economy grows by 4 percent next year, enough to make a real dent in the unemployment rate. This would be enough to make Obama the favorite.
But not by all that much: he'd have only about a 60/40 edge.
Why not larger? The key to understanding this one is that Obama has a lot of gravity to overcome. Voters usually put their earlier concerns aside if there is an improvement in the economic fundamentals in the election year. But there have been exceptions: growth was quite strong in 1992, but voters were still punishing George H. W. Bush for the 1990-91 recession and the jobless recovery it produced.
Romney is much different stylistically from Bush's opponent, Bill Clinton, but both are skilled at driving an economic message. Romney would bring out his PowerPoint and seek to persuade voters that the growth had been too little and too late. After all, if killing bin Laden couldn't lift Obama's approval rating much above 50 percent, who knows whether one year of good-but-not-great growth would?
Still, the most likely eventuality in this case -- enough economic growth that the White House gets to make the Getting Better case while maintaining a straight face -- is a narrow win for Obama. Perhaps it would be somewhat like the one that George W. Bush secured in 2004: it would keep the network anchors up late, but it wouldn't be close enough to put us in Recount Land.
CASE STUDY NO. 3: PERRY AND IMPROVING ECONOMY Obama approval rating in November 2011: 43% G.D.P. growth in 2012: 4.0% Probability of winning the popular vote: Perry: 17%, Obama: 83%
Imagine Rick Perry as the Republican nominee instead, and Obama has considerably more margin for error. Against Perry, should economic growth improve to 4 percent next year, Obama would be about an 83 percent favorite. This is the most favorable arrangement for Obama -- good enough that you might even hear talk about Obama expanding the map again (can he win Georgia? Arizona?).
The usual danger to the favorite in these cases is complacency, something that befell Gore in 2000 and Dewey in 1948. Perry, if he wouldn't go over well in high-income and socially liberal states like Colorado or Virginia, could make a credible-enough case about his working-class roots and his jobs record in Texas to appeal to voters in hardscrabble states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. With an improving economy, it would be a narrow path to victory, especially given that Florida -- where Perry's position on Social Security would not play well -- might be a difficult sale for him.
But Obama could still go down if he appeared out of touch. This particularly holds if he were too quick to declare ''mission accomplished'' on the economy, or if the Democratic base remained as disinterested in the election as it was in 2010. No one should mistake the Occupy protests, on Wall Street and elsewhere, for a movement of the Democratic base (one poll found that most of the Wall Street protesters identify as independent). But you sometimes get the sense that the left has already gotten over Obama and is focusing on longer-term problems. This may be good for them, but it isn't necessarily good for Obama.
And then there is the October surprise potential: ''Obama Sent Crotch Pics to Congressional Staffer.'' Subhead: ''Who Used to Be Lobbyist for Solyndra.''
CASE STUDY NO. 4: PERRY AND STAGNANT ECONOMY Obama approval rating in November 2011: 43% G.D.P. growth in 2012: 0% Probability of winning the popular vote: Perry: 59%, Obama: 41%
Perhaps the most interesting case is the one in which Perry (or Cain) is the nominee but the economy gets worse and falls back into recession. This would be a true test of the two political-science perspectives on the election: the referendum paradigm, which would favor Perry, against the median voter paradigm, which would favor Obama.
Our model suggests that the referendum paradigm is slightly more likely to win out, as it did under somewhat similar circumstances in 1980. Specifically, it suggests there is about a 60 percent chance that Perry would beat Obama under these conditions, as Reagan beat Carter.
True, Rick Perry is no Ronald Reagan. While they have some biographical similarities (multiterm governors of major states; movie-star good looks; former Democrats) and some ideological similarities, Perry is much more likely to make the mistake of turning the race into a popularity contest rather than asking voters, as Reagan did, whether they were better off than they had been four years earlier. But Reagan won by 10 points, which means that even if Perry has disadvantages relative to Reagan (and Obama has advantages relative to Carter), they might not be enough to overcome the weight of a sagging economy.
So Perry would be a favorite under these conditions -- but only a modest one. Republican strategists like Karl Rove are sensible in their desire not to nominate him; he might provide the clearest case in American history of a party blowing an election it by all rights should have won.
THE BOTTOM LINE
Average these four scenarios together and the probabilities come out to almost exactly 50-50. A month or two ago, when Perry and Romney appeared about equally likely to be the Republican nominee, it would therefore have been proper to think of the election as a toss-up.
With Perry having slumped in the polls, however, and Romney the more likely nominee, the odds tilt slightly toward Obama joining the list of one-termers. It is early, and almost no matter what, the election will be a losable one for Republicans. But Obama's position is tenuous enough that it might not be a winnable one for him.

HEADLINE: The 99% Onstage: Attention Must Be Paid

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
WAS that the ghost of Willy Loman I spotted in Zuccotti Park the other day, swapping grievances with the spirits of Joe Hill and Woody Guthrie? Probably not. Willy, the title character of Arthur Miller's ''Death of a Salesman,'' went to his grave paying lip service to -- and perhaps even still half-believing in -- the American dream. Anyway, being part of a public protest would have embarrassed a guy who put his trust in the conquering power of a smile and a shoeshine and who wanted, above all, to be well liked.
But it was hard not to hear the voice of Willy's widow, Linda, among the motley sign carriers in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, as they sounded their disparate watchwords. You remember Linda. She's the one who said of her husband, who seemed to have turned invisible to himself after he lost his job, ''Attention must be paid to such a person.'' And whatever you say about the lack of formal demands and strategies within the viral movement known as Occupy Wall Street, you can't deny that its participants are unified by one overriding desire: They want attention paid to them. 
When ''Death of a Salesman'' returns to Broadway next year, in a new production starring Philip Seymour Hoffman, Willy Loman may emerge as even more a man of our time than he seemed to be of his when the play first opened in 1949. And if the current state of New York theater is any indication, he'll have lots of company on other stages. Willy, after all, remains the American drama's most poignant example of a man driven to despair when he loses his job and is made -- to use a word more in fashion now than then -- redundant. As Miller portrays him, Willy out of work is Willy stripped of dignity, weight and even identity.
The feelings of shame and existential unease that were expressed again and again on a recent October night at Joe's Pub, the cabaret in the Public Theater in Manhattan, would surely have been familiar to Willy Loman. It was there that the Civilians, a documentary theater company, were trying out an early version of ''Let Me Ascertain You: Occupy Wall Street,'' a collage assembled from interviews conducted in the preceding weeks with people who had been spending their days (and often nights) in Zuccotti Park.
These people ranged widely in their social and economic backgrounds. Embodied by actors (often the same ones who had interviewed them), they included a former creative director from children's television; a student at a college in Brooklyn; two card-carrying Teamsters; a self-described professional activist from San Francisco; a 64-year-old supporter of the Tea Party; and a lively variety of young people who were collectively described as ''urchins,'' which is probably preferable to ''homeless,'' which most of them were.
Yet however much they may have shrunk initially from the Civilians' microphones and notepads, the versions of them that showed up in Joe's Pub seemed to expand and blossom as they responded to questions. As they should have. Wasn't the reason they had gathered in the park -- they, the proud and shamed representatives of the neglected 99 percent of the American economy -- to be seen, to be heard, to be noticed?
Some of these people did talk about their status as symbols of a vast majority of this country's population. But none who spoke pretended to be selfless, by which I mean someone without a self. These were definitely individuals with lives as distinct and different as fingerprints. And here they were, on a stage in a spotlight -- well not them, but actors playing them, who gave official form and maybe a glimmer of star shine to their individuality. A couple of them, by the way, when asked what they dreamed of for their futures, admitted that what they really wanted to be were celebrities.
When the dialectic of the haves and the have-nots becomes that of the seen and the unseen, it translates naturally to live theater, which is all about commanding and competing for attention. Plays in New York haven't been noted for their sweeping social consciousness in recent years (or even decades). But in the past couple of seasons the theater has seemed to remember the inherent dramatic value within the dialogue, or lack thereof, between classes.
David Lindsay-Abaire's excellent ''Good People,'' which opened on Broadway last winter for a limited run, is a love story manque between a man (Tate Donovan) who has escaped the poverty of South Boston and his former girlfriend (Frances McDormand), who is still a prisoner of it and -- like Willy Loman -- suddenly out of a job. She has been aware of his existence as a successful doctor. (She's seen his picture in the papers.) But he has managed to forget hers altogether, or pretended to, anyway. And when their lives collide, it's only for a fractious instant before they retreat again to their separate sides of the economic divide. She is an inconvenient memory for him and likely to be erased as much and as quickly as possible.
Only a maid, imported from the urban projects, is on hand to represent the working class in the affluent Connecticut home portrayed in Adam Rapp's ''Dreams of Flying Dreams of Falling,'' which ended its Off Broadway run last week. But this go-for-broke satire -- brazenly descended from Edward Albee's surreal and unforgiving family-portrait plays -- is clouded with a sense of revolution waiting in the wings (or the basement).
As characters at a dinner party swap chit-chat laden with status symbols and price tags, the weather, we learn, has turned apocalyptic, with a sky that seems poised to fall. And did I mention that one of the main characters is a disgraced Wall Street hotshot who has brought his clients to ruin? A young woman at the dinner table ominously chants what might be his epitaph: ''All the money's funny, and the sunny days aren't so sunny.''
A similar weather report might be made of Terence Rattigan's ''Man and Boy,'' which has been revived by the Roundabout Theater Company. This 1963 drama centers on Gregor Antonescu, a charismatic businessman of the 1930s, inspired by the notorious tycoon Ivar Kreuger and played (brilliantly) by Frank Langella. Gregor's financial improprieties are about to cause both the collapse of his empire and, it would appear, the fortunes of many of his clients. (Perhaps it's worth noting here that the protagonist of ''Chinglish,'' David Henry Hwang's play about an American businessman in China, is a casualty of the Enron scandal.)
As Gregor tries to stave off financial ruin, Mr. Langella emphasizes the incredible shortsightedness and narcissism that accompanies his character's genius. His only concern is winning what he sees as a great game -- for its own sake and his own glory. And even his own long-estranged (and attention-starved) son, in whose shabby New York apartment Gregor seeks refuge, is merely a pawn in that game.
The personal consequences to others of his recklessness don't exist. Oblivious and terminally self-centered, Mr. Langella's charming, destructive Gregor might be the very model of the reckless financier as envisioned by the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Another myopic financial genius is the subject of a one-man show by Mike Daisey currently at the Public Theater. It is called ''The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs,'' and yes, it is about the recently deceased founder of Apple. Mr. Daisey, a longtime fan and user of Mr. Jobs's products, is fascinated by the intelligence -- and pure force of will and tunnel vision -- that it took to develop them.
But in addition to charting the rise and rise of Mr. Jobs, Mr. Daisey chronicles his own journey to a Chinese factory town where many Apple products are made. And his monologue unfolds as portraits in counterpoint of the famous Mr. Jobs and of the unknown workers who manufacture his inventions under conditions that often cripple their bodies.
Mr. Daisey interviewed these Chinese workers himself (with a translator). He was surprised to discover how much they wanted to talk to him and how delighted they were by the prospect of an artist using his voice to give an international microphone to theirs. In other words, they were pleased that, finally, attention was being paid.

HEADLINE: Rehearsal for Reconstruction

BYLINE: MICHAEL SHAPIRO


HIGHLIGHT: How the Battle of Port Royal set off a bold experiment in freedom. 

 BODY:
On the clear, crisp morning of Nov. 7, 1861, Sam Mitchell, a young slave living on the island of Port Royal off the coast of South Carolina, thought he heard thunder - which seemed odd, since there was not a cloud in the sky. He asked his mother, Tyra, what he'd heard. It wasn't thunder, she said. The Yankees had come to give them freedom. A few miles away the largest fleet ever assembled by the United States was bombarding Fort Walker and Fort Beauregard, the two forts on either side of the entrance to Port Royal Sound. 
Within hours, Confederate troops had abandoned the forts, allowing Union forces to take control of the sound and the barrier islands that surrounded it, including Port Royal. The local slave owners and planters soon abandoned the island, leaving behind thousands of slaves. 
Union soldiers, profiteers, government agents and missionaries quickly moved into Port Royal. Some took advantage of the situation for their own gain, but others tried to organize the ex-slaves into self-sustaining citizens to prove that a system of free labor was better than slavery. What began as a Union effort to establish a Southern base for its naval blockade soon became "the Port Royal Experiment," or, as the historian Willie Lee Rose called it, a "rehearsal for Reconstruction."
The Union assault began at 8 a.m. when the fleet's commander, Samuel Dupont, and his frigate the Wabash led 14 ships into Port Royal Sound. Five of the ships sailed deeper into the sound, tasked with protecting the main column from Confederate gunboats. The other nine ships remained in formation, circled back closer to Fort Walker, bombarding it as they sailed by. Then they circled back, this time closer to Fort Beauregard, and bombarded it too. The fleet bombarded both forts a second time, and by the third pass Fort Walker was no longer firing back; the place had been evacuated. When the commander of Fort Beauregard realized that Fort Walker had fallen, he called for the evacuation of his own fort. By late afternoon Union forces controlled Port Royal Sound.
The victory was both strategic and symbolic. The islands surrounding Port Royal Sound, one of the most important deep-water harbors between Florida and Virginia, held profitable cotton plantations, while Beaufort, the sound's biggest town, was a center of secessionist sentiment. For many in the Union, the assault was a fitting rebuttal for the loss of Fort Sumter at the beginning of the war. 
For the slaves who lived on Port Royal, it was their first step toward freedom. Their owners had fled when Union forces attacked the forts, and most of the slaves either refused to join their owners or were not invited to flee in the first place. When Union troops entered Port Royal, they found thousands of slaves without masters. Their legal status, however, was not immediately clear: President Lincoln was not prepared to emancipate them, because he did not want to anger the leaders of the slave states that had remained loyal to the Union. 
Instead, he found a useful precedent in the actions of Gen. Benjamin Butler, who a few months earlier had refused to return slaves that had escaped to Fortress Monroe in Hampton, Va., which was under his command. Butler declared that the slaves were contraband of war; they would not be returned to their masters, but were not considered free. While Port Royal's slaves would have the trappings of freedom, the federal government initially declared that they too were contraband. The Second Confiscation Act and the Militia Act of July 17, 1862 emancipated some of the ex-slaves, but there was still a high level of ambiguity about the status of most of them. It wouldn't be until Jan. 1, 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect, that the Port Royal slaves would be truly freed.
Nevertheless, many anti-slavery activists in the North saw that Port Royal provided the war's first great opportunity to prove that free labor was superior to slave labor. Frederick Law Olmsted, who had recently co-designed Central Park and was serving as executive secretary of the United States Sanitary Commission, wrote in early 1862, "The opportunity of proving to the South, the economic mistake of Slavery, which is offered us at Port Royal, is indeed invaluable." Olmsted had studied the economic feasibility of slavery in his influential prewar book A Journey in the Seaboard Slave States, and in early 1862 he applied those insights to the situation in Port Royal. In February he drafted a bill for Senator Lafayette S. Foster that would establish a framework for productively managing the plantations and ex-slaves, which Foster introduced into Congress. 
But Capitol Hill wasn't forthcoming. When Congress refused to take action, Olmsted wrote to Henry Bellows, the president of the Sanitary Commission, "I hope the time-serving, shilly shally, disjointed, incoherent, lazy, cowardly disposition which prevails in Washington, will not fail to be denounced, and the urgency of immediate, comprehensive governmental action in the premises, will be insisted on." In a letter to President Lincoln on March 8, 1862, Olmsted argued that the federal government had a duty to "save the lives of the negroes" and to "train or educate them in a few simple, essential and fundamental social duties of free men in civilized life." Congress did not pass Olmsted's bill, and the federal government never implemented a comprehensive plan.
The reality was that there were too many competing interests on Port Royal. The Union commander, Lt. Col. William H. Reynolds, had little interest in the ex-slaves' welfare, having been sent by the Treasury secretary, Salmon Chase, to collect abandoned cotton and sell it. Others, like Edward L, Pierce, a Boston attorney who had supervised ex-slaves at Fortress Monroe, had been sent (also by Chase) to organize the ex-slaves into self-sustaining citizens, but the Treasury failed to coordinate the two men's missions. Meanwhile, in March, a group of 53 men and women known as Gideon's Band went to Port Royal to preach Christianity and set up schools. There were times when these groups worked together, but they rarely saw eye-to-eye, making the implementation of a cohesive plan difficult, if not impossible. 
Still, the ex-slaves and their new Union overseers helped turn Port Royal into a profitable source of cotton, though it was nowhere near as productive as in the antebellum era. For one thing, many of the ex-slaves had no desire to continue picking cotton. Families who were given or bought their own land to cultivate preferred to grow crops for their families. And, after 1863, African-Americans were allowed to serve in the Union Army, and many of Port Royal's best workers chose to fight. Nevertheless, many successful plantations developed, and the ex-slaves created a tightly knit community that endured into the 20th century.
Among those who stuck around was Sam Mitchell, who had heard the roar of the Union ships that November. After the war he married twice and fathered two children. When Chlotilde R. Martin interviewed him in the late 1930s as part of the Federal Writers Project, he described what it meant to be free. "What do I think of slavery?" he said. "I think slavery is just a murdering of the people. I think freedom been a great gift. I like my master and I guess he was as good to his slave as he could be, but I rather be free."

HEADLINE: Huntsman, Barbour Urge Cain to Come Clean on Accusations

BYLINE: BRIAN KNOWLTON


HIGHLIGHT: Pressure mounts on Herman Cain from fellow Republicans. 

 BODY:
Herman Cain faced fresh criticism on Sunday from some prominent Republican colleagues, and at least two of them called on him to be much more forthcoming about the allegations of sexual harassment that appear to be weighing on his presidential candidacy.
A fellow Republican presidential candidate, the former Utah governor John M. Huntsman Jr., suggested that the entire Republican campaign was suffering from the media-consuming focus on allegations that Mr. Cain harassed at least two employees of the National Restaurant Association while serving as its president in the 1990s.
While describing Mr. Cain as "a decent, decent man," Mr. Huntsman went on to say, "It's up to Herman Cain to get the information out and get it out in total." He said that the intense attention to the harassment allegations was "taking all the bandwidth out of the discussion," so that the Republican candidates were unable to discuss the economy, foreign policy and other pressing issues. 
"It's got to come out in total," he repeated during an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press." "Legitimate questions have been raised."
Mr. Huntsman, who has tried to position himself as something of a truth-teller in the campaign, thus appeared to have gone further than any other Republican candidate in calling on Mr. Cain for a fuller explanation. 
But another prominent Republican, Governor Haley Barbour of Mississippi, made a similar point. 
 "Bad news is not like fine wine -- it doesn't improve with age," he said, paraphrasing a quote from Henry A. Kissinger. Mr. Barbour, who himself had considered a presidential run this year, said it was vital for Mr. Cain to "get all the facts on the table, get it behind him."
Like other Republicans who appeared on the Sunday talk shows, Mr. Barbour declined to condemn Mr. Cain's actions, past or recent, but said the stakes were high, both for the former businessman and for the party. 
"I'm not one of the people who thinks this is necessarily fatal," he said, also on "Meet the Press." "But people need to know what the facts are." 
While Mr. Cain's campaign says its fund-raising has soared in the past week as conservatives rally around him, a new Reuters/Ipsos opinion survey found that his favorability rating among Republican voters had declined significantly in the past week, from 66 percent to 57 percent. 
"There's no way you could say it's been good for him," said Mr. Barbour. He added that Mr. Cain "needs to get all the cards on the table, face-up."
Other Republicans, however, were more cautious in their appraisal. 
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas was asked on CNN's "State of the Union" whether she found the harassment allegations disturbing.
"Not at all," she replied. "I just don't see anonymous sources as fair against a candidate. I think if someone has a real concern, they should come out and say it, but nothing that I've heard, or in the press that I have read, is other than off-color remarks" by Mr. Cain. 
The House speaker, Rep. John A. Boehner of Ohio, declined to comment about Mr. Cain in an interview on ABC's "This Week," saying simply, "I'm not going there."
But a former Democratic presidential hopeful, Bill Richardson, the past governor of New Mexico, called for the sort of accountability demanded by Mr. Huntsman and Mr. Barbour. "Sexual harassment is serious," he said on "Meet the Press." "I think
Mr. Cain has to answer these questions."
He suggested that some Republicans' defense of Mr. Cain was emblematic of a party moving right on women's rights and other issues. 
"The extreme right wing of the Republican Party has taken over to the point where we now have an amendment in several states that criminalizes a woman's right to choose," he said, referring to the so-called personhood amendments being considered in some states. 
Mr. Richardson said there was "a huge assault on women's right in the Republican Party, and an extreme right wing that has taken over." That, he said, would make it difficult for any Republican centrist to rise to leadership.

HEADLINE: In the Shadow of Grand Resorts, a Town Hill Struggles

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
JACKSON, Wyo. -- The ski slope that rises up the mountain just off downtown, called Snow King, dates from the 1930s, when this corner of the West all but folded up in winter, isolated and dark, and local people needed something to do. Getting rich from the snows that fall early and deep on the edge of the Teton Range in western Wyoming did not factor in.
''It was never meant to make money,'' said Bill Ashley, 89, who owned and ran the Snow King ski school for many years and met his wife, Mary, at the top of the mountain in the early 1950s. ''It was meant to be for the town.'' 
The big ski areas that came later -- Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, half an hour into the Tetons, and Grand Targhee, an hour northwest -- made winter tourism big business and Jackson Hole a winter destination.
But old Snow King, the first ski area in Wyoming and one of the oldest in the nation, soldiered on for the local residents, who could get in a run or two during lunch. The ski industry went upscale, and so did Jackson Hole, as the coastal glitterati came to nest in their humble ranchettes. But Snow King did not.
Now the question is resonating here and across ski country, from upstate New York to Montana, where local hills and communities are struggling in the face of changed times and economic stress. What place do ski hills like Snow King have in the modern world? What are they worth to a community or an economy? Has the chemistry between town and town hill been changed by tough times?
A small ski area called White Pine in Pinedale, Wyo., about 75 miles from Jackson, said this fall that it would not open for the season. In Bozeman, Mont., and Cody, Wyo., local skiers have banded together in recent years to create nonprofit organizations to run struggling town hills.
In Saranac Lake, N.Y., residents rallied this year around their town hill, called Mount Pisgah, and raised money for a new T-bar lift. Here in Jackson, the owners of Snow King, while vowing to continue on this season, have quietly put the resort and its nearby hotel up for sale.
A special discounted season pass for $149 -- almost what some resorts charge for a daily ticket -- comes with a plea on the Snow King Web site, ''Show support for your town hill,'' and with a raffle entry to win a 1950s-vintage chair from an old lift.
''Communities are struggling to keep their town hills,'' said Michael Berry, the president of the National Ski Areas Association, ''and they're finding ways to do it.''
Mr. Berry said that over all, the industry has held up fairly well through the economic downturn. What is different for town hills, he said, is that because they depend mostly on local residents, they reflect -- more than the Strattons or Lake Tahoes of the world -- local life and economics, for better or worse.
Like most communities, Jackson Hole has taken economic hits, in tourism and real estate. And while there seems to be hardly anyone in Jackson Hole who wishes ill of Snow King or hopes to see it fail, that is not really the question, residents say. What price to save or rescue it, and whether the town or county should wade in at all, defines the issue.
Jackson's Town Council, which oversees a municipally owned recreation complex at Snow King's base -- managed by the resort until financial troubles worsened -- reassigned the center's management last month to a nonprofit organization, a step that town officials said could lead to a larger public role on the ski hill itself. A community group also tried to step in this year to take over management at Snow King, but it failed to reach an agreement.
''There's the emotional appeal,'' said Mayor Mark Barron, who has vowed to keep Snow King alive, ''and then there's the practical reality.'' As for where the two might meet, he shrugged: ''Who knows?''
Some survivors of recreational skiing's early days, like Alta, Utah, or Aspen, Colo., grew to great economic might. But Snow King, with only 400 acres of skiable terrain -- challenging and steep, but tiny by modern resort standards -- could not outgrow its roots, a gnawing competitive disadvantage in the age of limitless choice.
''Unfortunately, size matters,'' said Manuel Lopez, Snow King's president.
Mr. Lopez, who is 67 and thinking about retirement, said the operation loses about $800,000 over the winter, partly subsidized by a year-round convention and hotel business and by summer moneymakers like an alpine slide. Prospective buyers have looked with interest at the hotel and convention trade, he said, but few want the ski hill and its losses as baggage.
At downtown businesses like Teton Mountaineering, an outdoor clothing shop, the debate over Snow King, prompted by a reporter's question, turned from economics to community to what Kathleen A. Crowley, a buyer for the store, described as ''family coziness.''
''Nothing against the big ski areas, because I spend a lot of time there,'' Ms. Crowley said, ''but there's just that homey kind of safe feel about Snow King.''
Chuck Schaap, the store's owner, struck a practical note. ''If it has such value,'' he said, ''why is it economically a failure?''
Ms. Crowley paused. ''That might be a whole other question,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Catskills Town, Slow to Rebound, Shows Signs of Energy

BYLINE: By NOAH ROSENBERG

 BODY:
PRATTSVILLE, N.Y. -- More than two months after flood waters that engulfed this remote Catskill Mountains town knocked Dave Rikard's Victorian house off its foundation, it remains frozen in a bow -- as if bidding farewell to Main Street after a 100-year performance.
Its yellow, blue and white facade has become a canvas for the swirling and sometimes overlapping array of emotions, rendered in black spray paint, that have coursed through Prattsville since late August, when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and other officials labeled it the place hit hardest by Tropical Storm Irene: ''God Save Prattsville''; ''Tx FEMA ...4 nutt'n''; ''God bless America.'' 
Lately, hope has started to enter that mixture, as a long-term plan for a flood-resistant Prattsville has begun to take shape.
Employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency have been a presence here since just after the storm. Indeed, the agency's disaster recovery trailer in Prattsville was recently replaced with the first long-term community recovery team the agency has established in a New York town affected by Irene.
Still, many here fear that Prattsville's resurgence has been hobbled by a poor economy and insufficient government aid, as well as the October snowstorm that left behind eight inches of snow.
Walking down Main Street, where fewer than five people are living and only 3 of 21 businesses are operating, is a bit like touring a war zone: condemnation notices are tacked to dozens of buildings; for-sale signs hang wanly from several cracked and mud-caked homes; clothing, toys and furniture lie in filthy heaps; and living rooms are open to the elements.
The town supervisor, Kory O'Hara, said there were about 15 ''guaranteed tear-downs'' in Prattsville.
Ben Hamilton, one of the few residents still on Main Street, summed up the sentiment as simply as he could: ''What do you do when you lose everything?''
His home, like several of the roughly 240 others that were damaged, has been reduced to its studs on the first floor. The house requires new wiring before it meets the electrical code, so he has been relying on a generator to cook hamburgers on a George Foreman grill.
And he has resigned himself to making frosty midnight bathroom trips to the adjacent Methodist church, whose waterlogged Bibles and pews have been removed to allow for repairs.
Even to Mr. Hamilton, a 49-year-old Army veteran who works at the resort Hunter Mountain and prides himself on his survival skills, ''After dark, Prattsville isn't pretty.'' Initially leery of government assistance, he expects to use emergency management agency money to move to an apartment in a neighboring town for the winter, he said.
But by day, a different story has slowly emerged. Construction hammers echo from several properties, like the Prattsville Tavern, set to reopen the day before Thanksgiving. And on Saturday, donated steel roof-framing and columns rolled onto the vacant lot where Mr. O'Hara's five-generations-old service station had been consumed by the swollen Schoharie Creek.
Mr. O'Hara has erected a three-foot concrete base around the riverside station to protect it against future flooding. Likewise, boulders have been placed along the Schoharie in certain spots to help maintain its softened banks.
But beyond Prattsville's immediate needs, a bigger, dreamier picture is taking shape -- one that has excited many residents, while causing some self-described pragmatists to shake their heads.
Margaret Irwin, the owner of River Street Planning and Development in Troy, N.Y., and the Prattsville rebuilding committee helped assemble a team of volunteer urban planners, architects and environmental engineers -- from firms in New York State and Florida -- who gathered this weekend for a collaborative ''vision process'' with residents. Their designs, for a Prattsville that is 3, 5 or 10 years away, evoked a modern, flood-resistant, tourist-friendly town featuring a village green, a recreation complex and attractive new homes and businesses -- built above the flood plain.
''It's more than just pretty pictures,'' said Kevin Piccoli, a financial executive from New Jersey who owns a second home in Prattsville and helped form the rebuilding committee and the Prattsville Relief Fund. He said the nonprofit fund had raised $180,000 for residents -- a mere drop in the bucket, he acknowledged. But the vision study, he emphasized, could ultimately become a moneymaker, backed up by ''real, solid facts'' and other studies that would help the town apply for rebuilding grants.
The energy at the planning meetings was not lost on James Coleman, a community recovery specialist for the federal agency who is responsible for Prattsville and other upstate New York towns affected by Irene. He said Prattsville was ''the most impressive place I've been,'' in terms of its recovery.
''This is the 'whole community' concept that FEMA is now focusing on,'' he added on Saturday, peering around an upstairs room at the Prattsville firehouse, where designers mingled with residents. Such a public-private partnership, Mr. Coleman said, will ''create the template for future disasters.''
Still, Mr. Coleman said the tight-knit nature of Prattsville -- where much of a pre-storm population of about 700 had been absorbed into the homes of friends and neighbors -- had, in a way, prevented the town from maximizing its federal assistance. Fewer than eight residents had requested temporary housing from FEMA, he said, and as a result, a delivery of residential trailers had been stalled.
Such a mind-set is well known to Glen Bellomy, who married a Prattsville native and helped manage the town's communications in the aftermath of the storm.
''There's visionary and there's pragmatic,'' Mr. Bellomy, 64, said, adding that the town had ''been the same way for 150 years and it's hard to change that.''
But even Mr. Bellomy's optimism eventually fought its way to the surface.
''If we want to we can lay down and just let it happen,'' he told a recovery volunteer after church recently, ''or we can build something bigger and better.''

HEADLINE: A Hidden Toll as States Shift to Contract Workers

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- Like many states and local governments struggling to cut costs, Michigan hopes to replace some government employees with contract workers who will do the same job for less.
Ginny Townsend, 41, took a job in January as a nursing assistant in the state-run home for veterans here. Technically, she works for a private company that supplies some employees to the veterans home under a state contract. She makes $10 an hour, about half the wage of the public employees working at the facility.
''I love my job, and I appreciate the opportunity to be here,'' Ms. Townsend, a former home health care aide, said on a recent afternoon as she cheerfully delivered fruit and a newspaper to an 85-year-old resident in a sun-drenched solarium.
With the national unemployment rate at roughly 9 percent, Ms. Townsend says she feels lucky just to have a job. But on her low wages, she is barely scraping by. She said she was raising four grandchildren under 11 with her unemployed sister and could not support them without the $300 in food stamps she collects every month. 
Now, the state wants to dismiss 170 nursing assistants on the public payroll at the veterans home and replace them with more contract workers like Ms. Townsend, prompting a legal dispute and much personal anguish.
The legal battle highlights the potential pitfalls in such decisions. Outsourcing, usually intended to ease strained public budgets, tends to most directly affect people like Ms. Townsend and her co-workers. But there can be other drawbacks. The quality of services provided by contract workers, for example, may not be as consistent as that of experienced government employees. And taxpayers can end up paying for the cuts in more indirect ways.
What governments save in salaries and benefits often ''ends up on the government books through all sorts of programs,'' said Paul C. Light, a professor at the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University, referring to unemployment insurance, Medicaid and other public assistance for workers earning low incomes.
Outsourcing becomes more popular during tough economic times as states and municipalities transfer the operations of facilities like prisons, school cafeterias and sanitation departments to private contractors. Governors or legislatures in Arizona, Louisiana, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have all proposed reviews of state agencies in search of opportunities to privatize operations.
Many local governments like Anaheim, Calif., and Luzerne County, Pa., have contracted out services including park maintenance, graffiti removal and tax claims. Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago recently outsourced recycling collection in parts of the city.
In Michigan, the plan to replace state nursing assistants at the veterans home resulted in a lawsuit contending that some temporary workers employed by the contract company had already jeopardized patient care. In one case, the suit says, a resident fell off his bed and broke his neck after being left unattended by a contract worker. A judge has granted a preliminary injunction that keeps the state employees at work while the lawsuit moves forward.
The injunction also prevents new workers from J2S Healthforce Group, which recently won the contract to replace the state employees, from taking jobs at the facility. The company has provided fill-in nursing assistants at the veterans' home since 2001.
The state has appealed the decision, saying in court documents that the incidents cited were isolated and that state workers had been involved in negligent care as well. It says contract workers can provide quality care to the veterans while saving about $5.8 million a year.
With state budgets under pressure, Michigan says it can no longer afford the relatively high wages of the public workers, which range from $15 to $20 an hour, along with health and retirement benefits. According to Salary.com, certified nursing assistants in private long-term care facilities in the area earn a median salary of just over $25,000 a year, or about $12.25 a hour.
The home, opened 125 years ago to provide care to the state's war veterans and their spouses, now serves nearly 600 residents. About 40 percent of its financing comes from the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs, with the rest coming from state funds and fees paid by residents.
Many of the nursing aides have worked here for decades, and the union that represents them says their experience and relationships with their patients cannot easily be replaced.
In 22 years working at the home, Glenn Fiedler has emptied bedpans, helped bathe patients and charted their diets. He regularly buys treats and selects special outfits for their birthdays, and he once served as an interpreter for a veteran who had suffered a stroke and began punctuating every gesture with the same profanity.
''A lot of them looked at me as being their lost son,'' said Mr. Fiedler, 52, who earns $20.34 an hour. He said he could not cover his expenses on $10 an hour.
And like many of his state colleagues, he also worries that lower-paid contract workers will provide inferior care to the veterans. ''You get what you pay for,'' he said.
The lawsuit, filed by Anthony Spallone, a resident, says that fill-in contract workers have, among other things, repeatedly dropped residents and left them in urine-soaked beds, and once fed a resident solid food despite specific instructions not to.
Tim Frain, the chief executive of J2S, declined to comment.
Mr. Spallone, a 64-year-old Vietnam veteran who said he had served ''12 months, eight days, four hours and 22 minutes'' as an Army engineer, described the state's caregivers as ''like family.'' He suggested the government ''drop one less bomb overseas and pay these guys' salaries.''
Some residents say the contract workers are vilified unfairly. ''Care is predicated on compassion and empathy,'' said Harold Sundberg, a World War II Navy veteran, not ''a union label.''
Under the new contract, nursing assistants must have at least 12 months of experience, said Sara Dunne, acting administrator of the Grand Rapids home. She said current state workers could apply for the lower-paying slots.
Union leaders denounce the efforts to roll back years of negotiated wages and benefits. The public sector gave ''people a chance to buy a home and send their kids to college,'' said Eileen Kirlin, executive vice president of the public services division of the Services Employees International Union. When contractors take over and pay lower wages, ''we're just driving everybody down.''
Leonard Gilroy, director of government reform at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian research organization, said that outsourcing companies simply paid ''the market rate,'' which ''may or may not correspond with whatever the government pay scale might be currently.''
Economists and other academics who study outsourcing are divided about whether it usually saves a government money. Recent data from Arizona shows that privately operated prisons often cost more to operate than state-run facilities. A study by the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit Washington group, found that in 33 of 35 occupations, using contractors cost the federal government billions of dollars more than using government employees.
And some municipalities have brought outsourced services back into the public fold after determining they could perform the work as cost-effectively as private companies.
In June, one of the state workers at the Grand Rapids home, Emilie Perttu, 24, reluctantly left her job and took a nurse's aide position at a hospital for a quarter less than she was making. Ms. Perttu, a single mother of two, started at the veterans' home as a contract worker for J2S before becoming a state worker last year. She said that after Michigan's governor, Rick Snyder, cited the outsourcing plans in his budget for 2012 and 2013, she feared losing her job or having her wages sharply reduced.
The lower wage, she says, has left her strained to cover $675 a month in rent, along with basics like food and child care. So Ms. Perttu collects $400 monthly in food stamps and child care assistance, programs administered by the state but largely financed by the federal government. She has not been able to buy winter coats for her children, she said, and often avoids calls from credit card bill collectors.
At the veteran's home, ''one check was enough to pay all the bills,'' she said. Drawing on public assistance, she added, ''is not helping our economy.''
Working for Less: Articles in this series are examining how new workers are being hired at lower pay and benefits.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 8, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about efforts by state and local governments to save money by using contract workers misstated, in some copies, the financial hardships of one such contract worker, Ginny Townsend. She said she was raising four grandchildren under 11 with her unemployed sister and could not support them without the $300 in food stamps she collects every month; she did not say that she could support them without the food stamps.

HEADLINE: What's On Today

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
10 P.M. (Flix) ANTONIA'S LINE (1995) Part fable, part pastoral fantasy, this winner of the Oscar for best foreign film, written and directed by Marleen Gorris, follows the magically feminist bloodline of a Dutch matriarch (Willeke van Ammelrooy, above, with Jan Decleir) as she reflects, over the course of a single day, on her life after World War II. Els Dottermans portrays Danielle, Antonia's daughter, an introvert who isn't too shy to stab the village rapist with a pitchfork. Carolien Spoor, Esther Vriesendorp and Veerle van Overloop play Danielle's intellectually precocious daughter, Therese, at various points in her life. And Elsie de Brauw is Lara, Therese's tutor, with whom Danielle falls in love as she imagines her to be a living version of Botticelli's Venus. ''While the film rejects and even mocks ideas of organized religion, it has a solid faith in nature and destiny, as well as in the fundamental goodness of its women,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. ''It expresses that faith with serene confidence in the cycles of birth, death and replenishment that play out during the story.'' 
3 P.M. (Cinemax) HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG (2003) Massoud Behrani (Ben Kingsley, left, in an Oscar-nominated role), an exiled Iranian military officer reduced to menial labor in his adopted homeland, and Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connelly), a house cleaner recovering from years of addiction and the breakup of her marriage, spar -- with tragic consequences -- over a modest piece of coastal California real estate to which both seem to have an equally legitimate claim in this directorial debut from Vadim Perelman, based on the novel by Andre Dubus III. Shohreh Aghdashloo is Nadi, the wife over whom Behrani exercises a brutal tyranny; Ron Eldard is Lester Burdon, the sheriff's deputy who evicted Kathy from her house and now wants to help her get it back. None of the central characters ''are particularly likable, but they all seem worthy of sympathy, in part because they remain capable of showing it,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''Even as the conflict over the house escalates, Behrani, Lester and Kathy all hold on to compassion and decency, and even show signs of a willingness to relent. They seem to agree that no house is worth a human life, which makes the heavily foreshadowed final cataclysm especially painful and powerful.''
8 P.M. (Sundance) LOVE LUST The series returns from hiatus to take on some guilty pleasures, starting with comfort food.
8 P.M. (13, 49) ANTIQUES ROADSHOW ''Junk in the Trunk,'' a special edition, reveals some previously unseen appraisals from the show's most recent season. The treasures include a set of six chairs made by a furniture designer who worked on commission for Aristotle Onassis; a collection of prison-camp materials from World War II that posthumously established a glider pilot's eligibility for a medal; and a drawing and a lithograph by Grant Wood, as well as a trunk containing some of his possessions valued at nearly $22,000.
9:45 P.M. (IFC) MONTY PYTHON'S LIFE OF BRIAN (1979) In this tale of Brian of Nazareth (Graham Chapman), a rather dimwitted Judean freedom fighter who annoys Pontius Pilate and whom people keep trying to turn into a messiah, the British comedy troupe sends up movies like ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' and ''King of Kings.''

HEADLINE: The Dark Side of the 'Green' City

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS. 
Andrew Ross is a professor of social and cultural analysis at New York University and author of ''Bird on Fire: Lessons From the World's Least Sustainable City.''

 BODY:
Phoenix
THE struggle to slow global warming will be won or lost in cities, which emit 80 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. So ''greening'' the city is all the rage now. But if policy makers end up focusing only on those who can afford the low-carbon technologies associated with the new environmental conscientiousness, the movement for sustainability may end up exacerbating climate change rather than ameliorating it.
While cities like Portland, Seattle and San Francisco are lauded for sustainability, the challenges faced by Phoenix, a poster child of Sunbelt sprawl, are more typical and more revealing. In 2009, Mayor Phil Gordon announced plans to make Phoenix the ''greenest city'' in the United States. Eyebrows were raised, and rightly so. According to the state's leading climatologist, central Arizona is in the ''bull's eye'' of climate change, warming up and drying out faster than any other region in the Northern Hemisphere. The Southwest has been on a drought watch 12 years and counting, despite outsized runoff last winter to the upper Colorado River, a major water supply for the subdivisions of the Valley of the Sun. 
Across that valley lies 1,000 square miles of low-density tract housing, where few signs of greening are evident. That's no surprise, given the economic free fall of a region that had been wholly dependent on the homebuilding industry. Property values in parts of metro Phoenix have dropped by 80 percent, and some neighborhoods are close to being declared ''beyond recovery.''
In the Arizona Legislature, talk of global warming is verboten and Republican lawmakers can be heard arguing for the positive qualities of greenhouse gases. Most politicians are still praying for another housing boom on the urban fringe; they have no Plan B, least of all a low-carbon one. Mr. Gordon, a Democrat who took office in 2004, has risen to the challenge. But the vast inequalities of the metro area could blunt the impact of his sustainability plans.
Those looking for ecotopia can find pockets of it in the prosperous upland enclaves of Scottsdale, Paradise Valley and North Phoenix. Hybrid vehicles, LEED-certified custom homes with solar roofs and xeriscaped yards, which do not require irrigation, are popular here, and voter support for the preservation of open space runs high. By contrast, South Phoenix is home to 40 percent of the city's hazardous industrial emissions and America's dirtiest ZIP code, while the inner-ring Phoenix suburbs, as a legacy of cold-war era industries, suffer from some of the worst groundwater contamination in the nation.
Whereas uptown populations are increasingly sequestered in green showpiece zones, residents in low-lying areas who cannot afford the low-carbon lifestyle are struggling to breathe fresh air or are even trapped in cancer clusters. You can find this pattern in many American cities. The problem is that the carbon savings to be gotten out of this upscale demographic -- which represents one in five American adults and is known as Lohas, an acronym for ''lifestyles of health and sustainability'' -- can't outweigh the commercial neglect of the other 80 percent. If we are to moderate climate change, the green wave has to lift all vessels.
Solar chargers and energy-efficient appliances are fine, but unless technological fixes take into account the needs of low-income residents, they will end up as lifestyle add-ons for the affluent. Phoenix's fledgling light-rail system should be expanded to serve more diverse neighborhoods, and green jobs should be created in the central city, not the sprawling suburbs. Arizona has some of the best solar exposure in the world, but it allows monopolistic utilities to impose a regressive surcharge on all customers to subsidize roof-panel installation by the well-heeled ones. Instead of green modifications to master-planned communities at the urban fringe, there should be concerted ''infill'' investment in central city areas now dotted with vacant lots.
In a desert metropolis, the choice between hoarding and sharing has consequences for all residents. Their predecessors -- the Hohokam people, irrigation farmers who subsisted for over a thousand years around a vast canal network in the Phoenix Basin -- faced a similar test, and ultimately failed. The remnants of Hohokam canals and pit houses are a potent reminder of ecological collapse; no other American city sits atop such an eloquent allegory.

HEADLINE: Looking at Inequality in America

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Wrong Inequality'' (column, Nov. 1), David Brooks implies that the Occupy Wall Street movement is narrowly focused on Blue Inequality, experienced by city dwellers who witness the extravagance of the 1 percent, and blind to what he terms Red Inequality, the gap between those in Middle America with a college degree and those without.
Those of us who identify with the Occupy Wall Street movement have already been fighting against the broader, so-called Red inequities for decades. We have written to Congress, joined civil action groups, attended school board meetings, donated to charity and worked on campaigns. 
Our struggle has been fruitless because no matter how many letters to Congress we wrote, we could never compete with the indomitable influence of the 1 percent.
Occupy Wall Street not only understands what inequality is -- all forms of inequality -- but it also correctly identifies its source: an undemocratic alliance between financial interests and government. The Red versus Blue dichotomy is, at best, an obsolete debate and, at worst, a fabricated wedge designed to keep America's working class divided and, thus, conquered.
JESSICA BONANNO Orlando, Fla., Nov. 2, 2011
The writer is a music teacher.
To the Editor:
What David Brooks describes as Blue Inequality versus Red Inequality might be better termed cause and effect.
The main reason for the radical accumulation of wealth in the hands of the 1 percent is federal policy: changes to the tax structure that allow the wealthiest Americans to retain even more of their income and capital gains, and corporate welfare policies that effectively transfer money from the 99 percent to corporations. This reduces the funds available for childhood nutrition, education, job training, health care and all the other programs designed to combat the social inequalities Mr. Brooks decries.
The Occupy movement isn't about jealousy, despite what Mr. Brooks insinuates. It's about understanding precisely the link between the two inequalities that Mr. Brooks writes about and the dire, and ever worsening, results.
ALISON PERCHUK Los Angeles, Nov. 1, 2011
To the Editor:
David Brooks articulates the reason for the ambivalence I feel toward the 99 percent movement. As an economist studying poverty, earnings and inequality, the 99th percentile seems an odd place to draw the line (and the focus of public attention) in discussions of our income distribution.
In 1975 in the United States, a full-time worker earning just above the bottom 20 percent could earn his way above the poverty line for a small family. By the mid-1990s, this was no longer true. The Great Recession took up where this decades-long trend of rising inequality left off and has created millions of new poor American families.
The skyrocketing incomes of the top 1 percent are certainly worthy of serious discussion, but the continuing decline at the bottom -- and its potential effects on future productivity and economic growth -- should capture our attention as well.
ANN HUFF STEVENS Davis, Calif., Nov. 1, 2011
The writer is chairwoman of the economics department and director of the Center for Poverty Research at the University of California, Davis.
To the Editor:
Inequality in America is not Red or Blue; it is Purple. Poverty, failed schools, and crumbling families and communities are as evident in cities as they are in suburbs and rural areas.
Moreover, these problems did not appear out of thin air. They are the direct result of a society in which the elite have rigged our government and economy in a successful campaign to preserve their wealth and power at any expense.
This is what the protesters are saying. I urge David Brooks to listen.

HEADLINE: In Europe, Market Fear Shifts Focus To Italy

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
European efforts to solve a growing sovereign debt crisis have failed to quell market unease on the Continent, and the skepticism over Greece points to continued volatility this week.
Among fresh warning signs, Italy's cost of borrowing has jumped to the highest rate since the country adopted the euro. Others signs include pressures building in the plumbing of Europe's banking system. While those pressures are not yet at the levels experienced during the 2008 financial crisis, when some markets in the United States froze altogether, they are high enough to cause worry, analysts say.
Even as Greece reached an agreement on Sunday to form a coalition government meant to avert the collapse of the latest bailout plan for the euro zone, investors are still demanding greater certainty on how Europe would pay for a rescue package aimed at stopping the Greek financial contagion from spreading to Italy or Spain.
''This is a bit of a sideshow,'' Mark D. Luschini, chief strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said of the shifting political leadership in Greece. ''Markets will react favorably to this, but they won't rally hard on the news. Italy is the bigger issue.'' 
In the United States, credit markets tightened earlier this year during a political stand-off over the debt ceiling and the ratings downgrade of the country's long-term debt by Standard & Poor's, but conditions have eased since then.
European banks are likely to remain wary about lending to one another, analysts predict, and investors will continue to require high interest rates on the billions of euros in loans Italy needs each month to keep its economy afloat.
The yield on 10-year Italian notes has surpassed that on Spanish debt, reaching 6.35 percent on Friday after leaders at a meeting of the Group of 20 nations failed to come up with details on how to stop the European crisis from spreading. The rising yield is troubling because once the interest rates on the debt of the bailed out countries Greece and Portugal surpassed 7 percent they shot up far higher, requiring those countries to turn to outside sources of financing. Rates on their debt remain in double digits.
At the end of last month, Italy issued 3 billion euros worth of bonds at an interest rate of more than 6 percent, about 1.5 percentage points higher than it had had to pay as recently as the summer. The extra bond yields are adding as much as 3 billion euros (about $4.1 billion ) annually in additional interest payments, estimates Tobias Blattner, a former economist at the European Central Bank who is an economist at Daiwa Securities in London.
Analysts are concerned that if interest rates on Italian debt keep rising, the country may no longer be able to afford to borrow on the open markets and instead would have to turn to official lenders like the European Union or the International Monetary Fund.
The latest rate ''is a warning,'' said Mark McCormick, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. ''Seven percent would be a point of no return.''
The European Central Bank is providing another gauge of European stress -- the amount of sovereign bonds it is now buying on an almost daily basis. The central bank is trying to provide a market for the debt of countries like Italy and keep interest rates from rising to punishing levels.
This year, the amount of sovereign debt held by the central bank has more than doubled, to over 150 billion euros. Many analysts say they think the bank would have to buy bonds on a much larger scale to stop interest rates from creeping higher, let alone drive yields substantially lower.
European banks, worried about each others' exposure to bad debts, have demanded an increasingly higher interest rate to lend euros to one another. The rate, measured by a gauge called Euribor-OIS, was 20 basis points as recently as June, but has since jumped to 90 to 100 basis points. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) The current rate, however, is still far below levels in 2008 and 2009 during the financial crisis, when it reached more than 2 percent.
Since May, sources of dollars have also been drying up, as United States money market funds have pulled back from buying the short-term debt of European banks.
According to Alex Roever, who tracks short-term credit markets for JPMorgan Chase, the agreement in Brussels on the latest euro zone rescue plan has not persuaded money market funds to jump back into the European market.
One of the greatest uncertainties for investors remains the exact nature of the latest bailout vehicle being assembled. The proposed $1.4 trillion European Financial Stability Facility is intended to keep Italy from getting swept up in the debt contagion and so prevent Europe's crisis from metastasizing to a new level and damaging the global economy.
''It has taken so long for the pieces to come together -- and there is still a lot of uncertainty about how the agreement will work -- that it is undermining the confidence of investors,'' Mr. Roever said. ''It didn't encourage anyone to pile back in.''
Instead, with dollars hard to come by, many banks must turn to the open foreign-exchange market, where the cost of swapping euros for dollars has spiked, another warning sign about the operation of money markets, although the cost is still well below levels at the end of 2008.
As European banks have lent less to each other, they have instead socked away cash at the European Central Bank. Banks' deposits at the central bank have shot up at the same time that borrowing from the central bank has risen.
''Banks are so nervous to lend to one another, they are using the E.C.B. as a clearinghouse,'' said Guy Lebas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.
Michael Gapen of Barclays Capital in New York says he prefers credit-default swaps as an indicator of sovereign risk. The swaps provide a measure of the cost of insuring against a default on debt.
''It should directly map into probability of default,'' he said. ''It tends to lead bond markets.''
But other analysts say credit-default swaps may be compromised as an indicator after an agreement was reached to allow Greece to write off 50 percent of the debt owed to some banks without triggering the insurance.
The cost of insuring a basket of Western European sovereign debt eased a little around the time of a summit meeting in Brussels at the end of October, but it has once again approached record highs. And insurance rates on the debt of Spain -- and especially Italy -- have risen sharply since the summer.
The annual cost to insure $10 million of the debt of a basket of big European banks rose to more than $300,000 in mid-September, the data provider Markit said. It has since dropped back to about $245,000 annually, but remains at stressed levels -- and some analysts see it staying there.
''The markets are looking and hoping for a stable Greek government that is able to sustain domestic and external support,'' said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive of the bond investment giant Pimco. ''A coalition government that is simply seen as a transition to new elections would have difficulty.''

HEADLINE: The Next Fight Over Jobs

 BODY:
The way the job market is going, it will never be robust enough to bring down the unemployment rate, now at 9 percent, or 13.9 million people. Monthly job growth has slowed to an average of just 90,000 new jobs a month over the past six months, a pace at which growth in the working-age population will always exceed the number of new jobs being created. 
High unemployment and low job growth, which have plagued the economy all through the current ''recovery,'' hurt both consumer spending and economic growth. But don't count on government to do the obvious and urgent thing -- intervene to create jobs.
Tragically, the more entrenched the jobs shortage becomes, the more paralyzed Congress becomes, with Republicans committed to doing nothing in the hopes that the faltering economy will cost President Obama his job in 2012. Last week, for instance, Senate Republicans filibustered a $60 billion proposal by Mr. Obama to create jobs by repairing and upgrading the nation's deteriorating infrastructure. They were outraged that the bill would have been paid for by a 0.7 percent surtax on people making more than $1 million.
Things may be about to get worse.
Federal unemployment benefits, which generally kick in after 26 weeks of state-provided benefits, are scheduled to expire at the end of the year. That would be a disaster for many of the estimated 3.5 million Americans who get by on extended benefits -- an average of $295 a week. It would also be a blow to the economy, because it would reduce consumer spending by about $50 billion in 2012 -- which would mean slower economic growth and 275,000 lost jobs. Unfortunately, given Republicans' demonstrated willingness to ignore human needs and economic logic, it is more likely than not that jobless benefits will be a major battle in the months ahead.
There are no plausible arguments against an extension -- in fact, Congress has never let federal benefits expire when the unemployment rate was higher than 7.2 percent. But there are many specious arguments, chief among them that providing benefits reduces the incentive to get a new job. The evidence says otherwise.
A recent paper by Jesse Rothstein, an economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research, shows that benefit extensions in early 2011 raised the jobless rate by about 0.1 to 0.5 percentage points, but most of that was due to benefit recipients staying in the labor force and actively looking for work during the time they are collecting benefits, rather than, say, dropping out in despair.
Unemployment benefits are the first line of defense against ruin from job loss that is beyond an individual's control. In a time of historically elevated long-term unemployment, they are an important way to keep workers connected to the job-search market. They are also crucial to ensuring that the weak economy doesn't weaken further.
They clearly need to be extended, though we have no illusion that it will happen without a fight.

HEADLINE: Reefer Madness

BYLINE: By ETHAN NADELMANN. 
Ethan Nadelmann is the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance.

 BODY:
MARIJUANA is now legal under state law for medical purposes in 16 states and the District of Columbia, encompassing nearly one-third of the American population. More than 1,000 dispensaries provide medical marijuana; many are well regulated by state and local law and pay substantial taxes. But though more than 70 percent of Americans support legalizing medical marijuana, any use of marijuana remains illegal under federal law.
When he ran for president, Barack Obama defended the medical use of marijuana and said that he would not use Justice Department resources to override state laws on the issue. He appeared to make good on this commitment in October 2009, when the Justice Department directed federal prosecutors not to focus their efforts on ''individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana.'' 
But over the past year, federal authorities appear to have done everything in their power to undermine state and local regulation of medical marijuana and to create uncertainty, fear and confusion among those in the industry. The president needs to reassert himself to ensure that his original policy is implemented.
The Treasury Department has forced banks to close accounts of medical marijuana businesses operating legally under state law. The Internal Revenue Service has required dispensary owners to pay punitive taxes required of no other businesses. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives recently ruled that state-sanctioned medical marijuana patients can not purchase firearms.
United States attorneys have also sent letters to local officials, coinciding with the adoption or implementation of state medical marijuana regulatory legislation, stressing their authority to prosecute all marijuana offenses. Prosecutors have threatened to seize the property of landlords and put them behind bars for renting to marijuana dispensaries. The United States attorney in San Diego, Laura E. Duffy, has promised to start targeting media outlets that run dispensaries' ads.
President Obama has not publicly announced a shift in his views on medical marijuana, but his administration seems to be declaring one by fiat. The head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Michele M. Leonhart, a Bush appointee re-nominated by Mr. Obama, has exercised her discretionary authority to retain marijuana's classification as a Schedule I drug with ''no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.'' And the pronouncements on marijuana, medical and otherwise, from Mr. Obama's top drug policy adviser, R. Gil Kerlikowske, have been indistinguishable from those of Mr. Bush's.
None of this makes any sense in terms of public safety, health or fiscal policy. Apart from its value to patients, medical marijuana plays an increasingly important role in local economies, transforming previously illegal jobs into legal ones and creating many new jobs as well, contributing to local tax bases and stimulating new economic activity. Federal crackdowns will not stop the trade in marijuana; they will only push it back underground and hurt those patients least able to navigate illicit markets.
Perhaps not since the civil rights era has law enforcement played such an aggressive role in what is essentially a cultural and political struggle. But this time the federal government is playing the bully, riding roughshod over states' rights, not to protect vulnerable individuals but to harm them.
At the federal level, there have been few voices of protest. Senior Democrats on Capitol Hill shy away from speaking out. Republicans mostly ignore the extent to which anti-marijuana zealotry threatens core conservative values like states rights, property rights and gun ownership.
Mr. Obama briefly showed a willingness to challenge the drug-war mind-set that permeates the federal drug-control establishment. He needs to show leadership and intervene now, to encourage and defend responsible state and local regulation of medical marijuana.

HEADLINE: Best Buy Pays $1.3 Billion for Cellphone Business

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The electronics retailer reached a deal with Carphone Warehouse of Britain to take full ownership of a fast-growing American cellphone joint venture and said it would abandon its expansion of big-box stores across Europe. 

 BODY:
9:53 a.m. | Updated 
LONDON -- The electronics retailer Best Buy agreed on Monday to pay $1.3 billion for full ownership of a fast-growing American cellphone joint venture from its British partner, the Carphone Warehouse Group.
Best Buy also said it was abandoning plans to expand its so-called big-box stores across Europe as the sovereign debt crisis continued to weigh on consumer spending across the Continent. The company is set to close all 11 of it existing big-box stores in Britain, which employ about 1,000 people.
Under the terms of the deal, Best Buy will take full control of Best Buy Mobile, a cellphone business that has expanded rapidly in North America, partly as a result of the rise of smartphones, including the AppleiPhone. The acquisition is expected to close by March 2012, and will increase Best Buy's pre-tax profits by up to $140 million in 2013.
"We wanted to use the Best Buy Mobile team to sell connections to consumers," Best Buy chief executive Brian J. Dunn said on a conference call with investors. "There's no doubt we can go faster in the U.S. and Canada to unleash the team."
The deal ends a profit-sharing agreement with Carphone Warehouse that Best Buy signed in 2008 as it sought to expand its presence in the cellphone market. As part of the sale, both companies have the option to buy the other out of their European joint venture, Best Buy Europe, in 2015.
The two companies will continue to work together through a new venture targeted at expanding their cellphone business into emerging markets, particularly China and Mexico.
"We are aggressively ramping up our growing connections capability to support consumers' increasingly connected lives across the entire range of devices entering the marketplace," Best Buy's Mr. Dunn said in a statement. "Over the past four years we have built unsurpassed expertise and depth of offerings in mobile."
The cash influx bolstered Carphone shares, which rose more than 11 percent on Monday in morning trading in London. The share price, however, fell back down by the afternoon and was trading 1.16 percent up at 2:36 p.m. GMT.
The company said the money from the Best Buy Mobile sale would be returned to shareholders.
Carphone Warehouse also announced Monday a 78 percent annual decline in net profit to 5.5 million, or $8.5 million, during the six months through September.
The British firm blamed the drop on Europe's struggling economy and low consumer confidence.
The tough economic climate also has affected Best Buy. While the company plans to expand its cellphone operations in North America, it has faced cutthroat competition from domestic rivals as well as a deteriorating economic environment that has led many consumers to cut back on spending.
After opening its first British big-box store in 2010, Best Buy had planned to open more than 100 large stores in the country as an initial expansion into Europe. The company said it would now focus on its 2,500 small European stores, mostly to sell cellphones.
The failure to crack the European electronics market follows similar troubles in emerging markets, including Turkey and China, where the company faced tough local competition and ongoing regulatory delays.

BYLINE: GENE MARKS

Brad Plumer says America doesn't have a small-business problem -- it has a start-up problem. One piece of evidence: A 2010 Rand study found that Americans are more likely to start new businesses as soon as they turn 65 and qualify for Medicare. In a rare interview, Mark Zuckerberg has some advice for start-ups. Vinicius Vacanti writes aboutthe long grind before becoming a success: "Now that I look back, I realize that I was wrong to think that we had nothing to show for two and half years of hustling. You're learning every day. And, when the inspiration strikes, you're going to be ready to pounce on it."

Around the World: China's Rich Want Out
Yes, the world's population hit seven billion, but a global population bust is on the way. Global Entrepreneurship Week is coming. Pakistan is ready to normalize trade with India. Croatia employs Q.R. codes on its postage stamps. By year's end, Brazil should become the world's sixth biggest economy, surpassing Britain, which, by the way, threatens to switch time zones. In Spain, both cash and snakesare disbursed from A.T.M.'s. Some think Canada is a start-up paradise. These facts about the Chinese start-up scene may blow your mind. Frank Holmes explains how China drives the global economy: "We've stated many times we don't believe the Chinese economy is a bubble, but that does not mean a significant slowdown wouldn't affect the global economy, especially natural resources. This is because China's economic transformation over the past few decades has cast the country into the forefront of demand." Nonetheless, China's manufacturing index falls, and almost half of China's rich want to emigrate.
The Week's Bests
Way to Sell to Moms. Kerry Bowbliss and Sherry Lombardi explain how: "We're looking for activities to enrich and entertain our little ones. We spend about $2,000 per year, per kid, on things like cooking classes, language lessons, puppet shows and fall festivals. And it doesn't look like that will change any time soon. Fifty-four percent of our moms said they will spend the same over the next 12 months and 35 percent plan to spend more. Consider holding a unique event for our kids, and we'll likely be there."
Reason to Favor Grit Over Talent. Jocelyn Glei says grit is more important: "As the hierarchy of the traditional workplace breaks down, we are all gaining more freedom and flexibility. More and more, we can set our own long-term goals, we can determine our own work schedules, we can work at an office or at a coffee shop, we can make our own decisions about what we focus on today, and what we focus on tomorrow. But this 'freedom' also brings responsibility -- a responsibility that, I would argue, demands a vastly increased capacity for self-control."
Advice From a Dad. Bob Cringely has some advice for his son: "Getting, keeping or making that future job starts with understanding the distribution system and your place in that process. And to survive even mid-term the key is to position yourself as the linchpin. Your knowledge has to be critical to the success or failure of the process. That would seem to call for specialization but specialists often don't see the ball even coming. You need a broader view. So for an education -- are you going to a school that helps you to develop serendipitous opportunities for your lifetime?"

HEADLINE: Former 'Blue Man' President Will Be Public Theater's Executive Director

BYLINE: PATRICK HEALY


HIGHLIGHT: Patrick Willingham is the new executive director of Public Theater. 

 BODY:
The board of the Public Theater announced its new executive director on Monday, entrusting its $18.5 million operating budget and other business operations to a somewhat unusual pick: Patrick Willingham, the former president and chief operating officer of Blue Man Productions, a for-profit company that turned the Off Broadway production "Blue Man Group" into an international entertainment attraction.
Both the Public's artistic director, Oskar Eustis, and Mr. Willingham said in telephone interviews on Monday that he was a counterintuitive selection: Mr. Willingham has never been a senior executive or financial officer at a nonprofit theater before, nor does he have experience in theater fund-raising or producing a season. 
He begins work on Nov. 28 facing his first challenge: the Public, a pre-eminent Off Broadway theater, finished its last fiscal year on Aug. 31 with its first deficit in seven years. Mr. Eustis attributed the deficit in part to not having a permanent executive director since February, when Andrew D. Hamingson resigned.
Mr. Hamingson left after Public board members lost faith in him because of financial losses from the musical "Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson" that transferred to Broadway and the revival of "Hair" that transferred to London, both for commercial runs, according to people familiar with his departure at the time.
Mr. Eustis said on Monday that the board has since put new financial controls in place: All contracts now must have two signatures, instead of one, and a new board committee on commercial productions has been established. Mr. Eustis and a spokeswoman for the Public said that they could not provide a figure for the size of the fiscal year deficit because the books were still being audited. "It's not a scary figure," Mr. Eustis said.
Mr. Eustis said he did not know Mr. Willingham before the outside firm helping with the search recruited him as a candidate.
"When I was simply told his resume, I thought, 'What sense does that make?' but as I dug deeper and then talked to Patrick I realized that he had very serious qualifications," Mr. Eustis said. "He is a genuine theater cat in a serious way, who has hands-on expertise in all facets of theater production." 
Mr. Eustis noted that Mr. Willingham began his career managing costume shops for Players Theater in Columbus, Ohio, and for the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival, and described him as a strategic thinker with an eye on new opportunities in the broader context of the economics, mission, and goals of a given company.
Mr. Willingham, 44, said his focus would be on "improving the stability of the Public and a legacy of sustainability there." He worked at Blue Man Productions for 16 years; there he was a neighbor of the Public on Lafayette Street in Greenwich Village.
"I was excited when I heard about the position, but it was my discussions with Oskar about the mission of the Public that really grabbed me by the lapels - the idea of culture as a birthright and the importance of theater to the cultural and political dialogue of the country," Mr. Willingham said. 
He said he left Blue Man Productions a year ago after one of his mentors there decided to move on to other projects; he has been working as a theater consultant since then. Mr. Eustis said the full board's search committee and the full panel voted unanimously to hire Mr. Willingham and give him a three-year contract.

HEADLINE: Five Questions for Neera Tanden

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The Caucus will occasionally pose five questions to individuals from across the political spectrum 

 BODY:
As we head toward another election year, The Caucus will occasionally pose five questions to individuals from across the political spectrum who have special insight into government, policy-making and political combat. If there is someone you think should be interviewed, let us know in the comment section below, or send me an email at michael.shear@nytimes.com
This week's subject is Neera Tanden, who recently took over as president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal research institute.
MR. SHEAR: How will CAP be different with you at the helm?
MS. TANDEN: Over the next year, we will focus on developing larger-scale, bold solutions to America's thorniest problems. Particularly on the economy, I think we have a short-term and a long-term challenge. Everyone is focused on economic growth right now and how to spur economic growth. But I do think that there is a longer challenge for the country, which is part of what's animating the anger we are seeing across the political spectrum. The concern that I think people have is that we don't see a long-term vision and a set of policies around them that will ensure that our kids will do better than we do.
MR. SHEAR: What single thing could President Obama do during the next year to keep liberals motivated?
MS. TANDEN: The biggest challenge he had with the liberal base was a seeming adoption of austerity politics. I think his move to focus on jobs has quelled a lot of being dispirited. The Republican Party has shifted so right on these issues that he has an opportunity to unite independents and progressives around a growth agenda. If he continues to outline the contrast between an invest-and-grow agenda and a cut-and-shrivel opposition, that's what progressives -- and I believe the rest of the country -- will warm to.
MR. SHEAR: What's an example of a trade-off or compromise that the White House should make with the Republicans in Congress?
MS. TANDEN: Look, the president definitely tapped into a frustration with Washington in 2007 and 2008 by talking about the desire to reach across the aisle. The challenge with that narrative and that strategy is when you have an opposing party willing to basically terrorize the country in the debt ceiling deal by playing brinksmanship. It takes two to tango. If your whole narrative is about reaching across the aisle, then you are empowering the alternative.
MR. SHEAR: How should progressives deal with the Occupy Wall Street movement?
MS. TANDEN: I don't think the issues are tactical -- whether we embrace the movement or not. It's more of a question of the issues that they are raising. Clearly, they are managing to communicate a concern that is really resonating with the country at large around widespread inequality and a concern that the game is rigged against average Americans. We welcome any focus on that message, and we recognize that Occupy Wall Street has brought tremendous attention to these issues.
MR. SHEAR: What do you think is the president's strongest argument to voters on the economy, given all the bad numbers?
MS. TANDEN: First and foremost, I think that voters will be measuring movement on the economy, whether we have any forward movement or not. We had the 2.5 percent GDP [growth rate last quarter]; it was higher than expected. He has an economic argument and a leadership argument, which is he's the only candidate who has ideas to generate growth now. He benefits by having a House Republican foil which demonstrates no interest in solving the problem and only ideas to stall the problem. I think the House Republicans will be a big challenge for the Republican nominee, and I believe the president will be able to set up an argument about actually doing everything you can to create jobs now and invest and grow the economy versus a slash and stall strategy which says cut everything you can.

HEADLINE: Its Leader on Sidelines, Regulator Faces Biggest Test in MF Global

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: Gary Gensler's recusal from the MF Global investigation comes at a critical juncture for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 

 BODY:
A few days before MF Global's collapse, regulators stationed at the firm were assured its books were in order.
 Their boss, Gary Gensler, was not convinced. A former Goldman Sachs partner who once passed the test for certified public accountants, he bore into the numbers himself and grew uneasy with the firm's finances.
 "Keep pressing them," he told his regulators, according to people with direct knowledge of the conversation.
 Within days, his suspicions were confirmed. More than $600 million in customer money was missing from MF Global, prompting an investigation by Mr. Gensler's Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
As the regulator intensifies its inquiry into MF Global and the firm's former leader, Jon S. Corzine, the agency must do without its hard-charging chairman. Last week, Mr. Gensler stepped away from the investigation amid questions over his relationship to Mr. Corzine, his former boss at Goldman Sachs and a fellow Democrat.
 Now, the worry is that the commission will stumble in its rare turn on center stage without its star leading the way.
Mr. Gensler's withdrawal from the investigation came despite apparently only loose ties to Mr. Corzine. The men have seen each other just a handful of times since Mr. Gensler left Goldman Sachs in 1997. Mr. Gensler did not attend Mr. Corzine's 2010 wedding. And Mr. Corzine did not attend the funeral of Mr. Gensler's wife, a noted artist who died of breast cancer in 2006.
Mr. Gensler's recusal puts the C.F.T.C. at a potential disadvantage as it embarks on its most high-profile investigation since its founding in 1974.
 Under Mr. Gensler, the commission had begun to shed a reputation as a toothless watchdog, bringing a record number of enforcement cases while writing new rules to police Wall Street.
At the same time, the agency's budget is under attack on Capitol Hill and it faces questions over its handling of MF Global. Lawyers and MF Global clients have questioned why it is taking so long to recover money that should have never been missing at all.
 "There is a huge spotlight on the agency now," said Scott Talbott, a lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable, a Wall Street trade group.
 Mr. Gensler has been Washington's most aggressive ambassador to Wall Street, introducing sweeping new rules to crack down on excessive risk taking.
 Even industry groups acknowledge his influence, though they are not fond of his aggressive tactics. He can be difficult, colleagues said. And his unshakeable faith in regulation has left some fearful the agency will jeopardize Wall Street's anemic recovery and broader economic growth.
 "It may be useful for Chairman Gensler in the short run to be viewed as an opponent of the financial industry, but to be successful in the long run, the C.F.T.C. will have to produce workable regulations that do not damage the economy too much," said Steven Lofchie, a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. "The jury is still out on whether the C.F.T.C. can do that." 
 Wall Street scourge is an unlikely addition to the resume of Mr. Gensler, a 54-year-old marathon runner and father of three daughters.
 Mr. Gensler grew up in Baltimore, the son of working-class parents who never went to college. His father was a cigarette and pinball machine vendor to local Baltimore bars. After graduating from public school, Mr. Gensler attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania for his undergraduate degree and master's in business administration.
 He spent 18 years at Goldman Sachs, where he was a star dealmaker in New York and Tokyo before ascending to the position of co-head of finance. After leaving the firm in 1997, a multimillionaire, he joined the Treasury Department under President Bill Clinton. It was then that the agency presided over the broad deregulation of Wall Street, and the very markets Mr. Gensler now monitors.
 Citing that past, liberal lawmakers held up Mr. Gensler's 2009 nomination to the C.F.T.C., worried he was too sympathetic to Wall Street's ways.
 Those critics were largely silenced after Mr. Gensler took a lead role in helping write the Dodd-Frank Act, the regulatory overhaul passed in the wake of the financial crisis. Mr. Gensler played a major role in writing portions of the law that deal with financial derivatives, the complex contracts at the center of the crisis. That market has exploded in size over the last decade, and is now pegged at $600 trillion.
But his former ties to Goldman and Mr. Corzine came into focus again last week. The two men spent nearly 18 years together at the Wall Street firm. In the early 1990s, Mr. Gensler, who has completed nine marathons, ran the New York City Marathon, borrowing Mr. Corzine's running number when his boss was unable to compete in the race.
 Years later, when Mr. Corzine ran for governor of New Jersey, Mr. Gensler supported his campaign with a $10,000 check. An active Democrat who worked for the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, Mr. Gensler has contributed nearly $300,000 to the party since 1990, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Late last year, Mr. Gensler and Mr. Corzine served on a panel on banking at Princeton University.
Fearful that their Goldman connection could be perceived as a conflict, Mr. Gensler stepped away from the investigation after Oct. 31, the day of MF Global's bankruptcy.
 The move appeased Republican critics, who were pushing for Mr. Gensler to recuse himself. Still, his supporters say it will free up his time to focus on another pet peeve of conservatives: Dodd-Frank. 
 In his office, Mr. Gensler keeps an autographed copy of the 2,300-page law. The namesake author of the law, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, even signed a special note to the regulator, saying "you should derive satisfaction from this," a nod to the derivatives industry that Mr. Gensler now watches over.
The C.F.T.C. chairman is also known around the office as an mountain climber. Since he no longer has the time to run marathons, he takes the stairs every day to his ninth-floor office. Colleagues say he has a penchant for walking the halls in socked feet, which he props up on his employees' desks when chatting with them.
 Those who work with Mr. Gensler say his attention to detail is exhaustive. He dives into Wall Street minutiae with an aggressive - some say obsessive - fervor. This summer, when finalizing an obscure detail of a new rule, Mr. Gensler missed a dinner party for his sister.
 Some say Mr. Gensler can be a tough, at times stubborn, negotiator. On one recent occasion, when at odds with another regulator about a contentious rule, Mr. Gensler wouldn't budge, saying: "I believe this to my core." He co-wrote a book called "The Great Mutual Fund Trap" critical of an industry where his twin brother, Robert, works as an executive at T. Rowe Price.
And in an austere environment for government, Mr. Gensler has sought to roughly double the agency's budget and staff.
 He has also expanded the agency's regulatory firepower with a number of crucial hires. A top derivatives lawyer, Gary Barnett, was poached from Linklaters, to bolster his Dodd-Frank forces. He also hired David Meister, a former partner at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Meagher & Flom and former federal prosecutor, to revamp the agency's enforcement effort.
 The expansion appears to be bearing fruit. The last fiscal year, the agency brought a record 99 enforcement actions, 74 percent more than the previous year. It has also levied record fines of nearly $300 million.
 MF Global is the agency's biggest enforcement test yet.
Whether the scandal will burnish or tarnish the reputation of the agency, as well as that of Mr. Gensler, will depend on how quickly authorities can locate the missing money and pinpoint what went wrong.
 As MF Global was rushing to save itself through a sale, Mr. Gensler was sounding alarms that customer money could be missing. He called the firm's lawyer, H. Rodgin Cohen, to ask for proof that the firm was separating its money from that of its customers. As a patchwork of regulators descended on the firm, Mr. Gensler served as a clearinghouse for information, firing off e-mail updates for other regulators as well as his own staff, responsibilities typically handled by less senior officials.
 At 2:30 a.m. on Oct. 31, Mr. Gensler received a call from his staff still camped out at MF Global's offices: more than $600 million in customer money was missing. He spent the next five hours in his bathrobe on a conference call with fellow regulators.
 Amid the chaos that day, Mr. Gensler was also frantically searching his suburban Maryland home for a glove to complete his daughter's cavewoman Halloween costume.

HEADLINE: In Portland, Ore., Being an E.V. Pioneer Brings Unforeseen Challenges

BYLINE: KEN BELSON


HIGHLIGHT: Keeping public E.V. chargers free of graffiti is just one of many issues that the creators of Electric Avenue, on the campus of Portland State University, are facing. 

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Ore. -- Sightings of the Nissan Leaf are a regular occurrence here on streets and freeways. Residents are retrofitting their older cars to run purely on electricity. D.C. fast chargers are being installed. And in August, a block on the campus of Portland State University became Electric Avenue.
Nearly three months on, the academics, city officials and company executives who built and are monitoring the Electric Avenue project, consisting of a one-way street with six chargers and parking exclusively for electric vehicles, have started to tally the many challenges to promoting electric transportation.
At E.V. Roadmap 4: Getting to a Million, a two-day workshop on electric vehicles held here last week, a five-person panel outlined issues large and small.
Charlie Allcock, the director of economic development at Portland General Electric, the utility that helped build Electric Avenue, said that more direct lighting was needed to ensure that users could see the plug ports on their cars when recharging. The designers, he said, did not factor in that people would be plugging in at night and in the rain and fog.
They also did not expect the chargers to be easy targets for graffiti artists or the pigeons that perched along a sky bridge that paralleled the street. After the chargers became dirty, the board realized that it had not assigned a specific person to look after them. A worker in the parking lot across the street has since been deputized with keeping them clean.
"It was so obvious, we missed it," said George Beard, who helped spearhead the Electric Avenue project and organized last week's conference, which was attended by government and industry officials from Georgia, Indiana and Colorado, among other states. "No one had operational responsibility for this, so we had to keep an eye on it."
Mr. Allcock added that while there was a widely acknowledged industry standard for electric chargers, each company interpreted it differently. Each charging unit, for example, had a different interface, so drivers had to learn how to use them all. The chargers also synched with the vehicles in different ways and, when the units were in sleep mode, had different ways of rebooting.
Rani Boyle, a planner in the Planning, Sustainability and Real Estate division at the university, said that the charger manufacturers were asked not to put any advertisements on their machines or issue any member cards to consumers.
"In essence, we were asking them to make the machines dumber than the companies wanted," she said. "It didn't fit all the business models out there."
Katja Dillman, a transportation policy adviser for Portland's mayor, Sam Adams, said that the city was starting to track parking violations by type to determine whether and how often drivers of gasoline-powered cars parked illegally in spots reserved for electric vehicles.
Mr. Allcock of Portland General Electric raised another issue: how to notify drivers that the chargers were there. The utility is trying to determine where to place signs on Interstate 5 and other major roads to guide drivers to Electric Avenue. The project's chargers also do not yet register on many GPS systems.
"Once you install them, you have to figure out how to get them up," he said.

HEADLINE: Who Rules the Global Economy?

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: New research shows that the extent to which large multinational corporations dominate the world economy is growing, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Most economists today don't ask who rules the global economy, visualizing it as a decentralized competitive market that cannot be ruled. Yet new evidence suggests that global economic clout is highly concentrated among large interlocking transnational companies. 
Three Swiss experts on complex network analysis have recently examined the architecture of international ownership, analyzing a large database of transnational corporations. They concluded that a large portion of control resides with a relatively small core of financial institutions, with about 147 tightly knit companies controlling about 40 percent of the total wealth in the network.
Their analysis draws heavily on network topology, a methodology that biologists use to good effect. An article in the British magazine New Scientist describes the research as evidence of a global financial oligarchy. 
The technical details of economic network analysis are daunting, but the metaphors evoke a "Star Trek" episode: the network is described as a bow-tie shaped "super entity" of concentrated corporate ownership. One cannot help but worry about threats to the safety of the starship Enterprise.

In recent years, research on industrial organization has focused more on corporate strategy than on social consequences. A recent article in the socialist journal Monthly Review, by John Bellamy Foster, Robert W. McChesney and R. Jamil Janna, criticizes both mainstream and left-wing economists for their lack of attention to monopoly power. 
Focusing on the United States, they note that the percentage of manufacturing industries in which the largest four companies account for at least 50 percent of shipping value has increased to almost 40 percent, up from about 25 percent in 1987. 
Even more striking is the increase in retail consolidation, largely reflecting a "Wal-Mart effect." In 1992, the top four companies accounted for about 47 percent of all general merchandise sales. By 2007, their share had reached 73.2 percent. 
Banking, however, takes the cake. Citing my fellow Economix blogger Simon Johnson, the Monthly Review article notes that in 1995, the six largest bank-holding companies (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley) had assets equal to 17 percent of gross domestic product in the United States. By the third quarter of 2010, this had risen to 64 percent. 
Some of these companies have undergone name changes in the process. A graphic published about a year ago in Mother Jones beautifully illustrates their merger history. 
Large companies are often able to offer lower prices than small ones because they can take advantage of economies of scale. On the other hand, if their market power reaches a certain level, they can increase prices as much as they like. The consequences of economic concentration for consumers are complicated by more difficult-to-trace impacts on small businesses, American workers and small businesses. 
The concentration of economic power at the top distills political power in ways described long ago by the sociologist William Domhoff in his classic "Who Rules America?" The related Web site provides updated information, exhorting today's "change agents" to conduct social scientific research seriously. 
Public concerns about economic concentration are stoked by hard times. Congress authorized a full-scale investigation of the topic back in days of the Great Depression. 
Seems like the time has come for a fully international update.

HEADLINE: Readers Respond: Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Some commenters think unemployment benefits reduce the incentive to get a new job. 

 BODY:
Today's editorial notes that there are no plausible arguments against extending federal unemployment benefits. Benefits, the board says, do not reduce the incentive to get a new job.
For some of our readers, that's obvious. Barry of Lexington, MA says "Let the Congressman who claim[s] $295 a week will keep a person from seeking work try living for the next year on $295 a week." And Culheath of Winter Haven, Fla. Writes "It has always amazed me that conservatives who understand the notion of market regulation by way of paying people not to produce a specific product during period[s] of over abundance, fail to see how that same idea applies to the job market."
Others aren't so sure. John Basic of Pennsylvania claims he has "friends, both in their early 60s, who collect SS payments and unemployment even though they have no intention of working again." Mark of Phoenix, Ariz., thinks "99 weeks of unemployment benefits is ridiculous. Statistics have shown that most people don't start looking for a job until the last month of benefits. Just one more attempt to transform American into a European-style socialist country."
Beyond this basic disagreement, one reader from Washington, D.C., proposes a novel way to raise revenue for job benefits "tax newspaper editorials."
For what it's worth, according to tax.com The New York Times Co. has a heavier tax burden than General Electric.

HEADLINE: Making a Boeing 737 More Like a Prius

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: A simple electric motor system can power a plane as it heads to and from the airport gate, reducing emissions. 

 BODY:
Just as some hybrid cars move at low speeds solely on electricity, Boeing 737s can do the same, reducing fuel burn and emissions, according to a company called WheelTug.
On Monday, the company announced a tentative deal to equip 20 jets of the Israeli carrier El Al with a motor system that eliminates the need for a tug to pull the plane away from the airport gate.
The company sells a pair of electric motors embedded in the aircraft's nose wheel that can be used to back the plane away from the gate, eliminating "pushback," and then enable it to taxi out to the runway at a speed of up to 28 miles per hour. 
The motors in the nosewheel run off electricity from a small engine in the back of the plane called the auxiliary power unit, which is generally used to keep the lights on and keep the plane ventilated when the main engines are turned off. 
Isaiah W. Cox, the company's chief executive, said the savings come from not having to use one or both of the main engines to taxi; each of those burns about 13 pounds of fuel per minute, or about two gallons. The auxiliary power unit burns about 4 pounds per minute, or a little more than half a gallon. In most cases, the auxiliary power unit is running anyway, he said.

Planes can leave the gate faster if they do not have to wait for a tug. The company says that engines will sustain less damage by running less when the plane is on the ground. In taxiing, planes sometimes suck in foreign objects that damage engine blades.
Airports are often major sources of air pollution, and reducing the use of diesel-powered tugs could help reduce that as well, experts say. 
Work on the system began in 1994, and the concept was tested extensively last winter at the airport in Prague. The company, which is based in Gibraltar, hopes to get certification from European and American aviation regulators in early 2013. 
To lure the airlines, which are often reluctant to accept new technology, WheelTug is offering to lease the equipment and split the savings. The fuel savings will easily pay for the lease, and the savings in reduced time on the ground and less engine damage will be obvious as months go by, the company says.

HEADLINE: Schwab Moves From Rotoscoping to Straight Talk

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Charles Schwab brokerage firm is changing its popular "Talk to Chuck" advertising campaign. 

 BODY:
The Charles Schwab brokerage firm is changing its popular "Talk to Chuck" advertising campaign, which has been running since September 2005.
The "Talk to Chuck" theme continues, as does the device of having that phrase appear inside the type of dialogue balloon that could be found in a comic strip or comic book.
Another element that has not changed about the campaign, which is planned to begin on Monday, is the creative agency in charge: Euro RSCG Worldwide in New York, part of the Havas Worldwide division of Havas.
But the commercials in the campaign will no longer use a production technique known as rotoscoping. The technique is created when animators trace over live-action movement on film and produces an effect that many viewers find compelling to watch.

The rotoscoped Schwab commercials featured actors portraying various types of investors, speaking frankly about their problems with investing like high commissions and indifferent brokers.
Replacing those distinctive commercials will be spots that feature a spokesman on a set with a white background who talks directly to the camera, starting all his spiels with "Let's talk about " The commercials end with the "Talk to Chuck" theme.
"The rotoscoping was very effective when we launched it, and very distinctive," said Laurine M. Garrity, who joined the Charles Schwab Corporation as executive vice president and chief marketing officer in February.
In recent research among current and potential customers, "some people loved it, and some people didn't," she added.
Those who did not made comments along the lines of "'It feels a little bit like a cartoon,'" Ms. Garrity said.
"We felt in these times, with so much disruption of financial services, a simple approach, a straightforward approach, someone talking to camera would be distinctive," she added.
In one commercial, the spokesman begins, "Let's talk about you," then continues, "We want to know what's on your mind, not just what's in your portfolio."
In another commercial, the spokesman appears with a welcome mat to illustrate a point about what a brokerage ought to do "to make you feel welcome."
In a third commercial, the spokesman uses a chair as a prop to describe how customers can interact with Schwab online, on the phone or in person -- as in, "Come in and pull up a chair."
The spokesman is an actor named Chris Diamantopoulos, who has appeared in television series like "24," "The Starter Wife" and "Up All Night."
Fun fact: Mr. Diamantopoulos is to play Moe in a new movie about the Three Stooges, which is scheduled to be released next year. (Somehow, "Talk to Moe" does not seem to be as worthwhile a piece of advice as "Talk to Chuck.")
Another change in the campaign, Ms. Garrity said, is that the ads will talk more about specific products and services that are available from Schwab.
The campaign needed to "evolve," she added, because "the markets have changed, the economy has changed and our clients' needs have changed."
For all the changes, it is "critical to maintain" the "Talk to Chuck" theme, Ms. Garrity said, because it is "so memorable."
The campaign includes, in addition to the commercials, print and online ads; the commercials can also be watched online.
Schwab also has a Twitter feed, at twitter.com/CharlesSchwab, and a blog, at www.aboutschwab.com/press/blog.

HEADLINE: China's 'Third Affliction'

BYLINE: DAVID BANDURSKI


HIGHLIGHT: With its latest edict on culture, the Chinese Communist Party is trying to influence global public opinion in its favor, but the move will only highlight China's political injustices. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - "Almost a full house!" Zhao Dayong said, his eyes glinting as we gazed over rows of filmgoers shuffling into their seats. It was a moment neither of us could have imagined two years earlier, as we filmed the Lisu tribespeople through a chilly Christmas in mountainous Fugong, in southwest China, not far from the border with Myanmar. 
Zhao's unapproved independent documentary, "Ghost Town," an unflinching look at a remote community on China's margins - one of those left behind by the country's breakneck development - was having its moment at last. But the ovation that followed the film's world premiere in 2009 at Lincoln Center in New York could not shake the bittersweet recognition that this moment would never have been possible in Zhao's own China. 
My thoughts drifted back to that screening last month, as I watched the nine members of China's Politburo Standing Committee preside over a stiffly choreographed meeting of the country's most senior leaders in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Against a phalanx of red flags and an enormous golden hammer-and-sickle, President Hu Jintao delivered the Chinese Communist Party's document on "promoting the great development and prosperity of socialist culture." 
The gist of the "Decision" was that China's ruling party, recognizing that culture is soft power, would lead a renaissance of cultural creation. The message behind the turgid ideological phrasings and the rodomontade about how the party was leading "the great reawakening of the Chinese people" was that China's leaders would encourage culture so long as it served their narrow political ends. The Decision states emphatically that China's rank-and-file "cultural workers" must uphold the party's "main theme" and "keep to the correct orientation" in cultural creation.

Controlling culture is nothing new to the People's Republic of China. The Chinese Communist Party has twisted culture to its own ends ever since Mao Zedong dogmatized on the role of literature and art at Yan'an in 1942. During the Cultural Revolution, China's traditions were ravaged or subverted to persecute millions. What was new last month was the C.C.P.'s urgent sense that China's power and place in the world should be reflected in its cultural strength. The party has long sought to manufacture legitimacy by "guiding" public opinion domestically through aggressive controls on media and culture. Now it also hopes to influence global public opinion in its favor. 
Behind the bravado lies deep anxiety about what some in China have called the "third affliction," its negative image in the world. With its economy now the envy of the world, China has symbolically thrown off the affliction of poverty. With its powerful and modernizing military, it is no longer afflicted by the threat of foreign aggression, as it was during its "century of shame." Yet the country's international prestige remains constrained by the cultural dominance of the West. Each time China is castigated by the international human rights community, or criticized by the Western media, the country's leaders feel more and more that global public opinion is stacked against them. Western culture and values have gone global in a way that Chinese culture and values have not, and Beijing wants to do something about this. 
China's leaders hope to close this "soft-power deficit" the only way they know how: by diktat. But commercializing state-controlled culture built on repression only turns the spotlight on the injustices of China's political system. China's "third affliction" is a self-inflicted malady. As the popular Chinese blogger Han Han said amid the official drivel in state-run media: "Governments in countries with cultural censorship may no longer fear criticism at the hands of their own country's cultural work, but they must endure the ridicule of the whole world." 
While the government backs slick propaganda epics with blockbuster budgets - like this year's "Founding of the Party" - real creativity will continue to struggle to survive in the gaps. Independent artists, writers and filmmakers like Zhao Dayong, those who refuse to submit to government censorship, will continue to endure marginalization to protect their creative freedom and work in a state of perpetual exile from their Chinese audiences. 
No sooner had the curtain closed on the C.C.P. meeting in Beijing than media outlets in Hong Kong and Taiwan reported with unmistakable schadenfreude that an Oct. 17 showing at Lincoln Center of the 2009 Chinese propaganda epic "The Founding of a Republic" had drawn not a single filmgoer. The screening was an opener for the series "Eastern Promise: Popular Cinema from China,'' a soft power ploy plain and simple. But not even the organizers from China's Ministry of Culture bothered to show up.

HEADLINE: One Option for Corzine in MF Global Inquiry: the Fifth Amendment

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: Jon S. Corzine and other executives from MF Global will have to decide whether to talk early in the investigation of the firm's collapse or wait until later when the legal issues are clearer. 

 BODY:
Will Jon S. Corzine take the Fifth?
To paraphrase Hamlet, to talk or not to talk, that is the question Mr. Corzine and other executives at the bankrupt firm MF Global will have to answer. The Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan authorized the trustee for MF Global, James W. Giddens, to issue subpoenas to former officers, directors and employees to testify about issues related to the commodities and securities firm's collapse and approximately $600 million in missing customer funds.
In an opinion issued last week, the bankruptcy court stated that "[w]hether management of [MF Global] or the debtors was involved in misconduct is clearly a proper subject for investigation." Mr. Giddens is not the only one looking into MF Global's demise, as investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission want answers about the firm's operations.
Mr. Corzine was the face of MF Global since he became its chief executive in March 2010, responsible for its foray into derivatives tied to European sovereign debt that undermined confidence in the firm. He will be a prime candidate to be interviewed by federal investigators and examined by Mr. Giddens. 
Whether Mr. Corzine and other executives are willing to talk, or instead assert the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, this is a crucial decision they will have to resolve quickly because there is pressure to complete the investigation, especially with roughly $600 million in customer funds that appear to be missing.
For Mr. Corzine, the decision whether to testify is especially difficult in light of his once-sterling reputation. As a former Democratic United States senator and governor of New Jersey, in addition to serving as chairman of Goldman Sachs, he has perhaps the most to lose because - fairly or not - an assertion of the Fifth Amendment will be viewed by the public as tantamount to admitting guilt. 
The Fifth Amendment privilege is available to a witness in any proceeding, regardless of whether it is criminal or civil. In Hoffman v. United States, the Supreme Court explained that the constitutional protection "not only extends to answers that would in themselves support a conviction under a federal criminal statute, but likewise embraces those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a federal crime." 
Asserting the Fifth Amendment is not an admission of guilt, and someone who believes he has done nothing wrong can refuse to respond to questions until a later time when the issues are clearer and the potential for criminal liability diminishes. Mr. Corzine is reported to have retained Andrew J. Levander, a leading white-collar criminal defense lawyer, to represent him, so the decision will be an informed one.
There are plenty of recent examples of defendants whose cooperation early in an investigation turned out to cause significant problems later. Both I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, former chief of staff to former Vice President Dick Cheney, and Martha Stewart were convicted for making false statements to the F.B.I and S.E.C., respectively, near the start of investigations of their cases. The former Enron chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, was cross-examined at his criminal trial with testimony he gave to the S.E.C. and before two Congressional committees long before any charges were filed in the case.
When it is unclear what direction the investigation of MF Global might take, a seemingly innocuous statement could be viewed as misleading, or even obstructive, at a later time. Given the confusion surrounding the collapse of MF Global, the prudent course may be to take the Fifth Amendment now, which does not preclude later speaking to investigators or testifying in a judicial or administrative proceeding.
But the cost of taking the Fifth can be significant. For investigators, a potential witness who asserts the privilege often makes that person a focus of the investigation, on the theory that "where there is smoke, there is fire." And while the F.B.I, S.E.C., and C.F.T.C. investigations will be conducted privately, Mr. Giddens is required to file his findings with the bankruptcy court, so a refusal to cooperate by Mr. Corzine and others is likely to become public in the near future, with all of the attendant negative publicity.
Perhaps more ominously, there is likely to be significant interest in Congress on the largest collapse of a Wall Street firm since Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, so it would not be a surprise if hearings were held at which Mr. Corzine may be called as a witness. Unlike the criminal and administrative investigations, Congressional committees have not been shy about requiring witnesses to publicly assert the Fifth Amendment. This happened most recently with two senior executives of the bankrupt solar power company Solyndra, who were castigated by House committee members when they asserted their constitutional right to refuse to respond to questions.
If a Congressional hearing is held on MF Global, Mr. Corzine is a likely witness because of his position as chief executive, much like Mr. Skilling was back in 2002. A Congressional committee may also feel pressure to call Mr. Corzine to avoid any perception that he was shown special favor because of his status as a former senator.
An incentive to speak now rather than take the Fifth is that Mr. Corzine can tell his side of the story to counter negative publicity about how he ran MF Global. From a public relations standpoint, it is better to control the message than have information about an assertion of the Fifth Amendment come out in a way that focuses on his unwillingness to cooperate, and the inferences that will inevitably be drawn from that. 
Mr. Corzine issued a statement after resigning last week as MF Global's chief executive that "I intend to continue to assist the company and its board in their efforts to respond to regulatory inquiries and issues related to the disposition of the firm's assets." This has been carefully crafted so that he has not committed himself to testify in response to a bankruptcy court subpoena or speak to federal investigators. Any assistance he does provide can be done through counsel, so that he does not say anything that can be used directly against him later on as an admission.
The decision whether to testify is fraught with risks either way, which makes it among the most important at this stage of the investigation. For Mr. Corzine and other MF Global executives, it is one they will have to confront in the near future as the demands for answers about the firm's demise and the missing customer funds grow more pressing.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Pay Expected to Fall 20% to 30%

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: The sluggish economy and Dodd-Frank restrictions are affecting bankers' compensation, leading to the weakest bonus season since the financial crisis. 

 BODY:
Wall Street bonuses are set to fall by an average of 20 to 30 percent this year from a year ago, according to a closely watched compensation survey. It would be the weakest bonus season since the financial crisis and a reflection of the leaner times confronting the industry.
Those who work in trading and investment banking - usually Wall Street's most profitable businesses, although struggling this year - will experience the sharpest drops in pay, said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, the firm that conducted the survey.
Employees in less volatile businesses, like asset management and commercial banking, will make about what they did in 2010.
 And bonuses for top executives including Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase are likely to fall sharply as well, Mr. Johnson said.
The bonus forecast will come as no surprise to many on Wall Street. Trading profits have slumped and new Dodd-Frank regulations have raised the cost of doing business. Even Goldman Sachs, a firm known for its earning power, last month reported its first quarterly loss since the financial crisis.
Goldman, Bank of America and other Wall Street firms have been cutting thousands of jobs.
"It is disappointing," Mr. Johnson said in an interview. "I think we were all hoping we were out of this morass."
This is the time of the year when Wall Street firms start to make decisions on which bankers and traders will be rewarded for 2011.
For many of them, the year-end bonus typically represents the bulk of their compensation. The firms pay as much as 60 percent of their annual revenue in compensation, so much is at stake in how they divvy up their bonus pools.
Wall Street is "effective at knowing what it can get away with" and for months has been managing down expectations of employees about pay, said Michael J. Driscoll, a former senior trader at Bear Stearns. This year the message has been that "star performers" will be paid and the rest of Wall Street will feel the pain, he said.
"Wall Street is in the process of re-evaluating what each seat is worth and having been in one of those seats it's tough," said Mr. Driscoll, now a professor at Adelphi University's business school. "Right or not, compensation is how you measure yourself and your value. You may still be making a lot, but it is a lot less than what you were making and that is what matters."
While overall compensation may be down, it is still out of sight compared with what most Americans make. Wall Street workers make a base salary of $100,000 to $1 million for top executives, but most of their pay comes at the end of the year in a big one-time bonus.
Employees are typically informed of their bonus in January or February, with checks going out shortly after.
In the first nine months of the year, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup set aside almost $93 billion to pay employees, up from $91.25 billion in the year ago period, according to Johnson Associates.
The final number, however, is not set until the fourth quarter, when firms have a clear idea of their total revenue for the year.
Johnson Associates surveys as many 20 firms every year.
Big paydays came under fire during the financial crisis as lawmakers and others called for restrictions on pay. Wall Street responded by lowering pay in some instances and firms are issuing more incentive based compensation, a move aimed at reducing reckless risk-taking. Firms also raised base salaries of employees after receiving criticism that big bonuses also encouraged employees to take unnecessary risks. Now, the market turmoil from Europe's debt crisis and the weak economy in the United States appear to be reining in Wall Street pay.
This year, the biggest loser will be fixed-income employees, Mr. Johnson said. That business is historically a big money maker, but profits in trading bonds, currencies and commodities have been hard to come by because of the uncertainty on global markets and economic weakness in the United States.
Goldman Sachs, one of the biggest in fixed income, made $12.07 billion in its fixed income, currency and commodities division during the first nine months of the year, down 37 percent from levels a year ago.
For employees on equity trading desks, compensation will fall sharply as well, about 20 to 30 percent. The same goes for investment banking, where pay will be down 10 to 20 percent.
Not everyone is going home with less, however, according to the Johnson survey.
Brokers who manage very wealthy clients will have compensation gains of as much as 5 percent. Some employees in commercial and retail banking may see either a small 5 percent drop in pay, or potentially a 5 percent bump, in part because client deposits are growing. Other areas, like private equity and prime brokerage, will see their compensation stay flat or fall just slightly, the survey predicts.
Mr. Johnson said Wall Street should expect continued attention focused on compensation, particularly since efforts like Occupy Wall Street show no signs of weakening.
The protesters, he said, "will say we have camped out in the snow and they haven't reduced compensation a nickel."
Wall Street executives, he said, "haven't gotten the memo at all."

HEADLINE: Is Overregulation Driving U.S. Companies Offshore?

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Perry says they are. But the United States has one of the some of the most favorable regulatory conditions for companies in the world, according to the World Bank and the World Economic Forum. 

 BODY:
As my colleague Richard A. Oppel Jr. reportedon Thursday, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is arguing that companies are sending work abroad primarily because of overregulation in the United States, and not because labor is cheaper abroad.
"They did not leave to begin with just because they could find cheap labor somewhere," said Mr. Perry, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination. "That may have been part of a formula, but it is not the reason they left. I would suggest to you they left because they were overregulated, and the cost of that regulation and the tax structure that we have in place in this country is what drove the masses away."
Is that statement true? Are American regulations so burdensome that they are driving companies abroad?
Certainly the United States tax code is impenetrably complicated, and companies do have to deal with plenty of regulations. But even so, the United States is far friendlier to business than are emerging markets like India and mainland China, according to international analyses of regulatory climates. 
For the last nine years, the World Bank has been grading countries on 10 measures of business regulation: getting electricity, enforcing contracts, protecting investors, dealing with construction permits, trading across borders, registering property, resolving insolvency, paying taxes, getting credit and starting a business.
Based on these criteria, these are the top 10 countries where it is easiest to operate a business:

        
Singapore
        
Hong Kong
        
New Zealand
        
United States
        
Denmark
        
Norway
        
United Kingdom
        
South Korea
        
Iceland
        
Ireland
That's right: The United States comes in fourth.
Hong Kong beats the United States, but mainland China -- that bugaboo of American employment protectionists -- does not. Instead, China comes in 91st. Despite the higher regulatory burden, American-based multinational companies have increased their employment in China by 161,400 from 2007 to 2008, a gain of about 20 percent, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. (The most recent data are for 2008.) In fact, American employment in China rose 77 percent in the prior decade, from 1998 to 2008.
India does even worse, with a ranking of 132nd. Edward L. Glaeser has written for Economix before about India's struggles with having a stable and transparent regulatory system and public sector.
As they have done in China, American companies have ratcheted up their employment in India by 43,000, or about 13 percent, from 2007 to 2008. From 1998 to 2008, the number of people in India working for American companies rose by 54 percent, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
In another measure of business climate and competitiveness put out by the World Economic Forum, the United States ranks fifth, again ahead of China (26), India (56) and a host of other countries where American companies are adding jobs.
Presumably, then, American companies are not attracted to these places because the business climate is more favorable.

HEADLINE: Opinion Report: Unemployment Benefits and Pensions

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A summary of what's on today's editorial page. 

 BODY:
There are no plausible arguments against extending federal unemployment benefits, but Republicans will doubtless turn this no-brainer into a major battle in the months ahead.
Mayor Michael Bloombert and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar have agreed to join forced to manage Jamaica's Bay's 10,000 or so acres of open spaces, wetlands and waterways. Not many New Yorkers know of this urban wilderness, but there are plenty of ambitious ideas to get the word out.
Several corruption cases and a federal lawsuit alleging racial bias in the New York City Police Department's stop-and-frisk policies leave no doubt that the city needs a strong, independent agency to investigate serious complaints about the police.
Fast and Furious, the foolhardy government operation that allowed high-powered weapons to cross the border to Mexican drug cartels, had a precedent: The Bush administration used the same tactic in Operation Wide Receiver in 2006-7. Congress must bring responsible officials to account, and stop ducking the need for stronger laws to control gun trafficking.
Both The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal offer editorials on public pension reform.
The Post discusses how Democratic governors in Illinois, New York, California and Maryland have taken on the issue. With regards to California, The Post has some kind words for Governor Jerry Brown's "innovative, mandatory, hybrid benefit" plan "composed of a 401(k)-type plan, Social Security and a smaller guaranteed pension."
But The Post concludes that in California and elsewhere "the problem is so big that [Democratic governors] will eventually have to do more. Sooner or later, state and local governments must further rein in benefits for current employees."
The Journal focuses on California, and comes to the same conclusion: "To significantly reduce current pension costs, lawmakers must modify worker benefits." The paper praises Governor Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island's proposed legislation, which "freezes current worker benefits, shifts them to hybrid plans and suspends annual cost-of-living increases for retirees."

HEADLINE: Steve Jobs: Tinker, Tailor, Tweaker?

BYLINE: DAVID CARR


HIGHLIGHT: A new article in The New Yorker by Malcolm Gladwell, based on the new biography of Steve Jobs, focuses on Jobs as a tweaker of great ideas rather than as someone who dreams them up. 

 BODY:
Had enough of Steve Jobs? Didn't think so. In the current issue of The New Yorker, Malcolm Gladwell dissects Walter Isaacson's biography of Mr. Jobs, and we read what Mr. Gladwell read, and we decided to write about what he wrote about what Mr. Isaacson wrote about. It's a meta-world, why fight it?
Yes, there are plenty of juicy asides about Mr. Jobs's legendary prickliness - he was picky right to the end, running through 67 nurses in his final visit to the hospital before he found three he liked - but Mr. Gladwell burrows in on the nature of genius, specifically asking the question of what Mr. Jobs was good at. To shed light on the light-bulb thinking that drove Mr. Jobs's successes, Mr. Gladwell rows back to the very beginnings of the industrial revolution.
In 1779, Samuel Crompton, a retiring genius from Lancashire, invented the spinning mule, which made possible the mechanization of cotton manufacture. Yet England's real advantage was that it had Henry Stones, of Horwich, who added metal rollers to the mule; and James Hargreaves, of Tottington, who figured out how to smooth the acceleration and deceleration of the spinning wheel; and William Kelly, of Glasgow, who worked out how to add water power to the draw stroke; and John Kennedy, of Manchester, who adapted the wheel to turn out fine counts; and, finally, Richard Roberts, also of Manchester, a master of precision machine tooling - and the tweaker's tweaker. He created the "automatic" spinning mule: an exacting, high-speed, reliable rethinking of Crompton's original creation. Such men, the economists argue, provided the "micro inventions necessary to make macro inventions highly productive and remunerative."
Mr. Gladwell concludes that despite the encomiums that described Mr. Jobs as a sweeping visionary, he was really more of a noodge with really good taste, one who was more than happy to take credit for - and make money off of - other people's ideas. He writes, "Jobs's sensibility was editorial, not inventive," and uses Mr. Isaacson's book to describe the dynamic between Mr. Jobs and Jonathan Ive, Apple's designer-in-chief.
Even within Apple, Jobs was known for taking credit for others' ideas. Jonathan Ive, the designer behind the iMac, the iPod, and the iPhone, tells Isaacson, "He will go through a process of looking at my ideas and say, 'That's no good. That's not very good. I like that one.' And later I will be sitting in the audience and he will be talking about it as if it was his idea."
The young writer and technology activist Aaron Swartz was similarly taken with the Jobs-Ive relationship described in Mr. Isaacson's book. In a blog post, Mr. Swartz writes about how Ive, " 'so instinctively nice,' found himself puzzled about how his good friend could be so mean." 
Every time a great person dies, there will be a cycle like this: collective grief, unalloyed kaddish and then a backlash that puts clay around the feet of the person being deified. But rarely does the cycle get to feast on a book as deep and serious as Mr. Isaacson's. Having a window into a man's life at the exact moment he leaves this mortal coil will provide fodder for many years to come.

HEADLINE: In Iowa, Mitt Romney Outlines Programs He Would Cut as President

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: On his list: The National Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and Planned Parenthood. 

 BODY:
DUBUQUE, Iowa - Mitt Romney, clad in Tommy Bahama blue jeans and a blue plaid work shirt, took that stage at a metal fabrication shop here and offered two different scenarios a year from now.
Referring to the "Obama great recession," Mr. Romney told the crowd at Giese Manufacturing that that they could turn on their television sets a year from now to the headline: "President Obama has been reelected to a second term." Or, he explained, "the alternative, of course, is that you turn on your TV about a year from now, and instead of seeing the Obama camp celebrating, you'll see something on the TV that says 'Mitt is It.'"
The crowd applauded, and Mr. Romney admitted that this later option was "the scenario I'm looking forward to."
"I want to go to work to make America once again the most attractive place in the world, the most prosperous place in the world, for middle income Americans," he explained. "I want this to be a place where people around the world say, 'I wish I could be middle class in America.'"
On his fourth trip to Iowa this year, and his third trip since announcing he was running for president, Mr. Romney also cast himself as a deficit-slayer.
"You see, unlike a lot of people in Washington, I believe that deficits matter," he said. "I believe that one of the reasons we've had such a hard time getting our economy going again is because of the huge deficits that are being racked by this president and by politicians in Washington."
He added: "I will slay the deficit beast. It's killing jobs, it's shadowing our future, and it's keeping our kids from the bright prospects they deserve."
Mr. Romney also reiterated portions of the deficit and spending cuts plan he'd debuted last week in front of the Americans For Prosperity Foundation's annual summit.
"Those three things - making government simpler, smaller and smarter - mean getting rid of programs, turning programs back to states, and finally making government itself more efficient," Mr. Romney explained.
In addition to repealing the president's national health care program, Mr. Romney also offered a few other examples of federal programs he'd be willing to cut - The National Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities.
"These are wonderful things," he said, referring to the programs he'd just placed on the chopping block. "But I'm not willing to borrow a billion dollars to pay for things we don't absolutely need. We can't keep buying and spending and passing on debts to our kids, and ill stop it by killing programs."
There was one program, however, that the crowd was eager to add the list - Planned Parenthood. Before Mr. Romney's speech began, Doris Hingtgen, 80, a retired Dubuque resident, said that while she was backing Mr. Romney, she was hoping he would "come out a little stronger on the right-to-life thing."
"A lot of people have mentioned to me that he hasn't said enough about right to life," she said, before adding, "I think he's a good businessman, he has good morals, and he's an electable type person."
When Mr. Romney worked the crowd after the event, smiling tightly and quickly moving along to the next person when a man thanked him for "acknowledging climate change," no fewer than four voters asked him about Planned Parenthood, and if it was one of the programs he'd defund as president.
"That is on my list of programs to eliminate," said Mr. Romney, who hadn't mentioned the program in his speech.
Diane Berryman, 65, a retired teacher from Asbury, said that she was satisfied with his answer.
"I guess I allow people to change their views - whether or not it's political or not, who am I do judge," said Ms. Berryman, who has picketed outside of Planned Parenthood.
Steven Brody, 44, who lives in Wisconsin but works in Dubuque as the executive director of Dubuque County Right to Life, was one of the voters who pressed Mr. Romney on defunding Planned Parenthood.
"It's the life issue that really matters to us in the heartland," Mr. Brody said. "When you're talking about cutting waste from government, Planned Parenthood is a great target."
Mr. Romney ended his speech much the way he'd begun - inviting the assembled Iowans to return to their television screens in just a year's time.
"I don't want to wake up a year from now and turn on my TV and have it say, 'President Obama re-elected,' because I know what that means," Mr. Romney said. "It means a weaker America. I want to see a new president that will take America in a great tradition, and a new tradition, one that makes America the best place in the world to be middle class again. And I will be that president. "

HEADLINE: Obama Presses Job Aid for Veterans

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: President urges Senate Republicans to approve a tax credit for companies that hire people who haev served in the military. 

 BODY:
 President Obama renewed his campaign Monday for measures to help veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan break into the workforce, amid signs that the Senate was moving toward passing a provision of the president's jobs bill that would give companies a tax incentive to hire returning veterans.
Declaring that the last thing "veterans should have to do is fight for a job when they come home," Mr. Obama urged Republicans to pass a tax credit of up to $9,600 for companies that hire veterans. He also announced a package of more modest unilateral measures to help veterans with counseling and job referrals.
Those proposals, which include an electronic job bank for veterans and six months of individual job counseling, are similar to proposals in a veterans' bill that the House passed by an overwhelming vote last month. Where the two bills differ is in the White House's use of tax credits for companies to hire veterans, though lawmakers from both parties appear ready to vote in favor of that, too.
 "Too many can't find a job worthy of their tremendous talents," Mr. Obama said in the Rose Garden, flanked by veterans and representatives of veterans' groups. "Too many military spouses have a hard time finding work after moving from base to base. And even though the overall unemployment rate ticked down last month, unemployment among veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan continues to rise."
The jobless rate for veterans of those wars is 12.1 percent, White House officials said, compared to 9 percent for the population at large. More than 850,000 veterans are without work, Mr. Obama said, some for long stretches. Other veterans, he said, are forced to undergo training or coursework for jobs they are clearly qualified to do based on the duties they had on the battlefield. 
"If you can save a life on the battlefield, then you can save a life in an ambulance," Mr. Obama said. "If you can oversee a convoy or millions of dollars of assets in Iraq, you can help a business back home manage their supply chain or balance their books."
Mr. Obama, who announced recently he would bring the last soldiers home from Iraq by the end of this year, has made veterans one of the centerpieces of his jobs campaign, along with teachers, firefighters, and police officers. First Lady Michelle Obama recently announced an initiative in which 270 companies, which supply military bases, pledged to hire 25,000 veterans, and their spouses, within two years.
The veterans' initiatives are part of the White House's strategy of using executive orders that do not require Congressional approval, which also dramatizes the unwillingness, until now, of Republicans to pass any part of the jobs bill.
This time, the president acknowledged, might be different. He noted that when he mentioned help for veterans during his speech to a joint meeting of Congress in September, lawmakers from both parties rose to their feet in support. "That was one of few times both sides stood up," he said.

HEADLINE: New Way To Tally Poor Recasts View Of Poverty

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE and ROBERT GEBELOFF; Sabrina Tavernise reported from Washington, and Robert Gebeloff from New York

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Census Bureau on Monday released what it says is a more accurate measure of poverty in America. The new measure shows more poverty among the elderly, but less among children and African-Americans.
It also shows a slightly higher poverty rate for the nation last year -- 16 percent compared with 15.2 percent under the official measure -- but lower rates among groups who benefit from noncash government programs the official count leaves out, including food stamps and the earned-income tax credit.
As a result, there were 3.2 million fewer children found to be living in poverty in 2010, compared with the official measure, a difference of about four percentage points, and 800,000 fewer poor African-Americans, or about two percentage points less. 
Two of the biggest antipoverty measures, food stamps and the earned-income tax credit, were expanded substantially under President Obama's stimulus package, helping lift about 11 million people above the poverty line in 2010, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. As that money winds down, there is a concern that help for the poor could shrink.
''Unemployment isn't going away anytime soon, and Congress has been talking a lot about cutting deeply,'' said Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher at the center.
Census officials cautioned that the bureau's new measure, known as the supplemental poverty measure, would not replace the official one, which is used to calculate federal assistance to states and other types of spending.
The new assessment was developed primarily to give policy makers a sense of the effect that social safety-net programs are having, said Kathleen Short, a Census Bureau official who presented the measure on Monday at a conference at the Brookings Institution. It also includes costs like child care, out-of-pocket medical expenses and taxes, which erode income for those above the poverty line, greatly expanding the ranks of the near poor, whom the safety net does not reach.
Under the new measure, a third of Americans fall into the group that earns 100 percent to 200 percent of the poverty threshold, which in 2010 was $24,343 for a family of four last year.
The middle and upper classes fared worse. Families with incomes four times the poverty threshold or more -- $97,372 for a family of four -- shrank to just 17 percent of the population, compared with 36 percent under the official measure, largely because taxes and work expenses were subtracted from income.
The traditional measure of assessing poverty was first applied in the 1960s, when Americans spent roughly a third of their income on food. Today, spending on food has shrunk to a seventh of income, census officials say, while spending on housing, utilities and work expenses has expanded. The new measure, which counts those costs, was designed to adjust for that shift.
Bruce Meyer, an economics professor at the University of Chicago, said the new measure overstated poverty for the elderly because it did not take into account their income from savings, the stock market and other accumulated wealth. ''If you look at what they consume, you see that their living standard is much higher,'' Professor Meyer said.
The new measure shows a 15.9 percent poverty rate among people 65 and older, nearly double the 9 percent rate of the official measure, largely because the new measure deducts medical expenses from income.
Other experts said the new measure was notable for how similar it was to the official one in terms of the rise in poverty: Both rose by just under one percentage point from 2009 to 2010.
''The big picture is that in this so-called recovery there are more people in distress regardless of how you measure poverty,'' said Lawrence Katz, an economics professor at Harvard University.

HEADLINE: Bonuses on Wall Street Expected to Decrease 20% to 30% This Year, Survey Finds

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
Wall Street bonuses are set to fall by an average of 20 to 30 percent this year from a year ago, according to a closely watched compensation survey - the weakest bonus season since the financial crisis and a reflection of the leaner times confronting the industry.
Those who work in trading and investment banking - usually Wall Street's most profitable businesses, although struggling this year - will experience the sharpest drops in pay, said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, the firm that conducted the survey. 
Employees in less volatile businesses, like asset management and commercial banking, will make about what they did in 2010.
And bonuses for top executives like Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase are likely to fall sharply as well, Mr. Johnson said.
The bonus forecast will come as no surprise to many on Wall Street. Trading profits have slumped and new Dodd-Frank regulations have raised the cost of doing business. Even Goldman Sachs, a firm known for its earning power, last month reported its first quarterly loss since the financial crisis.
Goldman, Bank of America and other Wall Street firms have been cutting thousands of jobs.
''It is disappointing,'' Mr. Johnson said in an interview. ''I think we were all hoping we were out of this morass.''
This is the time of the year when Wall Street firms start to make decisions on which bankers and traders will be rewarded for 2011.
For many of them, the year-end bonus typically represents the bulk of their compensation. The firms pay as much as 60 percent of their annual revenue in compensation, so much is at stake in how they divvy up their bonus pools.
Wall Street is ''effective at knowing what it can get away with'' and for months has been managing down expectations of employees about pay, said Michael J. Driscoll, a former senior trader at Bear Stearns. This year the message has been that ''star performers'' will be paid and the rest of Wall Street will feel the pain, he said.
''Wall Street is in the process of re-evaluating what each seat is worth and having been in one of those seats it's tough,'' said Mr. Driscoll, now a professor at Adelphi University's business school. ''Right or not, compensation is how you measure yourself and your value. You may still be making a lot, but it is a lot less than what you were making and that is what matters.''
While overall compensation may be down, it is still out of sight compared with what most Americans make. Wall Street workers make a base salary of $100,000 to $1 million for top executives, but most of their pay comes at the end of the year in a big one-time bonus.
Employees are typically informed of their bonus in January or February, with checks going out shortly after.
In the first nine months of the year, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup set aside almost $93 billion to pay employees, up from $91.25 billion in the year ago period, according to Johnson Associates.
The final number, however, is not set until the fourth quarter, when firms have a clear idea of their total revenue for the year.
Johnson Associates surveys as many 20 firms every year.
Big paydays came under fire during the financial crisis as lawmakers and others called for restrictions on pay. Wall Street responded by lowering pay in some instances and firms are issuing more incentive based compensation, a move aimed at reducing reckless risk-taking. Firms also raised base salaries of employees after receiving criticism that big bonuses also encouraged employees to take unnecessary risks. Now, the market turmoil from Europe's debt crisis and the weak economy in the United States appear to be reining in Wall Street pay.
This year, the biggest loser will be fixed-income employees, Mr. Johnson said. That business is historically a big money maker, but profits in trading bonds, currencies and commodities have been hard to come by because of the uncertainty on global markets and economic weakness in the United States.
Goldman Sachs, one of the biggest in fixed income, made $12.07 billion in its fixed income, currency and commodities division during the first nine months of the year, down 37 percent from levels a year ago.
For employees on equity trading desks, compensation will fall sharply as well, about 20 to 30 percent. The same goes for investment banking, where pay will be down 10 to 20 percent.
Not everyone is going home with less, however, according to the Johnson survey.
Brokers who manage very wealthy clients will have compensation gains of as much as 5 percent. Some employees in commercial and retail banking may see either a small 5 percent drop in pay, or potentially a 5 percent bump, in part because client deposits are growing. Other areas, like private equity and prime brokerage, will see their compensation stay flat or fall just slightly, the survey predicts.
Mr. Johnson said Wall Street should expect continued attention focused on compensation, particularly since efforts like Occupy Wall Street show no signs of weakening.
The protesters, he said, ''will say we have camped out in the snow and they haven't reduced compensation a nickel.''
Wall Street executives, he said, ''haven't gotten the memo at all.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Intern Gap Frustrates Clinicians In Training

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
They call it ''the match.'' Every year, thousands of graduate students in clinical psychology pick the hospitals and clinics where they would like to do yearlong internships. They rank their choices. The internship programs also rank the applicants.
A computer algorithm then digests the lists in an attempt to link mutually desired applicants and programs. But in recent years the process has broken down: In psychology, there are simply not enough internships to go around. 
The issue is on the minds of many graduate students in psychology right now, with the application season for next year's internships in full swing. Last year, 937 students, or 24 percent of those who applied, were not accepted by any of the sites they had chosen -- and students must complete internships to earn their degrees and venture out into the workplace.
''These results are unacceptable,'' Melba J. T. Vasquez, the president of the American Psychological Association, wrote in April.
Students who do not match must hunt for unaccredited internships, positions that can hobble their careers. Almost half end up without an internship at all and must try again the next year. According to a 2007 study by researchers at the University of Texas, 44 percent of graduate students who did not match were not able to find a program placement, and many if not most of them had to put off graduation by a year.
''It means that there are people who are taking student loans and spending years in this training who could go out and provide a service to the public, and they're stuck,'' said Robert E. McGrath, director of the doctoral program in clinical psychology at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey.
In some smaller cities and towns, counseling programs for the elderly, the poor and children do not have enough intern psychologists to see all the patients who need treatment, even as a weak economy and high unemployment drive up demand for the programs' services. The American Psychological Association recommends that students select a doctoral program with high match rates. (Schools are required to publish them.) Nevertheless, even top students at highly regarded schools sometimes do not match because they did not include enough of the less competitive programs in their list or did not rank those programs highly enough to convince the admissions officers of their enthusiasm.
Joanna Wolfson was an A student ''with distinction'' at Fairleigh Dickinson, which, along with her essays, recommendations and unpaid clinical experience, made her a top prospect from a highly regarded graduate program. Nine internship programs called her in for interviews, and then she went through the match.
''By the terms of the internship, I felt very prepared,'' Ms. Wolfson said. ''I was applying with an application I was proud of.''
Yet she failed to find a match. ''When it sunk in, I just felt it was the end of the world for 24 hours,'' Ms. Wolfson said. ''I went through all the emotions, being disappointed, being very upset, though in time I accepted it more.'' She had to put off graduation by a year, hoping to gain more experience while working on her dissertation.
Psychology students who do not match endure a free-for-all known as ''the scramble,'' a high-speed process in which, over a few days, they reapply to programs with unfilled positions. In 2011, there were just 1,138 unfilled psychology internship positions in the country.
The problem stems from another kind of mismatch -- between the number of students in the nation's 373 psychology programs and the number of internship slots. The number of enrolled students is growing twice as fast as the number of internships.
''You can't cram 4,100 students into 3,100 positions,'' said Greg Keilin, the director of psychology training at the University of Texas and the coordinator of the national psychology matching program.
The problem has been mounting for years, with the number of unmatched applicants increasing 117 percent since 2002.
Several training directors say part of the problem is that schools, particularly in California and Florida, are composing entering classes of 50 to 75 students, even though enough nearby internships may not be available.
The imbalance is less severe in New York, where clinical psychology programs accept only a dozen or so new students every year. Cynthia D. Belar, the A.P.A.'s executive director for education, said graduate programs could ameliorate the problem by authorizing their own internships, even if they're not accredited.
Unaccredited internships can be high-quality programs, said Mitchell L. Schare, the director of clinical psychology at Hofstra University. Often the administrators of these programs simply do not want to go through the expense or long commitment of getting accredited by the A.P.A.
But many postdoctoral fellowships and university teaching positions, as well as jobs at veterans' hospitals, are open only to psychologists trained in accredited internships.
Creating an internship can be expensive. A psychology intern who works 40 hours a week seeing both hospitalized patients and outpatients is paid a salary -- $20,000 to $30,000 is the average in New York -- and the psychologists who supervise them may lose face time with patients. In some states, including New York, hospitals cannot bill patients for visits to interns.
Susan M. Sussmann, the director of psychology education at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital, which has 10 internships a year, said her hospital had explored increasing internships. But, she added, ''if it gets too big, we won't give out stellar training.''
Still, the problem with the way the matching process works out, according to experts like Barry A. Farber, a professor of psychology and education at Teachers College at Columbia University, is that it weeds out ''not just marginal students but terrific students.''
''How can these students not have matched?'' he asked.

HEADLINE: Test for Hospital Budgets: Are the Patients Pleased?

BYLINE: By JORDAN RAU

 BODY:
''I'm a great kvetcher,'' said Pearl Schwartz, sitting in her hospital bed at NYU Langone Medical Center.
Indeed, during her brief stay to receive a pacemaker, Ms. Schwartz, an 88-year-old retired state worker, had a litany of complaints. Sure, the nurses were ''splendid, warm and kind'' and sang in her room -- and her operation went off without a hitch. But her sink was too small, she had to wait eight hours in the radiology unit for an X-ray, and no one brought her anything to read as she had requested.
''If people are down here, wouldn't it be nice if they could look at a cheerful magazine?'' she asked.
Winning praise from patients has become a pressing -- and often elusive -- obsession for NYU and for hospitals nationwide. In the coming months, Medicare will start taking patient satisfaction into account when reimbursing hospitals. Disgruntled patients will mean reduced revenue, a frightening prospect for hospitals already facing empty beds because of the recession and pressure from insurers to hold down costs. 
Medicare's new rule, mandated in the Affordable Care Act, pits hospitals against one another in a competition to best satisfy patients; those with the best scores will receive more money.
But some hospitals are worried that assessments from patients like Ms. Schwartz can be influenced not just by the quality of their care, but also by amenities like single rooms, renovated units and tasty food. And hospitals in cities and certain regions, like the Northeast and California, tend to get lower ratings, raising concerns that their revenues will be reduced simply because patients in those places are more disposed to grumble about things that a polite Midwesterner or Southerner would forgive.
''Hospitals are going be punished financially by the federal government for things they can't control,'' said Dr. James Merlino, chief experience officer at the Cleveland Clinic.
Surprisingly, some of the nation's most prestigious hospitals, including Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and the University of Chicago Medical Center, get lower marks from patients on most areas of patient experiences, according to the government's Hospital Compare Web site.
So do many of New York City's elite institutions, including NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, the Mount Sinai Medical Center and Beth Israel Medical Center. Some hospitals, like NYU, get bad patient reviews even as they score average or superior in measures of clinical care from the government and accreditation groups.
''People in New York have very high expectations about what it means to be taken care of,'' said Dr. Katherine Hochman, an NYU physician. ''When they don't get their food on time and have to spend eight hours in the emergency department, well, that's just not their image of what a world-class institution is.''
The ratings are based on Medicare-approved surveys, which hospitals hire companies to give to a random selection of patients after they are discharged. Some surveys are given by phone, others by mail. All ask the same questions: Did the doctors and nurses communicate well? Was pain well controlled? Was the room clean and the hospital quiet at night? The surveys go to younger patients as well as Medicare beneficiaries.
In setting payment, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services plans to be a tough grader. It is going to give hospitals credit only for patients who say their experiences were always good. The surveys also ask patients to rank their stays on a 10-point scale, and Medicare will credit only hospitals that receive a 9 or 10.
That is likely to be a tough threshold for hospitals. Interviewed weeks after her stay, Ms. Schwartz was much more positive about her experience, saying she had ''a wonderful time,'' but still she was not sure whether NYU deserved more than eight points.
Hospitals' initial scores will be based on reviews by patients discharged since last July. Starting next October, the federal agency will withhold 1 percent of Medicare's regular reimbursements to most hospitals and redistribute that money based on how they performed compared with other institutions and how much they improved from the previous year. The bonus amount will rise to 2 percent in 2016.
The agency has decided that patient experience ratings will determine 30 percent of the total bonus payments, more than the hospital lobby favored. The other 70 percent will be based on how hospitals follow clinical guidelines for care, like giving the right medications to avert blood clots and infections.
The agency hopes that commercial insurers will also incorporate patient experience scores into their payments. One major insurer, Wellpoint, already has.
Hospitals have long catered to patients in an effort to draw more customers and beat out competitors. It is one of the reasons so many renovate and rebuild. Many are finding that small changes, like having nurses visit rooms hourly, often improve patients' responses to the surveys more effectively than do new hotel-like amenities.
Jefferson Regional Medical Center in Pittsburgh expects all employees, from maintenance workers to doctors, to respond to a patient's call light or find someone to offer assistance. In Los Angeles, Cedars-Sinai is testing new patient call buttons that ring directly to nurses' cellphones. If the nurse's line is busy, the call automatically rolls over to another worker's phone.
Many hospitals have devised detailed scripts that doctors and nurses follow when interacting with patients, telling them what to expect and often extolling the care they are getting. This fall, the University of Toledo Medical Center launched an internal ''iCARE University'' dedicated to training employees on improving patients' experiences.
In Connecticut, Bridgeport Hospital improved some of its lowest scores in its maternity unit after delivery nurses began telling patients how great the postpartum nurses are, said Eileen Callahan, the nurse manager for the maternity unit.
When the mothers and their babies are brought out of the delivery room, ''the postpartum nurse greets them at the desk and starts the 'oohs' and 'ahhs,' and how lucky they were to have the nurse in the delivery,'' Ms. Callahan said. She said initially there was ''some hard swallowing going on'' during exchanges for nurses who did not like each other. Ms. Callahan said she bases a portion of her nurses' annual reviews on how well they followed these patient transfer practices.
Other hospitals are trying to game the system, said Paul Alexander Clark, a consultant to health system executives. He said some seek to influence patients' memories by instructing the staff to repeat phrases used in the post-discharge surveys. ''The problem of teaching the test is caregivers are more focused on the right words rather than the right care,'' he said.
Another concern is that the ratings system may hurt hospitals that handle many complex cases. Mr. Merlino said the Cleveland Clinic's own research shows the longer a patient remains hospitalized, the less the patient thinks he is getting adequate attention and the lower ratings he gives the hospitals.
Depressed patients also tend to give more negative assessments, Mr. Merlino said. The hospital gets below-average reviews on several questions, even though patients in the same surveys overwhelmingly say they would recommend the clinic to friends.
Medicare says that the surveys adequately take patient medical conditions into account by asking patients about their health.
Jean Moody-Williams, director of the quality improvement group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the topics covered by the surveys, like whether patients received proper instructions on what to do after they left the hospital, relate directly to important quality-of-care matters and will force hospitals to focus on them. ''It's not just a feel-good kind of a thing,'' she said.
Hospitals with lower scores fear that the new payments could widen the gap between those that have money to invest in improvements and those that do not. In particular, hospitals with older facilities believe they will have a harder time getting good reviews than hospitals with newer buildings.
When NYU moved its cardiology unit to a renovated floor in 2008, patient rankings shot up even though the procedures and employees were the same. NYU found that long waits at its elevators drove down its scores, so now it is building a new bank of elevators. Double rooms and cramped emergency rooms invariably lead to more noise and annoyances, but NYU said that it cannot fully solve that until it opens a new building in 2017.
''Those amenities are really important,'' said Dr. Robert I. Grossman, NYU's chief executive officer. Still, he said he believes that ''institutions have total control over the medical quality, and that's what I think they should be judged on.''
NYU is scrambling to find lots of little ways to please patients. Nurses in the emergency room are instructed to greet people at the door within 30 seconds. Several floors have started happy hours, providing chips and cookies for family members. The maternity ward has been experimenting with giving women cellphones so they can text their nurses. When new mothers leave, they are given cards signed by doctors and nurses.
''We have a lot of overachievers, and they want to overachieve with their babies,'' said Karen Goodman, the nursing manager for obstetrics. ''Our patients are upper-middle-class, educated women, and we're telling them, 'You have a roommate, you have to share a bathroom.' We have to go over the top, because no one's going to recommend the environment.''
Like many hospitals, NYU has patient advocates who handle nonmedical problems. On a cancer unit, one advocate, Jo-Ann Delgado, visited patient after satisfied patient. ''The service is just wondrous,'' one told her.
But she got an earful from another, who complained that an elevator operator had turned away someone who tried to get on, saying that that the elevator took only freight.
''I was beginning to have stress pain in my chest; that's where my tumor is,'' the woman said. ''Her haughtiness got to me.''
Ms. Delgado responded, ''I'm glad you told us that, because she has to know patients come first.''
Some patients remain reluctant to give superlatives. Charles Doheny, a 60-year-old hip surgery patient from Bayside, Queens, said he would give NYU an eight, although he said his doctors and nurses always communicated well and helped moderate his pain.
''I can't say I've had a bad experience at all,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Giving Up on Math and Science Careers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Why Science Majors Change Their Minds (It's Just So Darn Hard)'' (Education Life section, Nov. 6) claims that the decline in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) majors occurs because beginning college courses are ''just so darn hard.'' 
They are no harder now than 30 years ago, and no harder than comparable courses in other countries. The problem is not that courses are harder but that high school graduates are less prepared. This is because of a diminishing number of knowledgeable and inspiring teachers of math and science, which in turn is because of the widening gap (both in compensation and respect) between careers in the classroom and careers in industry available to such knowledgeable people.
Wring our hands as we may, until we narrow this gap our country will continue to fall behind.
JIM SIMONS JOHN EWING New York, Nov. 6, 2011
Mr. Simons is founder of the Simons Foundation, which promotes research in science and mathematics. Mr. Ewing is president of Math for America.
To the Editor:
Why do science majors change their mind? They wise up.
Your article makes it sound as if American science students are stupid or lazy, unlike their workaholic Chinese and Indian counterparts. This is glib and insulting.
It is in their second year that students typically join laboratories and see firsthand that their dreams of a scientific career include low-paying and highly competitive professorial jobs, that getting grants for scientific research is increasingly difficult and unpredictable, that they are facing many years of postgraduate work at ridiculously low salaries and that they would have a hard time supporting a family.
Compare this future with that of the economics major (lots of math) who goes to business school and can look forward to million-dollar yearly bonuses.
American students change their majors because they recognize that this country has stopped providing a reasonable future for scientists, with slashed budgets for the National Science Foundation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and National Institutes of Health.
For Chinese and Indian students, science remains a way out of poverty. For American students, it's becoming the path into it.
STUART FIRESTEIN New York, Nov. 6, 2011
The writer is chairman of the department of biological sciences at Columbia University.
To the Editor:
For decades, the United States has not had to improve its delivery of science education. When we needed scientists and engineers, we opened our immigration doors wider and let more in.
That may be starting to change because potential immigrants can stay in their own improving societies or go to other countries if they wish. Today Canada, Europe, Australia and parts of South America have welcoming arms for educated immigrants. We have to prepare our citizens for higher echelons of the job hierarchy; there just isn't any room at the bottom anymore.

The writer is a professor of engineering at the University of Rhode Island.
To the Editor:
To be an engineer, you have to be either brilliant or stubborn. If you're neither, you're going to change majors.
P.S. I wasn't in the brilliant class.

HEADLINE: Sharing Catches On at Airports

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
For years, frustrated air travelers have wondered why they had to sit on the tarmac waiting for a gate to open up when they could see empty gates outside the plane's windows.
Part of the answer is that airlines typically do not share their gates with competitors. Now some airports are working to change that.
Rather than giving airlines proprietary use of certain gates, airports in the United States are increasingly adopting a common-use strategy -- meaning any carrier may use any gate, as well as share check-in kiosks, ticket counters and baggage carousels. 
This allows airports to accommodate more airlines without a costly expansion, move carriers around more easily after flight cuts and respond quickly to schedule changes caused by mechanical problems and weather delays.
''If Airline A has a delayed flight and they're still on the gate, then Airline B doesn't have to wait on the tarmac,'' said Tim Harris, chief technology officer for John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Calif. ''They can go to an adjacent gate and deplane.''
When the airport's new Terminal C opens on Nov. 14, passengers will check in using shared kiosks, choosing their airline from an on-screen menu instead of finding that carrier's own machine. At the gate, digital signs will indicate which airline is operating the next flight, and agents from different carriers will share the same counter space -- eliminating the clutter of separate podiums crowding the entrance to the plane.
''The industry is starting to realize that common use has a lot of value,'' Mr. Harris said, citing operational efficiencies and cost savings as two main benefits of shared resources.
While other airports, especially in Europe, have taken a common-use approach for years, the concept has been slow to catch on in the United States. One difference is that European airports typically handle more international traffic, so dedicated gates do not make sense for carriers operating one or two flights a day.
Another factor is that American airports often have long-term leases that give dominant carriers exclusive rights to a terminal or set of gates, and those airlines are reluctant to change that arrangement.
But as these leases expire or new terminals are built, airports are gaining leverage to renegotiate their operations. In recent years, new or renovated terminals with common-use equipment have opened at airports in San Jose, Calif.; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Sacramento and Miami and others, and still more airports are considering the change.
McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, often referred to as the model for common use, has pursued this strategy for more than a decade. The airport has an unusual set of circumstances: It is in a destination many airlines want to serve, with no dominant carrier and no competition from a nearby airport. That gave McCarran an advantage as it embraced shared resources as a way to maximize efficiency and space.
''We have 28 carriers,'' said Randall Walker, director of aviation for Clark County, Nev. ''We could not have 28 independent sets of kiosks where people could get their boarding passes.''
Although airlines typically occupy the same gates and ticketing areas week to week, a carrier can overflow to an adjacent counter at peak times and foreign airlines with one flight a day can share the same gate.
In general, carriers are more willing to share space at international terminals but have resisted common use for domestic flights, especially at their hubs.
''I euphemistically say the process of working with the airlines has been death by a thousand cuts,'' Mr. Walker said, though he added that some of this opposition had faded over time.
Pete Houghton, senior director of properties at Southwest, which uses shared resources in Las Vegas, Sacramento and San Jose, said the airline preferred its own gates, primarily because it used most of them full time.
Another frustration for airlines is that the standards for common-use technology can vary from one airport to the next. ''It's not common to an airline -- it's common to the airport,'' Mr. Houghton said. ''So we end up having to support multiple systems.''
Rick Belliotti, who in 2008 wrote a report about common-use airports for the Transportation Research Board, said the airlines' main concerns were losing control over their operations and uncertainty about the cost of shifting to shared use.
''The cost benefit is really very tricky,'' said Mr. Belliotti, who now works for Ultra Electronics Airport Systems, a common-use technology provider. ''It varies by airport, by situation and by type of carrier.''
Maurice Jenkins, director of information systems at Miami International Airport, said one major benefit of a common-use strategy for airlines was that the airports take over responsibility for installing, managing and fixing the technology that keeps computer networks, jet bridges and other equipment functioning.
With all of these costs escalating airport operators say building terminals with shared resources makes economic sense.
''Terminals are far more expensive today than they used to be,'' said John Brantley, director of Raleigh-Durham Airport, which just spent $570 million on a new 36-gate terminal. Thirty years ago, the airport spent $9.2 million for a nine-gate terminal. ''Costs didn't grow linearly,'' he said. ''They grew exponentially.''
But the fact that airlines often contribute to terminal construction costs makes it difficult for some airports to adopt a common-use strategy.
Susan Baer, aviation director for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said that although Terminal B at Newark Liberty International Airport and Terminal 4 at Kennedy International Airport are both common use, other terminals are not, partly because carriers have made investments in their spaces.
''Certainly it's a way to use your terminal resources efficiently,'' Ms. Baer said. ''But then, of course, you have to be the owner-operator of that terminal, which means you have to have used your money -- which is not the case at our airports.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Clears Art Project By Christo In Colorado

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
DENVER -- Federal regulators on Monday approved a $50 million installation of anchored fabric over the Arkansas River in southern Colorado by the artist Christo, whose larger-than-life vision has divided environmentalists, residents and politicians for years over questions of aesthetics, nature and economic impact. 
The project, ''Over the River,'' will include eight suspended panel segments totaling 5.9 miles along a 42-mile stretch of the river, about three hours southwest of Denver. Construction could begin next year, pending final local approvals, with the goal being a two-week display of the work as early as August 2014.
''Drawing visitors to Colorado to see this work will support jobs in the tourism industry and bring attention to the tremendous outdoor recreation opportunities,'' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said. ''We believe that steps have been taken to mitigate the environmental effects of this one-of-a-kind project.''
Christo, 76, said in an interview that the project had already made history for its interconnection of art and public participation, with a federal environmental impact statement that drew thousands of comments.
Christo's projects -- from the wrapping of the Reichstag Parliament building in Berlin in 1995 to ''The Gates,'' a meandering path of orange awnings through Central Park in New York in 2005 -- have often generated heated debate in advance of their creation.
''We are elated,'' Christo said. ''Every artist in the world likes his or her work to make people think. Imagine how many people were thinking, how many professionals were thinking and writing in preparing that environmental impact statement.''
Permits are still needed from Fremont and Chaffee Counties, the Colorado Department of Transportation and the State Patrol. But Christo emphasized that those agencies had been working with the federal government all through the environmental impact study and were involved in shaping the mitigation measures included in Monday's decision.
Federal officials said that ''Over the River'' could generate $121 million in economic output and draw 400,000 visitors, both during the construction -- which could become its own tourist event -- and the display itself.
Points of contention and controversy ranged from road safety in the narrow canyon highway through the installation zone, which extends from the towns of Salida to Canon City, to potential impacts on wildlife, especially on the Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep that habituate the Arkansas River canyon and are Colorado's state mammal.
In May, the Colorado Wildlife Commission, an advisory panel to the state's Division of Parks and Wildlife, urged federal officials to reject Christo's proposal, specifically citing its concerns about the sheep, and whether the chaos and traffic of construction could keep them from crucial water sources. A local opposition group complained in August that federal regulators were being unduly swayed by Christo, and that phrases like ''artistic vision'' in the impact study, rather than neutral terms like ''proposed project,'' suggested a predisposition to let him have his way.
The decision announced Monday spelled out measures to protect the sheep, including restricting activity in lambing season and a Bighorn Sheep Adaptive Management Fund, paid for by Christo, who is covering the full cost of the project via the sale of his work.

HEADLINE: Day of Modest Gains Despite Debt Worries

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stocks rose slightly Monday on Wall Street but the markets remain unsettled by uncertainty over Europe's sovereign debt problems and political developments in two of the hardest-hit countries, Greece and Italy. 
After trading mostly lower throughout the day, stocks in the United States managed some modest gains on Monday. That followed a volatile week when the three major indexes closed down around 2 percent after the leaders of the Group of 20 nations made little concrete progress on tackling the euro zone's woes.
Officials in Greece were working Monday on forming a new unity government.
Investors have also been watching Italy closely because of concern about its high debt load and rising borrowing costs. As it did in Greece, the market pressure has affected Italy's political underpinnings, with support for Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy appearing to wane amid calls for him to resign.
''We're still a long way away from finding a comprehensive resolution to the euro zone's afflictions,'' said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company.
On Monday, borrowing costs for Italy continued to rise, with the 10-year bond reaching more than 6.6 percent.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 0.6 percent, or 7.89 points, at 1,261.12 and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.7 percent, or 85.15 points at 12,068.39. The Nasdaq composite index was up 0.34 percent at 2,695.25.
Interest rates moved slightly lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 5/32, to 100 30/32, and the yield slipped to 2.02 percent from 2.04 percent late Friday.
Financials and industrials barely rose. The health care index was the only sector to rise more than 1 percent, helped by a nearly 6 percent climb in shares of Amgen after the company said it was planning a $5 billion share repurchase. It closed at $58.43.
In economic data Monday, the Federal Reserve reported that overall consumer borrowing rose in September, but most of the increase was in a category that included big-ticket items like cars and education. Consumers cut the use of their credit cards for a third straight month.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, closed down 0.7 percent. The German DAX and the CAC 40 in Paris were each down 0.6 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London was 0.3 percent lower.
The markets have been weighed down by weeks of uncertainty over Europe, even as better than expected economic data in jobs and growth recently emerged in the United States, said Robert S. Tipp, the managing director and chief investment strategist for Prudential Fixed Income.
''We will continue to see large intra-day volatility and on balance a downward bias to stock prices and treasury yields,'' said Mr. Tipp.
In Asia, major indices closed slightly lower.
The euro was $1.3758, barely changed from $1.3792 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Voters Head to the Polls In an Array of Local Races

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
Voters in New York City's suburbs and upstate will decide on Tuesday in numerous local elections who they believe is best suited to create jobs and face challenging budgets in an election season colored by the bleak economy.
In the highest-profile contests, voters in Suffolk and Erie Counties -- two of the state's largest jurisdictions -- will elect county executives in races that have involved millions of dollars in campaign spending, endorsements by some of New York's biggest political names and furious last-minute pushes to turn out voters. 
Several races could also influence the state's political landscape, because they involve Republicans who, based on the results on Tuesday, could mount future election challenges to Democrats who hold statewide office.
For now, the state Republican Party, bolstered by its victory in a special Congressional election in a heavily Democratic district in Queens and Brooklyn in September, is trying to frame the local elections as another chance for voters to express their unhappiness with President Obama and his party.
''I think what you'll hear tomorrow from the voters is, we'd like to continue the momentum of less taxes, less government, less intrusion in our lives,'' said Anthony J. Casale, the chief of staff for the state party chairman, Edward F. Cox. ''That message, we think, will continue to resonate.''
The state Democratic chairman, Jay Jacobs, predicted that Democrats running for local office would benefit from the widespread popularity of the party's top elected official, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Mr. Jacobs, in a telephone interview, said that Mr. Cuomo's early success had energized Democrats, and that his handling of the state budget ''undermines the old Republican theme that Democrats are for higher taxes'' and would attract more independent voters.
''This isn't an election that is about anything other than local issues,'' Mr. Jacobs said, ''but mood is important, and the Democratic mood is definitely on the upswing.'' In New York City, the highest-profile race is on Staten Island, where the district attorney, Daniel M. Donovan Jr., faces a rematch of the 2007 race, when he defeated his Democratic opponent, Michael J. Ryan.
Perhaps the state's most watched race is on Long Island, where voters will choose a successor to the Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, a Democrat-turned-Republican who abruptly quit his bid for a third term this year in a deal to end a criminal investigation of his political fund-raising.
The Democratic candidate who is seeking to replace Mr. Levy, Steve Bellone, the town supervisor of Babylon, has spent more money on his campaign than any other candidate in New York State on the ballot on Tuesday, according to the New York Public Interest Research Group.
From mid-January until two weeks ago -- when candidates last had to report their finances -- Mr. Bellone spent $2 million. His Republican opponent, Angie M. Carpenter, the Suffolk County treasurer, spent $513,000.
Both candidates have trotted out big-name endorsements in recent days. Mr. Cuomo attended a rally for Mr. Bellone last week, and Ms. Carpenter has the endorsement of former Gov. George E. Pataki.
The Suffolk County race is one of three contests that have drawn campaign appearances by Mr. Cuomo. Most recently, the governor attended a breakfast on Sunday for Mike Spano, a state assemblyman who is running for mayor of Yonkers.
On Friday, Mr. Cuomo went to the Buffalo area for a rally for Mark Poloncarz, who is challenging the Erie County executive, Chris Collins, a Republican who considered running for governor last year and could be a rival for Mr. Cuomo in 2014.
In Westchester County, the elections could also have long-term political implications. Republicans are trying to pare back the Democrats' supermajority in the county Board of Legislators, a frequent roadblock for the Republican county executive, Rob Astorino, a rising figure within the party.
In New Jersey, all the seats in the Legislature are on the ballot. Though Democrats are expected to keep control of both the Senate and Assembly, Republicans are seeking to narrow their advantage in both chambers.

HEADLINE: On Election Day, the Candidates Have No Monopoly on Stress

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Election Day is seldom associated with raging hormones. But three professors from Israel, where all politics is vocal, suggest that the very act of voting generates stress levels that could affect the outcome.
In an experiment conducted in a small Israeli town during the fiercely contested 2009 national election, the researchers took saliva samples from people who were about to vote. They found higher levels of glucocorticoid hormones, including cortisol, which are secreted by the adrenal glands and are associated with stress.
Not only that, but people who planned to vote for the underdog tended to exhibit even more stress -- affirming a study from the United States that found Obama voters' cortisol levels remained steadier than those of McCain voters as the 2008 election results rolled in. 
''This is the first study to explore the psychological well-being of actual voters through an endocrinal measure at the ballot,'' the professors -- Israel Waismel-Manor of the University of Haifa and Gal Ifergane and Hagit Cohen of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev -- write in a recent edition of the journal European Neuropsychopharmacology.
They conducted their experiment in Omer, a small town 70 miles south of Tel Aviv, and hope to replicate it in the United States a year from now, when Americans choose a president.
''In an ideal democracy, we would like citizens to make reasoned choices, and vote based on the ideas and quality of the parties and candidates in a given election,'' the authors write.
While they do not discount the usefulness of emotion in making that choice -- ''they say that ''feeling anxious about a candidate is a good enough reason not to vote for him or her'' -- they add:
''We must understand that emotions are not merely feelings; often they carry with them a physio-endocrinal component which itself has the potential to biologically affect decision-making at the ballot box.''
People with higher cortisol levels are more likely to make snap decisions, the authors say, citing earlier studies. And higher levels of the hormone can affect memory.
''We do not argue that cortisol causes amnesia,'' Professor Waismel-Manor said, ''but it is possible that as some of these voters approach the ballot, they tend to forget how good or bad the last four years have been, or perhaps just that the troops are still in the Middle East, or that the recession is still here. That could be enough for some undecided voters or leaners to tilt the decision one way or the other.''
Such reactions may help explain the ''What's the Matter With Kansas?'' syndrome, advanced by the book of the same name, in which people sometimes seem to vote against their self-interest.
One way to reduce stress, he suggests, would be to encourage absentee voting or mail ballots to eliminate ''the public performance'' of voting.
''We go to a public place where there are lots of strangers, people who probably do not know me, will check my ID and determine if I can vote, I may face a long line, and I really want to get back to watch the game, I will probably run into Aunt Edna, and I hate her guts, etc.,'' he said. Stress levels may also be driven ''by a sense of duty: the fate of the nation is in my hands.''
Professor Waismel-Manor said he hoped to collaborate with American scholars ''to provide the public and decision makers in Washington substantiated data that may or may not confirm that voting is indeed stressful, what causes this stress, can the stress be reduced, and whether voters with lower stress vote more closely to their true preference -- the preference they had the night before Election Day.''

HEADLINE: Public Theater Picks New Executive Director

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
The board of the Public Theater announced its new executive director on Monday, entrusting its $18.5 million operating budget and other business operations to a somewhat unusual pick: Patrick Willingham, the former president and chief operating officer of Blue Man Productions, a for-profit company that turned the Off Broadway production ''Blue Man Group'' into an international entertainment attraction.
Both the Public's artistic director, Oskar Eustis, and Mr. Willingham said in telephone interviews on Monday that he was a counterintuitive selection: Mr. Willingham has never been a senior executive or financial officer at a nonprofit theater before, nor does he have experience in theater fund-raising or producing a season. 
He begins work on Nov. 28 facing his first challenge: the Public, a pre-eminent Off Broadway theater, finished its last fiscal year on Aug. 31 with its first deficit in seven years. Mr. Eustis attributed the deficit in part to not having a permanent executive director since February, when Andrew D. Hamingson resigned.
Mr. Hamingson left after Public board members lost faith in him because of financial losses from the musical ''Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson'' that transferred to Broadway and the revival of ''Hair'' that transferred to London, both for commercial runs, according to people familiar with his departure at the time.
Mr. Eustis said on Monday that the board has since put new financial controls in place: All contracts now must have two signatures, instead of one, and a new board committee on commercial productions has been established. Mr. Eustis and a spokeswoman for the Public said that they could not provide a figure for the size of the fiscal year deficit because the books were still being audited. ''It's not a scary figure,'' Mr. Eustis said.
Mr. Eustis said he did not know Mr. Willingham before the outside firm helping with the search recruited him as a candidate.
''When I was simply told his resume, I thought, 'What sense does that make?' but as I dug deeper and then talked to Patrick I realized that he had very serious qualifications,'' Mr. Eustis said. ''He is a genuine theater cat in a serious way, who has hands-on expertise in all facets of theater production.''
Mr. Eustis noted that Mr. Willingham began his career managing costume shops for Players Theater in Columbus, Ohio, and for the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival, and described him as a strategic thinker with an eye on new opportunities in the broader context of the economics, mission, and goals of a given company.
Mr. Willingham, 44, said his focus would be on ''improving the stability of the Public and a legacy of sustainability there.'' He worked at Blue Man Productions for 16 years; there he was a neighbor of the Public on Lafayette Street in Greenwich Village.
''I was excited when I heard about the position, but it was my discussions with Oskar about the mission of the Public that really grabbed me by the lapels - the idea of culture as a birthright and the importance of theater to the cultural and political dialogue of the country,'' Mr. Willingham said.
He said he left Blue Man Productions a year ago after one of his mentors there decided to move on to other projects; he has been working as a theater consultant since then. Mr. Eustis said the full board's search committee and the full panel voted unanimously to hire Mr. Willingham and give him a three-year contract.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Pleasures of Life in the Slow Lane

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
New Yorkers should love bicycling. We're control freaks. We want to get from here to there in a New York minute and moan about the subways and the buses, about lunatic taxi drivers and the gridlock that slows us down.
The other day I jumped on my bicycle and rode downtown to meet Janette Sadik-Khan, transportation commissioner for New York City. She is the driving force behind the city's new bike lanes and now also a pinata for their vocal opponents.
I started out along the Hudson, then headed east at 40th Street, past that nowhere stretch of depots that muscles its way toward the chaos of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The waterfront is bucolic and almost Zen-like without a million other bikes around, but I've also come to love those gruff, empty, brooding blocks on the far West Side, which I almost never bother to walk. River gives way to industry then density, silence to the din of Midtown -- a classic New York transition, an urban glory best absorbed, I have come to realize, from a bike. 
It's too bad that so many New Yorkers still complain about the bike lanes' contribution to the inconvenience of urban driving instead of promoting them for their obvious role in helping solve the city's transportation miseries, and for their aesthetic possibilities. I don't mean they're great to look at. I mean that for users they offer a different way of taking in the city, its streets and architecture, the fine-grained fabric of its neighborhoods. Decades ago the architects Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown wrote about how we see cities differently at different speeds. Las Vegas was their example, and they wrote about driving versus walking (skipping over the bicycle). But the point stands. On a bike time bends. Space expands and contracts.
I've had plenty of accidents over the years and know that it may sound a little crazy to talk about meditating on urban scenery when the issue is crashing into double-parked cars, abruptly opened taxi doors and reckless riders, which is where properly designed and enforced bike lanes come in, or increasingly will, as their network grows.
So far the city has installed some 260 miles of lanes during the last four years, ''hard miles,'' Ms. Sadik-Khan puts it, meaning lanes in the densest, most contested parts of town, the ambition being to link these better and set up a bike-sharing system before Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's term expires in two years. At the moment the lanes are disjointed, often badly marked and hardly policed, provoking antipathy and occasional chaos in the streets. Consolidating them will require a consistent, identifiable design vocabulary, a permanent architecture. This has to include more dedicated lanes, separated from automobile traffic by medians and parked cars, a feature that improves safety -- as it already has along Ninth Avenue, for instance -- and getting riders, drivers and pedestrians to follow the rules of the road. Cultural shifts like that take time. Bike riders especially need to follow those rules.
European cities have had decades to develop cycling cultures. The Dutch and the Danes are said to be among the happiest people on earth, which I can't help but imagine must have something to do with their bike culture. You find bicycle clubs for the elderly there, clusters of teenage boys with girls perched on the backs of their bikes, commuters chatting along the bike paths, which provide a natural mix of intimacy and distance. On a bike, the city shrinks.
I know how this happens from living in Berlin the past few years. I came to love to run errands there on my bike, to take my younger son to the aquarium and just to find excuses to ride through Treptow Park to watch old Berliners dance with hipsters on the riverside veranda of an ancient beer garden.
New York is not Berlin or Amsterdam, but London has lately turned into a bike capital too, in conjunction with a traffic-congestion fee program for drivers of the sort that New York was wrong to reject recently. It's now common around Sloane Square and Piccadilly Circus to find parents with children and businessmen and businesswomen commuting on bicycles. Safety in numbers, Londoners have discovered: a city reaches a tipping point when biking achieves what Ms. Sadik-Khan describes as an everyday ''architecture of safety.''
I looked at my watch when I arrived at 23rd Street and Ninth Avenue, where the transportation commissioner, a keen bicycler, had agreed to meet me. Including a 15-minute stop along the way, I had traveled some 4 miles in 40 minutes, or at a pace of more than 9 miles an hour. City buses average roughly 8 miles an hour, taxis, 9, during midday at this time of year. Making New York bike friendlier is of course a no-brainer for the obvious health and environmental reasons and also because cycling can be the swiftest way to get around. But it's about civic diversity as well.
A half-century ago the argument to run highways through the city sounded more than a little like the case now being made against bike lanes. Critics now say that bike lanes will hurt commerce and increase car traffic congestion. Back then, it was said, cars were the path to prosperity and more rational streets. ''What is now little more than a fume-filled traffic corridor will become a true neighborhood,'' a deputy to Robert Moses, New York's master builder during much of the last century, prophesied if the huge, multilane Lower Manhattan Expressway that Moses proposed were allowed to demolish much of what is today SoHo and the West Village. The city's very economic survival depended on accommodating automobiles and the destruction of those then-diverse areas, Moses warned.
The radical-sounding rebuttal by the urban theorist and writer Jane Jacobs was that new highways only create more traffic as cars multiply to meet increased capacity. Traffic engineers today call it ''induced demand.'' The opposite also applies. Closing streets to cars cuts traffic, as Times Square has proved. Conversely, installing more bike lanes increases the number of riders.
Ms. Sadik-Khan led the way on her sturdy bike, steering us from 23rd Street down Ninth Avenue using one of the new protected bike lanes. We rode across town on Bleecker Street to the Lower East Side, cycled over the Williamsburg Bridge, then around the Brooklyn waterfront, where, on banners, new apartment towers were advertising their adjacencies to the bike lanes. Passing the Russian Orthodox Cathedral and the Brooklyn Brewery, we stopped at a coffee shop near Bedford Avenue and North Fifth Street, where the sidewalk had been widened to make room for crowded bike corrals.
The whole trip -- about seven miles, traversed at a leisurely pace, obeying traffic signals and stopping occasionally to talk -- took less than an hour.
In that time an endless panorama became digestible. From Chelsea to the bird's-eye view atop the bridge and back down to street level at the Domino Sugar Factory, New York unspooled as a series of surprises.
Great cities offer up as one of their distinguishing virtues this combination of serendipity and complexity. I left Ms. Sadik-Khan in Brooklyn and snagged the ferry back to Manhattan. Rush-hour traffic clogged the bike lane on First Avenue. More crosstown madness left me cursing the downsides of cycling by the time I reached Central Park.
But then I found myself cruising past Bethesda Fountain in the fading sunlight. Aesthetics aside, the bike lanes are about urban livability and about encouraging the sort of street culture that, as Jacobs reminded us, a healthy and democratic city depends on.
The Central Park Lake was an echo of the Hudson at the start of the day, bringing the trip full cycle.
This was the only way to travel.

HEADLINE: A Greek Political Scion Undone by Economics

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
ATHENS -- George Andreas Papandreou, elected prime minister of Greece in 2009, is a son and grandson of popular former prime ministers. But two years later, with Greece on the verge of default and a possible exit from the euro, not even the Papandreou name could save him.
His commitment to step down as prime minister is not only a devastating blow to one of the more enduring political dynasties in Europe. It may also force a major overhaul of the old-style Socialist Pasok party that was created by Mr. Papandreou's father and which served as a major roadblock to many of the younger Papandreou's proposed economic and political changes. 
''I think that Mr. Papandreou wanted to reform, but his party failed him,'' said Yiannis Boutaris, the mayor of Salonika and one of the few politicians to achieve success outside the nepotism so prevalent in the Greek party monoliths. ''He could be forgiven many mistakes because of his name, but the last one -- calling the referendum -- that could not be forgiven.''
That may be a generous assessment. There are many Papandreou critics who claim he shirked an opportunity to grab history by the lapel and shake out all the elements of an entrenched Greek state that, through decades of wasteful borrowing and spending, had brought the nation to the verge of bankruptcy.
By most accounts, Mr. Papandreou, 59, lacked the relentless political drive that marked his father and grandfather.
His youth was peripatetic, the product of his father's own time in political exile. He was born in Minnesota and spent formative years in Berkeley, Calif.; Canada; and Sweden.
He supported 1960s- and 1970s-era movements like environmentalism and the legalization of drugs, causes that harked back to his guitar-playing days enmeshed in the counterculture at Amherst College in rural Massachusetts. His roommate there, Antonis Samaras, is now the leader of the New Democracy opposition party and agreed to join a coalition government only after Mr. Papandreou stepped down.
It was not until the early 1980s, when Mr. Papandreou joined his father's Pasok party as a member of Parliament, that he began to develop his own political identity.
Elected in October 2009 after five years of New Democracy rule marked by corruption scandals, violent riots and a growing sense of economic uncertainty, Mr. Papandreou was little prepared for the profound shock that the Greek deficit he had inherited was twice the size the previous government had claimed.
By December 2009, the failure to keep Greek borrowing in check had exploded into an international issue that would tear at the fabric that held the euro zone together.
Trained as a sociologist, Mr. Papandreou had to quickly get up to speed on such arcane matters as credit default swaps and the difference between voluntary and mandatory defaults. And while he understood, at least theoretically, how urgent it was for Greece to cut its bloated public work force, actually doing so proved almost impossible for a man who owed his political position to his party's deep connections with the powerful unions for civil servants.
The son of an American mother, he is described as a meticulous and exact man who favors regular jogs, technical gadgets and never-ending lists of options and things to do. He is more fluent in English than Greek -- a fact that has drawn scorn in the hypercritical Athens news media.
And from the beginning of his term he has reached out to vast number of advisers in the United States and Europe -- including Labour politicians in Britain, former economy ministers in Turkey, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, who is American, and any number of academics who captured, at least temporarily, his intellectual fancy.
But his critics say that while he was on the receiving end of numerous proposals, he was never really able to develop his own true voice. He could never, they say, make the case to his austerity-ravaged people that he truly spoke for them.
He could not rise to the level of a Churchill in 1939, said Yanis Varoufakis, an Athens-based political economist who years ago was an adviser to Mr. Papandreou. ''At a moment like this you need leadership.''
To be sure, Mr. Papandreou devoted his full energies to trying to find a solution to Greece's debt crisis, all while under the crushing weight, his friends and family members say, of being the third Papandreou to lead Greece.
But he could not reach his people the way his father, Andreas -- who spent his years in the United States as a vocal dissident of the Greek military regime -- was able to.
''Andreas came from the outside -- he spoke directly to the people,'' said Nick Papandreou, the prime minister's brother. ''George has been in Greek politics for 30 years. The way he expresses himself is cushioned by this.''
But, his brother adds, the elder Mr. Papandreou, driven more by ideology rather than pragmatism, might not have been so determined to carry out the painful changes that George was convinced were necessary to bring Greece out of the past.
Indeed, during the tense negotiations with his European partners, Mr. Papandreou showed himself to be a relentless bureaucratic tactician, seeking every last advantage to get the money he so desperately needed from Europe.
Early in the talks, for example, he opened up a back channel to Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then the president of the International Monetary Fund. ''Why don't we turn to the I.M.F.?'' Mr. Papandreou told intimates. ''They, too, will impose austerity -- but at least we will get the money.''
Mr. Papandreou's final ploy -- the threat that Greece might leave the euro -- proved to be his undoing.
George Papaconstantinou, Mr. Papandreou's finance minister until he was forced out last June, says the prime minister should be judged against the situation he inherited, which left him little room for maneuvering.
As for any overriding lesson Mr. Papandreou may have learned over the past two years, Mr. Papaconstantinou offered a one-word answer: ''Economics.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Field Attacks Obama Foreign Policy With Tough Talk on Iran

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
As United Nations inspectors prepare to unveil a new report on Iran's nuclear capabilities, some Republican presidential candidates have taken increasingly forceful tones on the issue, saying they would sanction or consider supporting an attack on Iran's nuclear program by either Israel or the United States.
The party's hawkishness was evident last week as five major Republican rivals campaigned in Iowa. In an interview outside Des Moines, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas was asked whether he would back a pre-emptive Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear program, and he then told CNN he would support Israeli efforts ''up to and including military action.'' 
Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, described Iran as an ''enemy'' on Friday night in Des Moines at a dinner of almost 1,000 of the state's most important Republican activists. In an interview, Mr. Santorum said that he would ''stand shoulder to shoulder'' in support of Israel if it launched a pre-emptive attack and that he would also back direct American military support if requested by Israel.
The issue holds particular resonance now amid numerous reports that United Nations inspectors will state this week that Iran has moved closer to being capable of building a nuclear weapon, and as Israel has been debating a more confrontational posture toward Iran.
Broadly within the party, the focus reflects not only competition to be regarded as the strongest ally of Israel, but also a sense that projecting toughness on Iran may offer one of the few political openings on foreign policy that Republicans can use to attack President Obama. Republicans assert that he has been weak and too solicitous of the Iranian government, while administration officials believe they have orchestrated an array of sanctions and other efforts that have put great pressure on Iran.
One candidate, Representative Ron Paul of Texas, flatly rejects a pre-emptive strike by American forces, absent ''credible evidence'' that Iran was planning an imminent attack on the United States, which Mr. Paul says would be highly unlikely. He says that the Iranian threat to the Middle East has also been overstated and that he favors better relations with that country.
His spokesman, Jesse Benton, added that Mr. Paul ''refused to condemn Israel's attacks against Iraq's nuclear facilities in the early 1980s and would not try to push Israel or tell them what to do.''
Two other candidates -- Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Herman Cain -- have in past interviews declined to state explicitly whether they could support a strike by the United States. But both have used strong words: Mr. Cain has suggested that he would equate an attack on Israel with an attack on the United States.
And after a campaign appearance at Iowa State University on Thursday, Mrs. Bachmann warned, ''Iran has stated once they gain a nuclear weapon they will use it to wipe Israel off the face of the earth.''
In a similar vein, when Mr. Perry was asked if he would approve a pre-emptive Israeli strike ''even if it started a war in the region,'' he responded, ''We cannot allow that madman to get his hands on a nuclear weapon, because we know what he will do with it.''
The comments by both candidates have their roots at least in part in a statement by the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, six years ago that was translated as his saying Israel ''should be wiped off the map.''
He did not say anything about using nuclear weapons, and Iran has denied seeking nuclear weaponry. The nature and meaning of Mr. Ahmadinejad's statement has been hotly disputed ever since. Some officials say it shows that Iran's leadership wants to annihilate Israel, but other analysts say he was not calling for an attack or military action but for the collapse someday of Israel.
Like the Obama administration, Mitt Romney, who leads the Republican field in many polls, would keep a military option ''on the table'' and use diplomatic and economic pressure. Mr. Romney also says he would order the ''regular presence'' of an aircraft carrier task force in the eastern Mediterranean and Persian Gulf.
A spokesman added that Mr. Romney would seek ''increased military coordination with and assistance to Israel in order to make clear to Iran that the military option is very much on the table, and increased Israeli preparation for a strike advances that policy.''
In response to a question four years ago, Mr. Romney said that if any military action were taken against Iran, ''I don't anticipate that the kind of strategy we would pursue would be a ground-intensive, change-the-regime, change-the-government type of effort. I think it's more likely that other military actions would be in the nature of blockade or a bombardment or surgical strikes of one kind or another.''
In a recent foreign policy speech, former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah said he would consider using American force to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. And former Speaker Newt Gingrich said last Friday that while he would not ''green-light'' a pre-emptive Israeli strike -- favoring instead efforts to replace the Iranian leadership -- he also would not try to talk the Israelis down from such an attack.
''I wouldn't,'' Mr. Gingrich said on CNN. ''I mean, if the prime minister of Israel comes to the conclusion that the survival of his country's at stake, the idea that an American president's going to second guess him -- you know, two nuclear weapons is a second holocaust.''

HEADLINE: Policy Proposals: Crowd Helps Romney With Cuts

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
DUBUQUE, Iowa - Mitt Romney, clad in Tommy Bahama blue jeans and a blue plaid work shirt, took that stage at a metal fabrication shop here and offered two different scenarios a year from now.
Referring to the ''Obama great recession,'' Mr. Romney told the crowd at Giese Manufacturing that that they could turn on their television sets a year from now to the headline: ''President Obama has been reelected to a second term.'' Or, he explained, ''the alternative, of course, is that you turn on your TV about a year from now, and instead of seeing the Obama camp celebrating, you'll see something on the TV that says 'Mitt is It.'''
The crowd applauded, and Mr. Romney admitted that this later option was ''the scenario I'm looking forward to.'' 
''I want to go to work to make America once again the most attractive place in the world, the most prosperous place in the world, for middle income Americans,'' he explained. ''I want this to be a place where people around the world say, 'I wish I could be middle class in America.'''
On his fourth trip to Iowa this year, and his third trip since announcing he was running for president, Mr. Romney also cast himself as a deficit-slayer.
''You see, unlike a lot of people in Washington, I believe that deficits matter,'' he said. ''I believe that one of the reasons we've had such a hard time getting our economy going again is because of the huge deficits that are being racked by this president and by politicians in Washington.''
He added: ''I will slay the deficit beast. It's killing jobs, it's shadowing our future, and it's keeping our kids from the bright prospects they deserve.''
Mr. Romney also reiterated portions of the deficit and spending cuts plan he'd debuted last week in front of the Americans For Prosperity Foundation's annual summit.
''Those three things - making government simpler, smaller and smarter - mean getting rid of programs, turning programs back to states, and finally making government itself more efficient,'' Mr. Romney explained. In addition to repealing the president's national health care program, Mr. Romney also offered a few other examples of federal programs he'd be willing to cut - The National Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities.
''These are wonderful things,'' he said, referring to the programs he'd just placed on the chopping block. ''But I'm not willing to borrow a billion dollars to pay for things we don't absolutely need. We can't keep buying and spending and passing on debts to our kids, and ill stop it by killing programs.''
There was one program, however, that the crowd was eager to add the list - Planned Parenthood. Before Mr. Romney's speech began, Doris Hingtgen, 80, a retired Dubuque resident, said that while she was backing Mr. Romney, she was hoping he would ''come out a little stronger on the right-to-life thing.''
''A lot of people have mentioned to me that he hasn't said enough about right to life,'' she said, before adding, ''I think he's a good businessman, he has good morals, and he's an electable type person.''
When Mr. Romney worked the crowd after the event, smiling tightly and quickly moving along to the next person when a man thanked him for ''acknowledging climate change,'' no fewer than four voters asked him about Planned Parenthood, and if it was one of the programs he'd defund as president.
''That is on my list of programs to eliminate,'' said Mr. Romney, who hadn't mentioned the program in his speech.
Diane Berryman, 65, a retired teacher from Asbury, said that she was satisfied with his answer.
''I guess I allow people to change their views - whether or not it's political or not, who am I do judge,'' said Ms. Berryman, who has picketed outside of Planned Parenthood.
Steven Brody, 44, who lives in Wisconsin but works in Dubuque as the executive director of Dubuque County Right to Life, was one of the voters who pressed Mr. Romney on defunding Planned Parenthood. ''It's the life issue that really matters to us in the heartland,'' Mr. Brody said. ''When you're talking about cutting waste from government, Planned Parenthood is a great target.''
Mr. Romney ended his speech much the way he'd begun - inviting the assembled Iowans to return to their television screens in just a year's time.
''I don't want to wake up a year from now and turn on my TV and have it say, 'President Obama re-elected,' because I know what that means,'' Mr. Romney said. ''It means a weaker America. I want to see a new president that will take America in a great tradition, and a new tradition, one that makes America the best place in the world to be middle class again. And I will be that president. ''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton Lays Out His Prescription for America's Future

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
BACK TO WORK
Why We Need Smart Government for a Strong Economy
By Bill Clinton
196 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $23.95.
Bill Clinton's new book, ''Back to Work,'' is really several books in one slender volume. It's a lucid one-man rebuttal of the Tea Party's anti-government agenda. A series of shrewd talking points for Democrats trying to hold on to the White House and battling for control of Congress in the midst of a sour economy and growing voter discontent. A self-serving reminder of the prosperity the country enjoyed during Mr. Clinton's tenure in the White House, meant to burnish his legacy. And a practical set of proposals -- some borrowed and some new, some innovative and some highly sketchy -- for restoring economic growth and creating jobs.
The book, which appears to be an expanded version of a Newsweek article by Mr. Clinton that appeared in June, shows the former president in two familiar modes: freewheeling policy wonk and genial retail politician. 
At a time when anti-government ranting dominates the Republican debates and the Democrats often seem on the defensive, Mr. Clinton serves up a succinct common-sense argument for why America needs a strong national government, why both spending cuts and increased tax revenues are necessary for addressing the debt problem (which is going to get worse given the demographics of an aging baby-boomer population and the high costs of interest payments), and why that debt problem ''can't be solved unless the economy starts growing again.''
Although Mr. Clinton questions the Obama administration's embrace of nuclear-power loan guarantees -- he brings up the vulnerability of nuclear plants to natural disasters and contends that ''nuclear isn't much of a job creator compared with other clean fuel sources'' -- the bulk of this book underscores just how closely aligned Mr. Clinton is with President Obama on many policy issues. The book contrasts their shared economic approach to that of Republicans, from Ronald Reagan through George W. Bush, who, Mr. Clinton writes, abandoned the idea of a balanced budget and instead chose ''large tax cuts especially for higher income people like me, along with two wars and the senior citizens' drug benefit,'' which resulted in snowballing deficits.
At the same time, this book has a passive-aggressive subtext, which suggests that Mr. Clinton has stepped into a gap -- has gone ''back to work,'' as it were -- to sell Obama policies that have not been persuasively sold to the American people. Mr. Clinton writes that he started and stopped writing the book several times because he didn't ''want just to add another stone to the Democratic side of the partisan scale,'' but ''decided to go forward because I think it's important that all Americans have a clear understanding of the basic economic facts and of the ideas driving the policy proposals under discussion.''
Mr. Clinton wonders why ''the president and the Democratic Congress did not raise the debt ceiling after the election, in November or December 2010, when they still had a majority.'' Such a move arguably would have averted the debilitating down-to-the-wire negotiations this summer, which Mr. Clinton says left the United States looking ''weak and confused'' to the outside world.
Among the reasons for the size of the Republican victories in 2010, Mr. Clinton argues, was the Democrats' failure to ''counter the national Republican message with one of their own.'' The Republicans, in Mr. Clinton's view, ran ''a more effective, more aggressive campaign'' that characterized the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi; the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid; and Mr. Obama ''as extreme leftists who wanted to spend America into ruin, regulate the economy into extended recession, and tax individuals into poverty and businesses into bankruptcy.'' The Democrats, he says, ''ran individual races without a big message,'' apparently because ''they couldn't agree on one.''
What sort of authority does Mr. Clinton bring to writing this book? His admirers will argue that he is the ideal author for a book about fixing the economy, and will point to his record as president -- reducing the federal deficit, overhauling welfare, blunting his party's reputation for profligate spending and presiding over the longest economic expansion on record with falling unemployment, rising incomes and improved competitiveness on the world stage. Moreover, as president and later as founder of the Clinton Global Initiative, he understands the politics and economics of globalization and the dynamics of the technological information age.
But critics will argue that the deregulatory policies promoted by Mr. Clinton's administration -- under the treasury secretaries Robert E. Rubin and later Lawrence H. Summers -- contributed to conditions that led to the Wall Street meltdown of 2008 and the subsequent recession. In this book Mr. Clinton skims over these issues lightly. Of his signing of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealing part of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act that prohibited commercial banks from engaging in the investment business, he argues that it is not self-evident that ''the mortgage crisis was hastened and enlarged by the end of the division between commercial and investment banks.''
On the matter of failing effectively to regulate financial derivatives, Mr. Clinton writes, ''I can be fairly criticized for not making a bigger public issue out of the need to regulate'' them. But he adds the rationalization that he ''couldn't have done anything about it, because the Republican Congress was hostile to all regulations, going so far as to threaten to leave the S.E.C. with no budget because the commissioner, Arthur Levitt, was vigilant in doing his job.''
As reporters have frequently pointed out, Mr. Clinton has always been an omnivorous reader of books, journalism, academic and governmental studies, and adept at drawing useful connections among highly disparate subjects. His prescriptions here for creating jobs and addressing the debt problem reflect those habits, while hewing to a basically centrist outlook.
Mr. Clinton lays out various ideas for increasing bank lending and corporate investment, unwinding the mortgage mess and amending tax laws to give corporations incentives to bring more money back to the United States.
Some of his proposals simply ratify initiatives advanced by the Obama administration, including payroll tax cuts, infrastructure investment and student loan programs. Some -- regarding, say, Social Security -- are little more than assessments of recommendations made by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles debt commission. And some -- like streamlining regulation, investing in job training and allowing gifted young immigrants to fill so-called STEM jobs (in science, technology, engineering and mathematics) that can't be filled by Americans -- echo proposals set forth by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York in a 2010 speech about promoting long-term economic growth.
As for Mr. Clinton's more original-sounding ideas, a handful may seem intriguing on paper but are vague and not so easily achieved: for instance, ''export more services,'' or emulate Germany by concentrating ''on high-end manufacturing and getting smaller companies into exports.''
Other proposals seem hard to imagine ever being effectively or enthusiastically implemented, among them working to make one or two states (like Nevada with its enormous solar and wind capacity) ''completely energy independent'' by ''maximizing their capacity to produce and consume energy,'' or imposing a ''value-added tax'' that would ''help to increase our exports'' and make ''our products more affordable in other markets.''
Mr. Clinton makes it perfectly clear that some of the ideas he has thrown out in these pages are hastily jotted down thoughts that require further investigation. At one point he says he doesn't know ''if the Fed has legal authority to invest in an infrastructure bank that would pay back the investment plus interest, but if it is legal to do so, I think it's a good idea.''
In the end this book seems meant less as a detailed blueprint for job creation than a catalyst for getting people to focus on the serious issues facing the United States -- which Mr. Clinton says is ''in a mess now'' -- and the necessity of doing so right away. Reviewing the alarming and by now familiar statistics that show America falling behind in high school and college graduation rates, science and math scores and income mobility, Mr. Clinton writes that ''the troubling thing about all these rankings'' is ''not what they say about where we are but what they reveal about where we're going.'' He adds, ''We simply are not doing what we have to do to stay ahead of the competition for good jobs, new businesses, and breakthrough innovations.''
Not facing up to such inconvenient facts, Mr. Clinton notes, is part of the problem. Or, ''As my daughter and her friends used to say when they were younger, 'Denial is not just a river in Egypt.' ''

HEADLINE: Obama Aide Hands Over Operations

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's chief of staff, William M. Daley, has turned over some of his day-to-day management responsibilities to another senior aide, Pete Rouse, according to several officials with knowledge of the change. The shift comes after a turbulent period in which the White House has struggled with a weak economy and a hostile Congress. 
Mr. Daley made the announcement in a staff meeting on Monday, these officials said, though it was unclear exactly what his new role would look like. He told a Chicago television station recently that he planned to return to his home there after the 2012 election.
The news of the management changes was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
A banker with deep connections on Wall Street and in Democratic politics, Mr. Daley was recruited by Mr. Obama last fall to smooth relations with the business world. But after the administration's failure to strike a deficit-reduction deal with the House speaker, John A. Boehner, Mr. Daley found that his deal-making skills were of less use.
Mr. Rouse, a low-key but highly regarded administrator who spent most of his career as an aide on Capitol Hill, served as interim chief of staff after the departure of Rahm Emanuel to run for mayor of Chicago. In an interview in September, Mr. Daley said he was frustrated that the breakdown in negotiations with Congress over the debt ceiling had led to a more confrontational strategy, in which the White House and Republicans in Congress trade accusations.

HEADLINE: In Mayor's Contest for a New Engineering School, Only One Judge Counts

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Midway through a third term marked by budget-cutting and a series of political and managerial setbacks, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and members of his inner circle are increasingly focused on the competition they created to build a high-tech graduate school in New York City, which many of them believe could become a major part of his legacy.
So while an advisory panel of business people and scientists, the Economic Development Corporation and the City Council each has a role to play in reviewing the seven proposals received last month from major universities around the globe, the decision as to who gets to build what, and where, will ultimately rest with one man. 
''This is going to be a mayoral call, because this is something that is incredibly important to him,'' said Howard Wolfson, a deputy mayor.
Many people attribute the enthusiastic response to the competition from universities and business leaders, in part, to Mr. Bloomberg's own track record. He became a billionaire as a technology entrepreneur, has made major gifts to universities and has spoken out against policies that limit immigration by engineers and others with talents that are in high demand.
''I think we'll look back and say this is a very significant part of Mike Bloomberg's legacy,'' said Christine C. Quinn, speaker of the Council. ''It could be a game-changer for New York City.''
City officials, who hope that a top-flight school of applied sciences will spawn enough high-tech businesses to make New York a rival of Silicon Valley, have declined to release the proposals submitted on Oct. 28 and have asked the bidders not to disclose any details.
Cornell University, in partnership with Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, and Stanford, which is working with City College, are seen as the top contenders, each vying to spend more than $2 billion to build a campus on Roosevelt Island. Columbia University, a consortium of schools led by New York University, and three other institutions are seeking to build on other sites.
Some elements of the selection process remain murky. The request for proposals that the city has published mentions options like narrowing the contest to a set of finalists, or negotiating with bidders to make changes in their submissions. The mayor has talked about the possibility of two winners rather than one, while giving no hint as to how that might work, leading to wide speculation about the prospect of choosing either Stanford or Cornell for Roosevelt Island, as well as either Columbia (which wants to build in West Harlem) or N.Y.U. (Downtown Brooklyn).
The request for proposals says that each submission will receive a grade -- 40 percent of which will be based on its economic impact and feasibility, 40 percent on the applicant's qualifications and track record, and 20 percent on how well the school would be linked to other city institutions. But under each of these umbrellas are many specifics, some of them overlapping, or subjective, and no point values are assigned.
Still, the document provides some clues for educated guessing. It says that universities will be judged not just on their record of spinning off technology businesses, but also on how many locate near its campus, an obvious advantage to Stanford, whose alumni and staff members founded nearby giants like Google, Yahoo and Cisco in Silicon Valley.
On the other hand, the request for proposals asks each applicant to show its experience and expertise in building a major development ''in an urban context,'' a potential drawback for Stanford when compared with Columbia, N.Y.U. and even Cornell, which built its medical and other schools in New York City.
The city asked for proposals of more than one million square feet of floor space. Cornell (2.1 million), Stanford (1.9 million) and Columbia (1.1 million) clearly qualify, but N.Y.U.'s team falls short, with 400,000. Less information has been made public about proposals by Carnegie Mellon University, Amity University of India and a consortium that includes the New York Genome Center.
The scoring system strongly favors proposals that focus on computing and electrical engineering, rather than medical technology, which could work against the Genome Center. It is unclear whether the city will also discount past successes in medical engineering, which would hurt Columbia, a major innovator in that field.
Columbia and N.Y.U., with the deepest roots in the city, are likely to garner the most points for success in working with local institutions; Stanford's promise to involve City College could help offset that.
The city's guidelines indicate that the Economic Development Corporation ''will lead a committee to review the proposals and select the developer.'' Mr. Bloomberg himself said last week, ''I'm going to leave it to the advisory panel, and then Seth and Bob,'' referring to Seth Pinsky, president of the corporation, and Robert K. Steel, deputy mayor for economic development.
''And you know,'' he added, ''we'll sit down and talk about it.''
Aides say that the advice of Mr. Pinsky, who conceived of the competition, and Mr. Steel, a former banking executive whose judgment on this project the mayor values most, will influence the mayor. But they, along with business leaders and other elected officials, said that Mr. Bloomberg would be deeply involved in assessing the plans, and that when the time for a decision came -- one is expected in January -- it would be his.
Once a proposal (or more than one) is selected, it will most likely need approvals from community boards, the Planning Commission and the Council, which controls the $100 million the mayor has proposed spending on infrastructure improvements for the new campus.
Ms. Quinn said she expected no major obstacles.

HEADLINE: Ivory Soap Refreshes Its Ads and Its Look, But Is Resolutely Simple

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
PROCTER & GAMBLE is bringing one of its oldest and one of its most known brands, Ivory soap, into the 21st century with new packaging, advertising and social media initiatives.
P.& G. announced the advertising, by Wieden & Kennedy, based in Portland, Ore., and packaging, by the Cincinnati office of Sterling Brands, last month. The company introduced an online community hosted by the actress Melissa McCarthy at a news conference in New York on Monday night.
The initiatives represent P.& G.'s first major marketing push for Ivory in years: According to Kantar Media, a division of WPP, the company has advertised Ivory minimally since 2006, spending a high of $1.4 million that year and less than $325,000 in total between 2007 and the first half of this year. 
The new Ivory packaging, which features bright colors like cyan, purple and green chosen to contrast with the soap's pure white, replaces more subdued packaging. And its social media efforts, which include a Facebook page introduced last month, are also a first. The overall campaign is intended to promote the Ivory brand's ''value and simplicity,'' Procter & Gamble said in a statement, while ''focusing on giving busy moms and families a product that delivers what they are looking for.'' Ivory is one of six soap brands sold by P.& G.; the others are Olay, Gillette, Old Spice, Safeguard and Camay.
In the past five years, Ivory's annual sales have ranked third among the six brands, said Kevin Hochman, marketing director of the Ivory brand team. According to Jason M. Gere, who follows Procter & Gamble for RBC Capital Markets, Ivory's annual sales are less than $100 million, or less than 1 percent of the company's total annual sales.
Competition in the soap category has changed radically since Ivory was introduced in 1879: Mr. Hochman said the biggest trend in recent years was ''genderization'' of the category, soaps specifically for men or women. He said Ivory, on the other hand, appealed to men and women, with half the brand's users male and half female.
Procter & Gamble also is grappling with slower growth in sales of beauty care products. Because of the economic downturn, the company ''has to hold onto its core demographic and capture new consumers with a new approach,'' Mr. Gere said. He said Ivory's main competitors in the bar soap segment -- the largest part of its business -- were Henkel's Dial and Unilever's Dove brands.
According to Mintel International, a market research company in Chicago, United States sales of nondeodorant bar soaps rose only 0.8 percent in 2010 compared with 2009.
According to SymphonyIRI, bar soap sales in United States supermarkets, drugstores and mass merchants excluding Wal-Mart totaled $739.4 million in the year ending Oct. 2. Dove generated 40.5 percent of these sales, an increase of 6.31 percent year over year; Dial generated 13.6 percent of sales, a fall of 3.44 percent; and Ivory generated 4.41 percent of sales, a decline of 3.13 percent.
Directed at mothers ages 25 to 49, the new advertising, by Wieden & Kennedy, is promoting Ivory's bar soap, body wash and liquid hand soap. All come in Ivory's original formula, or with aloe or lavender.
The ads, which run through December, include humorous 15- and 30-second TV spots that show how complicated soap use has become. One depicts a group of unusually shaped soaps, including a soap that resembles waffles with syrup and powdered sugar, and asks, ''At what point does soap stop being soap?'' Television ads are running in cities including San Antonio, Detroit, Miami, and Fort Smith, Ark., which Mr. Hochman called ''highly developed'' markets for Ivory.
Print ads are running in November and December issues of magazines like Cosmopolitan, Essence and People, while banner ads are running on Web sites like iVillage.com and AllRecipes.com. Outdoor advertising is running in Cincinnati; Nashville; Minneapolis; Charlotte, N.C.; and Bentonville, Ark.
Danielle Flagg, a creative director at Wieden & Kennedy, said the campaign's creative concept came about ''because it felt like just the right time to stand in contrast to the overcomplicated nonsense'' in the soap category.
Ivory's new online community, called Soap Dish, is hosted by Ms. McCarthy, who recently won an Emmy award for her work on the CBS sitcom ''Mike & Molly,'' and is the mother of two young daughters. Ms. McCarthy and community participants will discuss issues of marriage and motherhood; Ivory fans must ''like'' the brand's Facebook page to participate. The Facebook page and Soap Dish were developed by Citizen Paine in Irvine, Calif.
Industry experts generally praised the campaign, though some questioned why the brand's new packaging was not shown in any advertising.
Tulin Erdem, a professor of marketing at the NYU Stern School of Business, said the campaign tried to keep up ''with the times without sounding too trendy,'' while ''mocking lightheartedly the soap industry.''
David Reibstein, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said the unsettled economy might further Procter & Gamble's efforts, because many people cannot ''afford a luxurious soap.''
Renee Richardson Gosline, an assistant professor of marketing at the MIT Sloan School of Management, also predicted the simplicity of Ivory and its campaign could appeal to consumers.
However, she also questioned the absence of the new Ivory packaging in advertising. ''If you're proud of the packaging, show it off,'' she said.
Procter & Gamble declined to discuss the budget for the campaign. According to Kantar Media, the company was the largest United States advertiser in the first half of 2011, spending $1.4 billion, down 7.8 percent from the same period in 2009.

HEADLINE: Senate Acts On 2 Pieces Of Proposal On Hiring

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Monday cleared the way for a measure that would repeal a tax withholding program on government contractors and provide tax incentives for companies that hire veterans, making them the first pieces of President Obama's jobs plan to gain some momentum in Congress. 
The Senate voted 94 to 1 to take up the bill to end a new tax withholding program on government contractors after the House easily passed the measure last month. Democrats also intend to make the Senate bill the vehicle for a package of tax breaks to spur the hiring of veterans after Mr. Obama promoted that effort on Monday with the approach of Veterans Day.
These modest provisions are the only ones so far in Mr. Obama's sweeping proposal to promote hiring that have gained support in both parties. Republicans have denounced Mr. Obama's plan as a second stimulus package and blocked it in the Senate.
Backers of eliminating the withholding provision, which was created under President George W. Bush's administration but delayed until 2013, say it could encourage those who do business with the government to hire more workers since they would not have to withhold 3 percent of certain payments.
The Congressional Budget Office said its repeal would reduce federal revenues by $11 billion over 10 years. To pay for it, the House passed another bill, packaged into one measure for the Senate, which would fix an apparent error in the health care law that would allow hundreds of thousands of middle-income early retirees to get nearly free Medicaid coverage meant for the poor.
The effort to help veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan break into the work force has earned bipartisan support. The last thing ''veterans should have to do is fight for a job when they come home,'' Mr. Obama said as he urged Congress to pass a tax credit of up to $9,600 for companies that hire veterans. He also announced a package to help veterans with counseling and job referrals.
Those proposals, which include an electronic job bank for veterans and six months of individual job counseling, are similar to proposals in a veterans bill the House passed by an overwhelming vote last month. Where the two bills differ is in the White House's use of tax credits for companies to hire veterans, though lawmakers from both parties appear ready to vote in favor of that as well.
''Too many can't find a job worthy of their tremendous talents,'' Mr. Obama said in the Rose Garden, flanked by veterans and representatives of veterans groups. The jobless rate for veterans of those wars is 12.1 percent, White House officials said. More than 850,000 veterans are without work, Mr. Obama said, some for long stretches.

HEADLINE: Big Paydays In a Merger

BYLINE: By ROB COX and WAYNE ARNOLD

 BODY:
When is a merger of equals really a takeover? One easy way to tell is when the top brass get rich and undeserved paydays. There's probably no better live example than the just-delayed sale of a Massachusetts electric utility, Nstar. Its top five executives could feast on as much as $50 million in severance and change-of-control payments despite labeling their deal one of mutual control for both sets of shareholders. As regulators investigate the union more deeply, investors may want to do the same.
It's no surprise Nstar wanted to describe selling out to a rival, Northeast Utilities -- the company behind Connecticut's recent crippling power outages -- as a merger instead of a takeover. Given their huge local monopolies, electric companies are highly regulated and politicized creatures. Nstar has 1.4 million captive customers in the greater Boston area. 
These concerns explain why the companies used a variation on the verb ''merge'' 29 times when announcing the all-stock deal. Each company will contribute seven directors to the board. Nstar's chief executive, Thomas J. May, retains the same role in the combined company, while his counterpart at Northeast, Charles Shivery, will become chairman.
But while all this makes it sound like a merger, it's not. The terms of the transaction give Nstar's existing owners shares equal to around 44 percent of the new entity. That constitutes a change of control, according to Nstar's proxy documents, thereby causing accelerated payouts of unvested equity and other benefits for named executive officers.
For May alone, this comes to $8.3 million. What's more, the deal includes so-called double-trigger agreements that pay out as much as $50 million if the five senior employees are terminated after two years. In the context of executive pay gone wild, this may not sound like an aberration. The oil driller Nabors recently paid $100 million in severance to its chairman, Eugene Isenberg, merely to surrender the title of chief executive.
But equity investors normally receive a premium when handing control to a buyer. Nstar's deal was struck at parity. That effectively means Nstar's executives will exploit a change-of-control premium that their shareholders were denied.
Amiss in Japan
Something is amiss with Japan's biggest names. Sony, Panasonic and Honda were three whose earnings were battered in the latest quarter, but they weren't alone. Earnings at the 493 Japanese companies that announced results as of Oct. 31 were 57 percent short of their forecasts, according to Deutsche Bank. Excuses abound, from earthquakes to weak demand in the United States. But problems at home make them most susceptible.
Japan's corporate titans were hit by many of the worries that plague their global cousins. Europe's debt crisis and weak growth in the United States are hurting demand for gadgets and appliances. Floods in Thailand added a cruel twist, since many Japanese companies have cut costs by shifting some production facilities there. Some, like Honda, had only just returned to speed after March's earthquake in northern Japan.
A strong yen added further pain, as it edged toward a once-unimaginable rate of 75 to the dollar. But the yen's recent rise is neither dramatic nor new. It has been steadily climbing since 2007 and in broad terms for the last 30 years. Japanese companies have done many things right, cutting costs and moving production abroad. Profits in the electronics sector have recovered since the financial crisis to where they were six years ago, despite a yen that is 50 percent stronger, Goldman Sachs says.
The biggest problem might be an identity crisis. Japan's corporate managers have long focused on expanding market share at the expense of profitability, adding high-employment, low-margin business lines. Take Panasonic. Its display technology is world class, but the company still makes low-margin appliances like portable razors and fax machines. Sony tells a similar story. Honda remains the world leader in hydrogen-fuel cell technology but part of its supply chain is underwater.
Until recently, Tokyo supported strategies to promote revenues and employment over earnings, and shareholders played along. Investors are becoming increasingly impatient with thin margins that can't absorb shocks. The red ink spilled in the last quarter will hopefully serve as a wake-up call. Japan Inc. isn't broken -- it just needs to shed its dead wood.

HEADLINE: Anxiety Over Italy Feeds a Cycle of Rising Bond Rates

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
Is the endgame near for Italy?
Interest rates on Italian bonds rose to euro-era records on Monday, close to the level that have forced Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek financial rescues.
Most economists do not expect Italy to plead for a bailout yet. Instead, they say they think the higher rates will force the European Central Bank or other European neighbors to intervene more forcefully with measures to push down rates.
The yields on Italy's 10-year bonds, a measure of investor anxiety about lending money to the country, rose to 6.63 percent at one point during trading on Monday. Five-year yields were even higher, at 6.65 percent, up half a percentage point on the day. The two-year yield also rose, to 5.9 percent. 
Economists and investors say the dynamic is worrying. They fear the higher rates may incite bond clearing houses -- the middlemen between buyers and sellers of the bonds -- to demand higher collateral payments from traders of Italian debt. That, in turn, could lead to a further damaging spike in interest rates. Higher rates also threaten to sap Italy's long-term ability to support its debt load, nearly 120 percent of its annual economic output at the end of last year, which is among the highest for countries that use the euro currency.
''This is feeding on itself,'' said Eric Green, an economist at TD Securities. ''It continues to put pressure on Italy.''
Bond rates are being driven by investors' doubts that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy can push through sweeping changes to improve economic growth, including making pensions less generous and selling off some of the country's assets. The measures are widely considered necessary to tackle Italy's heavy debt load and revive its stagnating economy.
Investors are also selling Italian bonds because they fear that other European countries will not provide billions of euros to support Italy if conditions deteriorate even more.
They worry that European leaders have not come up with sufficient details about an expanded bailout fund, which is meant to provide ample firepower for Italy and other countries, like Spain, should the markets turn against them.
''Euro zone policy makers have yet to announce a policy bazooka,'' Jens Nordvig, an economist at Nomura Holdings in New York, said in a research note. He said the structure of a purported $1.4 trillion bailout fund, announced at a meeting of European leaders in Brussels last month, ''is insufficient to provide a credible backstop.''
Italy's interest rates rose early Monday, then fell back slightly as rumors spread through the markets that Mr. Berlusconi was intending to step down, although they rose again later in New York trading.
Mr. Berlusconi denied the speculation that he was leaving office. Yet the markets seemed to say that investors would be happier about Italy's future if he yielded power.
''The government needs to do a lot more to gain the full confidence of the Italian people, external creditors and the markets,'' said Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of the bond giant Pimco.
Andrea Schlaepfer, a spokeswoman for LCH.Clearnet, the big European clearing house that trades in bonds, said the spread between the yield on Italian bonds and the yield on a basket of AAA-rated bonds is one factor the company would consider before deciding to raise collateral requirements. Other factors include rates on credit default swaps.
The credit default swap rates that measure the cost of insuring Italian debt against default rose to near-record highs on Monday. It now costs $511,000 a year to insure $10 million in Italian debt for five years, according to the data provider Markit, compared with $145,000 in June.
The higher interest rates present hurdles for issuing new debt. Italy's next auction of debt is on Nov. 14. It must raise 30.5 billion euros in November, and another 22.5 billion euros in December, according to Daiwa Securities.
When its interest rates were just above 6 percent, Daiwa estimated, the extra bond yields were already adding as much as 3 billion euros a year in additional interest payments compared with around 4.5 percent, the rate as recently as the summer.
Now those debt costs are rising with every basis point increase in bond yields.
The climbing yields could present a worrying spiral that, before Italy, affected Greece, Ireland and Portugal. When rates for those countries' bonds reached around 7 percent, they suddenly jumped even higher and have still not come down to more sustainable levels.
Italy, the euro zone's third-largest economy after Germany and France, is on a different scale than those much-smaller nations.
Italy is also, in a way, in a healthier situation. Although its debt mountain is large, it is actually running a primary budget surplus, which means that its budget is running a surplus before debt service costs.
According to Mr. Green of TD Securities, this means Italy could survive paying rates close to 7 percent for some time -- but not forever. Eventually, the higher rates would worsen economic growth, and as the economy contracted, a wider and wider deficit would begin to open up.
Before Italy is forced to seek assistance from the European Union or the International Monetary Fund, economists say, the rising rates will force the European Central Bank to increase its purchases of Italian debt in secondary markets, which began in August.
Because the central bank bond purchases have failed to keep Italian interest rates down, economists expect that the bank will soon have to act much more aggressively.
Mr. Green said the design of the bailout package announced last month might, in fact, have encouraged investors to sell Italian bonds. The new fund may only protect holders of newly issued Italian bonds, which reduces investors' incentives to hold existing securities.
The deal to allow Greece to write off 50 percent of its debts to private investors without setting off credit default insurance protection has also left many investors feeling vulnerable, encouraging them to sell now.

HEADLINE: Gilded Blinders to the Reality of a Collapse

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Our mayor encompasses multitudes.
Michael R. Bloomberg can be subtle and passionate on government's role in promoting health and building subways and parks. And just as quickly, he can speak in the nuance-free voice of a Wall Street booster. He gave us the rhetorical Janus face at a panel discussion last week with former Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins.
Asked about the passions that fire the Occupy Wall Street crowds, Mr. Bloomberg gave an oh-puhleeze purse of his lips. Some complaints, he said, are ''totally unfounded.'' 
''It was not the banks that created the mortgage crisis,'' he said. ''It was, plain and simple, Congress, who forced everybody to go and give mortgages to people who were on the cusp.''
Few of us can easily transcend our class and cultural context. But as a city and a nation are riveted by the 99 percent, Mr. Bloomberg often sounds like a man trapped in his 1 percent golden roost. His narrative of Congressional guilt is beloved by national Republicans. In their telling, Congress, HUD and Fannie Mae -- those brutes! -- pushed financiers to make billions of dollars in profits selling calamitous mortgages to people who plainly could not afford them.
It sounds bracingly counterintuitive. But much evidence, not least a stack of Federal Reserve studies, suggests this is a fairy tale. Fannie Mae leaders indulged impulses toward greed and abuse of power. They just didn't cause the financial collapse.
Economists at the Federal Reserve recently posed the question, ''The Subprime Crisis: Is Government Housing Policy to Blame?'' They sifted the arguments and concluded: ''We find little evidence'' that government policy ''played a significant role in the subprime crisis.''
Elizabeth A. Duke, nominated to the board of the Federal Reserve by President George W. Bush, was no less adamant. Such claims, she said, ''are not supported by the facts.''
Evidence shows banks that complied with federal mandates to lend in underserved communities ''experienced lower delinquency rates and less risky lending.'' (The mayor was wrong when he said Fannie Mae gave out loans; Fannie Mae buys loans from banks).
Closer to home, the mayor's housing programs -- which are without peer in their scope -- offer an empirical test. In southeast Queens, a foreclosure cyclone left homes vacant and family finances fractured.
Only one class of single-family home stood sheltered. For the thousands of properties that were carefully evaluated and underwritten by federal, state and city officials -- together with dozens of nonprofit groups -- the foreclosure rate is minuscule.
The mayor suggests fault-finders should give blaming banks a rest. ''It's fun and it's cathartic,'' he said. ''I don't know, it's entertaining to go and blame people.''
This was too much for Mayor Koch, whose voice keened last week, ''Catharsis is good,'' adding, ''I have enormous anger.''
Mr. Koch noted that Citicorp and Goldman Sachs made billions upon billions of dollars misleading investors, and paid fines only in the hundreds of millions.
Mr. Bloomberg did not take up this argument -- a shame, since it would have been interesting to hear him on the topic. Then again, protest and anger never were his bag. He sidestepped that in the 1960s. And he has opined that the Occupy Wall Street protesters should make a difference by opening a business.
And yet.
The mayor hints that he's more than his self-caricature. When, earlier in the panel discussion, Mr. Bloomberg spoke of what made New York great, he found a prosaic poetry.
He spoke of 750 bridges repaired and vast investments in a new water tunnel, new parks that line the Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan waterfronts, an extension of the No. 7 subway line and a planned high-tech campus in the city. His health crusades, derided as ''nanny statism,'' have given New Yorkers more time to enjoy -- and complain about -- their city.
''If adding a year and a half to people's lives isn't an accomplishment,'' he said, ''I don't know what is.''
Here he calls to mind Felix G. Rohatyn, an enlightened raptor capitalist who helped rescue the city in the darkest days of the 1970s fiscal crisis. Mr. Rohatyn could be remarkably unsentimental in his day job, in which he found and helped devour weak companies.
Mr. Rohatyn also became a spokesman for urban America, and a social democratic vision in which government sows the seed corn of economic revival.
Talk of political philosophy tends to draw a wrinkled nose from this mayor. He's transactional, placing bets on horses Democratic and Republican.
But in his refusal to look carefully at the detritus of the past five years and hone his philosophy of government, he can end up sounding strangled and disengaged when he could be full-throated.

HEADLINE: Staring Into the Budget's Abyss

 BODY:
Republicans, looking for leverage to slash federal spending, created the phony debit-ceiling crisis that led to creation of the Congressional deficit-cutting ''supercommittee.'' But with the committee close to a deadlock -- largely because Republicans will not agree to higher taxes on the rich -- and the deadline for an agreement approaching, some Republicans are now talking about undoing the process. 
We are no fans of the supercommittee. It is undemocratic, and the deep, automatic cuts the law would impose if the committee fails to reach agreement are gimmicky and potentially dangerous. But walking away at this point would be an embarrassment for Congress and a far-reaching blow to Washington's financial credibility.
The committee of 12, divided between the two parties, was required by the Budget Control Act to come up with a plan to shrink the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion over the next decade through any combination of spending cuts and revenue increases. If the members fail to agree, the law would automatically ''sequester'' $1.2 trillion in spending cuts -- heavily affecting defense programs.
Democrats have proposed a $4 trillion mix of cuts and tax increases, carving too deeply from domestic programs. But Republicans have rejected any tax increases, and Democrats are rightly refusing to agree to any package without revenues.
If the committee fails, Representative K. Michael Conaway, a Texas Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, told The Times, ''most of us will move heaven and earth to find an alternative that prevents a sequester from happening.'' Several Republicans are talking about finding cuts elsewhere in the budget, and that surely means social-insurance programs. Democrats, including President Obama, would probably block any law that undoes the budget act, but even talking about doing so reduces the pressure on the panel to reach agreement.
The committee should be working overtime to avoid a sequester, which would cut virtually every discretionary program at the Pentagon and the Homeland Security Department by 10 percent in 2013. (Cuts in the following nine years would be made by Congress but would still be 10 percent.) Medicare providers would be cut by 2 percent, and there would be major reductions in other domestic programs, including several necessary for health reform.
But as bad as the sequester would be, it would spare most social-insurance programs, making it better than the proposals by supercommittee Republicans to cut more than $2 trillion without raising any revenues. Those would largely spare the Pentagon but make deep cuts in programs that benefit the needy.
Simply dismissing the committee and undoing the sequester would be such a vast admission of Congressional failure that it could push down the nation's credit rating, lead to chaos in financial markets and severely cripple hopes for an economic recovery. Republicans created the policies that forced up the deficit and then refused to compromise with President Obama. They cannot simply walk away now. Panel members have only a few days to come up with a plan that balances new revenues with spending cuts. That is the only way to wrestle down the deficit without doing huge damage to the economy and the country.

HEADLINE: End Bonuses for Bankers

BYLINE: By NASSIM NICHOLAS TALEB. 
Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a professor of risk engineering at New York University Polytechnic Institute, is the author of ''The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable.'' He is a hedge fund investor and a former Wall Street trader.

 BODY:
I HAVE a solution for the problem of bankers who take risks that threaten the general public: Eliminate bonuses.
More than three years since the global financial crisis started, financial institutions are still blowing themselves up. The latest, MF Global, filed for bankruptcy protection last week after its chief executive, Jon S. Corzine, made risky investments in European bonds. So far, lenders and shareholders have been paying the price, not taxpayers. But it is only a matter of time before private risk-taking leads to another giant bailout like the ones the United States was forced to provide in 2008.
The promise of ''no more bailouts,'' enshrined in last year's Wall Street reform law, is just that -- a promise. The financiers (and their lawyers) will always stay one step ahead of the regulators. No one really knows what will happen the next time a giant bank goes bust because of its misunderstanding of risk. 
Instead, it's time for a fundamental reform: Any person who works for a company that, regardless of its current financial health, would require a taxpayer-financed bailout if it failed, should not get a bonus, ever. In fact, all pay at systemically important financial institutions -- big banks, but also some insurance companies and even huge hedge funds -- should be strictly regulated.
Critics like the Occupy Wall Street demonstrators decry the bonus system for its lack of fairness and its contribution to widening inequality. But the greater problem is that it provides an incentive to take risks. The asymmetric nature of the bonus (an incentive for success without a corresponding disincentive for failure) causes hidden risks to accumulate in the financial system and become a catalyst for disaster. This violates the fundamental rules of capitalism; Adam Smith himself was wary of the effect of limiting liability, a bedrock principle of the modern corporation.
Bonuses are particularly dangerous because they invite bankers to game the system by hiding the risks of rare and hard-to-predict but consequential blow-ups, which I have called ''black swan'' events. The meltdown in the United States subprime mortgage market, which set off the global financial crisis, is only the latest example of such disasters.
Consider that we trust military and homeland security personnel with our lives, yet we don't give them lavish bonuses. They get promotions and the honor of a job well done if they succeed, and the severe disincentive of shame if they fail. For bankers, it is the opposite: a bonus if they make short-term profits and a bailout if they go bust. The question of talent is a red herring: Having worked with both groups, I can tell you that military and security people are not only more careful about safety, but also have far greater technical skill, than bankers.
The ancients were fully aware of this upside-without-downside asymmetry, and they built simple rules in response. Nearly 4,000 years ago, Hammurabi's code specified this: ''If a builder builds a house for a man and does not make its construction firm, and the house which he has built collapses and causes the death of the owner of the house, that builder shall be put to death.''
This was simply the best risk-management rule ever. The Babylonians understood that the builder will always know more about the risks than the client, and can hide fragilities and improve his profitability by cutting corners -- in, say, the foundation. The builder can also fool the inspector; the person hiding risk has a large informational advantage over the one who has to find it.
Banning bonuses addresses the principal-agent problem in economics: the separation between an agent's interests and those of the client, or principal, he is supposed to represent. The potency of my solution lies in the idea that people do not consciously wish to harm themselves; I feel much safer on a plane because the pilot, and not a drone, is at the controls. Similarly, cooks should taste their own cooking; engineers should stand under the bridges they have designed when the bridges are tested; the captain should be the last to leave the ship. The Romans even figured out how to deter cowardice that causes the death of others with the technique called decimation: If a legion lost a battle and there was suspicion of cowardice, 10 percent of the soldiers and commanders -- usually chosen at random -- were put to death.
No such pain faces bailed-out, bonus-taking bankers. The period from 2000 to 2008 saw a very large accumulation of hidden exposures in the financial system. And yet the year 2010 brought the largest bank compensation in history. It has become clear that merely ''clawing back'' past bonuses after the fact is not enough. Supervision, regulation and other forms of monitoring are necessary, but insufficient -- consider that the Federal Reserve insisted, as late as 2007, that the rapidly escalating subprime mortgage crisis was likely to be ''contained.''
What would banking look like if bonuses were eliminated? It would not be too different from what it was like when I was a bank intern in the 1980s, before the wave of deregulation that culminated in the 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that had separated investment and commercial banking. Before then, bankers and lenders were boring ''lifers.'' Banking was bland and predictable; the chairman's income was less than that of today's junior trader. Investment banks, which paid bonuses and weren't allowed to lend, were partnerships with skin in the game, not gamblers playing with other people's money.
Hedge funds, which are loosely regulated, could take on some of the risks that banks would shed under my proposal. While we tend to hear about the successful ones, the great majority fail and their failures rarely make the front page. The principal-agent problem they have isn't a problem for taxpayers: Typically their investors manage the governance of hedge funds by ensuring that the manager is hurt more than any of his investors in the event of a blowup.
I believe that ''less is more'' -- simple heuristics are necessary for complex problems. So instead of thousands of pages of regulation, we should enforce a basic principle: Bonuses and bailouts should never mix.

HEADLINE: Promises Made, and Remade, By Firms in S.E.C. Fraud Cases

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Citigroup agreed last month to pay $285 million to settle civil charges that it had defrauded customers during the housing bubble, the Securities and Exchange Commission wrested a typical pledge from the company: Citigroup would never violate one of the main antifraud provisions of the nation's securities laws.
To an outsider, the vow may seem unusual. Citigroup, after all, was merely promising not to do something that the law already forbids. But that is the way the commission usually does business. It also was not the first time the firm was making that promise.
Citigroup's main brokerage subsidiary, its predecessors or its parent company agreed not to violate the very same antifraud statute in July 2010. And in May 2006. Also as far as back as March 2005 and April 2000. 
Citigroup has a lot of company in this regard on Wall Street. According to a New York Times analysis, nearly all of the biggest financial companies -- Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America among them -- have settled fraud cases by promising that they would never again violate an antifraud law, only to have the S.E.C. conclude they did it again a few years later.
A Times analysis of enforcement actions during the past 15 years found at least 51 cases in which the S.E.C. concluded that Wall Street firms had broken anti-fraud laws they had agreed never to breach. The 51 cases spanned 19 different firms.
On Wednesday, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, an S.E.C. critic, is scheduled to review the Citigroup settlement. Judge Rakoff has asked the agency what it does to ensure companies do not repeat the same offense, and whether it has ever brought contempt charges for chronic violators. The S.E.C. said in a court filing Monday that it had not brought any contempt charges against large financial firms in the last 10 years.
Since the financial crisis, the S.E.C. has been criticized for missing warning signs that could have softened the blow. The pattern of repeated accusations of securities law violations adds another layer of concerns about enforcing the law. Not only does the S.E.C. fail to catch many instances of wrongdoing, which may be unavoidable, given its resources, but when it is on the case, financial firms often pay a relatively small price.
Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations and has led several inquiries into Wall Street, said the S.E.C.'s method of settling fraud cases, is ''a symbol of weak enforcement. It doesn't do much in the way of deterrence, and it doesn't do much in the way of punishment, I don't think.''
Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, said, ''You can look at the record and see that it clearly suggests this is not deterring repeat offenses. You have to at least raise the question if other alternatives might be more effective.''
S.E.C. officials say they allow these kinds of settlements because it is far less costly than taking deep-pocketed Wall Street firms to court and risking losing the case. By law, the commission can bring only civil cases. It has to turn to the Justice Department for criminal prosecutions.
Robert Khuzami, the S.E.C.'s enforcement director, said never-do-it again promises were a deterrent especially when there were repeated problems. In their private discussions, commissioners weigh a firm's history with the S.E.C. before they settle on the amount of fines and penalties. ''It's a thumb on the scale,'' Mr. Khuzami said. ''No one here is disregarding the fact that there were prior violations or prior misconduct,'' he said.
But prior violations are plentiful. For example, Bank of America's securities unit has agreed four times since 2005 not to violate a major antifraud statute, and another four times not to violate a separate law. Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America acquired in 2008, has separately agreed not to violate the same two statutes seven times since 1999.
Of the 19 companies that the Times found by the S.E.C. to be repeat offenders over the last 15 years, 16 declined to comment. They read like a Wall Street who's who: American International Group, Ameriprise, Bank of America, Bear Stearns, Columbia Management, Deutsche Asset Management, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Putnam Investments, Raymond James, RBC Dain Rauscher, UBS and Wells Fargo/Wachovia.
Two others, Franklin Advisers and Massachusetts Financial, said that their two settlements were made simultaneously and therefore one incident did not violate a previous cease-and-desist order.
A spokesman for Citigroup said ''there is no basis for any assertion that Citi has violated the terms'' of any settlement.
But some experts view many settlements as essentially meaningless, particularly since they usually do not require a company to admit to the accusations leveled by the S.E.C. Nearly every settlement allows a company to ''neither admit nor deny'' the accusations -- even when the company has admitted to the same charges in a related case brought by the Justice Department -- so that they are less vulnerable to investor lawsuits.
In 2005, Bank of America was one of several companies singled out for allowing professional traders to buy or sell a mutual fund at the previous day's closing price, when it was clear the next day that the overall market or particular stocks were going to move either up or down sharply, guaranteeing a big short-term gain or avoiding a significant loss.
In its settlement, Bank of America neither admitted nor denied the conduct, but agreed to pay a $125 million fine and to put $250 million into a fund to repay investors. The company also agreed never to violate the major antifraud statutes.
Two years later, in 2007, Bank of America was accused by the S.E.C. of fraud by using its supposedly independent research analysts to bolster its investment banking activities from 1999 to 2001. In the settlement, Bank of America without admitting or denying its guilt, paid a $16 million fine and promised, once again, not to violate the law.
But two years later, in 2009, the S.E.C. again accused Bank of America of defrauding investors, saying that in 2007-8, the bank sold $4.5 billion of highly risky auction-rate securities by promising buyers that they were as safe as money market funds. They weren't, and this time Bank of America agreed to be ''permanently enjoined'' from violating the same section of the law it had previously agreed not to break.
In fact, the company had already violated that promise, according to the S.E.C when it was accused last year of rigging bids in the municipal securities market from 1998 through 2002. To settle the charges, Bank of America paid no penalty, but refunded investors $25 million in profits plus $11 million in interest. And, the bank promised again never to violate the same law.
The S.E.C. led the bank settle without admitting or denying the charges, even though Bank of America had simultaneously settled a case with the Justice Department's antitrust division admitting the same conduct.
Companies routinely argue that while they may be settling multiple violations of the same law, the facts of each case are different -- and therefore not exactly a repeat offense.
But Jayne Barnard, a law professor at the William & Mary Law School who has studied repeat securities fraud violators, said ''it stretches the truth'' to claim that a company's multiple violations of the same law ''are just a freakish coincidence.''
The S.E.C. can target repeat violations. It could bring civil contempt charges against a company for violating one of orders, but it rarely does. The S.E.C. does not publicly refer to previous cases when filing new charges.
Mr. Khuzami, the agency enforcement chief, said it prefers to use its resources to bring charges of new violations against a company rather than to pursue contempt charges in court.
''If you've got a company that settles a case involving its research analysts one year, and several years later it is accused of fraud in selling a C.D.O. to customers, those are very different parts of a company,'' Mr. Khuzami said, referring to collateralized debt obligations, a form of derivative that contributed to the housing bubble.
Donna M. Nagy, a professor at the Indiana University law school and an author of a widely used textbook on securities law enforcement, said that by ignoring previous accusations of violations, the S.E.C. was minimizing the value of its actions.
Edward Skyler, a spokesman for Citigroup, said that the fact that the company entered into a $285 million settlement last month does not mean that it had violated the terms of any previous settlement. ''Like all other major financial institutions, Citi has entered into various settlements with the S.E.C. over the years and there is no basis for any assertion that Citi has violated the terms of any of those settlements,'' he said.
Mr. Levin, the Michigan senator, said he believed that the S.E.C.'s settlements were the problem. ''It's like a cop giving out warnings instead of giving tickets,'' he said. ''It's a green light to operate the same way without a lot of fear that the boom is going to be lowered on you.''

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Repeat Violations, Repeat Promises: Many big Wall Street firms have settled fraud cases brought by the government with a promise to never violate the same law. But an analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission documents by The New York Times found that since 1996, there have been at least 51 repeat violations by those firms. Bank of America and Citigroup have each had six repeat violations, while Merrill Lynch and UBS have each had five. (A3)

HEADLINE: Feeling the Pinch

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and MICHAEL WINES; Keith Bradsher reported from Guangzhou and Michael Wines from Beijing.

 BODY:
GUANGZHOU, China -- David Huan had big dreams for his business, a factory in central China that makes picture frames ranging from glossy wood to the gilded and baroque. He wanted to expand production, and add new equipment and 400 to 600 workers atop the 400 he already employed.
The demand was there last spring, he said on a recent afternoon. But his bankers weren't. They balked at lending him money to buy equipment -- and today his export-oriented business is about where it was six months ago.
''I feel like I'm walking in place,'' he said. 
He has lots of company. While many businesses in the United States struggle to stay afloat and workers collect unemployment checks, China has the opposite problem: an economy, pumped up by expansive lending by state-controlled banks, which is growing too fast to keep inflation and speculation in check.
Beijing's solution: Create an artificial shortage of credit. The central government has set stringent though undisclosed limits on how much money each bank can lend, clamped down on real estate speculation by limiting the number of mortgages allowed for each citizen and begun cracking down on many forms of semilegal and illegal lending. After months of steady tightening, the controls have finally begun to bite into inflation, business growth, real estate prices and lending.
Lending by Chinese banks jumped 32.5 percent in 2009 in inflation-adjusted terms. That growth slowed to 13.3 percent in 2010 and 7.3 percent in the first nine months of this year. Lending to small businesses has grown slightly faster. But there are so many small businesses and they are expanding so quickly that competition for these loans is especially fierce and difficult, said Nicholas R. Lardy, an economist at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
The policy makers' principal goal is to tamp down inflation, which has played a repeated role in causing social unrest, including during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Despite a goal of limiting inflation to no more than 4 percent a year, prices have stubbornly remained about 6 percent higher this autumn than a year ago for consumers based on official gauges -- and up to twice that by the estimate of many private economists.
The worst of the credit squeeze this year has compelled at least a few business people to flee the country or even commit suicide. They did so after borrowing money at usurious rates of up to 5 percent a month -- an 80 percent annual rate -- from loan sharks or neighborhood lending pools and then finding that their speculative investments with the money did not pay off.
But the credit squeeze is far broader. In more than a dozen recent interviews at the Canton Fair here, the country's largest export trade fair, every business owner or sales manager described increasing difficulties in borrowing money -- as well as strategies that banks and borrowers alike are using to cushion the effect of the new lending restrictions.
Some banks are requiring lenders to personally guarantee corporate loans and put up considerably more land and factory equipment as collateral. Others lend money only if borrowers agree to redeposit up to half of the loan in the same bank at a much lower interest rate. The practical effect is that the borrower pays a much higher interest rate than the official, heavily regulated interest rate for loans, usually 7 or 8 percent.
''If the bank lends you one million, they ask for 500,000 back as a deposit,'' said Elaine Yan, the import and export manager at the Wuxi Zontai International Corporation, a trading company specializing in brightly colored shower curtains and bath mats. The company has decided not to borrow money at all, meeting its modest financing needs through retained profits.
Daunted by such terms, Helen Huang, the owner of a company producing chrome-plated paperweights, turned to a neighborhood lending pool last year. The $3.1 million she borrowed helped finance a $7.9 million land purchase so her company, the Shijiazhuang Harmony Import and Export Company, could build a factory.
The lending pool, run by friends, charged only 7 percent a year, she said -- similar to what a bank loan would have been, but without onerous paperwork or redeposit requirements. The friends were seeking to earn more than the meager, regulated interest paid on bank deposits, currently 3.5 percent for a one-year certificate of deposit -- a rate so low that, with 6 percent inflation, bank deposits actually lose buying power.
China has a long tradition of such family-and-friend lending pools, which finance many entrepreneurial businesses whose creditworthiness may be hard for banks to assess. The legality of these pools is murky and depends partly on the extent to which they rely on new deposits to help pay interest to earlier investors.
With banks restricted from lending, businesses are taking different tacks to raise money. Some ask customers to make larger deposits when they place orders, for example, so that the factories can use the cash to pay for raw materials.
''I do try to ask for more deposits upfront, but customers are resistant,'' said Ms. Huang, the paperweight maker.
The government's tight grip on lending is producing results: Consumer inflation is slowly subsiding by official measures, to 6.1 percent in September from a peak of 6.5 percent in July. But in its place, one new concern is whether state planners have tightened too much.
Beyond slowing factory expansions, the lending curbs have hit real estate developers particularly hard, said Stephen Green, the chief China analyst for Standard Chartered Bank. Many speculators, betting on ever-rising land prices, have parked their money in newly built offices or apartments that are largely vacant.
With credit scarce, some are unable to roll over the loans used to build the developments. While well-financed developers are barely cutting prices, weaker developers have begun quietly discounting new apartments by up to 30 percent in the last month; the latest official figures for changes in real estate prices were not yet available. Others may be forced to sell or rent property at a deep discount, winding up underwater, like some American homeowners.
Cooling off land speculation was a major goal of the government's tightening, Mr. Green said. But if the credit tightening isn't carefully calibrated, he added, it could hit both developers and the economy too hard.
''I think generally the economy is showing signs of sand in the wheels -- it's beginning to slow things down,'' he said of the tightening measures. ''If it turns out to be a macro problem, that's one of the things that will cause the government to loosen policy sooner.''
And in fact, there are hints of just that. The State Council, China's cabinet, said in late October that it would experiment with lowering the value-added tax, which is typically 17 percent, at least for service businesses, potentially putting more money into circulation. Premier Wen Jiabao also signaled some relaxation, saying late last month that planners would eventually ''fine-tune'' policies to ensure adequate growth in credit and the money supply.
While many business people are dismayed by the scant availability of credit, they are also painfully aware of inflation. Rapid economic growth has exposed shortages, particularly labor shortages, and sent prices soaring.
Ms. Huang, the paperweight maker, said that pay for skilled workers who can operate chrome-plating equipment had doubled just in the last year, to $630 a month. Even with that increase, she has so much trouble finding workers that orders received last month will not be filled until March, she said.
Demand is surging even for unskilled workers in interior provinces far from the prosperous coast. Mr. Huan said that competition for labor from other businesses had forced his company, Tennon Frame in Luoyang, a city in inland Henan Province, to raise wages this year to $150 a month before overtime and benefits, compared with $95 a month early last year.
''It's crazy -- China is going crazy,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Its Leader on the Sidelines, Regulator Faces Biggest Test

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and AZAM AHMED; Michael J. de la Merced and Susanne Craig contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A few days before MF Global's collapse, regulators stationed at the firm were assured its books were in order.
Their boss, Gary Gensler, was not convinced. A former Goldman Sachs partner who once passed the test for certified public accountants, he bore into the numbers himself and grew uneasy with the firm's finances.
''Keep pressing them,'' he told his regulators, according to people with direct knowledge of the conversation.
Within days, his suspicions were confirmed. More than $600 million in customer money was missing from MF Global, prompting an investigation by Mr. Gensler's Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
As the regulator intensifies its inquiry into MF Global and the firm's former leader, Jon S. Corzine, the agency must do without its hard-charging chairman. Last week, Mr. Gensler stepped away from the investigation amid questions over his relationship to Mr. Corzine, his former boss at Goldman Sachs and a fellow Democrat.
Now, the worry is that the commission will stumble in its rare turn on center stage without its star leading the way.
Mr. Gensler's withdrawal from the investigation came despite apparently only loose ties to Mr. Corzine. The men have seen each other just a handful of times since Mr. Gensler left Goldman Sachs in 1997. Mr. Gensler did not attend Mr. Corzine's 2010 wedding. And Mr. Corzine did not attend the funeral of Mr. Gensler's wife, a noted artist who died of breast cancer in 2006.
Mr. Gensler's recusal puts the C.F.T.C. at a potential disadvantage as it embarks on its most high-profile investigation since its founding in 1974.
Under Mr. Gensler, the commission had begun to shed a reputation as a toothless watchdog, bringing a record number of enforcement cases while writing new rules to police Wall Street.
At the same time, the agency's budget is under attack on Capitol Hill and it faces questions over its handling of MF Global. Lawyers and MF Global clients have questioned why it is taking so long to recover money that should have never been missing at all.
''There is a huge spotlight on the agency now,'' said Scott Talbott, a lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable, a Wall Street trade group.
Mr. Gensler has been Washington's most aggressive ambassador to Wall Street, introducing sweeping new rules to crack down on excessive risk taking.
Even industry groups acknowledge his influence, though they are not fond of his aggressive tactics. He can be difficult, colleagues said. And his unshakeable faith in regulation has left some fearful the agency will jeopardize Wall Street's anemic recovery and broader economic growth.
''It may be useful for Chairman Gensler in the short run to be viewed as an opponent of the financial industry, but to be successful in the long run, the C.F.T.C. will have to produce workable regulations that do not damage the economy too much,'' said Steven Lofchie, a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. ''The jury is still out on whether the C.F.T.C. can do that.''
Wall Street scourge is an unlikely addition to the resume of Mr. Gensler, a 54-year-old marathon runner and father of three daughters.
Mr. Gensler grew up in Baltimore, the son of working-class parents who never went to college. His father was a cigarette and pinball machine vendor to local Baltimore bars. After graduating from public school, Mr. Gensler attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania for his undergraduate degree and master's in business administration.
He spent 18 years at Goldman Sachs, where he was a star dealmaker in New York and Tokyo before ascending to the position of co-head of finance. After leaving the firm in 1997, a multimillionaire, he joined the Treasury Department under President Bill Clinton. It was then that the agency presided over the broad deregulation of Wall Street, and the very markets Mr. Gensler now monitors.
Citing that past, liberal lawmakers held up Mr. Gensler's 2009 nomination to the C.F.T.C., worried he was too sympathetic to Wall Street's ways.
Those critics were largely silenced after Mr. Gensler took a lead role in helping write the Dodd-Frank Act, the regulatory overhaul passed in the wake of the financial crisis. Mr. Gensler played a major role in writing portions of the law that deal with financial derivatives, the complex contracts at the center of the crisis. That market has exploded in size over the last decade, and is now pegged at $600 trillion.
But his former ties to Goldman and Mr. Corzine came into focus again last week. The two men spent nearly 18 years together at the Wall Street firm. In the early 1990s, Mr. Gensler, who has completed nine marathons, ran the New York City Marathon, borrowing Mr. Corzine's running number when his boss was unable to compete in the race.
Years later, when Mr. Corzine ran for governor of New Jersey, Mr. Gensler supported his campaign with a $10,000 check. An active Democrat who worked for the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, Mr. Gensler has contributed nearly $300,000 to the party since 1990, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Late last year, Mr. Gensler and Mr. Corzine served on a panel on banking at Princeton University.
Fearful that their Goldman connection could be perceived as a conflict, Mr. Gensler stepped away from the investigation after Oct. 31, the day of MF Global's bankruptcy.
The move appeased Republican critics, who were pushing for Mr. Gensler to recuse himself. Still, his supporters say it will free up his time to focus on another pet peeve of conservatives: Dodd-Frank.
In his office, Mr. Gensler keeps an autographed copy of the 2,300-page law. The namesake author of the law, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, even signed a special note to the regulator, saying ''you should derive satisfaction from this,'' a nod to the derivatives industry that Mr. Gensler now watches over.
The C.F.T.C. chairman is also known around the office as an mountain climber. Since he no longer has the time to run marathons, he takes the stairs every day to his ninth-floor office. Colleagues say he has a penchant for walking the halls in socked feet, which he props up on his employees' desks when chatting with them.
Those who work with Mr. Gensler say his attention to detail is exhaustive. He dives into Wall Street minutiae with an aggressive - some say obsessive - fervor. This summer, when finalizing an obscure detail of a new rule, Mr. Gensler missed a dinner party for his sister.
Some say Mr. Gensler can be a tough, at times stubborn, negotiator. On one recent occasion, when at odds with another regulator about a contentious rule, Mr. Gensler wouldn't budge, saying: ''I believe this to my core.'' He co-wrote a book called ''The Great Mutual Fund Trap'' critical of an industry where his twin brother, Robert, works as an executive at T. Rowe Price.
And in an austere environment for government, Mr. Gensler has sought to roughly double the agency's budget and staff.
He has also expanded the agency's regulatory firepower with a number of crucial hires. A top derivatives lawyer, Gary Barnett, was poached from Linklaters, to bolster his Dodd-Frank forces. He also hired David Meister, a former partner at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Meagher & Flom and former federal prosecutor, to revamp the agency's enforcement effort.
The expansion appears to be bearing fruit. The last fiscal year, the agency brought a record 99 enforcement actions, 74 percent more than the previous year. It has also levied record fines of nearly $300 million.
MF Global is the agency's biggest enforcement test yet.
Whether the scandal will burnish or tarnish the reputation of the agency, as well as that of Mr. Gensler, will depend on how quickly authorities can locate the missing money and pinpoint what went wrong.
As MF Global was rushing to save itself through a sale, Mr. Gensler was sounding alarms that customer money could be missing. He called the firm's lawyer, H. Rodgin Cohen, to ask for proof that the firm was separating its money from that of its customers. As a patchwork of regulators descended on the firm, Mr. Gensler served as a clearinghouse for information, firing off e-mail updates for other regulators as well as his own staff, responsibilities typically handled by less senior officials.
At 2:30 a.m. on Oct. 31, Mr. Gensler received a call from his staff still camped out at MF Global's offices: more than $600 million in customer money was missing. He spent the next five hours in his bathrobe on a conference call with fellow regulators.
Amid the chaos that day, Mr. Gensler was also frantically searching his suburban Maryland home for a glove to complete his daughter's cavewoman Halloween costume.
Michael J. de la Merced and Susanne Craig contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Serious One

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
In the Marx Brothers movie that is the Republican presidential race, Mitt Romney is Zeppo. He doesn't spin out one-liners. He's not the rambunctious one. He's just the earnest, good-looking guy who wants to be appreciated.
But Romney continues to run an impressive presidential campaign. Last week, while the Twitterverse was entranced by Herman Cain, Romney delivered his most important speech yet. It was politically astute and substantively bold, a quality you don't automatically associate with the Romney campaign. Romney grasped the toughest issue -- how to reform entitlements to avoid a fiscal catastrophe -- and he sketched out a sophisticated way to address it. 
The speech was built around the theme that government should be simpler, smarter and smaller. First, he established his bona fides. Romney reminded his listeners that when he went to work at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, he inherited a $370 million deficit. He left behind a $100 million surplus that went into an endowment fund.
Then he argued that over the decades government has become bloated and lethargic. In World War II, the Navy commissioned 1,000 ships a year and had 1,000 employees in the purchasing department. Today, Romney said, we commission nine ships a year but have 24,000 employees in the department.
Romney then laid out a measured fiscal strategy, starting with a promise to bring federal spending down to 20 percent of gross domestic product, which is about the precrisis average. He then turned to entitlements.
Over the past several months, Romney has been vague on this subject. The general view among the cognoscenti was that he was being cautious and careerist. Why risk angering voters with plans to cut Social Security and Medicare?
But the fact is that you are not a serious presidential candidate in 2012 unless you have a specific method to reform these programs. Medicare costs are devouring the federal budget. The country can't wait another four years to address this problem.
A few weeks ago, Romney seemed to realize this. He sent out senior policy aides and close advisers to harvest the best entitlement reform ideas from the conservative policy johnnies. The experts were impressed. The Romney campaign operates like a smooth-running White House, with a process to identify the core issues, cull ideas and present options to the candidate.
In his speech, Romney proposed some sensible Social Security reforms: gradually raise the retirement age and slow the growth of benefits for richer retirees. His Medicare plan is more radical because the problems are more fundamental.
Medicare's central problem is that it institutionalizes the fee-for-service payment system, which rewards providers for the quantity of services provided, regardless of quality, outcome or cost. (For a summary of the best conservative thinking on this, read Yuval Levin's essay ''The Medicare Monster'' in the Sept. 26 issue of The Weekly Standard.)
True Medicare reform replaces the fee-for-service system with premium support. Government gives people money, rising slowly over time, to shop around for their own private insurance plans. The system would reward efficiency and quality, not just quantity. Competition between providers would unleash a wave of innovation.
Romney proposed keeping Medicare just as it is for everybody currently in or close to the system. But he would slowly introduce a premium support system, with less-affluent beneficiaries receiving more support than more-affluent ones.
Many reporters claimed that the Romney approach is similar to the Paul Ryan plan. It's actually closer to the plan that Pete Domenici, a former Republican senator, and Alice Rivlin, a former Clinton budget chief, devised. Romney would create a premium support system, but he would also give seniors the option of a government-run insurance plan that works a lot like the current fee-for-service Medicare.
This is politically smart because Democrats cannot legitimately charge that Romney is ''ending Medicare.'' But it is also substantively smart because, while people like me believe that intense competition among private insurers will lead to more innovation and cost reduction, we can't really be sure. The Romney approach sets up a prudent experiment. If real competition works, seniors will migrate toward that. If it doesn't, seniors will stay in Medicare and conservatives will have a lot of rethinking to do.
Romney's plan still has some holes in it (how fast would premium supports grow?), but it exemplifies the sort of big reformist vision that should be at the center of a serious Republican campaign. The U.S. is beset by sclerotic institutions: health care, the tax code and the education system among them. To thrive, these institutions need a burst of creative reinvention. The point, as Levin writes, is not to talk gloom and austerity but to confidently set the stage for an avalanche of innovation.
Romney is running in an atmosphere in which it is extremely difficult to remain serious and substantive. Yet he is doing it. Democrats should not underestimate him.

HEADLINE: Bad Theory, Bad Legislation

 BODY:
The House's campaign to undercut environmental laws has now migrated to the Senate. Rand Paul, a Republican of Kentucky, is expected to offer a resolution this week to block a new federal regulation requiring cuts in soot- and smog-forming gases from power plants east of the Mississippi River. Joe Manchin III, a Democrat of West Virginia, and Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican, are then expected to try to delay all new rules governing power-plant pollution. 
These are bad bills, and Senate leaders should stop them from going forward. Weakening clean-air rules would harm public health. And the fundamental premise, that environmental regulation destroys jobs, is simply wrong.
Earlier this year, the Economic Policy Institute conducted a study of a proposed rule that would require power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other airborne toxics. It said that investment in new controls would actually create 92,000 jobs beyond those that might be lost through plant closings and higher electricity prices. Other studies of clean air laws have come to similar conclusions: These rules are job creators, not killers.
That hasn't stopped Mitt Romney, a Republican presidential candidate, from accusing President Obama of killing jobs by ''vastly expanding'' Washington's regulatory reach. Even moderate Republicans, like Senator Susan Collins of Maine, wrongly blame the ''uncertainty and cost created by new federal regulations'' for unemployment.
Two recent reports also tell a different story. One, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that in the first half of this year federal regulations accounted for less than one-half of 1 percent of large layoffs -- those of 50 people or more. A second study from the Treasury Department found no evidence that federal rules -- or even ''regulatory uncertainty'' -- are having a chilling effect on economic growth. Both studies concluded that a main deterrent to job creation was weak demand.
Mr. Obama should be prepared to veto any of these bills, while his administration moves forward with its commitments to issue a final rule on mercury emissions and a preliminary proposal to regulate greenhouse gases from power plants. The Republicans won't drop their posturing and complaining about regulation, but the White House has the facts on its side.

HEADLINE: Boom For Whom

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Deregulation has been great at the top. 

 BODY:
While I'm talking about inequality and the crisis, I realized recently that there's another channel not usually talked about, via the misperception of success.
Let me start with a puzzle: why did faith in the wonders of financial deregulation persist so long?
After all, if you step back from the record, deregulation began producing disasters from early on. Early deregulatory moves helped bring on the Latin American debt crisis of the early 1980s; Garn-St. Germain produced the savings and loan debacle; freed-up capital flows produced the Asian crisis and LTCM; and now we have the great bust. So why were Very Serious People so convinced that it was a good thing?
Well, the answer from the usual suspects has always been that the era of deregulation was also an era of unprecedented economic growth. A while back I noted how Peter Wallison -- one of the prime movers behind the Big Lie on the causes of the crisis -- claimed that
Indeed, the modern era of rapid economic growth commenced after both Democratic and Republican presidents undertook to lift costly and stultifying New Deal regulations.
Similarly, Eugene Fama asserted that
Beginning in the early 1980s, the developed world and some big players in the developing world experienced a period of extraordinary growth. It's reasonable to argue that in facilitating the flow of world savings to productive uses around the world, financial markets and financial institutions played a big role in this growth.
The point is that these are pure fantasies on the part of the right. The true age of spectacular growth in the United States and other advanced economies was the generation after World War II, with post-Reagan growth nowhere near comparable. So why do these people imagine otherwise?
And the answer, once you think about it, is obvious: growth for whom? There's only one way in which the post-deregulation boom was exceptional, and that's in terms of the growth in incomes at the top of the scale.
Here's a comparison of the postwar boom with the deregulation alleged boom, using real average family income from the Census and real average income for the top 1 percent from Piketty and Saez:
If you're looking at the average, the last generation is a poor shadow of the postwar boom. But if you're talking about the 1 percent, wonderful things have happened.
No wonder then, that Very Serious People -- who, after all, get to be considered Very Serious because the elite likes them -- have retained faith in deregulation despite repeated disasters.

HEADLINE: Oppression Is Not a State's Right

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: In our time, the great fight against racist policies is over immigration reform. 

 BODY:
Stop me if you've heard this one: Elected officials in Southern states barring the schoolhouse door, shaking their fists at the federal government over civil rights, the Constitution and their right to oppress minority groups without Washington's meddling.
In our time, the great fight against racist policies is over immigration reform. Moderate Americans want it - to resolve the problem of tens of millions of illegal immigrants coming to do jobs Americans don't want and do better themselves. Extremists do not want it, and they seem to be willing to do anything to stop it.
Arizona has been one battleground. Now it is Alabama, which has the most outrageous anti-immigration laws in the nation - including the requirement that schools check the immigration status of students and their parents.
The Justice Department has sued Alabama, just as it sued Arizona over its anti-immigrant laws. And after reports of bullying and harassment and of terrified parents keeping their children home from school, Justice asked 39 school superintendents for data on absences and withdrawals.
Alabama's attorney general, Luther Strange, responded with the absurd declaration that Washington had no legal right to do that. Actually it does, under the Civil Rights Act and the Equal Educational Opportunities Act. The Fair Housing Act, the Safe Streets Act, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, also apply to aspects of Alabama's crackdown on Hispanic immigrants.
So Senators Jim DeMint of South Carolina, David Vitter of Louisiana and Jeff Sessions of Alabama decided to avoid all those annoying laws and introduce legislation barring the use of federal money to sue over a state's immigration policies.
Lawrence Downes, who covers immigration for the editorial board, said this is a bitter example of what has happened since federal immigration reform died during the administration of President George W. Bush, who supported reform, by the way. Lawrence said:
In the absence of federal immigration reform, states are going rogue, passing laws designed to terrorize vulnerable populations.
Justice has already sued Arizona, Alabama, and South Caroline, charging that their homegrown immigration schemes, designed to force undocumented immigrants out of state and underground, are an unconstitutional intrusion onto federal turf.
They are that. But to Mr. Vitter, Mr. DeMint and Mr. Sessions, this is none of the federal government's business.
"We're working to stop these politically driven lawsuits by cutting off the ability for the Obama administration to use taxpayers' money to pay for them," Mr. Vitter said in a news release.
It's interesting isn't it? Republican politicians oppose states' rights to provide marriage equality under the law for all Americans and to investigate illegal gun trafficking from other states. But oppress minorities, and they're suddenly all gung ho about states' rights.
The Times editorial board will continue monitoring the situation in Alabama. We wrote about the fight over the schools last Sunday. Coming up, we'll examine the ways the crackdown is harming American citizens, and damaging the state's economy.
No state has the right to violate sacred Constitutional guarantees of equality and due process. Our country settled that issue long ago, the hard way.

HEADLINE: A Fracking Method With Fewer Water Woes?

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Can a water-free fracking method reduce risks associated with gas drilling? 

 BODY:
Here's a quick review of developments related to the fast-expanding extraction of natural gas using hydraulic fracturing, otherwise known as fracking, that point to a route forward amid concerns about everything from earthquakes to water pollution.
As soon as I heard about the 5.6-magnitude earthquake amid a cluster of recent lesser tremors in Oklahoma, I figured the potential relationship of some earthquakes to drilling would emerge. There are hints that some fracking operations in Oklahoma and elsewhere have induced minor earthquakes, although there's no apparent connection between human activities and the bigger Oklahoma quakes in recent days.
The clearest connection between drilling and significant seismic activity is not related to the fracturing of rock to liberate gas. It's from instances where waste fluids -- for example, the water used in fracking -- are injected deep into the earth. In a piece for Oilprice.com, John C.K. Daly reviews the research, dating back many decades, on how deep-injection wells can trigger modest earthquakes.
So if you want to limit deep-well wastewater injection and also the risks of contaminating aquifers or surface water supplies from fracking, what do you do? Take the water out of the fracking process.
At a small scale so far, that future is on display in hundreds of gas projects in Canada and some states where liquefied propane (in gel form) is used to pressurize and fracture shale and then exits the well in gaseous form to be collected for reuse or other purposes.
The process, and the impediments to its wider adoption, are described in detail in "Cutting waste in gas drilling - Pioneering propane technology used to free natural gas from rocks, avoiding the pollution of vast amounts of water." The must-read article is by Brian Nearing of the Albany Times Union and Anthony Brino of Inside Climate News.
Here's a snippet, but I urge you to read the rest: 
Still awaiting a patent in the U.S., the technique has been used about 1,000 times since 2008, mainly in gas wells in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and New Brunswick and a smaller handful of test wells in states that include Texas, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Oklahoma and New Mexico, said GasFrac Chief Technology Officer Robert Lestz.
Like water, propane gel is pumped into deep shale formations a mile or more underground, creating immense pressure that cracks rocks to free trapped natural gas bubbles. Like water, the gel also carries small particles of sand or man-made material-known as proppant-that are forced into cracks to hold them open so the gas can flow out.
Unlike water, the gel does a kind of disappearing act underground. It reverts to vapor due to pressure and heat, then returns to the surface-along with the natural gas-for collection, possible reuse and ultimate resale.
And also unlike water, propane does not carry back to the surface drilling chemicals, ancient seabed salts and underground radioactivity.
"We leave the nasties in the ground, where they belong," said Lestz.
David Burnett, a professor of petroleum engineering at Texas A&M University, one of the nation's premier petroleum engineering schools, said fracking with propane makes sense.
"From a reservoir engineering perspective, there is no reason this would not be effective," said Burnett, who runs the Environmentally Friendly Drilling Systems Program, a project of the university and the Houston Advanced Research Center, a not-for-profit academic and business consortium. Supported by some of the nation's largest energy companies, as well as by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, the drilling program seeks new technologies that develop gas and oil in a safe and environmentally friendly manner... [.]
Will propane-based fracking catch on? It could well be the future in areas where water is scant or pollution concerns are elevated. Already it has become a focus in some communities in upstate New York seeking a reasonable path to both exploiting the energy resource while limiting the impacts. And, not surprisingly, activists opposed to fracking by any means are hardly enthusiastic.
But, as the story by Nearing and Brino makes clear, any such shift for the moment is being held up by questions about higher costs, a lack of published data on effectiveness (mainly because gas companies and their drillers are not quick to share insights in such a competitive arena) and, of course, simple industry inertia.
This is how the world works, for better and worse. Energy needs and economic forces drive innovation, both in using energy more thriftily and finding new sources.
Environmental issues arise. Pressure builds for change. Regulations and rules evolve. Industry resists. Lawsuits and environmental campaigns ensue. Innovations occur.
And the human enterprise, often in herky-jerky fashion, moves forward.

HEADLINE: Outsourcing Is Not (Always) Evil

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: The United States can outsource work without taking jobs from Americans - if it's done carefully, and ethically. 

 BODY:
On Friday, I wrote about two social enterprises - Samasource and Digital Divide Data - that extend computer-based employment to people with modest educations in developing countries. The strategy of harnessing the Internet to bring low-cost data management jobs to remote and impoverished communities has been called "impact sourcing." Some estimate that the market for these services, $4.5 billion today, could rise to $20 billion by 2015, providing jobs to 780,000 people (pdf, p.14).
A number of readers thought the idea had great potential to alleviate poverty in the developing world. David Griesing, from Philadelphia, (29) saw it as a way to allow more people to "work with dignity" while improving their productive capacity. Patrick McNamara, from the Boston Area, Mass. (46), noted that it could be a way to increase global security, as well - since "poverty and income inequalities can lead to violence [and] have a negative impact on our economy and our own 'homeland security.'" Tim Bal, from Belle Mead, N.J. (1), described impact sourcing as "a great innovation" that "would raise millions of the world's poor out of poverty." But he noted that it presents a problem: "It reduces the job demand in developed countries like the United States."
Most readers had the same concern. And some took me to task for supporting an idea that they felt gave corporations a green light to exploit poor people in the developing world. Tombo, from New York State (34), wrote that impact sourcing was another "attempt to put lipstick on the globalization pig" and Luanne DE, from Taos, N.M. (40) commented that "ethical outsourcing" was, itself, an "oxymoron."
At a time when so many Americans are in distress because they can't find work, it may seem that impact outsourcing is the wrong idea to champion. More than 70 percent of Americans believe that outsourcing harms the U.S. economy. Outsourcing is usually characterized as "moving jobs overseas" as if it's necessarily a one-for-one tradeoff. But it's not that simple. Many of the jobs that are handled through impact sourcing could not be justified on economic terms if they had to be handled in the United States. These are labor-intensive tasks that companies, governments, nonprofits or individuals would like to do - but will only do if the costs are not prohibitive. Accurately digitizing large swaths of information falls into this category.
"We're focusing on the lowest rung of outsourcing work that even the big Indian companies don't want any more because it's priced too low for them," explained Leila Janah, the founder of Samasource, a nonprofit organization that currently channels "microwork" - small tasks like entering, cleaning or verifying data - to 1,600 people in Haiti, India, Kenya, Pakistan, Uganda and South Africa. "At higher prices, it simply wouldn't make sense for many businesses to offer most of this work," she said, because they wouldn't be able to make a profit on the output. Now that such microwork can be distributed and managed affordably around the world, it's possible to create jobs that would otherwise have been handled poorly by machines or not handled at all.
"To our knowledge, none of the assignments we've taken were for work previously done in the U.S.," explained Jeremy Hockenstein, the founder of Digital Divide Data, which employs 900 people in Cambodia, Laos and Kenya. He offered an example. "The Harvard Crimson would never have paid $5 million to digitize its archives - but they could afford to pay a few hundred thousand dollars to do it."
I have the same problem. Like most journalists, I record several interviews each week and usually have to transcribe them myself, which takes hours. I would love to hire a locally based professional transcriber to do the work so I could devote more time to research or writing or relaxing with my family - but I can't afford it. The rates are too high for me. However, there are plenty of people around the globe who would be willing, even happy, to do this work at a rate I can manage. If I find a woman in Kenya or India and give her the job, am I hurting the American transcribers I wouldn't have hired?
Of course, if I were a rich, best-selling author it would be a different story. Which is why readers disapproved of the idea when they assumed that impact outsourcing is about big and wealthy corporations taking advantage of poor people when they have other options. NG, from Florida (9), wrote: "I can't help but think that big business will exploit this to make even bigger profits." That could happen - and that's why I focused on two social enterprises that are structured as nonprofits. "No one in our organization can grow personally wealthy," explains Janah. "This ensures we're aligned with our social mission. This is fundamentally different from for-profit outsourcing companies, which have generated seven billionaires in the last two decades."
Although Samasource highlights the marquee companies it has worked with, most of the requests for its services actually come from small businesses, start-ups, nonprofits and educational institutions. "For resource-strapped organizations like these, outsourcing labor is the only option," adds Janah. "They cannot afford to innovate with American labor, both because of the high costs, and because it's extremely complicated to hire someone in America."
One of the mistakes I made in the article was mentioning the amounts that Samasource's workers earn -- at least $5 a day, and often more -- without putting the figure in perspective. Adam, from Philadelphia (17) described this as "paying people peanuts in Third World countries to sell to people in [the] First World." And Shotsie, from Albuquerque, (2), asked "At $5 a day, how are these people going to boost their local economy enough to actually buy local or imported products?"
The amounts have to be considered in the context of people's lives. Rates of malnutrition and child mortality are very high among Samasource's target group, and life expectancy is low. "The people we help earn less than what $3 a day would buy you in the United States (in 2005 dollars), which is pretty shocking," explains Janah. "Our initial target population is living at a level that is hard for most Americans to fathom." Over all, Samasource's workers double their previous incomes. Samasource ensures that its workers are paid above guidelines set by the Fair Wage Guide, which stipulates wage levels that allow workers to support themselves and contribute to their local economies.
According to the World Bank, in 2010 per capita income was $780 per year in Kenya and $760 per year in Cambodia. Even the minimum salary of $5 a day represents more than a 65 percent increase over these averages (assuming five day of work per week for the full year). But many workers earn more. At Adept Technologies, one of Samasource's partners in Kenya, the average monthly earning for a Samasource worker is about $170, according to Diana Gitiba, Adept's co-founder. This figure represents an annualized income of more than $2,000 a year, or roughly 250 percent of Kenya's per-capital income. Graduates of Digital Divide Data's work-study program typically earn 400 percent the national income in their countries, notes Hockenstein.
Even so, nobody is getting rich. "The wages these jobs provide are not enough to get workers into the middle class," explained Hockenstein. "But they are enough to provide for food, shelter and transportation." And they often allow people to pay for schooling for themselves and family members. This is far from peanuts.
The readers who complained about outsourcing seem to hold the view that outsourcing of any form should be discouraged. Again, this response is understandable given the current unemployment crisis. But it's not just Americans who need jobs; people around the world are suffering in poverty. And an earnings increase that would be barely significant in the U.S. context - say, $3 a day - can, in a country like India or Kenya, mean the difference between families eating well, having decent clothing, and being able to send their children, especially daughters, to school.
It's hard to argue against making these opportunities available -- particularly through social enterprises that are mission-driven and offer people work that is a stepping stone to a better life. At the same time, it's necessary to do more to address the opportunity gap in this country - including through "domestic outsourcing." Samasource plans to launch a site in the United States within a year. "We chose to start internationally to demonstrate that the model would work even in very poor regions where there is much less infrastructure than the U.S.," explained Janah.
As the author Robert Wright has argued, we no longer live in a zero-sum world, where one person's, or one country's gain, must be another's loss. It's possible, and indeed necessary, to construct win-win scenarios. The success of a young person in Kenya, Cambodia or India can improve the world we all live in. Diana Gitiba, the co-founder of Adept Technologies in Kenya, put it this way: "Which software do we use? We use American software. What hardware do we use? We use American hardware. We use Dell computers in the office. The more work we get in Kenya, the more we can trade with other countries, and the more everybody can have what they need. At the moment, I'm just happy that the 50 people we work with have a sure meal at their table tonight for dinner. And the more we do that for more people it will be a happier world to live in."

HEADLINE: Outsourcing Is Not (Always) Evil

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: The United States can outsource work without taking jobs from Americans - if it's done carefully, and ethically. 

 BODY:
On Friday, I wrote about two social enterprises - Samasource and Digital Divide Data - that extend computer-based employment to people with modest educations in developing countries. The strategy of harnessing the Internet to bring low-cost data management jobs to remote and impoverished communities has been called "impact sourcing." Some estimate that the market for these services, $4.5 billion today, could rise to $20 billion by 2015, providing jobs to 780,000 people (pdf, p.14).
A number of readers thought the idea had great potential to alleviate poverty in the developing world. David Griesing, from Philadelphia, (29) saw it as a way to allow more people to "work with dignity" while improving their productive capacity. Patrick McNamara, from the Boston Area, Mass. (46), noted that it could be a way to increase global security, as well - since "poverty and income inequalities can lead to violence [and] have a negative impact on our economy and our own 'homeland security.'" Tim Bal, from Belle Mead, N.J. (1), described impact sourcing as "a great innovation" that "would raise millions of the world's poor out of poverty." But he noted that it presents a problem: "It reduces the job demand in developed countries like the United States."
Most readers had the same concern. And some took me to task for supporting an idea that they felt gave corporations a green light to exploit poor people in the developing world. Tombo, from New York State (34), wrote that impact sourcing was another "attempt to put lipstick on the globalization pig" and Luanne DE, from Taos, N.M. (40) commented that "ethical outsourcing" was, itself, an "oxymoron."
At a time when so many Americans are in distress because they can't find work, it may seem that impact outsourcing is the wrong idea to champion. More than 70 percent of Americans believe that outsourcing harms the U.S. economy. Outsourcing is usually characterized as "moving jobs overseas" as if it's necessarily a one-for-one tradeoff. But it's not that simple. Many of the jobs that are handled through impact sourcing could not be justified on economic terms if they had to be handled in the United States. These are labor-intensive tasks that companies, governments, nonprofits or individuals would like to do - but will only do if the costs are not prohibitive. Accurately digitizing large swaths of information falls into this category.
"We're focusing on the lowest rung of outsourcing work that even the big Indian companies don't want any more because it's priced too low for them," explained Leila Janah, the founder of Samasource, a nonprofit organization that currently channels "microwork" - small tasks like entering, cleaning or verifying data - to 1,600 people in Haiti, India, Kenya, Pakistan, Uganda and South Africa. "At higher prices, it simply wouldn't make sense for many businesses to offer most of this work," she said, because they wouldn't be able to make a profit on the output. Now that such microwork can be distributed and managed affordably around the world, it's possible to create jobs that would otherwise have been handled poorly by machines or not handled at all.
"To our knowledge, none of the assignments we've taken were for work previously done in the U.S.," explained Jeremy Hockenstein, the founder of Digital Divide Data, which employs 900 people in Cambodia, Laos and Kenya. He offered an example. "The Harvard Crimson would never have paid $5 million to digitize its archives - but they could afford to pay a few hundred thousand dollars to do it."
I have the same problem. Like most journalists, I record several interviews each week and usually have to transcribe them myself, which takes hours. I would love to hire a locally based professional transcriber to do the work so I could devote more time to research or writing or relaxing with my family - but I can't afford it. The rates are too high for me. However, there are plenty of people around the globe who would be willing, even happy, to do this work at a rate I can manage. If I find a woman in Kenya or India and give her the job, am I hurting the American transcribers I wouldn't have hired?
Of course, if I were a rich, best-selling author it would be a different story. Which is why readers disapproved of the idea when they assumed that impact outsourcing is about big and wealthy corporations taking advantage of poor people when they have other options. NG, from Florida (9), wrote: "I can't help but think that big business will exploit this to make even bigger profits." That could happen - and that's why I focused on two social enterprises that are structured as nonprofits. "No one in our organization can grow personally wealthy," explains Janah.

HEADLINE: For Christmas, J.C. Penney Ads Emphasize Fun and Frugality

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The retailer's Christmas theme, "Who's Your Santa!" will be promoted in many ways, including traditional ads, QR codes, a Facebook game and apps. 

 BODY:
You do not need to know "Who's your daddy," J. C. Penney declares in its Christmas 2011 advertising campaign, as long as you know "Who's your Santa!"
That playful phrase - punctuated with an exclamation point - will be the centerpiece of the ad blitz that Penney is to introduce for the holiday shopping season. Penney plans to describe the details of the campaign on Tuesday.
The campaign is from the Penney creative agency, Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe. It is quite elaborate, with traditional, online, mobile and social elements; among the new media aspects are QR codes, a Facebook game, apps and a presence on Google+.
There are multiple parts to the campaign in addition to conventional pitches to buy gifts.
There will be a "cause marketing" effort, which will help the Salvation Army, and an initiative to encourage shoppers to come out on Black Friday, the dizzy day after Thanksgiving when bargains ostensibly abound.
Penney is among several retailers that have already discussed all or parts of their sales strategies for Christmas 2011. Others include Kohl's, Macy's and Old Navy.
The stakes are high as Penney begins its Christmas campaign, and not only because of the uncertain economy. Penney has new faces in its boardroom, including a new chief executive, and recent sales have been sluggish.
In October, analysts expected an increase of 1 percent from the year before in so-called same-store sales at Penney, that is, sales at stores open more than a year, a standard measure of retail health. Instead, they fell 2.6 percent.
As a result, the Penney Christmas campaign will focus on value in addition to spreading holiday cheer.
For instance, a theme that has been running in regular Penney ads - "We make it affordable. You make it yours." - will be adapted to read, "We make Christmas affordable. You make it yours."
Still, the campaign strives to be cheerful rather than obsessed, like Scrooge, with saving money.
"The upbeat optimism is a value we've put into all our marketing this year," Ruby Anik, senior vice president for brand marketing at Penney in Plano, Tex., said in a phone interview.
"With all the bad news around," she added, "we wanted the element of 'When I go to J.C. Penney, I have a fun time, and the brand makes me feel good.' "
That is also a reason why "Who's your Santa!" is the focus of the Christmas campaign, Ms. Anik said. "When we were talking about it, working with Saatchi, talking to consumers, the thought came up that 'only Santa really knows what I want,' " she added.
That led to this thought, as Ms. Anik expressed it: "With all the great gifts we offer at J.C. Penney, everyone could be a Santa."
Television commercials feature multiple scenes of people passing gifts from one to another as an announcer makes statements like these: "Who's your Santa! Who gives the cozy? Who wraps the warmth, shares the sparkle and doles out the dreams?"
"There's only one who makes it right," the announcer concludes.
These are among other details of the Penney Christmas campaign:

        
There will be QR code gift tags, which Penney is calling Santa Tags, which a buyer of a gift will receive at a Penney store. The buyer can then scan a QR code, record a voice message of up to 60 seconds and affix the tag to the gift. When the recipient of the gift scans the QR code, the voice message will play.
        
The Facebook game will be on the Penney fan page on Facebook, at facebook.com/jcpenney, starting on Nov. 28.
        
Penney will again team up with Salvation Army in support of the organization's Angel Giving Tree online program.

HEADLINE: Société Générale Profit Falls 31% in Third Quarter

BYLINE: DAVID JOLLY


HIGHLIGHT: The French bank said its third-quarter net profit fell by nearly a third from the period a year earlier, weighed down by the cost of writing down its exposure to Greece. 

 BODY:
PARIS -- Societe Generale said on Tuesday that its third-quarter net profit fell by nearly a third, weighed down by the cost of writing down its exposure to Greece. 
The French bank said profit in the three months ended Sept. 30 fell 31 percent, to 622 million euros ($856 million), from the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 4 percent, to 6.5 billion euros, bolstered by a gain booked on a decline in the value of the bank's own debt; excluding that one-time gain, revenue fell 10.6 percent. 
The bank, based in Paris, said it was marking down 333 million euros of its Greek sovereign debt holdings on a pretax basis, equivalent to a 60 percent write-down, bringing its treatment of the holdings closer into line with its global peers. 
Societe Generale also said it had reduced its sovereign risk exposure to Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain to 3.4 billion euros by the end of October. 
Financial institutions across Europe are recognizing losses on their holdings of Greek bonds as it becomes obvious that the country will never pay off its debts in full. On Tuesday, Munich Re, a German insurance group, said it had written down the value of its Greek bonds by 933 million euros this year. 
Munich Re's loss on Greek debt coincided with insurance losses related to the March earthquake and tsunami in Japan and Hurricane Irene in the United States, cutting its profit for the third quarter 62 percent, to 290 million euros. 
BNP Paribas, the largest French bank, announced last week that it was marking down its Greek exposure by 60 percent and reducing its holdings of European sovereign debt, a move that cut its third-quarter profit 72 percent. 
Jon Peace, an analyst with Nomura International in London, noted in a report that most of Societe Generale's reported net profit resulted from the 542 million euros the bank booked on its own debt. Considering that large one-time gain and the bank's need to reduce leverage, he said, "we suspect the market will retain some caution." 
Societe Generale's shares rose 8.8 percent on Tuesday morning in Paris. For the year, the stock is down 53 percent. 
Revenue from its core corporate and investment banking activities dropped almost 37 percent, to 1.2 billion euros, the result of "a challenging environment in the debt markets, with very weak activity in the primary market especially in Europe, and the effects of the European sovereign debt crisis on secondary markets." 
Frederic Oudea, Societe Generale's chief executive, said in the statement that the third-quarter results "demonstrated the group's resilience: the profit-generating capacity of the core businesses is robust." 
He also said there would be "a significant decline" in bonus pay this year. 
Because of the regulatory requirement that banks strengthen their capital buffers, the bank said it would not pay a dividend for 2011. The third-quarter profit and the retaining of the dividend provision helped the bank to increase its core Tier 1 ratio to 9.5 percent on Sept. 30, from 8.5 percent on Dec. 31, 2010. That leaves it with the need to raise another 2.1 billion euros of capital, a sum the bank said it would cover through its own resources by the end of June 2012. 
All the major French banks have said they hope to raise their capital ratios by trimming their balance sheets, rather than by raising additional equity. 
Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
Wall St. Pay Expected to Fall 20% to 30% | Wall Street bonuses are set to fall by an average of 20 to 30 percent this year from a year ago, according to a closely watched compensation survey. It would be the weakest bonus season since the financial crisis and a reflection of the leaner times confronting the industry.
Those who work in trading and investment banking - usually Wall Street's most profitable businesses, although struggling this year - will experience the sharpest drops in pay, said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, the firm that conducted the survey.
And bonuses for top executives including Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase are likely to fall sharply as well, Mr. Johnson said.
The bonus forecast will come as no surprise to many on Wall Street. Trading profits have slumped and new Dodd-Frank regulations have raised the cost of doing business. Even Goldman Sachs, a firm known for its earning power, last month reported its first quarterly loss since the financial crisis.

 BODY:
Wall St. Pay Expected to Fall 20% to 30% | Wall Street bonuses are set to fall by an average of 20 to 30 percent this year from a year ago, according to a closely watched compensation survey. It would be the weakest bonus season since the financial crisis and a reflection of the leaner times confronting the industry.
Those who work in trading and investment banking - usually Wall Street's most profitable businesses, although struggling this year - will experience the sharpest drops in pay, said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, the firm that conducted the survey.
And bonuses for top executives including Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase are likely to fall sharply as well, Mr. Johnson said.
The bonus forecast will come as no surprise to many on Wall Street. Trading profits have slumped and new Dodd-Frank regulations have raised the cost of doing business. Even Goldman Sachs, a firm known for its earning power, last month reported its first quarterly loss since the financial crisis.

HEADLINE: Société Générale Profit Falls 31% in Third Quarter

BYLINE: DAVID JOLLY


HIGHLIGHT: The French bank said its third-quarter net profit fell by nearly a third from the period a year earlier, weighed down by the cost of writing down its exposure to Greece. 

 BODY:
PARIS -- Societe Generale said on Tuesday that its third-quarter net profit fell by nearly a third, weighed down by the cost of writing down its exposure to Greece. 
The French bank said profit in the three months ended Sept. 30 fell 31 percent, to 622 million euros ($856 million), from the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 4 percent, to 6.5 billion euros, bolstered by a gain booked on a decline in the value of the bank's own debt; excluding that one-time gain, revenue fell 10.6 percent. 
The bank, based in Paris, said it was marking down 333 million euros of its Greek sovereign debt holdings on a pretax basis, equivalent to a 60 percent write-down, bringing its treatment of the holdings closer into line with its global peers. 
Societe Generale also said it had reduced its sovereign risk exposure to Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain to 3.4 billion euros by the end of October. 
Financial institutions across Europe are recognizing losses on their holdings of Greek bonds as it becomes obvious that the country will never pay off its debts in full. On Tuesday, Munich Re, a German insurance group, said it had written down the value of its Greek bonds by 933 million euros this year. 
Munich Re's loss on Greek debt coincided with insurance losses related to the March earthquake and tsunami in Japan and Hurricane Irene in the United States, cutting its profit for the third quarter 62 percent, to 290 million euros. 
BNP Paribas, the largest French bank, announced last week that it was marking down its Greek exposure by 60 percent and reducing its holdings of European sovereign debt, a move that cut its third-quarter profit 72 percent. 
Jon Peace, an analyst with Nomura International in London, noted in a report that most of Societe Generale's reported net profit resulted from the 542 million euros the bank booked on its own debt. Considering that large one-time gain and the bank's need to reduce leverage, he said, "we suspect the market will retain some caution." 
Societe Generale's shares rose 8.8 percent on Tuesday morning in Paris. For the year, the stock is down 53 percent. 
Revenue from its core corporate and investment banking activities dropped almost 37 percent, to 1.2 billion euros, the result of "a challenging environment in the debt markets, with very weak activity in the primary market especially in Europe, and the effects of the European sovereign debt crisis on secondary markets." 
Frederic Oudea, Societe Generale's chief executive, said in the statement that the third-quarter results "demonstrated the group's resilience: the profit-generating capacity of the core businesses is robust." 
He also said there would be "a significant decline" in bonus pay this year. 
Because of the regulatory requirement that banks strengthen their capital buffers, the bank said it would not pay a dividend for 2011. The third-quarter profit and the retaining of the dividend provision helped the bank to increase its core Tier 1 ratio to 9.5 percent on Sept. 30, from 8.5 percent on Dec. 31, 2010. That leaves it with the need to raise another 2.1 billion euros of capital, a sum the bank said it would cover through its own resources by the end of June 2012. 
All the major French banks have said they hope to raise their capital ratios by trimming their balance sheets, rather than by raising additional equity. 
Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

HEADLINE: Can the Fed Stimulate Growth or Only Inflation?

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: With the risk of inflation as low as it's been in a half century, the Federal Reserve must do whatever it can to stimulate job growth, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Many economists, myself included, believe that a more aggressive Federal Reserve policy is needed to turn the economy around. Additional fiscal stimulus would also help. As the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Ben Bernanke put it at a Nov. 2 news conference, "It would be helpful if we could get assistance from some other parts of the government to work with us to create jobs."
However, such assistance will not be coming. President Obama's jobs package has been blocked by Republicans in Congress, and the order of the day is fiscal tightening, with the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction poised to offer recommendations for $1.5 trillion in additional deficit reduction by Nov. 23.
With fiscal stimulus off the table, monetary stimulus is all that is available. But the Republican view is that monetary policy is incapable of stimulating real growth - that it will stimulate only inflation. This view is regularly enforced by The Wall Street Journal editorial page, which establishes the ideological line for Republicans on Fed policy.

In an editorial on Feb. 29, 2008, The Journal said it was certain that higher inflation was on the way, calling it the "Bernanke reinflation." An editorial on June 9, 2008, warned that easy money and Keynesian stimulus "is taking us down the road to stagflation." On Feb. 6, 2009, the Journal editorial writer George Melloan said the inevitable result of economic stimulus would be inflation. On June 10, 2009, the economist Arthur Laffer wrote on the Journal editorial page that the increase in the Fed's monetary base was "a surefire recipe for inflation and higher interest rates."
Echoing the party line, Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, in a New York Times op-ed article on Feb. 14, 2009, said it was a virtual certainty that 1970s-style stagflation was coming back. In The New York Times on May 4, 2009, the conservative economist Allan Meltzer wrote that enormous budget deficits, rapid growth in the money supply and a sustained currency devaluation were "harbingers of inflation."
More than two years later, none of those predictions has come to pass. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, inflationary expectations have been falling for years and continue to fall. Indeed, recent reports from Reuters and CNNMoney found that deflation - falling prices - is a growing problem.
Although the anticipated inflation rate is falling and the "risk premium" - the difference between a bond that doesn't adjust for inflation and one that does, in the same maturity - has scarcely changed, conservatives continue to warn that inflation is right around the corner, especially if the Fed were to adopt a new operating procedure called nominal gross domestic product targeting. 
This is an idea supported by Christina Romer of the University of California, Berkeley, economists at Goldman Sachs and others. The idea is to permit a period of catch-up inflation to get nominal G.D.P. back to its prerecession trend, which would increase incomes, employment and household balance sheets.
But conservatives want nothing to do with N.G.D.P. targeting. Amity Shlaes, a columnist with Bloomberg News and a former Wall Street Journal editorial writer, denounced the idea in a Nov. 2 column, calling it "a license to inflate."
Her view is that if a recession causes growth to fall, unemployment to rise and home prices to crash, people should just suck it up and learn to live with it. Allowing prices to rise from wherever they are, even if there has been a deflation that caused them to fall, opens the door to stagflation and even hyperinflation. It's a risk too great to take. The risk of continuing the status quo is, apparently, nothing to be concerned about.
It's tiresome to read such rationalizations for doing nothing about the second-greatest economic crisis in our history, especially from someone like Ms. Shlaes, who is well versed in the history of the Great Depression.
Then, too, there were those just like her, like Henry Hazlitt, an editorial writer for The New York Times, and Benjamin M. Anderson, an economist with Chase National Bank, who also said people should just suck it up, that unemployment was only caused by excessive wages and greedy workers and that inflation was a cure worse than the disease, even as the price level fell 25 percent from 1929 to 1933.
With fiscal stimulus off the table and Republicans gambling that continued economic stagnation will hurt Democrats more than them, the Federal Reserve is the only institution with the freedom of action and power to stimulate growth. But it is constrained by conservatives who charge that it is fostering inflation whenever it tries to provide monetary stimulus.
The fact that conservatives have consistently been wrong about this for the last three years has done nothing to diminish their confidence. They are like the French Bourbons, who learned nothing and forgot nothing.
Of course, no one wants to go back to the 1970s, when we had both rising inflation and rising unemployment. But the risk of inflation is now as low as it's been since the 1950s, while slow growth and high unemployment impose a crushing burden on a huge portion of the population. If the Fed believes it can help, it has a responsibility to do so.

HEADLINE: The G.O.P. Campaign Goes On Unnoticed

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican presidential campaign? It's still going on. You just wouldn't know it. 

 BODY:
The biggest surprise in the Republican presidential campaign? That it's still going on, despite the media frenzy surrounding Herman Cain.
You just wouldn't know it.
Mitt Romney is still giving speeches and holding town hall meetings, describing in sometimes wonky ways what he would and wouldn't cut from the federal budget if he were running the country.
Michele Bachmann is still out there on the hustings, accusing both Democrats and Republicans of being socialists who are too willing to spend the country's bounty on questionable programs.
Rick Perry is continuing to blanket the airwaves in Iowa with television commercials as he attempts to fight his way back into the leading position he briefly held in the Republican contest.
And Rick Santorum is still in Iowa after working his way across all 99 counties in the state.
But for all their efforts, the Republican candidates for president are operating in a political environment that is - for now - devoid of the oxygen that normally fuels fiery, high-profile campaigning this close to the beginning of voting in early January.
Jon Huntsman, one of Mr. Cain's other rivals for the Republican nomination, bemoaned the situation during an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" program on Sunday morning. He called Mr. Cain a "decent, decent man and a good candidate" but said the scandal is harming the overall presidential contest.
"We've got some real issues to discuss in this campaign, and this is taking all the bandwidth out of the discussion," Mr. Huntsman said. "So we're not able to talk about jobs. We're not able to talk about our position in the world. And that hurts. That hurts the American people."
Instead, for the past 10 days, the allegations against Mr. Cain - that he repeatedly engaged in sexual harassment against as many as four women - have dominated the national public conversation about the presidential campaign, stealing attention away from the other candidates.
And with the latest accuser going public in a news conference with celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred on Monday evening, it is unclear when that might change. Mr. Cain's campaign seemed as defiant as ever after Sharon Bialek's accusations, making the possibility of a quick departure on his part seem highly unlikely, especially with new polls showing him remaining near the top of the Republican field.
Who benefits from this situation? 
Of all the candidates, Mr. Romney probably benefits the most, because the attention on Mr. Cain makes it that much harder for Mr. Romney's other rivals to present themselves as the alternative to the Massachusetts governor.
The news media - including The New York Times - is seizing the story for all it's worth. (The Times has had several front page stories on the allegations against Mr. Cain.) Cable news programs have been chattering about the incidents for more than a week. And the scandal is tearing up the Twitter universe.
President Obama's political strategists no doubt love to watch the Republican campaign being consumed by a scandal, rather than focused on trashing the president's record in office.
And in the very short term, Mr. Cain seems to have benefited as well, at least as far as money is concerned. While his poll numbers suggest that more people now view him negatively than before the scandal broke, many Republicans view him as the victim of a witch hunt by the media or the Democrats or his rivals. And Mr. Cain says that the story has been very good for their fund-raising.
"I'm getting much better results," Mr. Cain wrote in an e-mail to supporters, reported by Politico. "My fund-raising has skyrocketed since all this nonsense began. Just this weekend, The Washington Post has come out with a new poll taken since all this started - showing me in the lead nationally, with my numbers on the rise."
He added: "The media may be obsessed with this business, but the voters are not. And I am not."
Of course, the losers probably include the voters, who are getting fewer opportunities than they might otherwise get to compare and contrast the Republican candidates. In less than two months, voters in a handful of early states will begin casting ballots to decide who should face Mr. Obama next year. They will need more information about all the candidates before they choose.
So when will the Republican reality show end? 
It's possible that a bit of normality could return to the presidential contest this week, when the candidates gather for two debates. On Wednesday night, they will meet in Michigan for a debate that is supposed to be focused on the nation's economic crisis, and how they would respond if elected to the White House.
With none of the candidates eager to get anywhere near Mr. Cain's scandal, and with CNBC eager to focus on financial subjects, it could be an hour-and-a-half devoid of harassment allegations. 
And just days later, in South Carolina, the candidates will gather again for another debate, this time on foreign policy. That debate, on Saturday evening, will give the candidates another opportunity to seize the spotlight away from Mr. Cain and the harassment story.
Will that be the end of it? Perhaps. In his e-mail to supporters, Mr. Cain said that "If the media want to continue talking about nonsense, that's fine. I'm not going to join them. It doesn't look like the citizenry plans to join them either."
Just hours later, Mr. Cain bowed to the inevitable and duringan appearance on "Jimmy Kimmel Live"announced that he would hold a news conference today to directly refute Ms. Bialek's charges, facing the media in what is sure to be another circuslike media event.
And so goes another day in Campaign 2012.

HEADLINE: Mayor Presses Both Parties to Cut U.S. Deficit

BYLINE: KATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: The mayor offered specific proposals on debt reduction in addition to criticizing Democratic and Republican lawmakers and the president for failing to lead. 

 BODY:
10:17 p.m. | Updated Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Tuesday that it was time for Washington to take serious steps to address the federal deficit, starting with a measure certain to be unpopular with some of his financial industry friends: a change to the way that hedge fund managers are taxed.
Mr. Bloomberg, in a speech in Washington at the liberal research group the Center for American Progress, said both parties were merely tinkering around the edges of a major problem that threatened the economy. He urged them to hammer out an agreement on spending cuts and tax increases to balance the budget in 10 years. 
The mayor said the $1.2 trillion in savings being sought by a Congressional supercommittee set to report on Nov. 23 would not be enough, and he urged the panel to come up with a "bold, long-term and comprehensive plan." (Full text of speech below.)
His own proposals would generate $8 trillion toward deficit reduction.
First, Mr. Bloomberg said, the Bush tax cuts should be allowed to expire for all income brackets.
He also called for Congress to adopt the spending cuts proposed last year by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission, including changes to Social Security, like gradually raising the retirement age.
He urged the elimination of special tax breaks and subsidies to farmers and the energy industry.
He also recommended treating "carried interest" - a type of income earned by some hedge fund managers that is taxed at lower rates - as ordinary income.
"Since fair is fair, tax loopholes in the financial industry that are outdated should be closed too, such as taxing carried interest at ordinary income rates," Mr. Bloomberg said. "And I say this even though many of the people who would be affected are my constituents - so I assume I will get some phone calls later this afternoon."
Mr. Bloomberg has been under some pressure from both the business community and supporters of the Occupy Wall Street movement in recent weeks as a broader debate about income inequality has taken hold. As the encampment in downtown Manhattan has continued, the mayor has tried to balance his support for the financial industry as an engine of New York's economy with a defense of the protesters' free speech rights.
In his address, he offered copious criticism for politicians in Washington, accusing Democrats of "pitting Americans against each other in a game of class warfare," while saying that Republicans "have to stop protecting every tax break and loophole as though they were sacrosanct."
And he chided President Obama, saying he had failed to lead effectively on deficit reduction.
"The executive branch must do more than submit a plan to a committee, and then step aside and hope the committee members take action," Mr. Bloomberg said. "That's not how any C.E.O. would run a business."

HEADLINE: Christie's Backing Starts Paying Dividends for Romney

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Chris Christie brings his political clout to New Hampshire to make an appeal for Mitt Romney. 

 BODY:
Less than a month after endorsing Mitt Romney on the eve of a Republican debate in New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Christie will make his debut as a surrogate for Mr. Romney, once again on the eve of a debate, and once again in New Hampshire.
On Wednesday, while Mr. Romney prepares for a yet another debate - this time in Michigan - Mr. Christie will campaign for him in the southern part of the state. He will attend a rally at the Romney campaign's New Hampshire headquarters in Manchester, as well as a house party at the Nashua residence of John Stabile, a former state Republican Party chairman who just endorsed Mr. Romney. Mr. Christie will then head to Mr. Romney's national headquarters in Boston for a debate-watching party, where he has been billed as the "special guest."
The Union Leader first reported the news, which the Romney campaign then sent out in a press release Tuesday morning.
"Governor Christie is a national leader in the fight to reform government and cut spending." said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign. "He has consistently stood up for the principles of limited taxation and fiscal responsibility that are important to Granite Staters. Our campaign is honored to have Governor Christie in New Hampshire to talk to voters about why Mitt Romney is the best candidate to fix our economy and defeat President Obama in 2012."
When Mr. Christie endorsed Mr. Romney in October, his support was seen as a sign that Mr. Romney was consolidating the backing of the establishment and big donors. Mr. Christie, a pugnacious fiscal conservative, was also promoted as being able to serve as a bridge between Mr. Romney and the grass-roots wing of his party.
On Tuesday, the Romney campaign also rolled outanother long-sought endorsement - Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois. Mr. Romney had heavily courted Mr. Schock, who remained hesitant about endorsing, and went so far as attending the congressman's 30th birthday in Chicago.
"Mitt Romney has a record of cutting spending and keeping taxes low that needs to be replicated in Washington," Mr. Schock said in an e-mail. "Under President Obama, our national debt has skyrocketed and our prized AAA credit rating has been lost. Mitt Romney has the conservative solutions needed to get Washington off its spending addiction and focused on creating jobs."

HEADLINE: On Electric-Vehicle Incentives, Diesel Defenders Cry Foul

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: A coalition of vehicle powertrain suppliers claims that diesel technology is being overlooked by policy makers eager to embrace electric vehicles. 

 BODY:
The U.S. Coalition for Advanced Diesel Cars, a Washington-based advocacy group whose members include Bosch, Honeywell and BorgWarner, all major automotive suppliers, released a white paper on Monday to make the case for technology-neutral policy-making on fuel efficiency.
The document, credited to Norman Y. Mineta, the transportation secretary under President George W. Bush until 2006, objected to incentives and other policies of federal and state governments that encouraged the development and adoption of electric vehicles, while diesel technologies received no such encouragement. The coalition said that governments and their agencies should treat all technologies equally, allowing each to compete on a level playing field.
"The desire to dictate solutions based on preferred technologies rather than set goals and develop standards is a bad practice that denies creative innovations," Mr. Mineta wrote.
The coalition claimed that electric-vehicle incentives were steering consumer and manufacturer decisions independent of market forces. They also objected to government fleet purchases that, according to the paper, skewed almost exclusively toward hybrids and E.V.'s.
The coalition said that some gasoline and diesel engines could be nearly as energy-efficient as any other technology.
To support its position, the coalition cited a study published by M.I.T. in April 2008 that compared the energy efficiency and emissions of next-generation diesel and gasoline engines to those of next-generation hybrids and battery-powered electric vehicles. The study concluded that the gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles came within 10 to 15 percent of their competitors in both categories.
The coalition, however, did not cite factors used in the study to determine the type or amount of energy consumed during charging of the E.V.'s or emissions generated by the utilities that produced the energy. Emissions generated during energy production and resources consumed can vary, as utilities in many states are required to add clean, sustainable energy resources to their portfolios; data that is accurate today may not be representative of the grid of tomorrow. Meanwhile, battery technology has advanced in the intervening years since the M.I.T. study was published.
Not nearly as contentious was the coalition's assertion that efficiency-boosting technologies like direct injection, variable valve timing, turbocharging, reduced-friction components and transmissions with higher gear ratios were not being used to their full potential in the United States. The paper said that faster adoption of these technologies, coupled with the downsizing of both vehicles and engines, would be the quickest and most cost-effective way to achieve energy usage goals, including the revised Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards put forward by President Obama in July.
The coalition went on to claim that a turbocharged diesel, equipped with the exhaust after-treatment system required for emissions compliance, could outperform a gasoline engine by up to 30 percent in fuel economy and 25 percent in greenhouse-gas emissions. These savings would come at a cost of $1,500 to $2,500 a vehicle at time of purchase over a gasoline-powered car.
Some automakers, however, are claiming that their gasoline burners outperform common-rail diesels. Mazda, for example, said in a recent media release that its new Skyactiv-G 2-liter gasoline engine, featured on the 2012 Mazda 3, achieved better fuel efficiency than the brand's current 2.2-liter diesel, which is not offered in the United States.
Diesels remain prevalent in countries with less strict noxious-gas emissions standards than those of the United States. Some companies, notably Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, have successfully marketed their clean, yet expensive, diesels in America. Not surprisingly, the two German automakers were among the notable dissenters after President Obama proposed the 2017-25 CAFE standard in July.
"The conclusion is rather simple," Mr. Mineta wrote. "We need to reestablish both the principle and practice of technology neutrality, thus rendering the very best solutions in years to come."

HEADLINE: Sarkozy Reportedly Called Netanyahu 'a Liar' in Overheard Remarks to Obama

BYLINE: ROBERT MACKEY


HIGHLIGHT: During a private conversation that was accidentally broadcast to several journalists, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, reportedly told President Obama that the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was "a liar." 

 BODY:
Updated | 5:53 p.m. During a private conversation last week that was accidentally broadcast to several journalists covering the Group of 20 economic summit meeting in Cannes, France, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France reportedly told President Obama that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was "a liar."
According to Arret sur Images, a French Web site dedicated to media criticism that first reported the remarks on Monday, a half-dozen reporters who listened in on the broadcast heard Mr. Sarkozy say, of the Israeli leader: "I cannot stand him anymore; he is a liar." 
Reporters who spoke to Arret sur Images said that the journalists also heard a French interpreter's translation of Mr. Obama's response: "You are tired of him, but I have to deal with him every day."
Reuters, which had journalists at the summit, reported on Tuesday that it could confirm that the incident took place. 
Arret sur Images also explained the technical mishap that allowed the conversation to be overheard. Before a news conference last Thursday, French officials had handed out devices to journalists that would allow them to hear a simultaneous translation of what Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Obama said when they took the stage. The officials told reporters that they would not be handing out headphones for the devices until the leaders arrived in the room; otherwise the journalists might be able to listen in on the private conversation between the two men beforehand.
That prompted several quick-thinking reporters to simply plug their own headphones into the listening devices, which allowed them to overhear part of a conversation between Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Obama on the Middle East.
In a blog post for Politico on the incident, Ben Smith reports that the journalists who overheard the remarks initially refrained from reporting them since they had taken advantage of the technical confusion by the French officials who gave them the devices. 
The Arret sur Images journalist who first reported the incident, Dan Israel, explained on Twitter that the reporters only heard the French translation of Mr. Obama's reply.
Mr. Israel also told Politico that the journalists did not initially report the remarks because "they knew they had cheated," and "were implicitly asked not to use them."
As Reuters reports, the journalists also heard Mr. Obama criticize Mr. Sarkozy for the French decision to vote in favor of a Palestinian request for membership of the United Nations' cultural agency Unesco. "I didn't appreciate your way of presenting things over the Palestinian membership of Unesco," Mr. Obama said. "It weakened us. You should have consulted us, but that is now behind us."
The news agency added that Mr. Obama was also overheard asking Mr. Sarkozy to press the Palestinian leadership not to apply for membership to other U.N. agencies, since U.S. law would require his administration to then stop contributing funds to those organizations. "You have to pass the message along to the Palestinians that they must stop this immediately," Mr. Obama said.
Noam Sheizaf, an Israeli journalist and blogger, reported on Tuesday that the official Facebook page of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv "was filled with comments by Israelis defending their prime minister's honor," after the remarks were reported. 
Mr. Sheizaf added that the comments seem to have been part of an orchestrated campaign. He discovered that a political organization run by a Mr. Netanyahu's former chief of staff, which has ties to Israeli settlers, had called on its 60,000 Facebook followers to "maintain the honor of Israel" by visiting the Facebook pages of the American and French embassies and posting comments. The call to action, Mr. Sheizaf noted, "even offered them some talking points."

HEADLINE: The G.O.P. Campaign Goes On Unnoticed

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican presidential campaign? It's still going on. You just wouldn't know it. 

 BODY:
The biggest surprise in the Republican presidential campaign? That it's still going on, despite the media frenzy surrounding Herman Cain.
You just wouldn't know it.
Mitt Romney is still giving speeches and holding town hall meetings, describing in sometimes wonky ways what he would and wouldn't cut from the federal budget if he were running the country.
Michele Bachmann is still out there on the hustings, accusing both Democrats and Republicans of being socialists who are too willing to spend the country's bounty on questionable programs.
Rick Perry is continuing to blanket the airwaves in Iowa with television commercials as he attempts to fight his way back into the leading position he briefly held in the Republican contest.
And Rick Santorum is still in Iowa after working his way across all 99 counties in the state.
But for all their efforts, the Republican candidates for president are operating in a political environment that is - for now - devoid of the oxygen that normally fuels fiery, high-profile campaigning this close to the beginning of voting in early January.
Jon Huntsman, one of Mr. Cain's other rivals for the Republican nomination, bemoaned the situation during an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" program on Sunday morning. He called Mr. Cain a "decent, decent man and a good candidate" but said the scandal is harming the overall presidential contest.
"We've got some real issues to discuss in this campaign, and this is taking all the bandwidth out of the discussion," Mr. Huntsman said. "So we're not able to talk about jobs. We're not able to talk about our position in the world. And that hurts. That hurts the American people."
Instead, for the past 10 days, the allegations against Mr. Cain - that he repeatedly engaged in sexual harassment against as many as four women - have dominated the national public conversation about the presidential campaign, stealing attention away from the other candidates.
And with the latest accuser going public in a news conference with celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred on Monday evening, it is unclear when that might change. Mr. Cain's campaign seemed as defiant as ever after Sharon Bialek's accusations, making the possibility of a quick departure on his part seem highly unlikely, especially with new polls showing him remaining near the top of the Republican field.
Who benefits from this situation? 
Of all the candidates, Mr. Romney probably benefits the most, because the attention on Mr. Cain makes it that much harder for Mr. Romney's other rivals to present themselves as the alternative to the Massachusetts governor.
The news media - including The New York Times - is seizing the story for all it's worth. (The Times has had several front page stories on the allegations against Mr. Cain.) Cable news programs have been chattering about the incidents for more than a week. And the scandal is tearing up the Twitter universe.
President Obama's political strategists no doubt love to watch the Republican campaign being consumed by a scandal, rather than focused on trashing the president's record in office.
And in the very short term, Mr. Cain seems to have benefited as well, at least as far as money is concerned. While his poll numbers suggest that more people now view him negatively than before the scandal broke, many Republicans view him as the victim of a witch hunt by the media or the Democrats or his rivals. And Mr. Cain says that the story has been very good for their fund-raising.
"I'm getting much better results," Mr. Cain wrote in an e-mail to supporters, reported by Politico. "My fund-raising has skyrocketed since all this nonsense began. Just this weekend, The Washington Post has come out with a new poll taken since all this started - showing me in the lead nationally, with my numbers on the rise."
He added: "The media may be obsessed with this business, but the voters are not. And I am not."
Of course, the losers probably include the voters, who are getting fewer opportunities than they might otherwise get to compare and contrast the Republican candidates. In less than two months, voters in a handful of early states will begin casting ballots to decide who should face Mr. Obama next year. They will need more information about all the candidates before they choose.
So when will the Republican reality show end? 
It's possible that a bit of normality could return to the presidential contest this week, when the candidates gather for two debates. On Wednesday night, they will meet in Michigan for a debate that is supposed to be focused on the nation's economic crisis, and how they would respond if elected to the White House.
With none of the candidates eager to get anywhere near Mr. Cain's scandal, and with CNBC eager to focus on financial subjects, it could be an hour-and-a-half devoid of harassment allegations. 
And just days later, in South Carolina, the candidates will gather again for another debate, this time on foreign policy. That debate, on Saturday evening, will give the candidates another opportunity to seize the spotlight away from Mr. Cain and the harassment story.
Will that be the end of it? Perhaps. In his e-mail to supporters, Mr. Cain said that "If the media want to continue talking about nonsense, that's fine. I'm not going to join them. It doesn't look like the citizenry plans to join them either."
Just hours later, Mr. Cain bowed to the inevitable and duringan appearance on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"announced that he would hold a news conference today to directly refute Ms. Bialek's charges, facing the media in what is sure to be another circuslike media event.
And so goes another day in Campaign 2012.

HEADLINE: Christie Backing Starts Paying Dividends for Romney

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Chris Christie brings his political clout to New Hampshire to make an appeal for Romney. 

 BODY:
Less than a month after endorsing Mitt Romney on the eve of a Republican debate in New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Christie will make his debut as a surrogate for Mr. Romney, once again on the eve of a debate, and once again in New Hampshire.
On Wednesday, while Mr. Romney prepares for a yet another debate - this time in Michigan - Mr. Christie will campaign for him in the southern part of the state. He will attend a rally at the Romney campaign's New Hampshire headquarters in Manchester, as well as a house party at the Nashua residence of John Stabile, a former state Republican Party chairman who just endorsed Mr. Romney. Mr. Christie will then head to Mr. Romney's national headquarters in Boston for a debate-watching party, where he has been billed as the "special guest."
The Union Leader first reported the news, which the Romney campaign then sent out in a press release Tuesday morning.
"Governor Christie is a national leader in the fight to reform government and cut spending." said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign. "He has consistently stood up for the principles of limited taxation and fiscal responsibility that are important to Granite Staters. Our campaign is honored to have Governor Christie in New Hampshire to talk to voters about why Mitt Romney is the best candidate to fix our economy and defeat President Obama in 2012."
When Mr. Christie endorsed Mr. Romney in October, his support was seen as a sign that Mr. Romney was consolidating the backing of the establishment and big donors. Mr. Christie, a pugnacious fiscal conservative, was also touted as serving as a bridge between Mr. Romney and the grass roots wing of his party.
On Tuesday, the Romney campaign also rolled outanother long-sought endorsement -Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois. Mr. Romney had heavily courted Mr. Schock, who remained hesitant about endorsing, and had gone so far as to attend the young congressman's 30th birthday in Chicago.
"Mitt Romney has a record of cutting spending and keeping taxes low that needs to be replicated in Washington," Mr. Schock said in an email statement. "Under President Obama, our national debt has skyrocketed and our prized AAA credit rating has been lost. Mitt Romney has the conservative solutions needed to get Washington off its spending addiction and focused on creating jobs."

HEADLINE: No Such Place as 'Post-Racial' America

BYLINE: TOURé


HIGHLIGHT: Barack Obama is running for re-election, but please stop telling me we live in a "post-racial" America. 

 BODY:
Dear America,
Please, I beg you, stop using the bankrupt and meaningless term "post-racial!" There's no such thing as "post-racial." There's no place that fits the description "post-racial America." There's no "post-racial era." It's a term for a concept that does not exist. There's no there there. 
We are not a nation devoid of racial discrimination nor are we a nation where race does not matter. Race and racism are still critical factors in determining what happens and who gets ahead in America. The election of Barack Obama ushered in this silly term and now that he's begun running for re-election, I'm here to brusquely escort it out of the party called American English because it's a con man of a term, selling you a concept that doesn't exist. 
"Post-racial" is a mythical idea that should be as painful to the mind's ear as fingernails on the chalkboard are to the outer ear. It's an intellectual Loch Ness monster. It is indeed a monster because it's dangerous. What people seem to mean by "post-racial" is: nowadays race no longer matters and anyone can accomplish anything because racism is behind us. All of that is false. But widespread use of the term lends credence to the idea that all of that is true-I mean, why would we have a term for an idea that's not real? In that way the lie becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and thus feeds the notion that it's O.K. to be somnambulant about race or even aggressively dismissive of it. 
If, as "post-racial" suggests, race no longer matters, then we no longer need to think about race or take the discussion of it seriously. In this way the concept becomes a shield against uncomfortable but necessary discussions allowing people to say or think, "Why are they complaining about racism? We're post-racial." 
This barrier to conversation is dangerous in a nation where race and racism still matter very much. A place where black unemployment is far higher than white unemployment, where profiling and institutional racism and white privilege and myriad other forms of racism still shape so much of life in America. If we don't need to discuss race then it's allowed to fester and grow unchecked like an untreated malignant tumor. Race is an issue every American must care about. It's not a black issue, it's everyone's issue. It's relevant and important for whites because we all live here together and because the issue hurts everyone. If your neighbor's house is on fire, or gets foreclosed, you have a problem. If your neighbor's soul is on fire you have a major problem. 
Only through being aware of racial disparities and talking about race can we have any chance of forward movement. Because nowadays there are many white people who are not racist, who are perhaps anti-racist, but who still benefit from white privilege without even meaning to. So you may not be racist but still receiving the spoils of racism. That still doesn't make you racist. But it makes you part of the system and reveals why it's also your responsibility to interrogate and examine how our society works and be aware of the biases that keep white supremacy functioning. The term "post-racial" is the enemy of communication, understanding and progress. ("Post-racial" is not at all synonymous with "post-black," a term from the art world that explains modern black identity and the complexity of being black today and is the guiding force of my book "Who's Afraid of Post-Blackness?")
"Post-racial" is just one of several terms that only pervert and distort the discussion of race and give people who wish to disrupt the conversation a place to park their ideas. Others include "race card" and "reverse racism" and "race baiter." The naive term "race card" always refers to a black person racializing a situation that the person using the term thinks doesn't need to be racialized. It's as if race was not part of the situation, and no one was being black or white, and everybody was being color blind, and whistling sweetly, until a black person came along and ruined everything by pointing out race. But race is like weather-we only talk about it when it's extreme but it's always there.
Interestingly, "race card" is never used to signify a white person using race-as they do when they use the term race card thus trying to repudiate or silence discussion of race. I wonder why that is. The ludicrous term "reverse racism" has been around for a long time but has gained new force in this era in which people use the term "post-racial." It seems to function like some sort of rallying cry. "We no longer need be cowed by your accusations of racism! We have the antidote! We have a concept called reverse racism! Whenever you cry racism we'll retort reverse racism! Then we don't have to take you seriously! Muahahaha!" 
From a linguistic standpoint the term is meaningless: something is either racist or it's not. Reverse makes no sense. There's no stipulation within the definition of racism that it need be white to black. Ultimately this is another term that seeks to replace potentially productive discussions of race with noise. "Race baiter" works in the same way, as an attempt to reject the conversation about race. 
I suspect "post-racial" was born benignly from the hope that Obama's electoral success meant that the racial problems that have long plagued America were over. Kumbaya. Surely Obama's victory revealed something had changed in America, but it was not a signal that we'd reached the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s mountaintop world where race no longer matters and equality has been achieved. During the Obama administration "post-racial" and "race card" and "reverse racism" have run amok like gremlins in the language, obfuscating race and making discussions about it harder. America still has so much work to do regarding race and racism and "post-racial" is only making that work harder to do. That's why "post-racial" and its cohorts must be stopped posthaste.
Thank you, Toure

HEADLINE: No Such Place as 'Post-Racial' America

BYLINE: TOURé


HIGHLIGHT: Barack Obama is running for re-election, but please stop telling me we live in a "post-racial" America. 

 BODY:
Dear America,
Please, I beg you, stop using the bankrupt and meaningless term "post-racial!" There's no such thing as "post-racial." There's no place that fits the description "post-racial America." There's no "post-racial era." It's a term for a concept that does not exist. There's no there there. 
We are not a nation devoid of racial discrimination nor are we a nation where race does not matter. Race and racism are still critical factors in determining what happens and who gets ahead in America. The election of Barack Obama ushered in this silly term and now that he's begun running for re-election, I'm here to brusquely escort it out of the party called American English because it's a con man of a term, selling you a concept that doesn't exist. 
"Post-racial" is a mythical idea that should be as painful to the mind's ear as fingernails on the chalkboard are to the outer ear. It's an intellectual Loch Ness monster. It is indeed a monster because it's dangerous. What people seem to mean by "post-racial" is: nowadays race no longer matters and anyone can accomplish anything because racism is behind us. All of that is false. But widespread use of the term lends credence to the idea that all of that is true-I mean, why would we have a term for an idea that's not real? In that way the lie becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and thus feeds the notion that it's O.K. to be somnambulant about race or even aggressively dismissive of it. 
If, as "post-racial" suggests, race no longer matters, then we no longer need to think about race or take the discussion of it seriously. In this way the concept becomes a shield against uncomfortable but necessary discussions allowing people to say or think, "Why are they complaining about racism? We're post-racial." 
This barrier to conversation is dangerous in a nation where race and racism still matter very much. A place where black unemployment is far higher than white unemployment, where profiling and institutional racism and white privilege and myriad other forms of racism still shape so much of life in America. If we don't need to discuss race then it's allowed to fester and grow unchecked like an untreated malignant tumor. Race is an issue every American must care about. It's not a black issue, it's everyone's issue. It's relevant and important for whites because we all live here together and because the issue hurts everyone. If your neighbor's house is on fire, or gets foreclosed, you have a problem. If your neighbor's soul is on fire you have a major problem. 
Only through being aware of racial disparities and talking about race can we have any chance of forward movement. Because nowadays there are many white people who are not racist, who are perhaps anti-racist, but who still benefit from white privilege without even meaning to. So you may not be racist but still receiving the spoils of racism. That still doesn't make you racist. But it makes you part of the system and reveals why it's also your responsibility to interrogate and examine how our society works and be aware of the biases that keep white supremacy functioning. The term "post-racial" is the enemy of communication, understanding and progress. ("Post-racial" is not at all synonymous with "post-black," a term from the art world that explains modern black identity and the complexity of being black today and is the guiding force of my book "Who's Afraid of Post-Blackness?")
"Post-racial" is just one of several terms that only pervert and distort the discussion of race and give people who wish to disrupt the conversation a place to park their ideas. Others include "race card" and "reverse racism" and "race baiter." The naive term "race card" always refers to a black person racializing a situation that the person using the term thinks doesn't need to be racialized. It's as if race was not part of the situation, and no one was being black or white, and everybody was being color blind, and whistling sweetly, until a black person came along and ruined everything by pointing out race. But race is like weather-we only talk about it when it's extreme but it's always there.
Interestingly, "race card" is never used to signify a white person using race-as they do when they use the term race card thus trying to repudiate or silence discussion of race. I wonder why that is. The ludicrous term "reverse racism" has been around for a long time but has gained new force in this era in which people use the term "post-racial." It seems to function like some sort of rallying cry. "We no longer need be cowed by your accusations of racism! We have the antidote! We have a concept called reverse racism! Whenever you cry racism we'll retort reverse racism! Then we don't have to take you seriously! Muahahaha!" 
From a linguistic standpoint the term is meaningless: something is either racist or it's not. Reverse makes no sense. There's no stipulation within the definition of racism that it need be white to black. Ultimately this is another term that seeks to replace potentially productive discussions of race with noise. "Race baiter" works in the same way, as an attempt to reject the conversation about race. 
I suspect "post-racial" was born benignly from the hope that Obama's electoral success meant that the racial problems that have long plagued America were over. Kumbaya. Surely Obama's victory revealed something had changed in America, but it was not a signal that we'd reached the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s mountaintop world where race no longer matters and equality has been achieved. During the Obama administration "post-racial" and "race card" and "reverse racism" have run amok like gremlins in the language, obfuscating race and making discussions about it harder. America still has so much work to do regarding race and racism and "post-racial" is only making that work harder to do. That's why "post-racial" and its cohorts must be stopped posthaste.
Thank you, Toure

HEADLINE: Students Press Congress to Sustain Investment in Science

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Students press lawmakers to sustain American investment in science despite hard times. 

 BODY:
5:23 p.m. | Updated 
A group of graduate students has posted a letter and video message to Congress aimed at sustaining federal investment in basic science in an era of cost-cutting and political paralysis and polarization. They are looking for other graduate students to sign on. The letter is at standwithscience.org. Here's their YouTube callout:
There is a related Facebook page.
Andy Hargadon, a University of California, Davis, researcher who studies the roots of invention, once explained to me that doctoral and post-doctoral students are the "stem cells" of the science/innovation system. But the value of nurturing this component of the innovation pipeline seems hard for outsiders, including lawmakers, to absorb. (As evidence, note that President Obama didn't get substantial support for his proposals for invigorating education related to energy sciences even when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress).
[Nov. 9, 10:05 a.m. | Update |
 Johanna Wolfson, a Ph.D. student in chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and president of the MIT Science Policy Initiative, which launched this campaign, sent this note:
Grad students in science and engineering are the future of U.S. innovation and competitiveness. But Congress is sending us a message that our research may not be funded and that the U.S. innovation system -- which we're primed and ready to contribute toward -- is on shaky ground. Science and engineering research grows our economy, as history has shown time and again. Cutting this engine of growth is the absolute least productive way for the Congressional super committee to reduce the federal deficit in the coming years. So we're calling on all supporters of science to speak out before the committee's Nov. 23 deadline and keep us from undermining our own future.]

William B. Bonvillian, the director of the Washington office of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, sent this related thought: 
Congress is looking at major cuts in discretionary spending -- it cut $900 billion over 10 years in the August budget bill and is looking now at another $1.2 trillion. These cuts will lock in in 2013 and ensure stagnation for the following decade. Our grad students are supported through federally funded research; they are the future of our innovation system, and we're about to send them a message that their research may well not be funded. In a way, we're in the process of telling our future innovation team to get off the playing field. Since U.S. economic growth is predominately based on our ability to innovate, we may be undermining our own future.
Now if only this issue, and the students' push, could get some coverage from George Will, who claims to be a big fan of federal investment in science (unless it threatenshis worldview).
5:23 p.m. | Addendum | 
This afternoon the American Association for the Advancement of Science distributed a letter opposing a House proposal for a 50-percent cut in the budget of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.

HEADLINE: Boston, Free and Easy (and Campus-Oriented)

BYLINE: SETH KUGEL


HIGHLIGHT: With dozens of college campuses, Boston has an abundance of free (or practically free) events, from lectures to concerts to soccer games. And they are not just for students. 

 BODY:
"Joyce, this cookie is as big as your face," one M.I.T. business student said to another, as they pounced on the oversize chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin treats left over from a lunchtime lecture on the Chinese economy. 
Tuition for the M.B.A. program at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management is $52,900 a year, so perhaps students deserve bountiful free desserts and guest appearances by the likes of Yue Chim Richard Wong, a professor at the University of Hong Kong. But do tourists? Apparently so. I just strolled in the door -- no one asked for ID -- and had a seat and a cookie and enjoyed the show. Though I felt like a trespasser and a mooch, I wasn't: the event, like so many others at Boston-area campuses, was free to the public and listed as such on the M.I.T. events page. (You didn't have to know much about China to enjoy the lecture, you just had to be someone who follows the news.)
Over the next few days, I attended a classical piano recital, a demonstration by top Catalonian chefs, a museum exhibition on English history, a college soccer game with one of the top 10 teams in the nation and a nutty tour at Harvard. It was all free - or at least payment-optional -- and the crowds at most were post-grad to graying. (Should you think you're too old for this, the suggestion for this post came from my 81-year-old dad who has been known to haunt plenty of events like these.)
Every touristy city has free attractions: Google the city name and "free" and you'll get lists of art galleries and farmers' markets and fireworks. But Boston takes it to an extreme with its dozens of college campuses that are to a surprising and admirable degree open to everyone. 
To some extent, it is energizing just to walk around campus surrounded by (and eavesdropping on) students who are so "wicked smaht," as Bostonians might say. But there are also endless events to attend, listed on online calendar pages for colleges and universities like Harvard, Tufts, Boston University, Boston College, BerkleeCollege of Music and the New England Conservatory. Fliers posted around campus have even more.
An obvious way to start your mostly-free Boston trip is with a campus tour. Though these tours are usually directed at incoming students, you can go without a high school junior in tow. Even better, take the unofficial "Hahvahd" tour, given not by the admissions office but by Trademark Tours. I did, accompanied by a crowd of international visitors divisible into two groups: those who spoke enough English to appreciate the goofy humor of our guide, an 18-year-old first-year student named LuShuang Yu; and those who didn't. While our guide had half the group groaning at her ship-related puns about Widener Library (named after a class of 1907 student who died on the Titanic), the other half happily snapped pictures. (The tour is nominally free, but you're a more iron-willed frugal traveler than I am if you can resist the plea for a $10 donation at the end.)
Though I could have downloaded a tour of M.I.T. to my iPhone, I set out on my own before the China lecture, since I just wanted to see the Stata Center, which is instantly recognizable as the work of Frank Gehry. The center's interior, interesting enough for its quirkily chaotic colors, materials and floor plan, is also filled with displays memorializing Building 20, the famously ramshackle lab it replaced, and notorious pranks engineered by M.I.T. students.
Taking the Green Line trolley out to the Boston-Newton border, I spent an afternoon taking in high culture at Boston College, in the form of a museum exhibition, a classical concert and (lowering the bar slightly) a turkey Reuben. 
I almost skipped "Making History: Antiquaries in Britain" at the McMullen Museum, since it sounded deadly boring. But that was because I had no idea what antiquarians were. As it turns out, they were history buffs who, starting as far back as the 16th century, had the bright idea of collecting historical artifacts and documents, although they sometimes interpreted them in hilariously misguided ways. Some of those documents are on display, including a ledger listing everything owned by Henry VIII when he died, and a copy of the Magna Carta dating to 1225. (The exhibition ends Dec. 11, and opens again in February at Yale.) 
The concert was a piano recital by Jeremiah W. McGrann, who directs the undergraduate music studies program at Boston College. "You know you're in trouble when the guy who's about to play the piano for you is also a musicologist, because he's going to want to talk to you about the music," Professor McGrann said. But contextualizing the pieces he played made the afternoon more interesting. Before playing pieces by Mozart and Clementi, for example, he compared their perspectives on the piano and explained how in December 1781, they performed for the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna in a piano smackdown. Who knew (aside, of course, from Wikipedia)? The music was nice (though I might have dozed off for a minute), but the setting, in an elegant hall with stained-glass windows, was even lovelier.
On my way to Boston College, I stopped at Moogy's, a sandwich shop and bar, for a turkey Reuben on buttery toasted marble rye, slathered with Russian dressing. (I passed on the $1 Busch drafts.) Moogy's is a 15-minute walk from campus, but I also found great deals on food closer to campuses - or on them.
It's an open secret in Cambridge (and on Yelp) that anyone can stroll into Harvard Business School and eat under the chandeliers in the Spangler Center's dining room. I was tempted into one of the most expensive items there: macaroni and cheese with boursin, chunks of lobster and vegetables of my choice for $11.50 ). It was truly luscious, and caloric - definitely enough for two with a salad. There are also slightly cheaper lobster-free entrees, as well as made-to-order sandwiches for $5.75, and a pay-by-weight salad bar with choices so diverse that a decade of the cumulative contents of my refrigerator could not match it. 
Another night, my frequent travel companion Jon Chapman (last seen in this column adding roasted ants to trail mix in Colombia) joined me at Grendel's Den in Harvard Square, where any $3 drink purchase grants you 50 percent off the entire food menu from 5 to 7:30 p.m., Sunday to Thursday. He ordered broiled salmon with rice and vegetables (no ants this time) for $5.25; I had shrimp and Gorgonzola with Malaysian sambal sauce over pasta for $6. I dragged Jon to Oggi Gourmet afterward, since it was Monday and LuShuang the tour guide had clued me in on the Monday evening special: a margherita pie for $5.95, plenty for two people -- even for two people who had not already eaten full dinners.
Our eating had not yet ended: we were off to see "Mixing the Unmixable," part of the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences' "Science and Cooking" public lectures. Half cooking show, half science class, this immensely popular series attracts lines that snake through the halls outside the auditoriums where they are held. 
That night, the presentation was on emulsions and foams, and David Weitz, a physics professor, took us through the formulas and the science behind the topic using terms like "dispersed phase" and "surfactant." Then the chefs Nandu Jubany and Carles Gaig of Spain showed how cooks whip up such things; meanwhile Professor Weitz had an assistant put the chefs' concoctions under a microscope shown on a wide screen above the stage, bringing the diagrams he had shown us to life. At the end we all got to taste an emulsion in the form of Mr. Gaig's romesco sauce, spread on small pieces of bread and passed out to the audience in abundance. (A videois online.) 
The next night, before attending a concert at the Berklee College of Music for $12, I went to a Boston University soccer game versus Boston College, now ranked number 10 or 7 in the country, depending on the poll you look at. It's $5 to watch from the stands, but free if you walk left past the gates and stand along the railing beyond the southwest goal, under high-rise dormitories. 
It was near Boston University that I had my cheapest meal, at Lower Depths, a bar on Commonwealth Avenue known for its beer selection and its hot dogs. It sells Fenway Franks on a buttered, toasted bun for $1, a tiny fraction of what they go for at their namesake ballpark down the street (and, I might add, half the price of a far inferior version sold on the streets of New York). 
The hot dogs also come with endless toppings options for a dollar each, including one that stuck out at me: peanut butter. The bartender said it was the most popular, and offered to eat it himself if I didn't like it. Not only did I like it (sort of), it made me something of a celebrity among the customers sitting around me. 
I skipped dessert, though: the menu didn't offer my Boston area favorites -- free cookies as big as your face.

HEADLINE: Iowa Might Matter in '12 After All

BYLINE: ALLISON KOPICKI


HIGHLIGHT: In recent presidential races, the Iowa caucuses had little impact on who went on to win the Republican nomination. That may change next year. 

 BODY:
So how much does Iowa matter? In recent Republican nominating contests, the state's caucuses have hardly mattered at all. Republican nominations have tended to be predictable, with the party throwing its support behind a candidate early in the process. 
But 2012 may be different.
According to Wayne P. Steger, a professor of political science at DePaul University in Chicago, "elite" Republican endorsements - from governors, celebrities, state party leaders - generally occur months before the primary season begins in earnest. But not this year. While Mitt Romney does lead the pack in endorsements, many of the coveted party elite, like Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida are still sitting on the sideline. 
 "Social and economic conservatives have been looking for anyone but Mitt Romney," says Professor Steger. "First they tried on Michelle Bachmann. Then they looked at Rick Perry, who wasn't a strong campaigner. Chris Christie didn't fly. Now Herman Cain is having his moment."
Professor Steger's research contends that endorsements from party insiders are a significant predictor of primary votes. Generally, a win or a strong showing in the Iowa caucuses or New Hampshire primary acts as a confirmation of what was known all along by activist Republicans. Outsider candidates who beat expectations in one or both of the early contests may survive through a few more state primaries, but any bump in the polls from Iowa or New Hampshire tends to be short-lived. 
That's what happened in 2000. In the fall of 1999, national CBS and Gallup polls showed about two-thirds of Republican voters supported George W. Bush, while John McCain had the support of only about one in 10 Republican voters. Support for Mr. McCain grew through the beginning of 2000 to about one in five Republican voters, and his first-place finish in New Hampshire propelled his poll numbers higher, to about a third of Republican voters. But Mr. Bush had the support of the Republican establishment firmly behind him, his national poll numbers never fell below 50 percent, and Mr. McCain never caught up. 
According to the findingsof several political scientists, these national polls reflect party insiders' leanings, suggesting that they are the main driver behind presidential nominations. Hans Noel of Georgetown University, a co-author of "The Party Decides: Presidential Nominations Before and After Reform," describes the period leading up to the Iowa caucuses as the "invisible primary," when people who matter in the process are talking to the candidates and to each other and figuring out who they want to be the party's standard-bearer. "This process is not just about raising money," he says. "To win the nomination, these candidates have to win a sequence of primaries and caucuses in state after state, which requires major organization. It's impossible to do this without help from a deep network."
Professor Noel says he thinks the 2012 Republican race, with its slow pace of endorsements, compares to the 2004 Democratic race. That's when Howard Dean was ahead in the New York Times/CBS News and other national polls, supported by about a quarter of likely Democratic voters before the Iowa and New Hampshire contests. "As in 2004, there's a presumptive front-runner doing well in the polls, but that a lot of the people in the party don't like," he says. So far this year, Mr. Romney has failed to capture the support of more than 21 percent of Republican voters in Times/CBS polls. 
Democrat endorsements typically occur later in the nomination process; with such diverse interests in the party (labor unions, environmentalists, civil and gay rights advocates, etc.), insiders look for a candidate with enough magnetism and personality to appeal to a full range of party members. 
Republicans, on the other hand, tend to be more homogenous. The 2008 campaign, however, was the beginning of the end of Republican uniformity, says Professor Steger, with increasing rifts over economic and social issues. 
A September Times/CBS poll found signs of this internal discord, with differences of opinion on several subjects among Tea Party supporters, white evangelicals and Republicans who do not support the Tea Party. 
The Times/CBS poll showed that right-leaning groups were not completely consistent on certain social issues like same-sex marriage and climate change. A solid majority of white evangelicals, usually a major component of the Republican base, did not support legal recognition of a gay couple's relationship, but a majority of all Republicans said they agreed with civil unions or legal marriage for gay couples. About a third of white evangelicals and non-Tea Party Republicans said climate change was real and was mostly caused by human activity, whereas only 15 percent of Tea Party supporters agreed with that view. 
Differences about government priorities and policies emerged, as well. Half of Tea Party supporters said cutting government spending should be the nation's higher priority, while about the same number of white evangelicals said creating jobs should be more important. About seven in 10 white evangelicals and non-Tea Party Republicans said both tax increases and spending cuts were needed to reduce the federal budget, while half of Tea Party supporters said only spending cuts should be used. And while about half of both white evangelicals and non-Tea Party Republicans said taxes on wealthy households should be increased to balance the budget, only three in 10 Tea Party supporters supported a tax increase on the rich.
These shades of difference among Republicans are adding to the indecision about this year's slew of candidates, with different candidates appealing to different segments of the party. Professor Steger says the Republican elite was "facing tremendous uncertainty."
"They don't want to support someone who can't get the grass-roots level and base energized," he said.
He said that this year's Republican race was utterly unpredictable and that there was no way to forecast who would win with any type of accuracy. With members of the Republican establishment failing to coalesce behind any one candidate, they are now leaving it up to the voters. 
Which suggests Iowa is going to be extremely important this year.

HEADLINE: Ranking History's Atrocities By Counting the Corpses

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
Browsing the bookstore shelves can pose its grim challenges for the ordinary mortal. The reproachful cover of ''1,000 Places to See Before You Die'' is bad enough. There's also ''100 Birds to See Before You Die,'' ''100 Belgian Beers to Try Before You Die!'' and ''1,001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.'' Make your way through ''50 Places to Play Golf Before You Die'' and you're still not done: ''50 More Places to Play Golf Before You Die'' is staring right at you.
Into this profusion of lists comes Matthew White, a self-described ''atrocitologist'' and numbers freak from Richmond, Va., who has compiled yet another -- more sobering -- roll call to ponder. With its stylishly lurid graphics and goofy asides, ''The Great Big Book of Horrible Things: The Definitive Chronicle of History's 100 Worst Atrocities'' may seem more like an aspiring classic of macabre bathroom reading than a serious effort. But Mr. White's book, published this week by W. W. Norton, arrives trailing some impressive scholarly affirmation, including a ringing foreword from the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker. 
If coldbloodedly ranking body counts seems like an odd business, Mr. White, a bearlike man of 54 with a shy laugh and incipient Santa Claus beard, is an even odder person to be doing it.
He has no college degree or formal training in history or statistics. He does not attend academic conferences or publish in scholarly journals. He does not visit archives, instead culling numbers from far-flung secondary sources during off hours from his job as a librarian at the federal courthouse in Richmond. His Web site includes links to Tolkien-inspired maps and random self-help reflections (the page for ''How to Overcome Procrastination'' is listed as ''Under Construction''), along with links to carefully annotated compilations of war statistics. He prefers jaunty terms like multicide, megadeath and hemoclysm to sober, morally charged ones like genocide.
''I've always been a bit of a wiseguy,'' Mr. White said, though he is quick to add that he means no offense. Atrocity is a serious business, and the numbers he puts up are staggering, from the well known (1.67 million victims of the Khmer Rouge, atrocity No. 39 on Mr. White's list) to the largely forgotten (13 million dead from the An Lushan Rebellion in eighth-century China, which lands at No. 13).
Fifteen years ago Mr. White was just a local-history buff with a vague dream of creating a historical atlas of Richmond. But one day, for reasons he is hard pressed to explain, he drew a map illustrating the collapse of the Soviet Union and posted it on the World Wide Web, which was then new. More maps followed, and his grandly titled ''Historical Atlas of the 20th Century'' was born.
The obsession with body counts came later, along with a steady accumulation of citations by recognized scholars: 377 published books and 183 scholarly articles to date. (Yes, Mr. White has the stats.)
In his foreword to ''The Great Big Book'' Mr. Pinker -- who drew on Mr. White's work for own new book, ''The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined'' -- credits him with compiling ''the most comprehensive, disinterested and statistically nuanced estimates available.''
Charles Maier, a historian of modern European history at Harvard who stumbled on Mr. White's Web site five years ago when searching for reliable death counts in the two world wars, doesn't put it that strongly but welcomes his painstaking efforts nonetheless.
''These figures are notoriously elusive,'' Mr. Maier said, adding that Mr. White ''seems to have tried to get the best figures he could.''
Mr. White's methodology is simple. He gathers every estimate he can find, including some that mainstream historians might reject as unsavory. (''Beggars can't be choosers,'' he writes.) He throws out the highest and lowest numbers and then calculates the median, arriving at what he acknowledges is often just an informed guess. Deaths from famine and disease stemming from armed conflict count, but natural disasters and purely economic events do not. (''There has to be a core of violence,'' he explained.) All sources are listed on his Web site, along with darkly witty ruminations on the inherent uncertainty of numbers, especially where what he calls ''mass unpleasantness'' is involved.
Mr. White's estimates are ''at the high end of the range,'' Mr. Pinker said. But he called Mr. White's transparency about his sources impressive and his methodology statistically sound, in keeping with the scientific tradition of meta-analysis of previous studies.
But not all scholars are so confident about Mr. White's numbers. Benedict F. Kiernan, director of Yale's Genocide Studies Program and an expert in the Khmer Rouge, said in an e-mail that averaging guesses alongside more precise counts can be misleading. (Mr. White's Web page on the Cambodian genocide, however, ''looks to be a careful compilation,'' Mr. Kiernan said.)
Others say it can be difficult to make quantitative assessments of violence without a strong qualitative grasp of the context. To evaluate the reliability of a source, historians need to be immersed in that period, including its modes of exaggeration, said Randolph Roth, co-director of the Historical Violence Database at Ohio State University. While he admires Mr. White's willingness to look at the big picture, he said, ''it's going to be hard for many historians to read this book and look at that death toll for Genghis Khan, that 40 million, and not have a sinking feeling.''
When it comes to atrocitology, Mr. White likes to say, the side of caution is usually the high side, especially where an event remains politically charged. Which isn't to say he has much patience for Internet chestnuts like ''Which has killed more people: Christianity or gun control?'' He is equally skeptical of the claim that the 20th century had 174 million instances of ''democide,'' or death by government, an idea advanced by R. J. Rummel, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Hawaii, and enthusiastically embraced in some corners of the libertarian blogosphere.
Mr. White, who describes his politics simply as ''kind of pacifist,'' said that Mr. Rummel -- who keeps a Web site with its own eccentric vocabulary (''mortacracies,'' ''megamurderers'') and an early-Internet design sense to rival Mr. White's own -- tends to define every warlord, rogue militia and lynch mob as a form of government, rather than a sign of its lack.
The lessons of his own survey, Mr. White said, are clear. No one system of government is obviously more murderous, and anarchy can be worst of all. ''Governments don't kill people,'' he said. ''People kill people.''
Mr. Rummel, in an e-mail, dismissed Mr. White's numbers as ''not reliable,'' adding that it matters greatly whether Stalin killed 20 million people, Mr. White's figure, or 61 million, his own figure. ''When the magnitude is so great, it is a profound statement on the nature of Communism,'' he said.
Such polemics may have receded in mainstream historical circles since the late 1990s, when the publication of ''The Black Book of Communism,'' which placed the global death toll of Marxist regimes at 85 million to 100 million, inspired fierce debates about the relative evils of Communism and Nazism. (Mike Davis's 2001 book, ''Late Victorian Holocausts,'' in turn, indicted capitalist imperialism for tens of millions of famine deaths in the developing world.)
Mr. White, for his part, may start arguments with his own equivalences, such as lumping the Jewish victims of the Holocaust in with the 66 million total deaths in World War II, his No. 1 most horrible thing of all time.
Still, the question of which regime or ruler is the worst, according to Mr. Maier, the Harvard historian, remains ''a very natural question,'' even if most historians resist dwelling too much on the numbers.
''Most of us feel ashamed about doing this kind of raw exercise,'' Mr. Maier said, adding, ''Here's a guy who hasn't been afraid to get his hands dirty.''

HEADLINE: Democrat Elected Suffolk Executive, Giving Party Lift on Long Island

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN; Angela Macropoulos contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Democratic Party scored a pivotal victory on Tuesday as Steve Bellone was elected Suffolk County executive, enhancing the party's standing on Long Island and giving Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo a prominent new ally in the New York City suburbs.
With 96 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Bellone, the town supervisor of Babylon, received 57 percent of the vote, compared with 43 percent for his Republican opponent, Angie M. Carpenter, the county treasurer. 
Mr. Bellone, declaring victory at a union hall in Hauppauge, said that voters had embraced his message of making government function again. ''My pledge to you, tonight, is that we will take this mandate and do exactly what we promised to do,'' Mr. Bellone said. ''We will make government more efficient -- we will make it work, so that we can protect taxpayers in this county.''
Mr. Bellone's election ends a period of political tumult on Long Island that was unexpected and at times head-snapping. He will succeed Steve Levy, a Democrat turned Republican who mounted an unsuccessful run for governor last year and then abruptly abandoned his bid for a third term this year, in a deal to end a criminal inquiry into his political fund-raising.
Mr. Bellone, 42, vastly outspent Ms. Carpenter in the race, and eagerly trumpeted two critical endorsements: one from Mr. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat who is highly popular, and the other from Newsday, whose editorial he quoted at length in a last-minute radio spot this week.
Mr. Bellone campaigned on a promise to improve the business climate in Suffolk County, pointing to his track record of reducing Babylon's debt and cutting the size of its government during his decade as town supervisor. He promised to simplify county government and attract technology companies to the area.
Ms. Carpenter, 68, accused Mr. Bellone of not holding the line against tax increases. She also waged a campaign focused on job creation, promising to speed up the process of obtaining government permits and bring greater transparency to the county's budget process.
Fittingly for an area known for its political twists, the race detoured in its closing days to a different issue: whether Mr. Levy, in an effort to save money, should have canceled a $660 contract with an octogenarian who dresses as Santa Claus each holiday season. (Ultimately, Mr. Bellone convened a news conference to write a personal check covering Santa's salary.)
Mr. Bellone now inherits something of a fiscal nightmare in Suffolk County, which, with 1.5 million residents, is the state's largest county outside of New York City, and also one of the wealthiest and most highly-taxed. Mr. Levy's 2012 budget proposal called for more than 700 layoffs, but even with those cuts, the County Legislature's budget review office projected that his spending plan would have a shortfall of $135 million.
The County Legislature on Wednesday is expected to adopt its own budget proposal, which would raise taxes on some residents but sharply reduce the number of required layoffs. But the spending plan would cover only the first six months of next year, leaving the county executive with the task of figuring out a plan for the rest of the year.
Both Mr. Bellone and Ms. Carpenter criticized Mr. Levy's budget proposal, but neither offered precise details about plans to corral the county's finances. Difficult local government budgets provided a common backdrop to elections across New York on Tuesday, and the state Republican Party urged voters to reject Democratic candidates to send a message to President Obama that his shepherding of the country's struggling economy was unacceptable.
Democrats hoped to benefit from the high standing of Mr. Cuomo, who endorsed dozens of local candidates and made campaign appearances in three of the most watched races, including the Suffolk County contest.
All three of the Democrats for whom Mr. Cuomo made campaign appearances won their races. In addition to Mr. Bellone, Mike Spano, a state assemblyman, was elected mayor of Yonkers. And in Erie County, Mark Poloncarz, the county comptroller, defeated the incumbent county executive, Chris Collins, a Republican who flirted with running for governor last year, and had been seen as a possible rival to Mr. Cuomo in 2014.
The highest profile race in New York City was on Staten Island, where the incumbent district attorney, Daniel M. Donovan Jr., a Republican, easily fended off a challenge from Michael J. Ryan, a Democrat, in a rematch of their 2007 race.
In the Finger Lakes region, a town clerk who has received widespread attention for her refusal to sign marriage licenses for same-sex couples won re-election. The clerk, Rose Marie Belforti of Ledyard, said that signing the licenses would violate her religious beliefs, and she has arranged for a deputy to issue all marriage licenses by appointment. Ms. Belforti received 305 votes, compared with 186 for a write-in candidate who challenged her.

HEADLINE: Sleeping at Work to Keep Her Home

BYLINE: By JOHN OTIS

 BODY:
The view outside the train window never changes, save for the tint, or total absence, of the leaves across the Hudson River.
''I've been looking at the same trees now for three years, and they still look pretty to me,'' Linda Thornton said of her weekly journey from the South Bronx to her job far north of the city.
But the hourlong ride has become the last bit of calm before an exhausting mental storm.
Ms. Thornton's destination is northern Westchester County, where she works as a youth counselor at a detention center for boys. It is also where, because of financial constraints, she must live during her workweek, Wednesday through Saturday. 
''I have not gotten used to the process of having to pack up the way I do,'' Ms. Thornton, 47, said. ''I come back home Saturday night at 1 a.m. feeling like I've just come back from camp. I don't like leaving my home for four days without a choice.''
In March, she said, cuts in state financing for the detention center required a sacrifice from its salaried employees: 10 percent of their paychecks. Money had always been tight; now Ms. Thornton could not afford her commute, which, including her Metro-North train fare, had been more than $600 a month.
She said she had no choice but to remain on the detention center grounds after work, settling into a dormlike building provided for the staff. It is identical to the ones that house the juvenile residents.
''When I'm there,'' she said, ''I don't sleep well, and the residents being who they are, you can't sleep well, because you never know what might happen.''
Even though she works at a low-security center, her guard is up the moment she steps off the train. The job also takes a physical toll. A large part of the staff members' duties is shepherding the residents from their cottages to school, to recreation or to meals as part of a structured routine to ensure there are no idle hands.
While quick to emphasize that she cares about her job, Ms. Thornton is blunt about the conditions. ''It's a hostile environment up there,'' she said. ''It's like working in a prison.''
Compounding the rigors of her job and her anxiety about what suddenly lighter pockets would mean, there was the sense that she was all alone in her worry. ''Some people were saying, 'Ten percent is nothing,' '' she said, ''but I was like, 'Ten percent can make you homeless.' ''
In jeopardy was the small public housing apartment that she rents for $776 a month. Ms. Thornton, a divorced mother of three sons in their 20s, has a bachelor's degree in social services. Before the pay cut, she was making $29,000 a year, with monthly expenses of $300 for food and $140 for utilities. Her blood-pressure medication totaled $186 a month in co-payments and her student loans, $150.
Her sons, she said, cannot help her financially. ''My sons are going through their own issues as well,'' she said.
Ms. Thornton fell behind on her rent, owing $3,984. A case manager at Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, arranged for her to receive $1,544 from the Bridge Fund, a private agency established for the purpose of preventing homelessness, and $1,540 from the Social Services Department at the city's Human Resources Administration.
The caseworker also helped Ms. Thornton create a budget to save $400 to whittle away her back rent, and drew $500 from the Neediest Cases Fund to cover the rest.
For now, her apartment, her haven, is intact. Inside, photographs of her smiling children offset the litter and graffiti in the hallways of her building, and the scent of clean laundry offers a welcome contrast to the smell of urine in the building's elevators.
''I don't like the area I live in or the building I live in,'' Ms. Thornton said, adding, ''But once I get inside my apartment, all that is out there.''
Still, she gets on her train every Wednesday morning because she feels her options are limited in the current economy. She knows many friends who have lost jobs. But at least she is going to a job she enjoys.
''I know how it feels to be in the system, to feel like your parents don't want you,'' Ms. Thornton said. ''These young boys are younger than my sons. I know why they're there, but I can't help but connect to them.''
HOW TO HELP: Checks payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund may be sent to 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11245.

HEADLINE: Figures Show Some Signs Labor Market Is Easing

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
The number of people leaving or receiving jobs picked up in September, the Labor Department reported Tuesday, a sign that that the labor market may be regaining its health.
Both hires and separations have been relatively stagnant in the last year, with companies too nervous to hire or let anyone go, and employees too frightened to leave their jobs. Layoffs in particular had reached record lows earlier this year. But levels of both rose in September. 
While a rise in separations, at least, may not sound like welcome news, it means that companies and workers are finally more willing to start making decisions again. Uncertainty about the state of the economy had largely frozen both hiring and firing, and without people leaving their jobs, companies had nobody to replace with new workers. Greater churn in the job market now potentially means more opportunities down the line for the 14 million unemployed workers sitting on the sidelines.
The turnover is still not as great as it was before the recession began, however, when the population was also smaller.
Particularly promising is that the number of quits -- that is, workers who voluntarily left their jobs, as opposed to being fired or laid off -- rose in September, reaching its highest total since November 2008. That probably means that workers finally feel more confident that they can find new work if they are unhappy with their current position.
The best news was in job openings, which was at its highest level since August 2008, the month before Lehman Brothers failed. That also helped bring down the number of jobless workers per opening to 4.1, which, while still historically high, is far better than its peak of 6.9 unemployed workers per opening in July 2009.
Continued competition among unemployed workers implies that wage inflation is unlikely to hit anytime soon, according to Henry Mo, vice president of economics at Credit Suisse.
The main continued area of concern in the Labor Department's report was the disconnect between job openings and hiring. There has been decent growth in the number of job openings since the recovery officially began, with openings up 38 percent since June 2009, but growth in the number of hiring has been very slow, up only 17 percent.
It's not clear what to make of this. The disconnect could be due to a skills mismatch -- that is, workers don't have the skills that employers are looking for. Or it could just be a sign of continued hesitation among employers, who are waiting for the recovery to pick up more speed before they commit to filling an opening.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Another good sign is that the number of jobless workers per job opening has been falling. (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, via Haver Analytics)

HEADLINE: The Hardening of Easy Dave

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
David Stern was not always fully sold on going the distance as the entrepreneurial shepherd of professional basketball, as the commissioner of the N.B.A.
In the ascendant days of Magic, Larry and Michael -- not coincidently the prime of Stern's career -- the telephone would ring a couple of times each year and someone would pose a question that began: Would you consider? But the feelers, while flattering, were never too tempting. Stern, the son of a New York delicatessen owner, could not pull himself away from a sport that felt all-encompassing, increasingly consuming.
To explain its hold on him, Stern in a recent interview recalled the title of a book that his predecessor, Larry O'Brien, had written about his time as a strategist for the Democratic Party: ''No Final Victories.'' For Stern, who originally aspired to a long career in law and had a keen interest in politics, basketball became the best of all competitive, and occasionally cutthroat, worlds.
''The beauty of the business is that there has always been something else to do, and there will be when I'm no longer commissioner,'' he said. ''I'm comfortable with the notion that the time will come to step away. But there are a few more things to be done before that.'' 
The first of which is to somehow keep his career-defining sculpture from being scarred beyond recognition.
The league's second in-season lockout in 13 years has created a chasm between management and labor and produced resentments within the warring sides themselves. Given the chaotic nature of the negotiations, Stern's ultimatum to the players to accept management's current offer by late Wednesday afternoon or face a more punitive deal carries a real risk. His move could save the season, or set loose the forces of chaos that will wreck it.
In effect, the outcome of the lockout could actually represent Stern's final victory -- at least as some owners will see it. Or in the event of a lost season, his most devastating defeat -- and who knows what after that.
Either way, at 69, a time in life more conducive to embarking on a path to patriarchal disengagement, Stern has become more publicly embroiled and embattled than ever. One can almost imagine him on the roof of the league's Fifth Avenue headquarters, commissioner-turned-Kong, swatting at attackers from all sides -- including his back.
Is Stern a menace to the players? Is he misunderstood? Is the problem more with the new environment he inhabits?
''Ownership has changed, the players have changed, the media has changed -- the whole landscape has changed,'' said Jerry Colangelo, the former Phoenix Suns owner and a longtime Stern ally. ''And in the past five to seven years, I've also seen some changes in David. He is a survivor and a competitor, but put it this way: some of the stuff has worn on him.''
However hardened and hardheaded, Stern's pain over having the N.B.A. shut down in the wake of its most compelling season in years has been obvious to those who have known him a long time. They are not fooled by the combative persona, the lawyer prosecuting his case in pursuit of a more balanced and profitable league.
''Inside, this is killing him,'' Colangelo said
Stern has been the commissioner since 1984 and has been involved with the N.B.A. since the late 1960s. Better than any modern-day league sports executive, he managed for a time to straddle that fine line of contractual allegiance while leading owners and players past one marketing threshold after another. As the reputed rainmaker of revenue, he was characterized as commissioner to all, though few, if any, addressed him by title. Instead, the informality of ''David'' only furthered the notion that Stern was no proverbial owners' stooge.
''I represent the owners, but I've always believed that if you represent them well, you can represent the interests of players, fans and communities, too,'' he said in the interview. ''We always saw this as one continuous wheel, working broadly, like a family.''
Through the years and other power struggles, Stern's guiding leadership principle has been to know his adversaries from his enemies and to always make that distinction.
An adversary was typically someone who rebelled from under his protective umbrella -- for example, the Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, hauled into court by Stern when he exploited Michael Jordan's popularity in the early 1990s by putting his team on the superstation WGN in competition with the league's national television partners.
An example of an enemy was David Falk, who as Jordan's superleveraged agent imposed his will on labor issues in the 1990s. Back then, Stern labeled Falk and his brethren as parasites -- those whose meddling would bend the spokes on his continuous wheel.
Falk still represents some players but no longer wields the influence he once did. Now he calls himself ''an unabashed admirer'' of Stern and hails him as ''the world's greatest real estate agent'' for how he has increased the value of N.B.A. franchises.
''I like him, respect him and I never took his jabs personally,'' Falk said. ''He gets criticized for being stubborn and a bully and he often used me as a lightning rod. But you have to give the man his credit. I think he's earned his longevity.''
It was during the 1998-99 lockout that the image of Stern as the Everyman Commissioner -- he once called himself Easy Dave after one negotiating settlement -- dissolved. With the league shuttered until the players accepted a last-ditch offer in January to save a 50-game season, Stern went to make peace with the players at a Midtown Manhattan hotel -- flanked by security guards.
Still, he remained in firm control of the owners, with the unquestioned support of influential veterans like Colangelo, Abe Pollin in Washington and Bill Davidson in Detroit. But Colangelo moved on, Pollin and Davidson died, and as younger owners have acquired teams, most paying inflated sums, they came without a deep reservoir of gratitude to Stern.
The ''big market versus small market'' struggles go all the way back to the formation of the league when Ned Irish, the president of Madison Square Garden, overpowered other franchises that were demanding shared gate receipts. Today's small-market teams, their numbers increased by expansion, have now banded together in an attempt to force draconian cuts on the players.
Those who have worked closely with Stern and who recognize that the players have made significant concessions this time around believe that he would have already cut a deal if past conditions still prevailed.
''This is a very different economic situation than he's had,'' said Russ Granik, the former N.B.A. deputy commissioner and now a vice chairman of Galatioto Sports Partners, which advises pro teams and leagues on finances. ''When the dynamics end up being more important than the economics, it's the hardest kind of dispute to resolve.''
And Stern winds up looking more like the provocateur than the pragmatist, though Granik added: ''If he was concerned about his legacy, he would have walked away, retired a year ago. Everyone knew this was coming.''
Those who know Stern said he would not have left the current mess to Adam Silver, who replaced Granik as deputy and could be Stern's eventual replacement. For his part, Stern said he understood and accepted the heightened rhetoric and news media criticism that are parts of any contentious labor showdown. Regarding the most inflammatory of comments -- HBO's Bryant Gumbel's likening him to ''some kind of modern plantation overseer'' -- Stern sighed and called it ''an occupational hazard.''
But he didn't leave it there because here, finally, was an attack not on the commissioner's persona, but on his core person.
''I have worked harder for inclusiveness and diversity than he could ever understand,'' Stern said. ''So when I heard what he said I sat back and waited for the e-mails from the people who know me, who have worked with me.''
He was reluctant to identify the supporters but offered the Rev. Jesse Jackson as one example.
Beyond character witnesses, Stern could tick off a long record of social achievements, beginning with pro bono work as a young lawyer in a groundbreaking lawsuit that attacked the practice of racial steering in suburban New Jersey in the mid-1970s. He could brag about the N.B.A.'s long history of being far in front of its pro sports competitors in minority hiring and black ownership. So enthralled was Stern when Barack Obama was elected president that he suspended league office operations so his staff could watch the inauguration speech.
But Stern for decades has also walked a fine line, trying to draw an affluent and largely white fan base to arenas while repeatedly railing against the public's lower tolerance threshold for missteps from his predominantly black, and very visible, player pool.
''We've gone from people objecting to Afros to people objecting to cornrows,'' Stern said. ''We know better than most that America is not postracial.''
In any case, the Gumbel attack gained little traction. ''It may have hurt Stern personally but it winds up hurting the players more, polarizing the support, because it was so over the top,'' said Toure, the cultural critic and author of the recently published ''Who's Afraid of Post-Blackness?''
He added: ''People think, the players are making how much money and Stern's a slave master?''
It has been a long, rewarding run for Stern, crashing cultural and international borders. Some might call him paternalistic, even pompous, but Stern has been resolute that he has been and remains the best man for the complicated, and often confounding, job.
In recent years, he has occasionally confided to friends like Granik and Dave Checketts, the former president of Madison Square Garden, that he would remain as the commissioner ''a couple more years and that would be enough.''
What would he do next? Checketts said he believed Stern had satisfied whatever wanderlust he might have once had by serving on the Columbia University board of trustees, among other outside interests, but he has teased him recently about a future ambassadorship -- provided his beloved Democrats retain the White House.
Before the election, he must survive the negotiations. Referring to the continuing labor dispute, Checketts said, ''There's a certain amount of sadness that he has to fight this in order to go out on top.''
Hazarding his own guess, Colangelo said he doubted that Stern would soon be going anywhere.
''Not of his own volition,'' he said. ''You have to understand that this has become part of his being.''

HEADLINE: After Long Ordeal, a Homeowner Can Stay Home

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
FOR two years, Althea Girard-Blakey toted a black canvas bag when she went to work, full of the enormous collection of papers documenting her request for a mortgage modification.
''I never knew when I was going to need it,'' said Ms. Girard-Blakey, 59, who was struggling to make payments on a loan she took out on her home in East Palo Alto, Calif.
Now, Ms. Girard-Blakey can leave the sack at home. Her lender, Chase, has approved a permanent loan modification that reduced her monthly payments to an amount she can afford. She made the first of the new payments on Oct. 1.
In the context of the housing crisis, Ms. Girard-Blakey is one of the lucky ones: She got to keep her home, a compact two-bedroom with a pale exterior framed by bougainvillea. ''Home, sweet home,'' she said, smiling, during an interview in her cozy living room, which she has decorated in brown hues, contrasted with colorful orange and green accent pillows. 
Getting the necessary approval involved several false starts and proved to be a frustrating, sometimes bewildering, process for Ms. Girard-Blakey and her husband, Cornel Blakey, 61. Her experience shows how the loan modification process can tax the resources of people who already are stressed by the demands of a difficult economy.
Coming as close as she did to losing the house was wrenching, because Ms. Girard-Blakey had owned it for more than 30 years. She bought the property in 1975, for what now seems like the startlingly low sum of $17,500. ''It's like buying a car, now,'' she said of the price. A young single mother at the time, she wanted a home in which to raise her daughter. ''I needed a place to get us settled,'' she said.
She was able to secure a mortgage by saving a small amount for a down payment from her income as a preschool teacher, she recalled, and also by agreeing to pay the owner part of the purchase price over time.
Over the years, she said, she borrowed against the house to make improvements, like a new roof and an additional bedroom, and once to support herself during a period of unemployment. More recently, she and her husband added a small covered patio with artificial turf in the backyard. ''This is my favorite part of the house,'' she said while giving a visitor a tour. She viewed the debt-financed upgrades as positive, at the time. ''I had my house working for me,'' she said.
The most recent refinance came in November 2007, when, amid the housing bubble, the home's value had grown to more than $500,000, according to the real estate Web site Zillow. She took out a 30-year fixed-rate loan, arranged through a broker, for roughly $265,000.
The loan was sold to Washington Mutual and ended up at Chase after Chase took ownership of WaMu's mortgages in September 2008. (Mr. Blakey wasn't a borrower on the loan, although his income helped pay the bill; because Ms. Girard-Blakey had owned the home herself before the couple married in 2000, they considered it her asset, they said). The resulting monthly payment of more than $1,600 was higher than she had expected. Still, she initially was able to handle the payments.
But two years later, the stalled economy was affecting Mr. Blakey's income and straining the couple's ability to pay their bills. East Palo Alto, populated by many African-American and Hispanic families, is less affluent than its neighbor Palo Alto, home to Stanford University and technology companies, including Hewlett-Packard. East Palo Alto was hit hard by the recession. On a recent Saturday, as children played in the street, a woman approached passers-by, asking for spare change.
Mr. Blakey had worked for years cutting hair at the barber shop his father had operated since the 1960s. But long-time customers began to move away, he said, and new ones seemed to be getting fewer haircuts during the slow economy. Finally, late last year, his father retired, and they closed the shop. The sign, East Bayshore Barber Shop, still hangs on the building a few blocks from their home, but the space has been taken over by a neighboring liquor store. ''Right now, I'm unemployed,'' said Mr. Blakey, a slight, soft-spoken man wearing a felt cap. He makes some money cutting hair for a few customers in a makeshift barber shop in the garage.
Ms. Girard-Blakey's job as a receptionist at an office in nearby Mountain View was steady, she said, but it was getting harder to pay the bills, which included credit card debt.
In the summer of 2009, after she missed a mortgage payment, she sought help from Caughern & Associates, a Bedford, Tex., company that offered to get her a better deal on her loan. ''Your chances of avoiding foreclosure are much greater if you have professionals on your side,'' the firm's Web site says. A friend had recommended Caughern, saying they would handle burdensome negotiations for her. So she signed up, instead of calling Chase directly.
Ms. Girard-Blakey now says that was a mistake. ''This was new to me and I didn't know what I was doing,'' she said, shaking her head. ''It seemed like a good idea.''
Ms. Girard-Blakey filled out a packet of forms in July 2009 and paid Caughern one month's mortgage payment in three installments as a fee; that put her further behind on her home loan. The company's representative told her to be patient, so Ms. Girard-Blakey waited a couple of months before following up. When she began calling, she said, she was given various reasons for why no progress had been made; one time, she was told that her representative was on leave having surgery. ''Nothing seemed to happen,'' she said. (Her agreement with Caughern predated federal rules that took effect in January, making it illegal for most mortgage-relief firms to collect advance fees to negotiate modifications.)
Then, in a letter dated Jan. 19, 2010, Chase offered a trial loan modification, under the Home Affordable Modification Program, a federal program to prevent foreclosure that began in 2009. If she made three consecutive loan payments at the reduced amount of $954.18, beginning in March, the letter said, she would be considered for a permanent modification. She was also given a month to submit six separate pieces of information, including pay stubs and a form authorizing release of income tax information from the Internal Revenue Service. Ms. Girard-Blakey signed the forms at the end of January, her records show.
Tim Caughern, chief executive of Caughern & Associates, said the trial modification was the result of an application his firm submitted on Ms. Girard-Blakey's behalf in November 2009. His employees kept notes, he said, which indicate the application was assigned to a negotiator at Chase in early December and that a trial modification offer was sent to her in late January. ''We did everything we were supposed to do, and more,'' Mr. Caughern said.
Caughern's files, he said, indicate that Ms. Girard-Blakey continued to make payments even after the three-month trial was up, and that Chase informed Caughern in early July that it was preparing a permanent modification offer. But on July 26, according to Caughern's notes, the bank told her that her application had been denied; the reason wasn't clear.
Ms. Girard-Blakey said she was disappointed in Caughern's service: ''They didn't get me a permanent modification. That's the bottom line.''
A common criticism of the Home Affordable Modification Program, especially before the middle of 2010, was that banks were unprepared for the onslaught of modification applications and often mishandled paperwork. But according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, it's also not uncommon for modifications to founder when applicants miss paperwork deadlines.
In addition to making the payments, Ms. Girard-Blakey recalls sending in the necessary documents. ''I think they keep losing things,'' she said of Chase.
Chase declined to comment for publication on the specifics of Ms. Girard-Blakey's experience with her loan modification due to ''privacy issues,'' a bank spokesman, Tom Kelly, said in an e-mail. ''We have continued to improve our modification process to help 404,000 families get permanent modifications,'' he said.
Ms. Girard-Blakey then received an invitation from Chase to attend a mortgage modification event in Oakland, where the bank has a home ownership center. As the housing crisis dragged on, Chase set up such centers across the country and sponsored special events, where struggling borrowers could meet in person with modification specialists. One event was held over five days in Oakland in August 2010.
Ms. Girard-Blakey and her husband drove 45 minutes to the event at a Marriott hotel to discuss a modification. In a cavernous ballroom filled with long lines of desks and chairs, and other worried borrowers, ''We filled out all the forms again,'' Ms. Girard-Blakey said.
Mr. Blakey said he was encouraged after the meeting with a Chase representative and believed that the meeting would escalate the modification application. But, when his wife followed up with phone calls, Mr. Blakey said, she was always directed to different people, which was confusing. ''When I called, they said, 'You haven't sent the paperwork in, send it again,' '' she said. ''I kept going, until I got overstressed.''
On Sept. 7, 2010, struggling to pay her bills and her credit card debt, Ms. Girard-Blakey filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. She couldn't afford a lawyer, but paid a document preparer to help her complete the required forms. That seemed to derail her pursuit of a loan modification, she said; in a letter dated Sept. 16, Chase informed her that her home loan was now being monitored by the bank's bankruptcy department. ''I couldn't really understand it,'' she said. ''But everything seemed to stop, after that.''
A bankruptcy filing doesn't disqualify homeowners from obtaining a loan modification, according to the Home Affordable Modification Program Web site. But loan counselors say a filing can slow the approval process -- assuming the borrower wants to keep the home -- in part because many loan servicers have a separate department that handles modification applications from borrowers who are in bankruptcy. The homeowner may need to submit additional forms, and provide updated financial information multiple times, because the department may have the application for several months.
Sitting at her dining room table recently, in an attempt to piece together a paper trail of her experience, Ms. Girard-Blakey shuffled through piles of documents -- letters from Chase and Caughern mingled with oversize envelopes, pay stubs, tax forms and sticky notes scribbled with reminders -- and seemed overwhelmed. ''What am I looking for, again?'' she asked more than once.
She and her husband recalled that as the weeks dragged on, they would find notices on their door indicating that a representative from Chase had stopped by; the notes included a phone number to call. Apparently, the bank was checking to see if the home was occupied; some distressed borrowers were simply abandoning their homes.
Discouraged, Ms. Girard-Blakey became resigned to losing the house. In early 2011, she began packing her belongings in boxes, stacking them in her daughter's former bedroom and looking for apartments to rent. ''I said, I can't do it anymore. They can have the house,'' she recalled.
But that upset her daughter, Rachel Brown, who had grown up in the house. ''She'd been there so long,'' Ms. Brown said in a phone interview. ''I didn't want her to lose the house.'' Ms. Brown had a friend, she said, whose parents were in the same situation and were able to stay in their home with the help of a nonprofit. She got the number and urged her mother to call.
So, with her expectations low, Ms. Girard-Blakey called the nonprofit, called CredAbility, in February. The outfit, based in Atlanta but with a national reach, is approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to work with distressed homeowners on possible solutions, including loan modifications.
A counselor, Carolyn Murray, called Chase with Ms. Girard-Blakey on the phone, so she could give permission for Ms. Murray to speak to the bank on her behalf. Then, Ms. Girard-Blakey again filled out forms and faxed documentation of her employment and income to the lender. Chase confirmed receipt of the application in a letter dated Feb. 25.
''They told me to stay in the house,'' she said, referring to CredAbility. So Ms. Girard-Blakey stayed -- although she didn't unpack her boxes right away.
Ms. Murray said Ms. Girard-Blakey appeared to be a good candidate for a loan modification because she had a steady employment history and had a hardship because of the couple's reduced household income. When evaluating prospects for modification, she said, the program evaluates a borrower's ability to make a given payment based on a percentage of their income, and it appeared Ms. Girard-Blakey could qualify.
Chase next approved another trial modification, which it confirmed in a letter dated July 27. If she made three successive monthly payments of $789.61, the letter said, she would be eligible for a permanent modification. Ms. Girard-Blakey made sure to get the payments in on time. She called Chase weekly to check on the status of her application and faxed supporting documents from her little black bag multiple times -- even if the bank had not requested them -- to make sure they had been received.
On Aug. 19, she received a letter beginning with a single world: ''Congratulations!'' If she filled out two more copies of a new modification agreement and submitted them by Sept. 2, her new payment amount would be permanent, as of Oct. 1. Ms. Girard-Blakey has made that new payment and is confident she can afford to continue doing so.
''I can handle it,'' she said.
She and her husband, meanwhile, are living as frugally as they can. They disconnected their cable television and rely on cellphones, and they are facing a winter without heat in their home. Their furnace needs to be replaced, she said, but they don't have the money to repair it.
To arrive at the lower payment, Chase deferred $99,600 in principal, lengthened the term of the loan to 40 years from 30 and reduced the initial interest rate to 2 percent. Her total loan balance is about $305,000, because of the addition to her principal of missed payments and interest, but her monthly payment is based on a principal amount of $205,402. The rate can increase annually after the first five years, but it is capped at 5 percent. (The deferred principal comes due when the loan matures, or when the house is sold).
''This was a great outcome,'' said Ms. Murray.
The downside of the lower payment is that because the mortgage is extended for another 10 years, it is now scheduled to mature in 2051, when Ms. Girard-Blakey would be 99 years old. She's aware that if she hadn't taken out additional loans on her home over the years, she would probably be finished paying any mortgage. ''I wish I never refinanced,'' she said.
The extra time added to the mortgage, however, is worth it, she said, because she can remain in her home. ''I cherish my little house,'' she said.

HEADLINE: In a Queens Enclave, Often Shopping in Vain

BYLINE: By BETSY VERECKEY

 BODY:
When Nick Bate and his wife decided they wanted to rent an affordable apartment with a third bedroom, they looked across the East River from their Manhattan home to Hunters Point in Long Island City, Queens.
Mr. Bate worried he would miss Manhattan, but a year and a half later, he is happy with his 1,450-square-foot apartment in a waterfront high-rise. An Englishman by birth, Mr. Bate said he fits in with the neighborhood's expatriates who like the short commute to the United Nations, directly across the river.
Once an industrialized area with warehouses and factories, Hunters Point is undergoing a transformation. Last year, there were 11,311 residents living in the area, up almost 64 percent from 10 years ago. Restaurants and bars dot the main thoroughfares, as do places that cater to bicyclists and pet owners. 
But new residents say they are frustrated by a lack of essential services like clothing shops and hardware stores. Also on the wish list are stores that sell toys, housewares, office supplies and electronics.
''We've seen a lot of stores open in our time here, but they've mostly been restaurants,'' Mr. Bate said. ''One day, we needed to buy an extension cord, and we had to get in the car and drive to Roosevelt Island to get one.''
The lack of retail services is puzzling, residential real estate brokers say, because demand for apartments does not appear to be waning. The residential vacancy rate hovers around 3 percent, said Eric Benaim, the chief executive of Modern Spaces, a brokerage firm that handles residential and commercial listings. As of September, the average rent for the neighborhood rose 18.1 percent to $3,453 from a year earlier, according to Streeteasy.
There are thousands of new apartments in the area, and approximately 1,500 units will come onto the market in 2012, and 2,000 more in 2013, said Mr. Benaim, who also expects JetBlue Airways to spur additional demand for retail. The airline is setting up its new headquarters nearby in the Brewster Building in Long Island City.
Mr. Benaim, whose offices are in Hunters Point, acknowledged the need for different kinds of commercial business, especially shops that sell clothing and housewares. He is negotiating a retail space on Jackson Avenue for a wine shop and recently rented a space on Vernon Boulevard for a comedy club. Mr. Benaim also rented out two other retail locations to a beauty parlor and a nail salon, but he said about 80 percent of new businesses were restaurants.
''I think the residents are dying for retail over here,'' Mr. Benaim said, noting empty commercial spaces accessible to foot traffic on Vernon Boulevard and Jackson Avenue, two of the neighborhood's main thoroughfares. ''If a retailer were to come here, they'd do well,'' he added.
Mr. Benaim estimated that on Vernon Boulevard and toward the waterfront, retail space rents for around $50 a square foot, which he said was comparable to other parts of Queens but cheaper than most parts of Brooklyn. On Jackson Avenue, he estimated it was closer to $40 a square foot.
One explanation may be that current and potential business owners are still trying to determine what residents want.
Gayle Baron, the president of the Long Island City Partnership, which promotes economic development in the area, said the retail mix had not adjusted to the relative wealth and youth of the newcomers.
''You had certain types of retail there that may have accommodated long-term residents,'' she said, ''but may not be the same requirements for newer residents because of the difference in age and income level.'' Clothing boutiques would help serve the younger residents in the neighborhood, she added. ''That's the one thing I believe is missing.''
There are also national trends at play. Demand for retail space still remains depressed across the country, especially among independent, small-business owners.
National chains also find it tough to venture into a small community where zoning restrictions may be arduous and community support for them is less than enthusiastic. A Dunkin' Donuts that opened this year on Vernon Boulevard drew criticism from some residents who complained the chain store did not jibe with the mom-and-pop businesses in Hunters Point.
Meanwhile, many commercial real estate landlords nationwide are facing the dilemma of either keeping rents high and losing occupancy or cutting rents and generating lower returns on their real estate investment, said R. J. Milligan, a real estate analyst at Raymond James.
''If you're a landlord and you're charging too much rent,'' Mr. Milligan said, ''it doesn't matter how great the location is. The store has to be profitable.''
Some independent retailers in the area say the new residents are accustomed to shopping elsewhere. Donna Drimer, who owns Matted, a boutique on Vernon Boulevard that sells handmade gifts, jewelry and art frames, recently used Groupon to advertise her store. She said the response was enthusiastic, but only one coupon buyer came from the surrounding neighborhood. The majority of those who bought her coupon came from Manhattan and Brooklyn, others as far away as Connecticut, she said.
''As horrible as it is for the community when the subway is down,'' Ms. Drimer said, ''it's the best day of my week because residents finally walk around the neighborhood to see what's here.''
Looking ahead, the completion of Hunters Point South, a new housing development along the waterfront, is sure to spur demand for additional retail stores, said John Maltz, a Long Island City commercial real estate broker. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg headed the project along the southern tip of the neighborhood's waterfront, which calls for up to 5,000 housing units and roughly 20,000 square feet of new retail space. Additionally, four new buildings by TF Cornerstone, to be called East Coast, along the Long Island City waterfront, will have a combined 26,616 square feet of ground-floor retail space when completed in 2014.

HEADLINE: A Familiar Dream, Still Beyond Reach

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
LIKE many young married people, Steve and Logan Kinney dream of owning a home. So after several years of diligent saving, the couple, both teachers, scoured the listings in Boerum Hill, the leafy Brooklyn neighborhood where they rented. But before long, they realized that home ownership would require living within the four walls of a studio. And even that was a stretch.
''From what I've been told from TV, you are supposed to get a house,'' said Mr. Kinney, 27, referring to the progression of life after marriage. ''And then I get to sit in a nice chair.''
So they kept a sense of humor and broadened their search to seemingly more affordable areas: Jersey City, the Rockaways in Queens and neighborhoods farther out in Brooklyn. Their jobs at opposite ends of the city -- she teaches first graders in Harlem, while he works in Rockaway Park -- further complicated their search. But the real challenge was their price range: with a budget of only $250,000, their quest was over shortly after it began. 
Considering the city where they live, the Kinneys' predicament is not unusual. Yes, prices have tumbled 32 percent from their peaks, according to Fiserv Case-Shiller, and housing is now more affordable across the nation. But the couple lives in one of those places where the crash seemed to play out only on the nightly news. Here, gravity-defying ZIP codes rule the land, pushing home ownership out of reach for everyone but the most affluent.
In fact, prices in several metropolitan areas -- including New York, Los Angeles and Boston -- will end up being higher than their prebubble levels, at least relative to local income, said David Stiff, an economist at Fiserv Case-Shiller, which tracks the real estate market. There are a few reasons, but one of the main drivers is the work force: these areas develop pools of specialized, highly compensated employees. Think of Silicon Valley in Northern California, the financial industry in New York or the biotechnology sector in Boston.
''When that industry booms, it drives up home prices for everyone,'' Mr. Stiff said. ''Through each boom cycle, the price levels relative to income at the end of the cycle will be higher than at the beginning, so you get a ratcheting effect of unaffordability.''
And even though lower- and middle-income households are not directly competing with the wealthier workers for housing, they are still affected. ''Each step of the way they are pushing prices up out to my market,'' he added. ''So in many instances, the only option is an extremely long commute.''
When prices peaked, the median cost nationwide of a single-family home was $226,000, four times the median income. Since then prices have dropped to levels last seen in the mid-'90s: at $166,000, that's about 2.7 times the median income of $61,593, according to Fiserv.
But things begin to look a lot less affordable when you consider hot spots like Los Angeles. The median home there costs about 5.86 times the median income, compared with 4.89 in San Francisco. New York isn't far behind: the median home runs about 4.62 times the median income, in part because of foreign buyers who take advantage of a weaker dollar. In Boston, it costs 3.7 times median income.
For many would-be buyers, that means it is simply more affordable to rent. But that can be frustrating for people who thought they had done everything right, except for choosing a higher-paying profession. The Kinneys both went to Rutgers, a public university in their home state, to keep student debts manageable. Instead of attending graduate programs at costly private schools, they became New York City Teaching Fellows, an intensive teacher-training program that subsidizes the cost of a master's degree in education.
When they moved in together, the couple began saving about $700 each month, and Mr. Kinney helped his future wife extinguish the credit card loans she had accumulated in school. Their wedding, two years ago, was a small affair in Ms. Kinney's mother's backyard in New Jersey, where Mr. Kinney's father served as the photographer. They honeymooned in Paris, but did it on a student's budget, staying in hostels and subsisting on baguettes.
Today, they have no debt other than Ms. Kinney's student loans, which total about $25,000 -- not too bad, relative to many of her peers. They've been saving about $1,000 most months and put an additional 15 percent away for retirement. They both have credit scores that top the enviable 800 mark.
So why can't their savings yield enough money for a hefty down payment? ''It feels like anytime we hit around $20,000 something terrible or some unexpected thing happens,'' Mr. Kinney said of their savings which reached about $22,000 at its peak. He planned on coming up with another $20,000 for their down payment by borrowing from his pension.
But that still wasn't enough to stretch their price range much further. Since then, their savings has dwindled a bit, largely because so many things need to go right for it to grow. About a year and a half ago, Ms. Kinney was working as a special education teacher through an agency, but her small caseload and collection of part-time jobs didn't generate enough income.
Mr. Kinney recently returned to graduate school, because more credits will lead to a higher paycheck, while Ms. Kinney spent about $2,500 getting certified in yoga instruction so she can teach during the summers. Their quest to find a cheaper rental also cost them thousands in brokers fees each time they moved. Then there's the $800 they had to spend on shots for Marley and Bucu, their dog and cat.
''Unless you are a lawyer, owning a home is out of the question,'' said Mr. Kinney, adding that they would need to save the equivalent of one year's salary, before taxes, to come up with the full 20 percent down payment needed to avoid private mortgageinsurance. ''That's a lot of money and assumes nothing ever comes up.''
And that doesn't even include the $10,000 cushion they would like to keep in the bank -- after the down payment and closing costs -- which would make them comfortable buying.
Saving that much has always been a slog, which is why experts say that first-time home buyers rarely come up with the full 20 percent down payment. In fact, more than 53 percent of first-time home buyers obtain mortgages through the Federal Housing Administration's program, where government-insured loans permit borrowers to put as little as 3.5 percent down, according to a September survey of 2,500 real estate brokers conducted by Inside Mortgage Finance and Campbell Surveys.
Only about 11.2 percent of first-time home buyers took traditional mortgages that are backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The remainder paid with cash, private financing, or through programs sponsored by the Veterans Affairs or Agriculture Departments.
The Kinneys were considering an F.H.A. mortgage, but for now, they're back to watching their spending. They rarely eat out, though they do splurge on organic produce. Mr. Kinney said he could draw a map of the city's best happy hours, which ''dovetails nicely with the fact that we're public school teachers and have been up since 5 a.m.''; they are ready for bed soon after the specials are over. He has worn the same $20 sneakers for two years. They reward themselves with one vacation a year, which is typically financed with half of their tax refund. The other half is saved.
The couple said they were grateful for what they have. Still, the inability to buy makes them feel as if they are living an extended adolescence, especially because they're eager to start a family. ''There is something about that that makes you feel like you are not fully a member of society,'' Mr. Kinney said.
''You still feel like a child,'' Ms. Kinney added, conceding that sometimes she feels that the goal is so far off that it's not even worth trying. But during those moments, Mr. Kinney, the money manager, tries to keep them focused (just don't tell him it's a great time to buy). The couple might also move West at some point, but not until the economy improves. And right now, they love living in New York.
Meanwhile, they have managed to find a two-bedroom rental that feels more like home, a few blocks from the sand and surf in the Rockaway Beach section of Queens. At $1,600, it costs the same as the dark basement studio they had rented in Brooklyn. ''Rockaway Beach is a little far out there,'' Ms. Kinney said of her three-hour round-trip commute, ''but whenever I come home I will have the ocean at my door.''
And that doesn't cost their down payment fund anything at all.

HEADLINE: They Walked Away, and They're Glad They Did

BYLINE: By TESS VIGELAND; Devin Maverick Robins contributed reporting.

 BODY:
JON WITTENBERG and Bill Sawyer have never met. One lives in Walnut Creek, Calif., the other in Wilsonville, Ore. But if they did, the conversation might be littered with exclamations like, ''That's exactly what happened to me!''
Their stories start with a mid-decade home purchase and turn sharply as they simply walk away from those homes and the mortgages that accompany them. What was supposed to happen next was that their financial lives would crash and burn for years.
Or so the dire warnings went. In reality, both men said, walking away turned out to be the best financial decision they made.
In 2005, Mr. Wittenberg, 42, was working in the pharmaceutical industry in Boulder, Colo., when his employer told him he would be relocated to Southern California. It was two years to the day since he had bought a house, and he had no trouble selling it. 
When he got to Agoura Hills, north of Los Angeles, Mr. Wittenberg said, he could not believe the pressure to buy another home. ''Everybody was making tons of money,'' he said. ''My company had a relocation expert who said, 'I'm going to have to insist that you buy property.' My only hesitation was it seemed like prices were inflated. Little one-bedroom condos were half a million dollars.''
Mr. Wittenberg bought a two-story, 1,300-square-foot condominium for $450,000 in April 2006, putting 20 percent down on a 30-year fixed mortgage with Wells Fargo. And the bank promptly offered him a line of credit, he said: ''They were handing mortgages out like candy, and I was able to borrow from the house on Day 1 of signing the loan.'' A Wells Fargo mortgage spokeswoman, Vickee Adams, confirmed last week that Mr. Wittenberg had been a customer but said that because of confidentiality laws, the bank could not release any additional information.
A year and a half after getting his mortgage, he was laid off, along with 3,300 co-workers. But he found a new job almost immediately, with a renewable-energy company. It meant yet another relocation, to San Francisco. So he turned the condo into a rental and headed north.
But Mr. Wittenberg found himself agreeing to lower and lower rents, eventually resulting in a monthly shortfall of $1,200 between the rental income and his mortgage payment. By 2009, comparable homes in the area were selling for $210,000, and he still owed more than $300,000. He tried for a year and a half to get the bank to modify his loan, he said, to no avail. So with the help of YouWalkAway.com, he decided to stop paying. YouWalkAway.com is a company that sprang up in 2007 to help homeowners through the foreclosure process, specifically what is called a strategic default. In that instance, even if you can afford to make mortgage payments, you stop paying to force the bank into foreclosing.
The company charges clients an enrollment fee of $199 to $395, and monthly membership fees ranging from $29.95 to $99.95, depending on which assistance plan a homeowner chooses. Then it essentially coaches clients through the process of walking away from their mortgages, helps them figure out which threatening letters to pay attention to and which to ignore and provides access to lawyers versed in each state's property laws.
As YouWalkAway.com points out in its materials, there is usually no paperwork or response required from homeowners: they should track what documents the bank sends, but other than that, the process is fairly simple. ''We looked at how much my home was under water, how much I'd lost thus far and how much I would continue to lose until I started to break even,'' he said. ''And that could be 20 years away. It was a no-brainer.''
YouWalkAway.com's chief executive, Jon Maddux, said that was how it should be -- a no-brainer -- for hundreds of thousands of people who were underwater on their mortgages.
''I think as more and more people know someone that's done it, they know that, O.K., these people have moved on, they kind of pushed the reset button, and they're starting over,'' he said.
For many Americans, a mortgage is about more than money. It's a contract that should not be broken, a debt that should under almost all circumstances be paid. In this context, walking away has been framed as an ethical or moral issue.
But many economists, and legal professionals, say it's not and is simply a matter of contract law. ''If your home is a financial asset, and it's financially rational to walk away, that's what you do,'' said Nicolas Retsinas of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard.
Mr. Maddux of YouWalkAway.com said his site had helped more than 7,000 homeowners walk away and that, for most of them, a change in their all-important credit score was the biggest downside.
Among the company's clients, the average score drops 100 points, he said. Fair Isaac, which provides the industry-standard FICO credit score, released a study this year showing similar results.
But if someone's original score is on the high end, say a 780, that person will take a bigger hit (150 points on average) in a foreclosure or short sale than someone who has a lower score of 680 or 720 to begin with.
The bigger surprise, according to YouWalkAway.com, is that many clients are finding their scores begin to recover within the first few months of a foreclosure's becoming final. Mr. Wittenberg said he knew the decision to walk away could spell doom for his score, which was in the low-to-mid 700s, and he didn't know what other financial complications might arise.
''Am I going to have to pay this back? What are these banks capable of doing to me? Buying a house again? Out of the question,'' he said. ''So here I am, upper middle class, I have two degrees, and I'm stuck. Just because I wanted to end the hemorrhaging.''
The impact so far? There hasn't been any. At least for him.
Mr. Wittenberg lives in his girlfriend's house in Walnut Creek, so he didn't have to worry about a landlord checking his credit. He has a job he enjoys. And he said he was done with debt forever. He doesn't have any credit cards. His car is paid off. ''I live in a cash world, and I want to keep it that way,'' he said.
He hasn't checked his FICO score and doesn't want or intend to. He shredded every last piece of paperwork from his mortgage and foreclosure.
That's not to say he has not paid a price, though. He lost his entire down payment and drained a significant portion of his savings account to make up for the monthly rental shortfall.
Mr. Wittenberg said he never planned to walk away from his debts and if the bank had lowered his interest rate by a percentage point or two, he could have continued to rent it out.
In the end, his financial stability, both short term and long term -- it would take up to 20 years to break even on the home -- trumped any ethical or moral questions he had about honoring his contract with the bank.
What saddens Mr. Wittenberg, he said, is the loss of a home. ''I did a lot of work on it, did it all myself, and it was nice,'' he said. ''But it's O.K. I've moved on.''
He did note that the lack of permanence in the job market made owning a home for any length of time more difficult.
''It's not like our parents, where they worked at the same place for 40 years,'' he said. ''So when you own a house, it's a huge burden. It's almost like renting is peace of mind.''
SIX hundred miles north, in the rural community of Wilsonville, Ore., Bill Sawyer, 50, sat at a desk just off the kitchen in his apartment in a multiunit complex near the I-5 freeway, about 17 miles south of Portland.
Mr. Sawyer, who works as an operations and policy analyst for a state government agency, said a couple of years ago, his credit score was in the low 700s. That's about average on the Fair Isaac scale, which tops out at 850.
He knows his score has gone down, because he stopped paying the mortgage on his former residence, a small town house in nearby West Linn, more than a year ago. But he has no idea how much. He bought the town house in 2000 for $138,000, with a loan from the Federal Housing Administration and a small down payment. Mr. Sawyer was a single father to Vanessa, who was 12 at the time, and Daniel, who was 11.
Over the next few years, the town house's appraised value grew to $256,000. The mortgage holder, Wells Fargo, approved two cash-out refinancings, and Mr. Sawyer said he used that money to pay down other debts.
''They just crunched the numbers like a car salesman might, and, you know, you sign the dotted line,'' he said.
Then in 2007, his son, then 18, was killed, along with a friend, in a head-on collision with a truck.
Aside from the emotional and psychological devastation, the accident sent Mr. Sawyer into a financial tailspin. Insurance coverage was minimal, he said, and he was billed by the towing company and the volunteer fire department that responded to the accident.
''There were financial hardships as a result of funeral expenses and so forth,'' he said in a low voice. ''That started a chain reaction. A maxed-out credit card and line of credit. When you have a limited income, and you make minimum payments, well, that debt just keeps going.''
Within a year, the housing market collapsed. Similar town houses started selling for $180,000, and with the equity he had taken out over the years, he owed more on the mortgage than his home was worth. He said he spent months trying to negotiate with the bank for a loan modification. When he was unsuccessful, he abandoned the property in March of this year, with the help of YouWalkAway.
Mr. Sawyer had not wanted to check what that had done to his credit scores, but he did. ''Oh, boy,'' he said, with a small, uncomfortable chuckle, as he waited for numbers to pop up on his laptop's screen.
''Oh gosh. Never has it been that low. TransUnion 535. Equifax 520. Pretty much start over from the bottom of the barrel now.''
It's not the bottom of the barrel, but it's close, and it was made worse by a bankruptcy filing over the summer. The resulting damage to his credit history is what Mr. Sawyer worried about most.
He has what he thinks is a stable job, he said, and he made sure to secure his current apartment before leaving his other property, in case a low score scared away potential landlords. But if something happened with his job, and he had to move, he said his decision to walk away could make everything more difficult.
A future landlord could decide not to rent to him. Insurance companies could decide to raise his rates.
One thing Mr. Sawyer and Mr. Wittenberg do not have to worry about is banks coming after them for the mortgage debt they left behind. California and Oregon are nonrecourse states, which means that lenders cannot take homeowners to court to get that money back. Many other states -- including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as Nevada, a foreclosure hub -- do allow recourse. In those cases, walking away can exact a much higher price.
For now, Mr. Sawyer said he felt relief. ''We were happy in that home,'' he said. ''But I didn't see any other way to resolve this matter without pretty much putting money down the drain for years to come.''
And the financial recovery appears to have started already. Mr. Sawyer was approved last month for a credit card through Capital One. It has a $300 limit and a 22 percent interest rate, but he said he planned to use it and pay it off each month. ''I'm going to live within my means and kind of start from scratch,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Three Generations, Two Comfy Homes A Few Steps Apart

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
ON a recent Sunday evening, Wanda Urbanska and her family gathered around the table to catch up over cabbage and potato pierogies. Her 89-year-old mother, a retired college professor, sat across from Henry, her 14-year-old grandson, whose blue T-shirt matched the swaths of color in his hair. He told the women about the rave he attended the night before, where he ''jumped up and down for three hours.''
At the end of the night, Henry typically takes his grandmother by the arm and walks her home. She lives in a small cottage in the backyard, a few steps away from the table where they all dine together.
This scene plays out at their home in Raleigh, N.C., every night, and, increasingly, in more American households across the country. Multigenerational homes are becoming more common, as financial strains and joblessness force many families to double up. But for others, it is simply about being closer, or making life easier in other ways, whether grandma is looking after the children or a grown child is looking after an elderly parent. 
While moving in together can make a lot of financial sense, these arrangements are not without their challenges. Families that want to expand or retrofit their home may encounter architectural or zoning issues. And if they are shopping for a home together, they need to reach some sort of consensus. Then there are the issues of mental space and of family dynamics.
''The arrangement is not for everybody,'' said Michael Litchfield, author of ''In-laws, Outlaws and Granny Flats,'' a guide to turning one house into two homes. ''It is like having two sovereign nations next to each other.''
For Ms. Urbanska, a media consultant and author, the economics of shared living have eased some of the financial pressures she faces as a single mother. Together, she and her mother, Marie Whittaker, bought the three-bedroom home for $370,000 last year. They each contributed $60,000 to the down payment, which consumed a considerable portion of their liquid savings, or money that was not tied up elsewhere.
''It wouldn't have been possible for either of us to purchase this property without pooling resources,'' Ms. Urbanska, 55, said.
The physical configuration of the gray clapboard house, built in 1928, is ideally suited for the family. Ms. Whittaker's two-bedroom apartment -- also known as an in-law unit or a granny flat, among other things -- is in a detached structure. The two women are near enough to see the same bird feeder -- from Ms. Urbanska's office window and from Ms. Whittaker's living room window -- but they can also retreat to their own space.
''She is kind of messy, and it really bothers me,'' Ms. Urbanska said.
''Kind of messy?'' Ms. Whittaker chimed in. ''Very messy.''
Their differing approaches to clutter and cleaning led to their decision to seek out a home with two separate kitchens, though Ms. Urbanska does most of the cooking. ''I keep an eye on her, and she on me, but we're not living on top of each other,'' Ms. Urbanska said.
And because their home included the cottage -- the cottage also includes a second-floor studio apartment, which is rented for $495 a month -- they did not need to contend with any zoning regulations or other restrictions. Most of the changes they made were cosmetic, though they did renovate the bathroom in Ms. Whittaker's unit.
Zoning, which varies across the country, can create a variety of obstacles, whether a family wants to add a free-standing unit like Ms. Whittaker's, expand the existing home or create an apartment above a garage or in the basement. But architects and other housing experts say that is slowly changing, at least in some areas.
According to the American Planning Association, at least four states -- California, Massachusetts, Vermont and Washington -- have enacted laws encouraging or requiring changes to the zoning rules to permit the so-called accessory dwelling units, also called A.D.U.'s. Architects said that parts of Oregon, Colorado, Texas and Virginia had also become more accommodating. And last year in New York, then-Gov. David Paterson signed a law that will ultimately develop model planning and zoning guidelines for communities to create senior housing and granny flat accommodations.
''The trend is that more and more cities and towns are interested in implementing some form of A.D.U., whether by right or special permit use,'' said William Klein, director of research at the American Planning Association.
But even in communities that have liberalized their rules, there can still be several challenges at the local level. Parking is a big one because many areas require the unit to have an extra space off the street, and there may be rules as to where the spot can sit on the property. Many locales also require minimum lot sizes; in Berkeley, Calif., for instance, the property must be at least 4,500 square feet, according to a research paper that studied secondary units in the East Bay area. Others might require the unit to be a certain number of feet from the rear and side property lines. In fact, all the rules have driven many homeowners to just roll the dice and add the units without their community's blessing.
Advocates of in-law units say they also address the changing face of families and their economic circumstances. They can provide an extra income source, or allow elderly people to remain in their communities. They can also create a source of affordable housing, they say, at no cost to the government.
In fact, a cottage industry is beginning to develop. Several companies specialize in designing these units. Sidekick Homes, a two-year-old firm in Denver, designs them and then hires local builders to execute the plans.
Meanwhile, Larson Shores in Oakland, Calif., is working on its first ''inspired in-law unit.'' Carrie Shores, an architect and a principal in the firm, said that she and her partner wanted to make the cost of building their units competitive with the annual cost of a stay in a nursing home. The architectural plans for the one-bedroom cottages, which are approximately 500 square feet, start at $2,500. The homeowner can then hire a local builder to complete the project, or work with the firm to obtain a prefab structure.
Proponents of these arrangements point to the coastal city of Santa Cruz, Calif., as a model. It liberalized its zoning ordinance in 2002, which made it easier for homeowners to add a unit and encouraged them to do so. It also loosened some of its parking requirements and went as far as providing homeowners with a guide, including prototypes designed by architects that were preapproved by the city's building department.
The city also tried to address objections from neighbors, said Carol Berg, housing and community development manager for Santa Cruz. The main home or the unit needs to be owner-occupied, for instance, and the new unit can be built only on a lot of at least 5,000 square feet. ''Everything is intended to minimize impact on adjacent neighbors and the visual quality of the neighborhood,'' she added.
Besides the neighbors, cost is a consideration. Creating a unit within the footprint of the existing home is less expensive. Carving out a couple of rooms and adding a kitchenette is also typically more economical than, say, renovating an attic, which often requires structural work because it was meant for storage, Mr. Litchfield, the author, said.
But there are savings to be had, too. Ms. Urbanska and Ms. Whittaker divide most of their bills, including the mortgage and property taxes. They recently split a $60 grocery bill, and because Ms. Whittaker no longer drives, Ms. Urbanska sold her 2007 Toyota Prius and kept her mother's 10-year-old Subaru. ''In general, living together can save a lot of money,'' she said.
Besides the financial benefits, probably the most satisfying part of their situation is the comfort and security found in their routine, such as their nightly dinner in the main house. ''It's much better than being alone, with a cat,'' Ms. Whittaker said. ''As nice as cats are.''

HEADLINE: Despite Critics, Mortgage Deduction Resists Change

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
IF you ask most people about the possibility of reducing or eliminating the tax deduction for interest on home mortgages, you will generally hear the same things that you would if you suggested altering Social Security benefits.
It's political suicide. It will crush an already anemic economy. It's downright un-American.
Talk to most economists, though, and they are likely to question the rationale of having a tax deduction at all. They will tell you that countries like Australia, Canada and Britain do not have a deduction for mortgage interest, yet have higher rates of homeownership than the United States. And they will ask, what behavior is the United States government trying to encourage by favoring homeowners over renters?
Homeownership would be the obvious answer, but it is an incomplete one. ''Its intention was to increase the rate of homeownership,'' said Celia Chen, a senior director and housing economist at Moody's Analytics. ''It hasn't helped to expand homeownership, but it's helped to support purchases of larger homes.'' 
Many lower-income homeowners do not itemize their tax returns, because they do not have enough deductions to make it worthwhile. In filing the basic 1040 form, they do not benefit from the deduction. Many older Americans -- perhaps as few as 10 percent, according to one study -- do not benefit from it either, because they have paid off their mortgages entirely or rent.
The deduction overwhelmingly favors wealthier homeowners. The limits are quite high -- up to $1 million of a mortgage's value and an additional $100,000 for home equity loans -- and the amount that can be deducted does not fall as people's incomes rise. And the deduction is not limited to a primary residence, so someone with two or three homes that fall under that $1 million limit could claim the deduction. Even so, it is one of the few benefits for the wealthy that seems not to have been swept up in the recent tax-the-rich movements.
''Surveys that ask people if they're supportive of it get very broad-based support, because renters aspire to be homeowners,'' said Eric Belsky, managing director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard. ''The idea that it won't be available to them when it was available to others doesn't seem fair.''
A New York Times/CBS News poll in June found that 9 in 10 Americans thought homeownership was an important part of the American dream, while 45 percent of respondents felt that the government should be doing more to help the housing market.
Is it tenable to maintain the mortgage interest deduction? Here is a look at the state of the deduction.
ITS FUTURE The deduction began when the federal tax code was created in 1913. At the time, all interest was deductible because the government considered it a business expense. The mortgage interest deduction survived the overhaul of the tax code in 1986 when interest on credit cards, which had also been deductible, was eliminated.
No one I spoke to was willing to wager that the mortgage interest deduction would go away. That was one proposal in the report released by Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, who headed a bipartisan panel created at the behest of President Obama to find solutions to the fiscal problems the United States faces.
The Simpson-Bowles report also offered a second idea: reduce the limit on the deduction to $500,000 of a mortgage's value from $1 million, eliminate the deduction for home equity loans and prohibit people from deducting the interest on a second home.
Robert Pozen, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and the former chairman of MFS Investment Management, said that approach was a logical way to reduce the cost of the deduction without discouraging people from buying homes. ''These three aspects have a weak relationship at best to promoting homeownership,'' he said. ''How is this goal furthered by the mortgage interest deduction for a second home in the mountains?''
He calculated that taking those three steps would save the government $150 billion over the next decade.
The real estate lobby objects strongly to any change in the current limits, even for second homes.
''Our members believe tinkering with the mortgage interest deduction at the high end will trickle down,'' said Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. He argued that with a reduction at the top level, prices on more expensive homes would fall, but so too would prices on less expensive homes as certain buyers realized they could not afford as much house without the deduction.
''People view this as part of the social contract, as something that represents the American dream,'' Mr. Yun said. ''Therefore any changes are changes to the property rights of homeowners.''
THE COST In addition to being one of the oldest federal tax deductions, the mortgage interest deduction is the largest one.
The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it cost $90 billion last year and would cost $484 billion from 2010 to 2014. Depending on your point of view, this is either a very large revenue loss to the federal government or a very large saving for homeowning taxpayers.
About a quarter of all tax filers claim the deduction, said Mr. Belsky at Harvard. But a look at some other numbers shows how the deduction affects Americans disproportionately.
Sid Rosenberg, the William F. Sheffield Professor of Real Estate at the University of North Florida, calculated that the deduction would mean little to a person buying or selling a house in Florida, where the median price is $135,000. He estimated interest deductions of $7,000, which is below the standard deduction of $11,600 that a couple get if they do not itemize all of their deductions on their tax return.
''To me it's a heck of a lot more valuable to people in New York than people in Florida,'' he said. ''If you're moderate income and you're in Florida, you're probably not going to get much effective deduction. It's certainly not the case that not having it is going to hurt poor people, at least not down here.''
But it does have an impact in states where income and housing prices are higher. Melissa Labant, technical manager at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, calculated two situations for middle- and upper-income homeowners in more expensive states.
In the first situation, consider a couple who earn $137,300 a year and are in the 25 percent tax bracket. If they owned a $350,000 house paying 5 percent interest on their mortgage, they would save $4,375 a year on interest of about $17,500.
For the wealthiest homeowners the deduction is far better. People with $1 million homes with the same 5 percent rate would be paying $50,000 a year in interest. As they would most likely be in the top 35 percent tax bracket, they would save $17,500 a year in federal taxes through the deduction.
''The problem is, everyone's information is different, and that's what makes it so challenging,'' Ms. Labant said. ''High-income taxpayers have benefited the most from being able to take advantage of the mortgage interest deduction.''
That should not be surprising -- bigger mortgages equate to more interest and bigger deductions. But it does contradict the belief that the deduction helps lower-income people buy their first homes.
IMPACT ON HOUSING The big question is what effect changing the mortgage interest deduction would have on the housing market. In the short term, it would be bad, and given the weak housing market, it could be worse than at some other time.
A change to the deduction would hurt people who already own homes more than new buyers, in two ways. If homeowners wanted to sell, they would, on average, get less for their house. That's because the prospective buyers would have to recalculate what they could afford to pay each month toward their mortgage -- and thus the purchase price -- if the deduction disappeared.
''The price of the deduction is built into the home, so eliminating it would have a negative impact in the near term,'' said Ms. Chen of Moody's Analytics. ''If you reduced the limit of the deduction, it would hit higher-end housing, but the impact on lower-income households isn't that great.''
First-time and lower-income buyers might get a break, however, because housing prices would be lower. Ms. Chen said the absence of a deduction was not likely to affect the number of homes sold at the high end because wealthier buyers would most likely still want to own a nice home (though it might affect the price, at least in the short term).
Where eliminating the deduction would have an impact would be on people who itemized their taxes and took the deduction. Mr. Belsky estimated that eliminating the deduction would increase their taxes, on average, about $2,400 a year. And in the broader economy, that means less demand for goods and services from spenders and less money for savers to use to buy stocks and bonds.
Ultimately a reduction of the deduction would not quash the American dream of homeownership and, if modified, it might help certain buyers get their first homes. But it is impossible to predict what might happen given the current political stalemate. Besides, most of the conversation in Washington is about revenue, not about the harder philosophical question of what the deduction is meant to do.
''We as a country should decide what types of homeowners we want to subsidize and how,'' Mr. Pozen said. ''At present, we have a vaguely defined policy goal together with programs that are not well designed to accomplish that goal.''

HEADLINE: Wealthy Buyers Fuel Market for Second Homes

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
FAIGIE RICHMAN used to tell everyone that she never wanted to live in Florida. She enjoyed visiting her husband's family in Boca Raton, but the lifestyle simply did not suit her. She didn't play golf or tennis and had no desire to learn either. And she and her husband already owned a second home, on a pond in Rhode Island, that their three children loved.
So she was just as surprised as anyone when she and her husband ended up with two condominiums in Miami Beach, 50 miles south of Boca Raton, this spring. They had gone to Miami Beach to look at a condo for their daughter and report back. Instead, they closed on that one and another in the building in a matter of weeks.
''We're not the type of people who do things spontaneously,'' she said. ''We thought it was a good opportunity to get in at the ground floor.'' 
Sitting in their uncluttered one-bedroom condo, with Biscayne Bay stretching out before her, Mrs. Richman, 56, said she and her husband felt like newlyweds again. And their apartment, built many booms and busts ago in 1962, is indeed very new to them. When Mrs. Richman was interviewed, the couple had lived in the condo for only six weeks, three in the spring when they bought it and three after arriving for the season at the beginning of October.
Although they have been struggling to find a buyer for their primary residence in West Hartford, Conn., Mrs. Richman said she was relishing having less stuff and more things to do when her husband travels.
In this she sounds no different from the snowbirds of the decades before her, lured to Florida by the promise of sun, fun and far fewer responsibilities. Yet the purchases were not some flight of fancy -- and plenty of other people are shopping opportunistically just as the Richmans did. The combination of low prices for vacation properties, the volatility in the stock and bond markets and the American love of property is proving too tempting for people seeking second homes in desirable locales.
Take Miami, just a few years ago a symbol of the excesses of the real estate boom. Sales in Miami were up 34.1 percent in September from the same month last year, according to the National Association of Realtors.
Sales in other hard-hit areas also rose. Atlanta was up 24.7 percent and Phoenix was up 25.3 percent in September.
According to a separate report by the Miami Association of Realtors released last month, sales in Miami were on pace to hit 29,000 this year, higher than the record set in 2005. That said, prices are nowhere near what they were in those frothier days. While condo prices rose 17 percent in September, they were coming off a very low base; prices for single-family homes continued to fall, down 6 percent to $131,000.
The Richmans see the two condos as investments. They paid cash for them, just as they would have if they had made investments in a brokerage account. (The Miami Association of Realtors said 63 percent of buyers this year paid cash, compared with 30 percent nationwide, according to the national Realtors' report. Most of those buyers, the organization said, were investors.)
Mrs. Richman said they had paid $217,000 for a condo in foreclosure on the 10th floor for their daughter Alanna, a jewelry designer who divides her time between New York and Miami Beach. They considered this a deal because it needed work. ''It had black floors,'' she said, which they knew would be expensive to refinish.
For their own unit, on the 12th floor, Mrs. Richman said she thought they had paid about $50,000 too much, but they wanted something in move-in condition, and it had recently been renovated. At $370,000, the price was still below the condo's replacement value, the real estate term for what it would cost to rebuild it.
''We're going to try it for a year,'' she said. ''It's just another asset class. We think it will go up in value.''
In a time of financial and economic uncertainty, both snowbirds and international clients seem to be motivated by more than Miami Beach's natural beauty. ''There's a certain confidence in parking their cash here right now, as opposed to leaving it in the stock market or whatever country they're from,'' Allison Turk, an agent with EWM Realtors, said.
Across Biscayne Bay, in Miami proper, the story is slightly different. During the bust, many high-rise condominium complexes that sprang up along the water remained vacant and unfurnished, leading to the joke that they were not seafront but ''see through.'' Ms. Turk said the buildings were no longer unoccupied but filled with renters, not the buyers developers had hoped for.
Another difference from years past is who is buying. It is not the leveraged buyer of the boom but wealthier people who are looking for safe harbors for their money. Their hope is for a 2 or 3 percent return on the properties today that will grow to an 8 or 10 percent return in five to 10 years.
Such returns would be very generous -- or the sign of another bubble. But buyers believe that vacation homes in crucial markets are priced at the bottom, while investors from abroad see these areas as safe harbors that could drive up their returns.
Marlon Young, chief executive of HSBC's private bank in the Americas, said many of his wealthy clients in Latin America, particularly Brazil, were buying upward of 20 properties in hard-hit vacation areas like Florida and California just for this reason.
''They've increased their exposure to real estate from 10 to 15 percent to 15 to 30 percent'' of their overall portfolios, Mr. Young said, adding, ''If you can buy real estate at or just slightly above replacement cost, that is a screaming buy for these clients. They're not new to the real estate market.''
Of course, not everyone is so sanguine on real estate as an investment. David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, a wealth management firm, said anyone buying a second home should think of it as a consumption good and not an investment. He said the idea that it would appreciate in value was a return to the mind-set that got so many Americans saddled with homes they could not afford -- and may now be selling at a loss as demand perks up.
''Go ahead -- buy it and enjoy it but don't treat it as an investment,'' Mr. Rosenberg said. ''I'm not saying houses are going down another 30 percent. The worst is behind us. Eventually the market will clear, but it will clear at a lower price.''
For most people, paying cash for a house is not realistic. Bob Donovan, regional sales executive for the New York-New Jersey area at Bank of America Home Loans, said it was a misconception that mortgages were not available for second homes.
''There's financing available, but we're in a full documentation environment,'' Mr. Donovan said. ''Where transactions get held up, whether primary or secondary homes, is those situations where we don't have a full picture upfront. It just leaves an open hole for something for go wrong.''
Buyers should expect to put down 20 to 30 percent of the value of the property. And they should not expect to move quickly. Mr. Donovan said the bank no longer preapproved buyers for a mortgage but gave them what he called a ''prequalification'' to tell them what type of financing was available to them.
He said the most successful applicants were the ones who provided all of their income and credit information in advance and took the time to make sure it was complete and verifiable.
For Mrs. Richman, a youthful woman who smiles easily, being in her new condo clearly makes her happy. She has already had a favorite item, gigantic purple chair, shipped from Connecticut, and she said she was excited about her children and friends visiting this winter.
But she also is keenly aware that their investment is doing well. Their daughter fixed up her apartment and is applying for a mortgage to pay back her parents. ''It's already gone up $15,000 since April,'' Mrs. Richman said.
And so the real estate cycle begins again.

HEADLINE: 'I Should Have Known Better': How a Financial Pro Lost His House

BYLINE: By CARL RICHARDS. 
Carl Richards's book, ''The Behavior Gap: Simple Ways to Stop Doing Dumb Things With Money,'' will be released on Jan. 3.

 BODY:
ONE night a few years ago, when the value of our home had collapsed, our debt was out of control and my financial planning business was shaky, I went to take out the trash.
There was this enormous window that looked right in on the kitchen table, and through it I could see my wife, Cori, and our four children eating dinner. It was dark outside, so they couldn't see me, and I just stood there looking at them.
After a while, I pulled up a bucket and I sat on it, just watching my children eat. I found myself wishing that I could get back there, connected to the simple ordinary stuff of my family's life. And as I sat and watched, filled with longing and guilt, two questions kept arising:
How did I get here? 
And how am I going to get out of this?
There are many stories these days of people who lost their financial bearings during the housing boom and the crisis that followed, but my story is a bit different from most.
I'm a financial adviser. I get paid to help people make smart financial choices, and I speak and write about personal finance issues for this publication and others. My first book comes out in January, ''The Behavior Gap: Simple Ways to Stop Doing Dumb Things With Money'' (Portfolio, a Penguin imprint).
The thing that few people know, though, is that I learned a lot of this from experience. I made a bunch of mistakes, the very same ones that I now go around warning people to avoid.
So this is the story of how I lost my home, the profound ethical questions that arose along the way, and what my wife and I learned from the mistakes that led us to that point. It made me better at what I do, but it wasn't much fun getting there.
Like most financial stories, this one is personal. It starts with me getting into the financial services industry more or less by accident. I answered an ad in 1995 that I thought was for a job related to ''security'' (as in security guard) but was in fact related to ''securities.'' That's how little I knew about the stock market. A few months later I found myself working a phone at a Fidelity Investments call center.
Things went well, and by 1999 I was a Merrill Lynch financial adviser and a certified financial planner. By then, we also owned a house in Salt Lake City. We'd bought it two years earlier, with a $25,000 down payment.
A few years later, an opportunity arose to form a partnership with a successful Merrill adviser in Las Vegas. The place was on our top 10 list of never-move-to cities because we had always associated it with the Strip. But Cori and I were looking for an opportunity to have an experience somewhere else, and we met some great people when we visited the city. I took the job, and we moved down there.
That was May 2003. Housing prices were already crazy, so we rented. But our neighborhood had zero character and lots of cookie-cutter houses. Within a few weeks, we were looking for a place to buy.
I felt we could afford around $350,000. We called a real estate agent named Mitch, who had signs on all the bus stops: Talk to Mitch! He picked us up in a gold Jaguar, and suddenly we were looking at houses that listed at $500,000 or more.
It felt a little crazy to be shopping for houses that cost half a million dollars, but my income was growing rapidly. Everywhere I looked, people were being rewarded for buying as much house as they could possibly afford, and then some. There was this excitement in the air, almost like static. I started to think that if I didn't buy a house right then, I would never be able to afford one.
At moments during our house hunt, I felt in my gut that something wasn't right. We'd go to open houses for $400,000 homes and see lines of couples in their late 20s -- younger than we were -- waiting to get inside. I kept wondering where all the money was coming from. How did all these people make so much?
But prices just kept rising, and when people kept buying, that made it seem safer. I knew from my work as a financial adviser that following the crowd could be costly. But like everyone else, I felt safer in a crowd.
We didn't find anything we liked with Mitch, but one day in September 2003 Cori spotted a for-sale-by-owner sign in a really nice neighborhood. We ended up buying the house and paid the asking price of $575,000. (When we tried to negotiate on price, the owners were amused; it just wasn't that kind of market.)
We borrowed 100 percent of the purchase price. In fact, I was told I could borrow even more if I wanted. I had perfect credit and a solid income that was growing. But even so, when the lender approved us at 100 percent, it was more than I had expected. I remember thinking something like ''Wow. I guess if they're willing to lend it to us it must be O.K.''
I should have known better. No matter how well things are going, borrowing 100 percent of the purchase price of a home is not a good idea. I shouldn't have relied on someone else to make that calculation, let alone the guy who was making money putting me in the loan. I was a financial adviser, and I never sat down to figure out what it would take to make this work. I just wanted to believe him. And it was so easy to believe he had been right, at least at first. We loved living there. The children went to an awesome public school, and we made some great friends. I could ride my bike to Red Rocks, the wilderness area outside of town. And for a time, the real estate market erased any doubt I may have had. It just kept going up.
One evening in 2006 comes to mind. My sister-in-law was thinking of moving to Las Vegas, and a real estate agent told me about an open house for a new Toll Brothers community. This wasn't a come-by-for-cookies type of open house; it was held at a Las Vegas hotel ballroom. I arrived to find a line that led down a flight of stairs and out of the front door. Before I got to the front of the line, they stopped admitting people. Then people rushed the door, like it was a rock concert.
The market's continued strength meant we could borrow even more. It was easy. In late 2004, a year after buying the house, we refinanced our mortgage with World Savings Bank, which later ended up in the hands of Wells Fargo, using one of the pick-a-payment loans that let you choose your own payment each month.
We picked the lowest possible payment, the one that added to our balance each month instead of subtracting from it. And we added a line of credit with Wells Fargo.
The extra borrowing power was important, because while my income was growing rapidly it wasn't enough to support all our expenses. Around that time, I left Merrill Lynch to become an independent financial adviser, so it was easy enough to convince ourselves that we were borrowing to pay for the start-up costs.
There was some truth to that, but we were also borrowing against the house to finance our lifestyle. The line between business expenses and personal ones is sometimes hard to draw when you run your own business, and during those heady times it seemed even harder. But in hindsight it is clear that we were spending more than we should have on things like recreational gear and family trips for ourselves and our four children.
It was extravagant, but it seemed modest compared to what some of our neighbors were doing. Our house was the smallest model in the neighborhood (though at 3,500 square feet it was hardly tiny), and we drove a Chevy and a VW. Cori and I and some of our friends had a lot of conversations comparing our spending habits to those around us. How can so-and-so afford a boat? How are people buying new trucks and four-wheelers and 5,000-square-foot homes? Do they know something we don't know?
At times, it seemed as if maybe they did. I knew a builder of custom homes who urged me to buy one of his houses for close to $2 million. I told him there were at least a million reasons why I couldn't do that. He looked at me like I just didn't get it. He assured me the house was appraised for $200,000 more than the asking price, and that after I lived there I could take out a line of credit to live on while the house went up even further.
The crazy thing is, he was right. The place eventually sold for more than $3 million. When I heard that, I felt a little silly that we hadn't taken that risk.
As for our spending, we told each other that we'd catch up later, as my income and the value of our home continued to rise. As late as February 2006, a comparable home in our neighborhood sold for $998,000. We made the classic mistake of projecting recent trends -- even extreme ones -- into the future.
But slowly -- and then increasingly -- we began to have a different kind of conversation, ''When are we going to stop and just get on top of this?'' The solution was always making more money, not cutting back. The fact is, it's much easier to set a goal of making more money in the future than it is to buckle down and cut back today.
We never really worried that things would go to pieces the way they ultimately did. But then came the collapse in the stock market. I had clients calling in tears and breaking down in my office. People who had never worried about their portfolios were calling me from their vacations. It was like talking people in off a ledge virtually every day, maybe three times a day, for maybe 90 days in a row.
The range of potential outcomes had gotten so broad in people's minds that it now included the end of the world. What they wanted and needed more than anything was reassurance that things would be O.K. and that they should stick with the investment plans we had created together. Providing that reassurance had been my job for 10 years or more, but this was the first time that I really wondered if my advice was right.
It was my job to assist them, but I found it incredibly stressful. It didn't help that we were in increasingly dire straits ourselves. My income fell about 20 percent because my take-home pay depended on the amount of money I managed. At the same time, our cost for health insurance and property taxes kept increasing, and the payment on our mortgage reset higher as well.
By then, housing prices in Las Vegas were falling quickly, and the bank had cut off our home equity line of credit. We quickly got rid of a car and stopped taking trips. I moved into a smaller workspace and cut back on my administrative and marketing costs. Even so, we found ourselves using credit cards as emergency stopgaps.
Then, the sickness set in. The pain would start in my stomach, and then I'd spend six hours vomiting. It happened once, then three months later it happened again, then one month later it happened yet again. Eventually, it was happening every couple of weeks. The doctors couldn't find a physical cause.
Right around that time, it became clear that we might need to get back to Utah, where 90 percent of my (still nervous) clients lived. We spent the summer of 2009 living in my in-laws' basement in Salt Lake City, while I tried to stabilize my financial planning business. By that fall, I was convinced we had to move back permanently to save the business. But that meant we faced the question of what to do about the house.
By then, we owed over $200,000 more than our original loan balance.
Borrowing that much had seemed to make sense when the value of the home was still rising substantially every year, taking our net worth higher with it. But at that point, there was no way we could sell the home for anywhere near what we owed. Some of my friends were already doing short sales, where the bank agrees to let you sell the house for less than your loan balance. I was also aware you had to be three months behind in your payments before the bank would talk to you about the possibility.
At first, I dismissed the idea of a short sale. Late that summer, I sat down with a really close friend in Las Vegas, someone I looked up to. He cut to the heart of the matter right away: Why, he wanted to know, were we still making the payments?
Because I have a moral obligation, I said. You pay your debts.
He proceeded to explain that I didn't have a moral obligation to the bank. I had a moral obligation to my family. I had a contractual obligation to the bank, along with a clear moral obligation to be honest in my dealings. What he was asking was this: Which is more important? Your contractual obligation to the bank or your obligation to your family to preserve your ability to make a living?
I had never thought of it that way. But it made sense. I summed it up to myself like this: I have a contractual obligation to the bank (as well as a moral obligation not to skirt the consequences of breaking it: losing my house and wrecking my credit score). But my moral obligation to my family trumps the contractual obligation to the bank.
Cori and I thought about this for months, but we finally decided to let the house go and stop making payments so we could pursue a mortgage modification or a short sale. The fact was, we didn't have a choice. We simply couldn't afford it.
I remained troubled by the ethical implications of what I was doing, but I soon started seeing some of my friend's arguments echoed in the work of Brent T. White, a law professor at the University of Arizona. He and others were arguing that homeowners should act more like companies -- taking into account legal and economic reasons for stopping a regular payment rather than ''perceived moral obligations.''
That was reassuring in the dead of night while I sat in front of the computer trying to make sense of the world financial markets and my own personal situation. I remember being relieved at discovering a way to frame my decision.
But we didn't know what would happen in the harsh light of day, and we were scared to death. Would we be kicked out of our house? What would the neighbors think? What would the children think? We worried about the stress on our relationship and even the survival of our marriage. I felt like a complete failure.
We looked into a mortgage modification, thinking it might let us keep the house and rent it out after we moved. But the offer from Wells Fargo, which owned our loans by then, was too modest. That meant we could either walk away from the house or work with the bank to do an orderly short sale.
A bank representative came to the house and met with us. He was such a nice guy. Cori had treated it like an open house, and the place was spotless. The guy said he'd never met anyone more qualified for their short sale program.
Somehow, even in that horrid market, we sold the home for $531,000. That was in late August 2010. In exchange, the lender released us from both our first and second mortgages. Today, Zillow estimates the home's value at $505,000.
We were pretty low when we packed up to leave. We hadn't told anyone about the short sale -- not family and only one or two friends. But we sensed that people knew anyway.
We borrowed a truck from a friend who owns a wood mill to move our belongings. Back in Utah, we found a house to rent-- much to my relief and after months of being terrified that we'd never be able to find a landlord willing to take a chance on us. I had to tell the owner what had happened. He looked at our personal references and let us lease the house anyway.
We love where we live now. Still, there are consequences. We lost our home. It's not clear when we'll be in a position to become homeowners again.
But the worst thing was my sense of complete failure and powerlessness when I realized that things were out of control and that it was my fault. These days, there is still a sense of genuine regret that I screwed up and hurt myself and other people. I still worry about what others think of my behavior, which is one reason I haven't shared this story with many people until recently.
We have a friend who is under water on his mortgage even though he has lived within his means and done everything right. He's sticking with his mortgage for as long as he can.
Someone recently asked me what I'd say to people like him. I guess I'm saying it now. As I was writing this article, I pulled behind a truck with a bumper sticker, ''Honk if I'm paying your mortgage.''
I thought about that for a while. I guess one of the ideas behind that bumper sticker is that people like Cori and me who couldn't afford to pay off our mortgages are to blame for the financial crisis and the bank bailouts that followed. This isn't the place to explain the causes of the economic slump, and I'm not the guy to do it.
Still, the questions linger. As I ponder all this -- and I think about it a lot -- it occurs to me that we are a nation of risk-takers. Some of us were overoptimistic; some were ignorant; some were deluded; some were greedy; some just had bad timing. We erred to different degrees. Our experiences varied; each story is different. Now you know mine.
The experience has changed just about everything about how I do financial planning and the advice I give in public. For one thing, I am less quick to judge other people's financial behavior. I'm also more inclined to take into account personal factors that determine how people behave around money.
I have a friend who is going through a tough time financially. He has a high income, but is burdened by debt from a few real estate deals that went south. He continues to take fairly expensive ski trips. That would seem irresponsible in his situation, and maybe they are.
But I now realize that it is not that simple. Maybe those trips are keeping the guy alive, or saving his marriage or keeping him sane enough to work.
I have another good friend who borrowed against his house to pay for a therapist. Unless you were walking in his shoes you might think that was stupid, but it saved his life and changed his career. It ended up being one of the best investments he ever made.
The process of making financial decisions is about more than building a spreadsheet to calculate the answer, because life rarely fits cleanly into a spreadsheet. Our decisions often appear irrational until we understand the whole story.
I've also learned some things about risk. Risk is an arbitrary concept, until you experience it. And I've noticed myself focusing more on the consequences of something going wrong than just the probability of that happening. As a result, I tend to urge my clients to make decisions that err on the side of caution.
As for Cori and me, things are much better now. Moving back to Utah clearly was the right choice. The business is doing well, and we've managed to pay down most of our debt. It would be easy to say that we've learned our lesson, that we'll never screw up again.
But it's not that simple. At times I'm absolutely clear about what makes sense. Then ordinary life choices arise, and things can get cloudy. Should our children play sports that cost money? What kind of family vacation is O.K.? How much is enough?
We're still working on that last one. But we are asking the question, repeatedly. And the temptation to overspend, to go for it, to tell ourselves that things will work out in the long run, is tempered by a feeling that something big is at stake.
All I have to do to remind myself of that is to remember what it felt like to stand outside the kitchen window two years ago, looking in on my life, and thinking I might not get it back.

HEADLINE: Hop Farmers Reviving Heady Days of Brewing

BYLINE: By DANIEL FROMSON

 BODY:
Cazenovia, N.Y.
NEAR the farm that grows the pumpkins for his pumpkin ale and the ranch that raises wagyu beef for the brewpub he owns, David Katleski parked his S.U.V. in the middle of an empty field. ''What we're going to recreate is old hop barns,'' he said, surveying a grid of wooden stakes. ''Stone hop barns.''
''Are you familiar with the hop barns of Madison County?'' his wife, Karen, asked from the back seat.
She was referring not to some steamy romance novel, but to a romantic past: the days when hop barns, those squat, often turretlike structures housing charcoal fires, perfumed the air of central New York with the scent of drying hops. Resinous flowers that give beer its bitterness and flavors of pine, herbs and fruit, hops were a huge part of the local economy in the late 19th century, when New York State grew up to 90 percent of the nation's supply. But the business withered as beer production became industrialized. 
Nearly a century later, the Katleskis and other farmers and craft brewers are trying to revive the region's hop culture, harnessing the current passion for all things local and artisanal. Just as they and brewers around the country are turning to barley, wheat and other ingredients grown locally, New York beer makers are increasingly using local hops. Some, like the Ithaca Beer Company and Brown's Brewing Company in Troy, are planning next year to open so-called farm breweries that will raise the crop themselves.
Here in a small organic garden, Mr. Katleski has been growing hops for the Empire Brewing Company, his brewpub in nearby Syracuse, since 2009, and he hopes someday to brew using only local ingredients. The two hop barns he plans to build in the spring will be largely decorative, forming the facade of his Empire Farmstead Brewery, a 20,000-square-foot production and canning center flanked by hop trellises and vegetable gardens -- a sort of hop chateau.
Wine terminology is not out of place. Dozens of hop varieties, some scarce and highly sought after, are used in brewing around the world, and connoisseurs say they lend flavors and aromas to beer that are as distinctive and varied as those that grapes and soils give to wine. Mr. Katleski, president of the New York State Brewers Association, said that although New York brewers sometimes use local examples of hop varieties grown in, say, the Pacific Northwest, their beers taste vastly different.
''What I'm getting is a very fruit-forward or grapefruit-forward flavor from the hop, and less bitterness,'' he said. ''It kind of just comes from the natural terroir.''
So does much of the inspiration for a hop renaissance: Near several breweries lie the vineyards of the Finger Lakes, which have not only won an international reputation but also spawned a side business in tourism.
''We're trying to create a beer culture in the area, much like you have a wine culture,'' said Jeremiah Sprague, a home brewer and full-time vineyard employee who recently helped oversee the first major harvest at Climbing Bines Hop Farm in Torrey, which overlooks Seneca Lake. With his high-school friends Chris Hansen and Brian Karweck, Mr. Sprague is transforming the site into a farm brewery where hops will be grown and dried.
''The coolest thing we're going to have,'' he said, ''is the ability to offer some estate-hopped ales,'' the fruits of the roughly 1,500 hop plants the farm has already cultivated.
A principal goal of the revival effort is agritourism that demonstrates where the ingredients come from. Visitors to Climbing Bines will see that hop vines resemble bushy green telephone poles, and will taste the wide differences among varieties, from grapefruity Cascade to earthy Fuggles to intensely bitter Nugget. Education is even built into the farm's name: Hop plants are not vines that climb with help from tendrils or suckers, but bines -- stems that wrap in spirals around their supports.
Homegrown beers are not unique to New York. The Sierra Nevada Brewing Company in California and Rogue Ales in Oregon have become known for ''estate beers'' containing their own hops and barley, a niche pioneered in the 1990s when several California wineries started breweries. Farm breweries have sprung up recently in the East, from New England to North Carolina.
But an unusual concentration of hop farms is emerging in New York, fueled by local history and embodied in a pastoral symbol: the hop barn, where farmers dried, stored and baled their crop for shipping as far away as England.
In 1889, The New York Sun reported a ''mania'' for hop farming: ''A prominent hop-grower describes it as being simply the spirit of Wall Street carried afield.'' The industry was destroyed by aphids and mildew, competition from the Pacific Northwest and Prohibition.
Becca Jablonski, a former agricultural specialist with the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Madison County, said the New York hop revival began in 2000 when enthusiasts gathered to preserve the few remaining barns. Several growers formed the Northeast Hop Alliance, which had at most 10 members until last year, when its first big hop-farming workshop increased the ranks tenfold.
Steve Miller, whom the cooperative extension installed in May as New York's first hop horticulture specialist, predicted that statewide acreage devoted to hops would more than double next year, to over 100 acres.
Many brewers are excited by the past they are restoring. Randy Lacey is building a classic pitched-roof hop barn near Ithaca to house his Hopshire Farm and Brewery, where he will use waste heat and a wood-fired boiler to dry his hops as traditionally as possible.
Mr. Katleski, meanwhile, has been working with State Senator David J. Valesky and Assemblyman William D. Magee to promote a bill, modeled on a 1976 law that jump-started the state's wine industry, that would create a special license for farm breweries that use a designated percentage of New York-grown ingredients. The bill, which would reduce licensing costs and logistical barriers to tourism, has encountered no opposition, Mr. Valesky said.
Even if the legislation passes, the state's farm brewing movement will be slow to develop. Hop plants take three years to reach maturity, and harvesting and processing equipment is scarce.
Still, the growers who have dabbled in hops, harvesting mostly by hand, say technology suited to their small farms is becoming more available.
Ultimately, what they are betting on is the sense of place that their products will convey, a selling point that is nowhere more evident than on the western shore of Seneca Lake. Sandwiched between vineyards, Climbing Bines Hop Farm slopes toward the water; a hop trellis fashioned from 150 black locust tree trunks stands postcard-ready.
''We'll utilize what, specifically, this part of the world has to offer,'' Mr. Karweck said. ''Because we've traveled, and we've done some things, and we choose to call this place home.''
A Beer Sampler
Not sure how hops smell or taste? Here are a few widely available brews that hint at the many possibilities.
Samuel Adams Boston Lager The best-known American craft beer made with ''noble hops,'' central European varieties with floral, spicy aromas and minimal bitterness.
Bass Pale Ale A good example of the muted earthy, woody flavors and aromas associated with English hops.
Pilsner Urquell The spiciness of the Saaz hop, a noble Czech variety, complements the crisp, clean taste of this archetypal pilsner.
Sierra Nevada Pale Ale The beer that popularized Cascade hops, whose piney, citrusy profile, which is typical of many American hop varieties, has made it a mainstay of domestic pale ales.
Stone India Pale Ale In West Coast IPA's like this one, American hops add intense herbal and citrus fruit flavors and a pronounced bitterness.
Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA A more restrained IPA typical of East Coast versions of the style, in which citrusy American hops are balanced by large doses of malt.
Correction: November 16, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Wednesday about a revival of hop farming in central New York State misstated the location of Climbing Bines Hop Farm. Though the farm has a Penn Yan mailing address, it is in Torrey, not Penn Yan.

HEADLINE: With Profit Down 19%, Toyota Withdraws Its Forecast

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Just as Toyota has seemed to find its footing after the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, a painful jump in the yen is weighing on quarterly profit and a shortage of parts from flooded suppliers in Thailand has led the company to scrap its outlook.
Toyota, which makes Camry sedans and Prius gas-electric hybrids, said Tuesday that its profit fell 19 percent to 80.4 billion yen, or $1 billion, in the July-September quarter. It said a surge in the yen, which nervous global investors consider a haven, weighed on overseas profit. Sales for the quarter fell 4.8 percent to 4.6 trillion yen, or $57 billion, the company said in a statement. 
The uncertainty pushed Toyota to withdraw its forecast for the financial year ending in March to give it more time to assess the damage from the Thai floods, which have taken a humanitarian and economic toll on the Southeast Asian manufacturing hub. Toyota previously said it expected to earn 390 billion yen in the year.
The problems seem likely to knock Toyota out of the spot as the world's biggest automaker and push it behind General Motors and Volkswagen, which have been able to fill a void left by Japanese automakers since the natural disasters in Japan in March.
Combined production at Toyota, Honda, Nissan and other Japanese carmakers fell one-fifth from April to September, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, after the earthquake and tsunami ravaged plants and severed production lines, forcing factories as far away as the United States to reduce output.
But just as Toyota started to restore production, the flooding in Thailand again forced the company to halt work at its plants. Three vehicle factories in Thailand have been closed since early October, while a shortage of parts has caused Toyota to limit production at factories across the world, including plants in Japan and the United States.
Toyota said Tuesday that production would remain below normal in Japan until at least Nov. 18. The company predicts that production will have fallen by 150,000 units by mid-November.
A strengthening of the yen to record levels in recent months has taken a toll on Toyota's earnings. On Oct. 31, the currency reached a post-World War II high of 75.34 yen to the dollar, prompting the Japanese government to intervene in foreign exchange markets in an effort to weaken it. But the currency has remained stubbornly strong since the intervention, at about 78 yen to the dollar, and exporters are urging the government to do more. A strong yen can make exports more expensive and therefore less competitive overseas and can erode profit earned overseas when it is repatriated as yen.
For Toyota, which still manufactures about 40 percent of its cars in Japan, costs from the rising yen are especially damaging. It has said it remains committed to making about three million cars a year in Japan, though it sells fewer than half that many in a shrinking domestic market.
Toyota exports the rest at a high cost, a system long criticized by analysts as unprofitable.
Satoshi Ozawa, an executive vice president of Toyota, on Tuesday defended its insistence on keeping production in Japan. Exports remained vital to the Japanese economy, he said, and Toyota was committed to keeping manufacturing jobs in Japan. ''Recent foreign currency levels threaten to undermine Japan's standing as an exporter nation,'' Mr. Ozawa said. He called on the government to ''take resolute measures.''
Toyota will keep production in Japan as if ''clinging to a rock with its teeth,'' Mr. Ozawa said, drawing from a Japanese proverb.
Toyota's American depository receipt shares fell 1.3 percent to $64.61 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Mayor Presses Both Parties to Act on Cutting U.S. Deficit

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
10:17 p.m. Updated Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Tuesday that it was time for Washington to take serious steps to address the federal deficit, starting with a measure certain to be unpopular with some of his financial industry friends: a change to the way that hedge fund managers are taxed. 
Mr. Bloomberg, in a speech in Washington at the liberal research group the Center for American Progress, said both parties were merely tinkering around the edges of a major problem that threatened the economy. He urged them to hammer out an agreement on spending cuts and tax increases to balance the budget in 10 years.
The mayor said the $1.2 trillion in savings being sought by a Congressional supercommittee set to report on Nov. 23 would not be enough, and he urged the panel to come up with a ''bold, long-term and comprehensive plan.'' (Full text of speech below.)
His own proposals would generate $8 trillion toward deficit reduction.
First, Mr. Bloomberg said, the Bush tax cuts should be allowed to expire for all income brackets.
He also called for Congress to adopt the spending cuts proposed last year by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission, including changes to Social Security, like gradually raising the retirement age.
He urged the elimination of special tax breaks and subsidies to farmers and the energy industry.
He also recommended treating ''carried interest'' - a type of income earned by some hedge fund managers that is taxed at lower rates - as ordinary income.
''Since fair is fair, tax loopholes in the financial industry that are outdated should be closed too, such as taxing carried interest at ordinary income rates,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''And I say this even though many of the people who would be affected are my constituents - so I assume I will get some phone calls later this afternoon.''
Mr. Bloomberg has been under some pressure from both the business community and supporters of the Occupy Wall Street movement in recent weeks as a broader debate about income inequality has taken hold. As the encampment in downtown Manhattan has continued, the mayor has tried to balance his support for the financial industry as an engine of New York's economy with a defense of the protesters' free speech rights.
In his address, he offered copious criticism for politicians in Washington, accusing Democrats of ''pitting Americans against each other in a game of class warfare,'' while saying that Republicans ''have to stop protecting every tax break and loophole as though they were sacrosanct.''
And he chided President Obama, saying he had failed to lead effectively on deficit reduction.
''The executive branch must do more than submit a plan to a committee, and then step aside and hope the committee members take action,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''That's not how any C.E.O. would run a business.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Health Law Survives Test In Court Of Appeals

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
A federal appeals court in Washington upheld the Obama administration's health care law on Tuesday in a decision written by a prominent conservative jurist.
The decision came as the Supreme Court is about to consider whether to take up challenges to the Affordable Care Act, a milestone legislative initiative of the administration.
Of four appellate court rulings on the health care law so far, this is the third to deal with the law on the merits, and the second that upholds it. 
The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Washington issued the 37-page opinion by Judge Laurence H. Silberman. In the opinion, Judge Silberman, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, described the law as part of the fundamental tension between individual liberty and legislative power.
''The right to be free from federal regulation is not absolute, and yields to the imperative that Congress be free to forge national solutions to national problems, no matter how local -- or seemingly passive -- their individual origins,'' he wrote. The fact that Congress may have never issued an individual mandate to purchase something before, a central argument for many opposing the law, ''seems to us a political judgment rather than a recognition of constitutional limitations,'' he wrote.
A 65-page dissent by Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, a conservative jurist appointed by President George W. Bush, stated that the courts lack jurisdiction until the law's tax penalties take effect in 2015. Citing the 19th-century Anti-Injunction Act, he said that the ''important and long-standing'' law ''poses a jurisdictional bar to our deciding this case at this time.''
The split among the appellate courts increases chances that the Supreme Court will hear the case. Tuesday's opinion is the second appeals court decision that upholds the law on the merits. The Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, struck down the individual mandate in a suit brought by officials of 26 states, and experts say it is most likely to be among those that the Supreme Court will choose to hear if the judges decide to take up the cases at their private conference on Thursday.
The White House posted a blog entry by Stephanie Cutter, a senior aide to the president, that hailed ''yet another victory'' for Americans getting benefits from the early elements of the bill.
The fact that two leading lights of conservative jurisprudence decided against positions held by opponents of the health care law threatens to upend the popular notion that the fate of the law will be determined by judges along political lines. In lower courts, judges appointed by Republican presidents did tend to rule against the law while those appointed by Democrats issued rulings in its favor. Those expecting the pattern to continue have predicted defeat for the law at the Supreme Court.
Jack M. Balkin, a constitutional scholar at Yale Law School, said that what is emerging at the appeals level, including a June decision supporting the law from the Sixth Circuit that with a concurrence by Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton, another Bush appointee, shows ''it's actually a much more complicated story about how judges are seeing this act.''
In fact, Professor Balkin said, conservative legal theory runs deeper than politics, with two schools of thought. The one that emerged in Tuesday's decision ''emphasizes judicial restraint and respect of political branches when they attempt to make national economic policy.'' The other school, he suggested, ''argues for robust judicial review to protect constitutional values that conservatives hold dear, for example, federalism and individual liberty.''
Elizabeth B. Wydra, chief counsel to the Constitutional Accountability Center, a Washington group that supports the law, underscored that point in a statement that called the decision ''a devastating blow to the challengers of the act, delivered by one of the country's foremost conservative jurists.''
A conservative legal organization that took part in the suit opposing the law, the American Center for Law and Justice, expressed disappointment. Jay Sekulow, the chief counsel for the group, said ''we still remain confident that ObamaCare and the individual mandate, which forces Americans to purchase health insurance, is the wrong prescription for America and ultimately will be struck down as unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.''
Randy E. Barnett, a professor at Georgetown University's law school and an opponent of the law, said: Judge Silberman's opinion ''rests on his claim that Congress has an unlimited power to address whatever it deems to be a national problem. Fortunately, his will not be the last word on these constitutional challenges.''

HEADLINE: With West Wing Reshuffling, President Seeks a More Cohesive White House

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER, MARK LANDLER and JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A year before Election Day, President Obama has realigned the West Wing to consolidate power among his closest and most trusted campaign advisers, putting Pete Rouse, a confidant with decades of Capitol Hill experience, at the center of White House operations.
Mr. Obama began the realignment a month ago, administration officials said, when he asked Mr. Rouse to write a strategic plan for the final year of his term with a focus on whether all corners of the administration were delivering a cohesive message. The president concluded that they were not and that Mr. Rouse could solve the problem by resuming some of the duties he had performed during the first two years of the administration, before the arrival of the current chief of staff, William M. Daley. 
On Monday, Mr. Daley announced during a staff meeting that he will turn over several major responsibilities, including some of the day-to-day management of the West Wing, to Mr. Rouse. Mr. Daley, friends, associates and administration officials say, has never been a detail-oriented manager, and he was in favor of the change.
But the reshuffling also reflects two fundamental truths about Mr. Obama's struggle to run the White House and his re-election campaign when the economy remains disappointingly weak and Republicans have little interest in his proposals.
First, it is extraordinarily difficult for any outsider to penetrate Mr. Obama's close-knit inner circle, which is dominated by David Plouffe, Valerie Jarrett, and other advisers who forged relationships during the 2008 campaign.
And second, Mr. Daley was hired to do a job that no longer exists: finding common ground with Congressional Republicans, who have become the chief antagonists in Mr. Obama's re-election narrative.
The realignment inside the West Wing is likely to have little strategic impact on the president's re-election bid, which is overseen by Jim Messina in the campaign headquarters in Chicago, and by Mr. Plouffe, a senior adviser and top political strategist to the president. But the elevation of Mr. Rouse is intended to improve the internal workings at the White House and to improve communication with Democrats on Capitol Hill, who were particularly irate about an interview with Politico in which Mr. Daley seemed to lump Congressional Democrats with Republicans as obstructionist.
The relationship between Mr. Obama and Mr. Rouse, who keeps an extraordinarily low profile, goes back to Mr. Obama's arrival in Washington, in 2005. Mr. Rouse had been a trusted adviser to the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, and went to work as chief of staff to Mr. Obama, then a freshman senator.
The fact that Mr. Rouse would take the job at the time reflected the high expectations for Mr. Obama's career, and Mr. Rouse has been one of Mr. Obama's most trusted confidants since. The president has repeatedly turned to him as a troubleshooter, including as interim chief of staff before Mr. Daley took over.
In giving Mr. Rouse more duties, the president decided that he ''wanted to make sure that everyone was rowing in the same direction,'' a senior administration official said Tuesday. ''There has been some tension there.''
Aides said Mr. Rouse would serve in a role similar to a chief operating officer, who can carry out decisions without approval from other aides. Among other things, Mr. Rouse will coordinate the administration's message across its own departments and with Democrats and Capitol Hill. The reshuffling was first reported in The Wall Street Journal.
One adviser said Mr. Rouse's knowledge of government, Capitol Hill and outside Democratic groups would allow him to be the ''connective tissue,'' a role with which Mr. Daley has struggled because of his lack of deep relationships with members of Congress and a sense of the inner workings of the administration.
''There was a sense that there wasn't the right glue on all of these issues,'' a senior administration official said.
Mr. Daley took over as chief of staff in January vowing to turn around the insular culture of a White House where decisions were made by a handful of advisers, most of them from the 2008 campaign. A former banker and Clinton administration commerce secretary, Mr. Daley was supposed to reach out to business and Republicans in Congress, administration officials said. He said he would build a bridge between Mr. Obama and his cabinet, most of whom rarely interacted with the president.
Mr. Daley helped oversee some successes, especially in foreign policy, such as the raid that killed Osama bin Laden and the American role in ousting Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya.
The economy's continued weakness is almost certainly a bigger problem for Mr. Obama than the West Wing organizational chart. Even with the reshuffling, Mr. Daley remains the chief of staff, with the corner office and presidential access that comes with the job, and will focus on setting the White House's major priorities. He will also serve as a liaison with the Obama campaign.
Nonetheless, aides said Mr. Obama had been disappointed by his advisers' performance. Mr. Daley pushed particularly strongly for a deficit deal with Congressional Republicans this summer, a move that ended up looking naive after Republicans again decided that they were not willing to raise taxes.
But other officials -- and Mr. Obama, who rose to national prominence calling for cross-partisan compromise -- also supported pursuing such a deal. Still, the Politico interview two weeks ago incensed Mr. Obama and served as a public reminder that Mr. Daley has much less of a connection to Mr. Obama. Unlike many others in the White House, he does not owe his career to the 2008 campaign, in which Mr. Obama and his team -- initially at least -- took on the Democratic establishment.
As chief of staff, officials say, Mr. Daley created a hierarchical structure that did not fit easily. About a month ago, he reinstituted an 8:30 a.m. meeting that he had once eliminated, in the hope of improving morale and better informing aides so they could do their jobs better.
Mr. Daley also voiced his opposition to the president's re-election campaign being located in Chicago, according to people familiar with the discussions, but he was overruled.
In the end, however, the change was less about Mr. Daley than it was about Mr. Obama and his longtime advisers, White House officials say.
''They're going back to what they're comfortable with,'' said one senior Democratic strategist.

HEADLINE: Head Start Is Given New Rules for Grants

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
YEADON, Pa. -- President Obama visited a schoolhouse in this suburb of Philadelphia on Tuesday to announce stricter financing standards for the government's Head Start program, which offers preschool training for children from low-income families.
Declaring that investments in early education are critical to the future competitiveness of the United States, Mr. Obama said the government would, for the first time, require Head Start programs to meet certain standards to qualify for renewal of federal grants. 
''If a program isn't giving children the support they need to be ready for school,'' the president told teachers and administrators, squeezed into a small auditorium on folding chairs, ''then other organizations will be able to compete for the grant. We will take money from programs that don't work and put it into programs that do.''
Like many other stops on Mr. Obama's itinerary over the last several weeks, this four-hour visit had three ingredients: a politically crucial swing state (Pennsylvania), a sympathetic crowd (educators), and a camera-friendly backdrop (3- to 5-year-old children).
Before his speech, Mr. Obama dropped in on a classroom, where he watched several groups of children playing with blocks, Legos, puzzles, and toy cars and trucks. Later, he told the crowd that the children ''choked me up'' because they were ''so huggable,'' adding that his daughters were ''still huggable,'' though now 5-foot-9 and 5 feet, respectively.
For the president, who has crisscrossed the country in recent weeks to promote a $447 billion jobs plan that is largely economic stimulus, the visit on Tuesday had a different cast: a pledge to be more discriminating in how the government spends money.
But Mr. Obama renewed his criticism of Republicans in Congress, saying they had voted in favor of cutting the financing of Head Start and the Pell Grant program and had blocked a $35 billion piece of the jobs bill aimed at preventing layoffs of teachers.
''The Republicans in Congress have been trying to gut our investments in education,'' Mr. Obama said. He described this initiative as part of a series of unilateral measures that the White House is taking because it does not want to wait for Congress to act.
In fact, many Republicans favor tightening standards for Head Start, and the reforms of the program announced by Mr. Obama on Tuesday date back to the Bush administration. White House officials said the Yeadon Regional Head Start Center, which serves 260 children from Delaware County, was an example of a high-performing center.
Mr. Obama's criticism came during a week in which the Senate, after blocking several pieces of jobs legislation, seems likely to approve the first elements of the jobs package: tax credits to encourage companies to hire returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan.
''Obviously we look forward to passage of this very important provision of the American Jobs Act, hope it does pass, and the president will sign it into law,'' the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said to reporters traveling with the president on Air Force One.
But the president was not softening his partisan tone, noting that his job-creation ideas could be paid for if Republicans were willing to allow millionaires pay somewhat more in taxes.
''There is no substitute for Congress doing its job,'' he said to noisy applause. ''If Congress continues to stand only for dysfunction and delay, then I'm going to move ahead without them.''

HEADLINE: Euro Crisis's Enabler: The Central Bank

BYLINE: By JOHN QUIGGIN. 
John Quiggin, a visiting professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University, is the author of ''Zombie Economics: How Dead Ideas Still Walk Among Us.''

 BODY:
THE escalating debt crisis in Europe has claimed the political career of one prime minister, George A. Papandreou of Greece, and threatened that of another, Silvio Berlusconi of Italy. Despite popular resistance, governments are racing to stay ahead of the bond markets by slashing their budgets. The drama of meetings, proposals, counterproposals and popular unrest seems destined to end in tragedy.
But the theatrical atmosphere of these negotiations within the European Union has overshadowed an event that may prove to be far more significant in the long run than the Greek referendum. It has also sustained a narrative about the sovereign debt crisis that is deeply misleading. 
According to this narrative, the crisis shows the impossibility of managing a common macroeconomic policy in a system where decisions require the agreement of 27 member states, including the 17 that share the common currency, and a vastly diverse Continent with different countries that face different growth and consumption patterns and have different business cycles.
These are real problems. But they are not the reason for the systemic failure of the European financial system. Overwhelmingly, this failure has been caused by the policy choices of one of the few European institutions that has the capacity to act unilaterally and decisively: the European Central Bank.
Far from struggling to manage a ''one size fits all'' monetary policy, the bank has pursued a ''one size fits nobody'' policy of monetary contraction, at a time when no European economy is growing strongly. With great reluctance, the bank has agreed to support the markets for European sovereign debt through purchases of government bonds. But, unlike the policy of quantitative easing pursued by the Federal Reserve -- in which the United States' central bank amassed Treasury securities to push down long-term interest rates -- the European Central Bank has insisted on ''sterilizing,'' or neutralizing, its purchases of government bonds by selling the securities to private-sector banks. Such a policy cannot be sustained on a scale sufficient to stabilize financial markets.
This is part of a broader problem: the European Central Bank's conception of its own role. The bank was established in 1998, at a time when memories of the inflationary surge of the 1970s and 1980s were still fresh. It was therefore given a mandate that focused primarily on inflation, and has interpreted that mandate very narrowly.
Unlike any previous central bank in history, the bank has disclaimed any responsibility for the European financial system it effectively controls, or even for the viability of the euro as a currency. Instead, it has focused almost entirely on the formal objective of keeping inflation rates to a 2 percent target.
And this brings us to the most crucial recent event: not the drama in Greece but the departure of Jean-Claude Trichet as the central bank's president on Nov. 1. More than any other single person, Mr. Trichet has embodied the systemic failure of European financial institutions.
Having failed to predict or resolve the crisis, Mr. Trichet has compounded his errors by denying them. Rather, he pronounced his own performance as ''impeccable,'' because inflation rates had been kept at or below the target level. Any change of course in European policy would require him to admit his mistakes, and that is clearly impossible.
In a desperate attempt to pretend that pre-crisis normality had returned, Mr. Trichet even raised interest rates in two steps, in response to marginal deviations from the central bank's target inflation rate. This was the worst possible response to a debt crisis.
Mr. Trichet's replacement, Mario Draghi, has shown no particular signs of independent or creative thinking. Nevertheless, he has one great asset: he is not Mr. Trichet. Free from the need to defend the past policies of the European Central Bank, Mr. Draghi has the opportunity to wipe the slate clean.
Indeed, he has already shown some signs of fresh thinking, with his decision last Thursday to cut the euro zone's benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 1.25 percent.
But Mr. Draghi needs to do even more if he is to avoid becoming the first central banker in recent history to preside over the collapse of the currency he was appointed to manage.
The crucial step is to announce that the central bank will stand behind the sovereign debt of euro zone members, if necessary at the expense of the 2 percent inflation target. This would give governments the financial resources they needed to recapitalize banks. Since the crisis is largely one of confidence, it is likely that bond markets would stabilize without the need for large-scale bond purchases, once there was a credible commitment to intervene where necessary.
In his first news conference as the central bank's president, Mr. Draghi gave mixed signals. Rhetorically, he emphasized consistency with the failed policies of the past. But in practical terms, he announced a cut in interest rates, effectively admitting that the last increase, only five months ago, was a mistake.
The opportunity for him to take a new path will not last long. If current policies are pursued, the European Central Bank will end up by destroying the euro in order to save it from (largely hypothetical) inflation.

This seductive drama from Andre Techine was based on a real-life case involving Marie-Leonie Leblanc, a 23-year-old who claimed in 2004 that she had been the victim of an anti-Semitic attack by six men of North African and African origin on a train outside Paris. The French president at the time, Jacques Chirac, condemned the attack, and the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, urged French Jews to leave for Israel to ''escape the wildest anti-Semitism.'' Then the woman admitted that she had lied. ''I wanted my parents to take care of me,'' she explained, ''my boyfriend to take care of me.'' Manohla Dargis, reviewing the film in The New York Times, wrote: ''Mr. Techine isn't pretending that he understands what people do. But by showing us what they do, the flowers they pick and the people they love, he makes us notice them more intently.'' KATHRYN SHATTUCK

HEADLINE: Markets Turn Higher After Berlusconi Offers to Resign

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Elisabetta Povoledo and Rachel Donadio contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks gyrated Tuesday before ending higher on a day of significant political developments in Italy, the latest country to come under fire in the drawn-out euro zone debt crisis. 
Powered by an early rally in Europe, the stock market in the United States rose slightly before a budget vote in Italy that had taken on immense importance for the prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, after the recent defections of several lawmakers in his party. It passed with numerous abstentions, but Mr. Berlusconi lost his absolute majority.
Stocks then declined or were flat in afternoon trading until about two hours before the end of the session, when news that Mr. Berlusconi had offered to resign -- after Parliament passes an austerity package -- first emerged.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 0.84 percent, or 101.79 points, to 12,170. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 1.17 percent to 1,276, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 1.2 percent to 2,727.
There were no big reactions in credit markets, however. Italian 10-year bonds remained above their 6.7 percent yield, close to the level that forced other countries such as Greece to seek bailouts.
Investors have long been concerned that the debt ills in some of the smaller euro zone nations could spread to those with much bigger economies, a contagion that would be much harder to fix. They have been focusing on Italy of late because of concern about its high debt load, rising borrowing costs and stagnant economy. Interest rates on the country's debt have hit their highest levels since the country joined the euro zone more than a decade ago.
''With all of the debt they have to roll over it is extremely detrimental,'' said Laura LaRosa, the director of fixed income at Glenmede, adding that the ''domino effect'' is ''absolutely what seems to be happening now.''
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 17/32, to 100 13/32, and the yield rose to 2.08 percent from 2.02 percent late Monday.
Earlier in Europe, stocks closed higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, was up 1.2 percent. The German DAX was up 0.6 percent and the CAC 40 in Paris rose 1.3 percent. The FTSE 100 index in London was 1 percent higher.
''The equity markets are generally rallying in Europe because they are hopeful resolving the political crisis is a necessary solution to resolving the European crisis,'' said Jurgen Odenius, the chief economist at Prudential Fixed Income.
''The bond market remains bearish on this issue,'' he added.
The euro was $1.3839, compared with $1.3758 on Monday.

HEADLINE: Report on Nuclear Efforts Draws a Muted Response From the White House

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When American intelligence agencies concluded four years ago that Iran had suspended efforts to build a nuclear weapon in 2003, the findings undercut the Bush administration's arguments for harsher international sanctions or even, from its more hawkish quarters, military intervention.
Now, with the International Atomic Energy Agency detailing what it calls credible evidence of Iran's continuing efforts to design a nuclear warhead and install it on a ballistic missile, President Obama faces a problem over how to respond -- even as his options are more limited than ever. 
Even though the report was in the works for weeks, and American intelligence officials contributed to it, the administration's reaction after its release on Tuesday was strikingly muted, both in public and in private, given the high diplomatic and military stakes of Iran's pursuit of nuclear weaponry.
That reflected the White House's reluctance to fuel a war of words -- including the openly discussed possibility of an Israeli pre-emptive strike -- but also a careful strategy to allow the agency's report to speak for itself in hopes that it will intensify economic and diplomatic pressure on Iran, administration officials said.
Officials said that they were considering additional sanctions and ways to close loopholes in the existing ones, promising to do so in coordination with European and other allies in the days and weeks ahead.
The measures, one official said, could be more stringent than existing sanctions on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the elite military force that controls Iran's nuclear activities as well as wide areas of the Iranian economy.
The United States already enforces a range of United Nations and unilateral sanctions against Iran, which Mr. Obama last week described as part of ''unprecedented international pressure'' against its government. Those include sanctions on the guard corps and several of its senior leaders.
Calls for additional sanctions intensified on Capitol Hill after the United States broke up what prosecutors called an Iranian-backed plot to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States -- a scheme so bizarre that some countries questioned it. At the same time, however, officials said that more sweeping sanctions against Iran's central bank -- as members of Congress have proposed -- or against its oil and gas exports could disrupt the world's economy at a time when the United States and Europe are already mired in economic crises. It is also not clear if they would win support from Russia and China, veto-wielding members of the United Nations Security Council.
''We're going to study it,'' the State Department's spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said in the administration's only public comments on the findings. ''We are not prepared to speak about any next steps at this point.''
Unlike the findings contained in the National Intelligence Estimate in 2007, the latest report does not fundamentally reshape the debate here over how to manage Iran's nuclear ambitions, despite calls from Republicans in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail for tougher action.
It has long been the stated policy of Mr. Obama and his predecessors to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and while the nuclear monitoring agency did not predict when that might happen, the issue of how to accomplish the goal has now risen to the top of the list of foreign threats facing the president as he wages his re-election campaign in the next year.
For now, according to officials, an American military response is not under discussion, though presumably intelligence operations aimed at undermining Iran's effort continue in earnest.
The administration clearly hopes the agency's report, backed by intelligence from nine other countries in addition to the United States, will bolster international pressure and begin to have an effect on Iranian strategy. Officials also hope the report will refute Iran's claims of American and Israeli plotting against what Iran says is peaceful civilian research.
But there is still no global consensus behind draconian new measures. Russia, for example, reacted angrily to the release of the report's findings, saying it jeopardized efforts to restart negotiations with Iran.
Russia and China have made it clear they will not vote in the Security Council for any more sanctions, leaving any international effort divided from the start. NATO's intervention in Libya after both nations abstained on resolutions against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's bloody crackdown have only hardened their positions.
''It is important to determine whether some new, reliable evidence to strengthen suspicions of a military element in Iran's nuclear program has really appeared, or whether we are talking about an intentional -- and counterproductive -- whipping up of emotions,'' the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement quoted by Reuters.
The Obama administration contends sanctions are starting to bite, disrupting Iran's economy by cutting off its access to international finance even without explicitly isolating its central bank. Officials point to recent statements by Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in which he publicly acknowledged that sanctions were having an effect.
''We believe there is additional space to build out that pressure on Iran,'' a senior administration official said, speaking according to the White House's ground rules that he not be quoted by name.
Administration officials have confirmed that they are weighing a Treasury Department ban on transactions with the Central Bank of Iran -- a step that would be powerful because any third country that did business with the central bank would be cut off from the American financial system.
But American allies like Japan and South Korea buy large amounts of oil from Iran, paying their bills through the central bank because most Iranian commercial banks are off limits. China relies less on the central bank for its purchases but is also a large buyer of Iranian oil.
The administration is also weighing whether to impose sanctions on elements of the Revolutionary Guards that control Iran's oil exports, effectively banning purchases of fuel from Iran. Cutting off Iran's oil exports would have unpredictable effects on prices, officials said, with even a brief shock posing an economic threat.
In June, in a more typical example of pressure, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Tidewater Middle East, a company linked to the Guards that operates strategic container ports through which the Guards and its paramilitary group, the Quds Force, have moved weapons, administration officials said.

HEADLINE: Study Clarifies the Energy Savings in Retrofitted Buildings

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
While the practice of retrofitting buildings with energy-conserving technology like efficient boilers, high-quality windows and compact fluorescent light bulbs has been around for years, data on whether these changes result in any real savings has been virtually nonexistent. Now, a new study shows that these relatively straightforward fixes can significantly reduce spending on fuel and electricity.
Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation, a philanthropic arm of the German bank, and Living Cities, a nonprofit partnership of 22 foundations and financial institutions, commissioned the report, which will be released later this month. It examined nearly 19,000 affordable housing units in New York City that had undergone energy efficiency retrofits and found that these changes resulted in a 19 percent savings on fuel bills and a 10 percent savings on electricity across the portfolio. This translates into $240 in fuel savings and $70 in electrical savings per apartment every year.
''We have been looking for the secret sauce,'' said Ben Hecht, the president and chief executive of Living Cities. ''This study is definitely the first foray into data, and that is going to be critical to convince owners and lenders of the importance of retrofitting buildings.'' 
At Terrific Tenements, for example, an 88-unit, two-building affordable housing complex on West 48th Street in Manhattan, the installation of new boilers and heating controls reduced fuel costs by 50 percent. At one of the buildings, at 425 West 48th Street, there was a fuel saving of $551 a year per apartment, while at the sister building at 527 West 47th Street, the saving was $355 annually for each unit.
''These buildings are prewar classics and are representative of a pretty broad swath of the city's housing stock,'' said Marc Zuluaga, a vice president and director of the multifamily energy services group at Steven Winter Associates, a building consultant in New York. The company, along with HR&A Advisors, an economic development and real estate consulting firm, conducted the study.
The retrofits at the Terrific Tenements ''was not achieved with any particularly exotic technologies'' like solar panels or a green roof, Mr. Zuluaga said. Rather, this is the simple story ''of how an owner took the worst-performing building type in the city and turned it into one of the best-performing buildings in the entire city.''
Jeffrey I. Brodsky, the president of Related Management, an arm of the Related Companies, the landlord of Terrific Tenements, said: ''This study proves that the assumption that you can't rely on savings when doing a retrofit isn't true. It may not be perfect or exact, but you will see savings.''
The company does energy audits on all of its New York City buildings, where building engineers examine the utility usages to expose any opportunity for increased efficiency and savings, he said.
Another project examined in the study is Riverview II in Yonkers, also owned by the Related Companies. The 343 apartments at Riverview, at 47 Riverdale Avenue, were heated with electricity, and the landlord was responsible for paying all of the tenants' electrical bills. The Related Companies started an electrical savings program, including better windows, lighting upgrades and Energy Star refrigerators, that helped reduce overall electricity usage by more than 25 percent.
In addition, each apartment was responsible for paying its own electric bills, giving tenants an incentive to conserve electricity. As a result, the changes translated into $808 in annual savings for each apartment.
The study's authors hope the results will go beyond persuading landlords to institute environmentally beneficial retrofits. They hope that lenders will use this data and consider underwriting larger loans to landlords based on the projected savings that come from retrofitting buildings.
Currently, lenders do not consider future savings from retrofits when they are underwriting a loan because there is little data indicating what those savings would be, experts said.
In addition to a lack of data, there is also some doubt whether energy audits, like those conducted by the Related Companies, are accurate. This is in part because some auditors are motivated to overstate the potential savings since favorable results help to justify the audits, and also because there is not sufficient follow-up to determine whether the energy audits were accurate.
To help resolve this, the study also created a tool for lenders to confirm the accuracy of energy audits. Using the data gathered, they divided New York City multifamily housing stock into categories based on a building's age, heating system, electrical infrastructure and other factors.
Lenders can then apply the data gathered in the study to the building types to determine the potential savings and check the veracity of the energy audits. It also allows lenders to identify those buildings that would have the greatest increase in efficiency, and therefore the largest drop in costs, from an energy efficient retrofit.
''The study informs what we hope will be a new set of lending practices that places real monetary value on energy efficiency improvements,'' said Sam Marks, the vice president of Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation.
When a lender is considering refinancing a building, for example, ''it makes sense for them to perform an energy audit as a risk management tool,'' Mr. Brodsky said. ''They can see what the issues are at the building and the options available to make the building more efficient, and in this way they won't be subject to as much volatility in the energy market over time.''
But in this soft economy, lenders are reluctant to rely on new techniques when making loans. To make them more comfortable using projected savings from retrofits, a public-private partnership started this year, the New York City Energy Efficiency Corporation, is planning to dedicate a portion of $37.5 million in federal stimulus money to provide collateral guarantee these deals. If a lender agrees to underwrite a loan and incorporate potential energy savings from a retrofit, the partnership will repay that loan should the projected savings fall short.
''We are trying to catalyze a new financing market to satisfy the growing demand for retrofits,'' said Susan Leeds, the chief executive of the Energy Efficiency Corporation. The partnership's board includes Mr. Brodsky of Related Management; Gary Hattem, the president of the Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation; as well as city officials and other private executives.
These efforts come at a time when New York City has been pushing environmental initiatives. The City Council has instituted laws requiring that buildings of more than the 50,000-square-feet benchmark compile and share information regarding their energy efficiency, and that every 10 years these buildings perform an energy audit.
The city does not require that the building owners complete any retrofits, but the study's authors hope that these efforts to highlight the data and facilitate the financing for retrofits will increase the likelihood more landlords will do so.

HEADLINE: The Romney Campaign: Christie Makes the Rounds

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
Less than a month after endorsing Mitt Romney on the day of a Republican debate in New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Christie will make his debut as a surrogate for Mr. Romney, once again on the day of a debate in New Hampshire. 
On Wednesday, while Mr. Romney prepares for yet another debate that evening in Michigan, Mr. Christie will campaign for him in southern New Hampshire. He will attend a rally at the Romney campaign's New Hampshire headquarters in Manchester, as well as a house party at the Nashua residence of John Stabile, a former state Republican Party chairman who just endorsed Mr. Romney. Mr. Christie will then head to Mr. Romney's national headquarters in Boston for a debate-watching party, where he has been billed as the ''special guest.''
The Union Leader first reported the news, which the Romney campaign then sent out in a press release Tuesday morning.
''Governor Christie is a national leader in the fight to reform government and cut spending.'' said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign. ''He has consistently stood up for the principles of limited taxation and fiscal responsibility that are important to Granite Staters. Our campaign is honored to have Governor Christie in New Hampshire to talk to voters about why Mitt Romney is the best candidate to fix our economy and defeat President Obama in 2012.''
When Mr. Christie endorsed Mr. Romney in October, his support was seen as a sign that Mr. Romney was consolidating the backing of the establishment and big donors. Mr. Christie, a pugnacious fiscal conservative, was also promoted as being able to serve as a bridge between Mr. Romney and the grass-roots wing of his party.
On Tuesday, the Romney campaign also rolled out another long-sought endorsement - Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois. Mr. Romney had heavily courted Mr. Schock, who remained hesitant about endorsing, and went so far as attending the congressman's 30th birthday in Chicago.
''Mitt Romney has a record of cutting spending and keeping taxes low that needs to be replicated in Washington,'' Mr. Schock said in an e-mail. ''Under President Obama, our national debt has skyrocketed and our prized AAA credit rating has been lost. Mitt Romney has the conservative solutions needed to get Washington off its spending addiction and focused on creating jobs.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Political Tensions Dampen Liberia's Runoff Vote

BYLINE: By EMILY SCHMALL; Josh Kron contributed reporting from Nairobi, Kenya.

 BODY:
MONROVIA, Liberia -- President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who won the Nobel Peace Prize this year for helping to stabilize her country after years of conflict, was poised to win a second term in an uncontested presidential runoff on Tuesday.
But the election was dampened by low voter turnout, the refusal of her only remaining competitor to stay in the race and lingering bitterness from clashes between the police and opposition supporters a day earlier that left at least one person dead. 
The election -- only the second since Liberia emerged from 14 years of civil war -- was intended to solidify the country's fledgling democracy but instead could exacerbate divisions.
''After Monday's events, she might have some difficulty pulling the country together,'' said Dan Saryee, executive director of the Liberia Democratic Institute, referring to the president.
Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf, the first woman to be elected a head of state in Africa, is an icon abroad but less popular at home. She persuaded international donors to forgive $4.6 billion of Liberia's debt and has drawn $19 billion in foreign direct investment.
But 8 out of 10 people here still live on $1.25 or less per day, according to the World Bank. About half the population has no access to safe drinking water, and far fewer people have access to electricity.
The president has recently been criticized for clamping down on political freedoms. The government refused to allow the chief opposition party to use the main stadium in Monrovia, the capital, for a campaign event, and on Monday night it shut down a pro-opposition television network and two radio stations.
The opposition's vice presidential candidate, George Weah, an international soccer legend, is his party's main draw. Liberians view his rise from a Monrovia slum to the ranks of the world's top athletes as inspiration for their own struggle against Liberia's deeply rooted elite.
''The Sirleaf administration has to do a much better job of reaching out to the disenfranchised youth of Liberia, who will always be an army of ready-made shock troops for any opposition,'' said Michael Keating, a Liberia expert at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. ''They need to do a much better job of creating jobs rather than simply signing natural resource deals that rarely serve the interests of the majority.''
The opposition's presidential candidate, Winston Tubman, a Harvard-educated former justice minister and diplomat, withdrew from the race on Nov. 5 after claiming fraud in the first round. International observers had declared the election free and fair, but Mr. Tubman urged voters to stay away from the polls during the runoff and warned of violence if it was not postponed.
Hundreds of demonstrators supporting Mr. Tubman's boycott took to the streets on Monday, throwing rocks and setting tires ablaze. The Liberian national police responded with tear gas and gunfire, chasing demonstrators off the main road. About 50 people were taken into police custody, said a police spokesman, George Bardue.
At the opposition's headquarters on Tuesday, the party's secretary general, Acarous Gray, addressed dozens of people who had gathered in the yard amid broken glass and spent bullet casings.
''I've come to offer solace, to tell you that all is not lost,'' he told the crowd, adding that the opposition would announce its position after overseeing the medical care of those injured in Monday's melee.
Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf expressed remorse over Monday's events as she cast her vote Tuesday in a small village 50 miles outside the capital. ''I think Liberians want peace, they want their basic needs met, and that will be our obligation and commitment,'' she said.
Though an elections commission spokesman, Emmanuel Bowier, said Tuesday's vote went off without a hitch, the earlier violence seemed to have had a chilling effect.
In the swamp behind the opposition headquarters, Victoria Wesseh, 28, said she saw a young man shot just a few feet from her zinc shack. ''If the president wanted peace, why would she bring police to kill innocent people?'' she said. ''I don't need to give her my vote.''
More people -- mostly young men -- stood defiantly outside a polling place in West Point, a Monrovia slum and opposition stronghold that in the first round was filled with voters.
''I'm not voting because what happened in my country yesterday made me feel discouraged from participating,'' said Kibie George, 32, a trader. ''I'm afraid and I'm bereaved. My brothers and sisters died yesterday.''
Daddy Boy Padmore, 27, was more to the point. ''We will not legitimize their killing,'' he said.
Fewer than a third of registered voters in one election district cast ballots on Tuesday at a high school in downtown Monrovia that was empty minutes before polling places closed.
''The first round, people were lined up out the door,'' said Lionel Richards, a poll worker. ''I don't know what happened.''

HEADLINE: Deficit Panel Members Seeking to Avoid Blame

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR; Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Members of a Congressional panel on deficit reduction are no longer trying just to solve the nation's fiscal problems. Some are desperately trying to avoid blame for the possible collapse of a process concocted by Senate leaders to break an impasse between those who want to raise taxes and those who would prefer to cut spending by focusing on entitlement programs.
After weeks of calculated silence, the two parties have begun shoving out rival versions of the same message: If the joint committee cannot reach agreement, the other side will be responsible. 
Republicans, long opposed to tax increases, said Tuesday that they might allow $250 billion to $300 billion of additional tax revenue as part of a deal to shave $1.2 trillion from federal deficits over the next 10 years.
Democrats were quick to dismiss the offer because, they said, it came with a proposal that would permanently reduce individual income tax rates, including those for the most affluent Americans -- a group that Democrats would like to see contribute more to deficit reduction.
Members of both parties said Tuesday that they saw a glimmer of hope that the panel could strike a deal and vote on its recommendations by the statutory deadline of Nov. 23, just two weeks off.
With Republicans resisting additional tax revenues until now, Democrats had refused to entertain significant savings in benefit programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the committee, said that the latest Republican overture represented a ''slight change.''
''I would not characterize it as substantial yet, but it is a change,'' he said. ''We have some distance to travel.''
Democrats said they worried that the ideas floated by Republicans like Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania might be largely a public relations gesture, to deflect Democratic complaints that Republicans were responsible for the current impasse.
Some of the new revenue under the Republican proposal would come from limiting tax breaks that primarily benefit upper-income households. Some would come from other sources like fees charged for government services, higher Medicare premiums for high-income people, sales of federal lands and surplus federal property, and perhaps oil drilling in part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a proposal that has failed to win broad Democratic support over the years.
Democrats pointed to the nontax revenue as evidence that Republicans were still not serious.
''The Republicans' insistence on no new taxes was not working,'' said a Democratic senator close to the negotiations. ''So Republicans have now offered a tiny bit of tax revenue. To be serious, they must offer much more.''
A Democratic aide close to the talks said the latest Republican proposal was unacceptable because it would lower the top tax rate on the most affluent Americans to 28 percent in 2013, from the current 35 percent. Under existing law, the rate is scheduled to rise to 39.6 percent in 2013.
''This plan would provide the very wealthiest Americans with one of the largest tax rate cuts ever,'' the Democratic aide said. ''It's a shell game -- a thinly veiled attempt to appear to put revenue on the table while simultaneously removing far more with massive tax cuts for wealthy Americans. This plan is not a solution that Democrats or middle-class Americans would ever be willing to accept.''
Another Democratic aide said the proposal would be ''a windfall for millionaires.''
A Republican close to the talks said it was Democrats who had been intransigent, demanding tax increases as part of any deal.
The House will not approve a bill that raises tax revenue unless it also reduces tax rates, the aide said, adding, ''We put tax revenues on the table, and Democrats don't know what to do.''
The Republican Study Committee, a group of more than 170 conservative House Republicans, immediately circulated a letter urging the committee not to support any tax increases. ''With current levels of taxation already limiting economic growth, we believe that marginal rates must be maintained or lowered and that repeal of any tax credit or deduction be offset with an equal or greater tax cut,'' the letter said.
The latest Republican proposal also calls for a gradual increase in the age of eligibility for Medicare, to 67 from 65, and the use of an alternative measure of inflation that would reduce annual cost-of-living adjustments in Social Security benefits.
The new measure of inflation would also be used to adjust income tax brackets and other tax code provisions. Some people would find themselves in higher tax brackets, and more income would be subject to taxation.
The Congressional Budget Office said these changes could reduce federal spending by more than $110 billion over 10 years and could generate $70 billion of additional revenue.
Creation of the panel, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, was originally recommended in July by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, concurred.
In a news briefing on Tuesday, Mr. McConnell said he suspected that ''folks down at the White House are pulling for failure'' by the panel, because an agreement would tend to disprove President Obama's portrayal of Congress as dysfunctional.
Mr. Reid said Republicans on the committee appeared to be under the spell of Grover G. Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, who strenuously opposes tax increases.
Mr. Norquist is so influential that it seemed as if he were ''elbowing his way into all these rooms where we're having these meetings,'' Mr. Reid said.
Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, said he had not been impressed with the panel's efforts to cut spending.
''It seeks only to spend the country into bankruptcy a little slower,'' Mr. DeMint said. ''Rather than letting the country rack up $23.4 trillion of debt by 2021, the supercommittee hopes to keep it to $21.3 trillion. It's the difference between speeding off a cliff at 91 miles per hour versus 100 miles per hour.''

HEADLINE: U.S. to Open New Areas to Offshore Drilling

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Tuesday announced its proposed five-year plan for offshore oil drilling, which calls for opening new areas in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska but bars development along the East and West Coasts.
The plan disappointed environmentalists but fell far short of what the oil industry and its Congressional supporters demanded. 
The plan, which is subject to months of public hearings and possible revisions, expands the areas in the Gulf of Mexico that are now under development, including some near Florida that have been off limits. It will also make available broader parts of the Arctic Ocean off the North Slope of Alaska and in the Cook Inlet off the state's southern shore.
But unlike an administration plan announced shortly before the lethal BP blowout and spill in April 2010, the government is withdrawing all of the Eastern Seaboard from leasing consideration.
The earlier proposal, later reversed, drew sharp protests from state and federal representatives along the East Coast, except for a handful of Virginia officials who were eager to see drilling rigs off the state's coastline.
Ken Salazar, the interior secretary, said the new plan incorporated the lessons learned from the BP explosion, which killed 11 workers and poured nearly five million barrels of crude into the gulf. Mr. Salazar said the proposal was a balance between resource development and environmental protection, while acknowledging that drilling beneath 5,000 feet of water in the gulf or in the unforgiving conditions in the Arctic would never be free of risk.
Oil industry officials quickly criticized the plan, which covers the years 2012-17, saying it limits oil exploration at a time when the economy is in desperate need of jobs.
But Mr. Salazar said that oil production in 2010 was at its highest level since 2003 and that natural gas production was at its highest peak in 30 years. He said his proposed offshore lease strategy made available more than 75 percent of undiscovered and technically recoverable oil and gas resources.
Still, anticipating industry criticism, he said at a noon briefing for reporters, ''We don't believe we should open up every single place and look under every single rock in order to produce oil and gas.''
Jack N. Gerard, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, said in an interview that this was a missed opportunity for the administration.
''They failed to open additional areas that would have led to job creation, revenue generation and economic recovery,'' Mr. Gerard said. ''What they've offered today is significantly less than what the president offered in 2010. The reality is we're moving in the wrong direction.''
Environmental advocates responded vehemently to the new plan, which they said put sensitive coastlines, waters and fisheries at risk in Alaska and in the gulf.
''Last year's disaster in the Gulf of Mexico was supposed to be a wake-up call about the dangers of offshore drilling,'' said Miyoko Sakashita, oceans director at the Center for Biological Diversity. ''But it looks like President Obama hit the snooze button and slept right through it.''
Several groups pointed out the difficulties of dealing with a potential spill in the Arctic, where the nearest Coast Guard facility is almost 1,000 miles away.
David J. Hayes, the deputy interior secretary, acknowledged that the infrastructure did not now exist to prevent or respond to a major spill in the Arctic. Mr. Hayes said a response could be compromised by inclement weather, a lack of deep harbors, a shortage of appropriate vessels and inadequate oil transportation resources.
The department was addressing those concerns, he said, and as a result had scheduled any possible lease sales in Alaska for the end of the five-year lease program.
Frances Beinecke, the president of Natural Resources Defense Council and a member of the panel Mr. Obama named to investigate the BP spill, said approving new drilling without adequate safety measures was a ''reckless gamble.''
''The president's oil spill commission put forth a game plan to improve the industry's safety, but it has yet to be realized,'' Ms. Beinecke said in a statement. ''Congress has failed to pass a single law to better protect workers or the environment. Industry has not invested sufficiently in developing the technologies needed to prevent future disasters. And the government still needs additional resources and science in order to effectively police an industry that so desperately needs it.''
