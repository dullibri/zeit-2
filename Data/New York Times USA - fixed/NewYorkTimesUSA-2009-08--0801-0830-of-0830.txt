HEADLINE: Dimming Prospects Aug. 23-29

 BODY:
THE NEWS Law firms have cut their recruitment of new lawyers so sharply that even at top law schools, students say they are having trouble getting interviews and are scrambling to find jobs in government or at public-interest groups, which typically pay much less than positions at private firms. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS With their revenue eroded by the economic downturn, many firms deferred some of their 2008 hiring into 2009, leaving little room for new recruits this year. Universities like Yale, Georgetown and Northwestern say interviews are down by one-third to one-half, and some major firms say they are doing no recruiting at all this year as they rethink how they fill their ranks.
 THE NEWS The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's reserves for protecting bank customers' deposits fell to $10.4 billion in the second quarter, the lowest level in nearly 16 years. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Financed using fees paid by banks rather than tax money, the reserves stood at $45.2 billion a year ago. But a growing wave of banks collapsing under the weight of bad loans -- more than 80 have failed so far in 2009 -- has drained most of that money, as the dud banks' depositors were made whole. The F.D.I.C. said in a grim report on the state of the banking industry that to keep the insurance fund afloat, a special assessment on surviving banks may be necessary soon. 
 THE NEWS After the release of a long-secret report by the C.I.A. inspector general on brutal interrogations of detainees, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. named a prosecutor to investigate the abuses. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Though President Obama has said he does not want the nation to dwell on the past, a series of controversies -- about whether to continue military trials, close the Guantanamo Bay prison or reveal what was done in the name of counterterrorism by the Bush administration -- have put mounting pressure on Mr. Holder to order an investigation over the objections of Leon E. Panetta, the agency's chief, who is trying to rebuild its morale. 
 THE NEWS Rapidly growing production of photovoltaic cells in China has helped push prices down by half over the past year, complicating President Obama's promise to restore American leadership in solar energy. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Chinese officials are alarmed, too, about the threat of overcapacity, and issued new limits on Wednesday to slow plant construction. Demand for solar cells is strong because of high energy prices, pressure to reduce carbon emissions and, most recently, economic stimulus plans that favor investments toward those goals. Western manufacturers question whether low-cost Chinese solar cells should qualify for those subsidies. 
 THE NEWS Opinion polls in Japan signaled that the Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled the country almost continuously for more than 50 years, would go down to a landslide defeat in parliamentary elections today.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Even the main opposition bloc, the Democrats, appeared surprised by surging voter discontent with the ruling party, which is deeply conservative despite its name and which has presided over political paralysis and economic decline that predated Japan's hard fall in the global recession. On Friday, new figures showing worsening deflation and unemployment at a postwar high seemed to underline the ruling party's struggles.

HEADLINE: In the Latest Friendly Gesture, North Korea Releases Fishermen From the South

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
North Korea on Saturday released four South Korean fishermen it had held for a month, in another move to reach out to its rivals after months of bellicosity. 
 The North returned the four-man crew and its 29-ton fishing vessel at the sea border off the Korean Peninsula's east coast. The South Korean boat was seized on July 30 after it strayed into North Korean waters when its satellite navigation system malfunctioned.
 The North's recent barrage of conciliatory gestures has been surprising, even to South Korean officials familiar with the fickle pattern in North Korea's diplomacy. Analysts say the overtures indicate that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, has regained confidence about his health and grip on power. He was reported to have had a stroke last August. 
 ''North Korea has suddenly become a nice guy, reaching across the table to grab South Korea's hand,'' said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at the Sejong Institute near Seoul. ''South Korea fears it might be dragged into a relationship it doesn't want. So it's balking, pushing back its chair from the table.''
 North Korea's charm offensive began when former President Bill Clinton visited Pyongyang, the North's capital, on Aug. 4 to secure the release of two American journalists held there on charges of illegal entry. Since then, North Korea has released a South Korean worker held for five months on charges of denouncing Communist rule, lifted restrictions on border traffic and promised to resume South Korean tours to scenic spots in the North. 
 It also sent a high-level delegation to the funeral of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. When President Lee Myung-bak balked at meeting the group, the delegates extended their stay to win an audience with him and relay Kim Jong-il's wish to improve ties. The mood is worlds apart from that of only three months ago. In April, the North launched a long-range rocket, quit six-nation nuclear disarmament talks, expelled nuclear monitors and restarted a plutonium plant. In May, it tested its second nuclear device.
 ''The change in Pyongyang's approach means that Kim Jong-il has now become confident about his health,'' said Kim Yong-hyun, an analyst at Dongguk University in Seoul. 
 His hard-line military had grown bolder as uncertainty deepened about the North Korean leader's health, heightening tensions with the outside world. Analysts said that helped Mr. Kim tighten his grip at home while he reportedly began grooming Kim Jong-un, the youngest of his three sons, as his heir.
 Mr. Kim looked gaunt after the stroke. But by meeting Mr. Clinton and later Hyun Jeong-eun, the chairwoman of the South's Hyundai conglomerate, in Pyongyang, and increasing his visits to factories and military units by 50 percent in the first half of this year, Mr. Kim showed he was healthy enough to remain in charge. 
 ''Kim Jong-il got the power elite to support his son,'' said Mr. Cheong, the analyst at the Sejong Institute. Now he must get his people to accept the son. To do that, he needs food for the hungry people and breakthroughs in external relations that can be attributed to his son.''
 But the North's ''tactical appeasing gestures'' disguise its ''strategic goal'' of both improving ties with the United States, South Korea and other neighbors and being accepted as a nuclear power, according to Park Hyong-joong, an analyst at the government-run Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.
 Washington has been mustering international support for United Nations sanctions intended to strangle the North's arms trade, which is an important source of hard currency for the North's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
 United States and South Korean officials fear the North may be using its current overtures to undermine international consensus for the need to enforce sanctions. They say they are determined to break the old pattern of rewarding the North's on-again, off-again nuclear strategy with aid and diplomatic incentives.
 South Korea says it will not repeat the old format of dialogue with the North that had provided aid but failed to dismantle the North's nuclear program. On Thursday, the State Department said it had no immediate plan to send an envoy to North Korea. Such a trip would allow North Korea to open the bilateral discussions it has long sought while continuing to shun six-nation talks, a forum Washington prefers. 
 Analysts say they expect the North to continue its recent tack. Mr. Kim has promised his people that he will rebuild the economy by 2012. That achievement would make the dynastic transfer of power to his son more popular domestically, but require better ties with the outside world.

HEADLINE: A New Jersey College Retreats Just a Bit

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
The bad-news budget fashioned by Gov. Jon S. Corzine and the New Jersey State Legislature in June at least tried to limit the pain for students at public colleges and universities. It provided that any school seeking federal stimulus money must accept a 3 percent cap on increases in ''tuition rates and required educational and general fees.'' 
 So imagine the surprise of students at Ramapo College when the college board of trustees last month approved a plan for a 3 percent increase -- and then imposed an additional charge of $500 per semester in ''capital improvement fees.'' College officials say the money is desperately needed to pay for roof repairs, heating system upgrades and other deferred maintenance on its campus, in Mahwah. Together, the tuition and fee increases amounted to a 12 percent hike over last year, which so infuriated some lawmakers that they threatened to slash the college's funding. 
 Faced with the criticism, school administrators beat a partial retreat, reducing the $500 fee to $164 per semester but insisting that they needed the funds because they already received less aid than other public colleges. Some lawmakers are still fighting to have the entire fee revoked, but many students say they are bracing themselves to pay more. 
 ''With the current economy, everyone is trying to pass the buck off to someone else, and students are at the end of the line,'' said Marissa Molnar, a marketing major who is entering her final semester. ''But it's too much of an increase, too soon.'' DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

HEADLINE: Tax Reform's Lesson for Health Care Reform

BYLINE: By BILL BRADLEY. 
Bill Bradley, a former Democratic senator from New Jersey, is a managing director of Allen & Company.

 BODY:
THE chance of bipartisan agreement on health care seems to be waning as August draws to a close and ideologues mount increasingly vitriolic attacks on President Obama's health care initiative. The debate is beginning to sound more and more like the politics President Obama decried in his campaign -- partisan, mean and progress-free. It needn't be that way.
 In 1986, before President Ronald Reagan, a Republican Senate and a Democratic House succeeded in passing landmark tax reform, Washington insiders and the press predicted -- as they are doing now -- that it would never happen. There are lessons from the 1986 legislative experience that can be applied to health care reform today. 
 In the end, the tax bill passed because each party got something it wanted: Republicans got a lower marginal tax rate, and Democrats eliminated special-interest loopholes. By adhering to the principles of equity (equal incomes should pay equal taxes) and efficiency (the market is a more efficient allocator of capital than Congress), the bipartisan coalition produced a bill that lowered the top tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent, eliminated $30 billion annually in loopholes and resulted in the wealthy contributing a higher percentage of income-tax revenues than they had before the reform. 
 Once the discipline of revenue neutrality was adopted, the trade-off between loophole elimination and a lower top rate became obvious (the lower the rate, the more loopholes had to be closed to pay for it), and the deficit was not increased. The bill's proponents, myself among them, also strove to enforce a no-amendment strategy on the Senate floor. With Republicans and most Democrats on the Finance Committee adhering to the strategy, countless amendments were fended off, and the compromise was protected from unraveling.
 None of this would have happened had the Reagan administration not taken on some of the Republican Party's sacred cows -- the oil and gas industry, real-estate interests and large industrial enterprises, all of which benefited disproportionately from loopholes. Similarly, the bill would never have passed had some Democrats not taken on an ingrained party orthodoxy -- the belief that equity demanded higher tax rates. 
 In addition, there was the human factor. I remember a meeting in the White House with President Reagan and the supporters of tax reform from both parties. Each member of Congress had a few minutes to say something to the president. When my turn came, I said, ''Mr. President, I know you're interested in tax reform because when you were an actor, the marginal tax rate was 90 percent -- and Mr. President, I'm interested in tax reform because when I was a basketball player, I was a depreciable asset.'' He smiled, and we found common ground because he had been an overtaxed actor and I had been a loophole for the New York Knicks.
 In working with Republicans, I felt I could trust Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, his successor, James Baker, and their staffs to do what they said they would do. Dan Rostenkowski, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and I believed not only that this tax bill was good policy but also that it might serve as a model for passage of other significant legislation, like deficit reduction and health care reform. Bob Packwood, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, initially resisted the idea of fundamental reform, but after his less-ambitious alternative bill collapsed in committee (one of the many times the whole tax-reform initiative looked dead), he became a fearsome and effective supporter of tax reform, and I became his partner.
 I mention all this because I believe such a grand bipartisan compromise is still possible with health care. 
 Since the days of Harry Truman, Democrats have wanted universal health coverage, believing that if other industrialized countries can achieve it, surely the United States can. For Democrats, universal coverage speaks to America's sense of decency and compassion. Democrats also believe that it will lead to a healthier and more productive country. 
 Since the days of Ronald Reagan, Republicans have wanted legal reform, believing that our economic competitiveness is being shackled by the billions we spend annually on tort costs; an estimated 10 cents of every health care dollar paid by individuals and companies goes for litigation and defensive medicine. For Republicans, tort reform and its health care analogue, malpractice reform, speak to the goal of stronger economic growth and lower costs.
 The bipartisan trade-off in a viable health care bill is obvious: Combine universal coverage with malpractice tort reform in health care. 
 Universal coverage can be obtained in many ways -- including the so-called public option. Malpractice tort reform can be something as commonsensical as the establishment of medical courts -- similar to bankruptcy or admiralty courts -- with special judges to make determinations in cases brought by parties claiming injury. Such a bipartisan outcome would lower health care costs, reduce errors (doctors and nurses often don't report errors for fear of being sued) and guarantee all Americans adequate health care. 
 Whenever Congress undertakes large-scale reform, there are times when disaster appears certain -- only to be averted at the last minute by the good sense of its sometimes unfairly maligned members. What now appears in Washington as a special-interest scrum could well become a triumph for the general interest. But for that to happen, the two parties must strike a grand bargain on universal coverage and malpractice tort reform. The August recess has given each party and its constituencies a chance to reassess their respective strategies. One result, let us hope, may be that Congress will surprise everyone this fall.

HEADLINE: Antiwar Movement Plans an Autumn Campaign Against Policies on Afghanistan

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
A restive antiwar movement, largely dormant since the election of Barack Obama, is preparing a nationwide campaign this fall to challenge the administration's policies on Afghanistan.
 Anticipating a Pentagon request for more troops there, antiwar leaders have engaged in a flurry of meetings to discuss a month of demonstrations, lobbying, teach-ins and memorials in October to publicize the casualty count, raise concerns about the cost of the war and pressure Congress to demand an exit strategy.
 But they face a starkly changed political climate from just a year ago, when President George W. Bush provided a lightning rod for protests. The health care battle is consuming the resources of labor unions and other core Democratic groups. American troops are leaving Iraq, defusing antiwar sentiments in some quarters. The recession has hurt fund-raising for peace groups and forced them to slash budgets. And, perhaps most significant, many liberals continue to support Mr. Obama, or at least are hesitant about openly criticizing him. 
 ''People do not want to take on the administration,'' said Jon Soltz, chairman of VoteVets.org. ''Generating the kind of money that would be required to challenge the president's policies just isn't going to happen.'' 
 Tom Andrews, national director for an antiwar coalition, Win Without War, said most liberals ''want this guy to succeed.'' But he said the antiwar movement would try to convince liberals that a prolonged war would undermine Mr. Obama's domestic agenda. Afghanistan, he said, ''could be a devastating albatross around the president's neck.''
 But there is also a sense among some antiwar advocates that Mr. Obama's honeymoon with Democrats in general and liberals in particular is ending. As evidence, they point to a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll showing that 51 percent of Americans now feel the war in Afghanistan is not worth fighting, a 10-point increase since March. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 ''We're coming out of a low period,'' said Medea Benjamin, co-founder of the antiwar group Code Pink. ''But as progressives feel more comfortable protesting against the Obama administration and challenging Democrats as well as Republicans in Congress, then we'll be back on track.'' 
 The Obama administration has opposed legislation requiring an exit strategy, saying it needs time to develop new approaches to the war. ''Given his own impatience for progress, the president has demanded benchmarks to track our progress and ensure that we are moving in the right direction,'' a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
 The October protest schedule is expected to include marches in Washington and elsewhere. But organizers acknowledge that it may be difficult to recruit large numbers of demonstrators. So groups like United for Peace and Justice are also planning smaller events in communities around the country, including teach-ins with veterans and families of deployed troops, lobbying sessions with members of Congress, film screenings and ad hoc memorials featuring the boots of deceased soldiers and Marines.
 ''There are some that feel betrayed'' by Mr. Obama, said Nancy Lessin, a founder of the group Military Families Speak Out. ''There are some who feel that powerful forces are pushing the president to stay on this course and that we have to build a more powerful movement to change that course.''
 The October actions will be timed not only to the eighth anniversary of the first American airstrikes on Taliban forces and the seventh anniversary of Congressional authorization for invading Iraq, but also an anticipated debate in Congress over sending more troops to Afghanistan. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the commander of American forces in Afghanistan, is widely expected to request additional troops, beyond the 68,000 projected for the end of the year, after finalizing a policy review in the next few weeks.
 The antiwar movement consists of dozens of organizations representing pacifists, veterans, military families, labor unions and religious groups, and they hardly speak with one voice. Some groups like Iraq Veterans Against the War have started shifting their focus toward Afghanistan, passing resolutions demanding an immediate withdrawal of troops from there. Others, like VoteVets.org, support the American military presence in Afghanistan, calling it crucial to fighting terrorism. 
 And some groups, including Moveon.org, have yet to take a clear position on Afghanistan beyond warning that war drains resources from domestic programs. 
 ''There is not the passion around Afghanistan that we saw around Iraq,'' said Ilyse Hogue, Moveon.org's spokeswoman. ''But there are questions.''
 There are also signs that some groups that have been relatively quiet on Afghanistan are preparing to become louder. U.S. Labor Against the War, a network of nearly 190 union affiliates that has been focused on Iraq, is ''moving more into full opposition to the continuing occupation'' of Afghanistan, said Michael Eisenscher, the group's national coordinator. 
 ''President Obama risks his entire domestic agenda, just as Johnson did in Vietnam, in pursuing this course of action in Afghanistan,'' Mr. Eisenscher said.
 Handfuls of antiwar protestors can still be seen on Capitol Hill, outside state office buildings and around college campuses. Cindy Sheehan, for instance, has set up her vigil on Martha's Vineyard while Mr. Obama vacations there. But many advocates say a lower-key approach may be more effective in winning support right now. 
 An example of that strategy is an Internet film titled ''Rethink Afghanistan,'' which is being produced and released in segments by the political documentary filmmaker Robert Greenwald. In six episodes so far, Mr. Greenwald has used interviews with academics, Afghans and former C.I.A. operatives to raise questions about civilian casualties, women's rights, the cost of war and whether it has made the United States safer.
 The episodes, some as short as two minutes, are circulated via Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and blogs. Antiwar groups are also screening them with members of Congress. Mr. Greenwald, who has produced documentaries about Wal-Mart and war profiteers, said the film represented a ''less incendiary'' approach influenced by liberal concerns that he not attack Mr. Obama directly.
 ''We lost funding from liberals who didn't want to criticize Obama,'' he said. ''It's been lonely out there.'' 
 Code Pink is trying to build opposition to the war among women's groups, some of which argue that women will suffer if the Taliban returns. In September, a group of Code Pink organizers will visit Kabul to encourage Afghan women to speak out against the American military presence there.
 And Iraq Veterans Against the War is using the Web to circulate episodes of a documentary, ''This Is Where We Take Our Stand,'' filmed in 2008 at its Winter Soldier conference, at which veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan testified about civilian casualties, combat stress and other tolls of the wars.
 The group's leaders say they do not expect many people to take to the barricades against the administration any time soon. But that will change, they argue, as the death toll continues to rise. 
 ''In the next year, it will more and more become Obama's war,'' said Perry O'Brien, president of the New York chapter of Iraq Veterans Against the War. ''He'll be held responsible for the bloodshed.''

HEADLINE: Clunkers Don't Come Cheap

 BODY:
The $3 billion cash-for-clunkers program that ended last week worked well as a jolt of economic stimulus. Nearly 700,000 people used the rebate to buy new cars in July and August -- adding about 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points to economic growth in the third quarter, at an annual rate. 
 But there's also another lesson in the cash-for-clunkers experience: such rebates are a spectacularly inefficient way to implement environmental policy. Sure, the new cars deliver about nine miles per gallon more than those traded in, on average. But the benefits -- measured in terms of reduced greenhouse gas emissions -- come at inordinate expense.
On average, cars are driven 12,000 miles per year, according to government statistics. Considering that the traded-in clunkers had an average fuel economy of 15.8 m.p.g. while the new ones deliver 24.9 m.p.g., a swap saved some 278 gallons of gas per year -- which would have released almost 2.8 tons of carbon dioxide when burned. 
 Assuming the clunkers would have been driven four more years, the $4,200 average rebate removed 11.2 tons of carbon from the atmosphere, at a cost of some $375 per ton. If they would have been driven five years, the carbon savings cost $300 per ton. And if drivers drive their sleek new wheels more than they drove their old clunkers, the cost of removing carbon from the atmosphere will be even higher. 
 To put this in perspective, an allowance to emit a ton of CO2 costs about $20 on the European Climate Exchange. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a ton of carbon would be valued at $28 under the cap-and-trade program in the clean energy bill passed by the House in June.
 The program might have been more efficient with modifications, like a smaller rebate. But even if the new cars bought under the program had zero emissions, the price of removing the clunkers' carbon dioxide from the atmosphere would have been nearly $140 per ton. 
 The best tool to induce Americans to drive more fuel-efficient cars would be a gas tax that provided rebates for low-income drivers. Another, though inferior, alternative -- if Congress couldn't face the political risks of a gas tax -- would be a program that provided a rebate for drivers of clean cars while imposing a fee on drivers of gas hogs. 
 In any case, as environmental policy, it's just too expensive to buy clunkers to take them off the road.

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Projects Stall
 In Greenpoint
 Greenpoint, a neighborhood lined with the bones of industry and infused with a rich Polish heritage, has avoided much of the tumult that churns neighboring Williamsburg. 
 The main commercial thoroughfare, Manhattan Avenue, is still a village high street, lined with Polish bookstores, cafes and meat markets. Even nearby Franklin Street, a trendy stripe of restaurants and bars, manages to feel sleepy. 
 For now at least, Greenpoint's stunning views of Manhattan are still mostly unobstructed by the kinds of high-rise developments that are starting to sprout -- and wither -- in Williamsburg.
 A 2005 rezoning that was supposed to transform both neighborhoods has foundered in the recession, leaving parts of Greenpoint in a curious stasis. Condominium projects have stalled, and some developers have resigned themselves to renting.
 ''There's an impact on the neighborhood,'' said David Yassky, the city councilman who represents the area and said there are now 10 stalled projects in the neighborhod. ''An empty site is an eyesore. It leaves an unsettled feeling.''
 Beyond the woes of developers, the city's financial belt-tightening is also being felt. ''The macroeconomy of the city is affecting the development of open space in Greenpoint,'' said Ward Dennis, the chairman of the local community board's land use committee, referring to slow-moving or postponed parks projects. 
 And in another worry with echoes across the city, local merchants say there are more empty storefronts on Manhattan Avenue. At Zayas Appliance, a store the owners say might be the oldest in Greenpoint, they are starting to feel the pinch. Gina Zayas, 29, who took over the store from her father eight years ago, talked about her experience.
 Q. In what ways are you feeling the recession?
 A. It started last August. A lot of regulars, we just haven't seen. The appliances are usually the biggest sellers, but people are cutting back. This other stuff [teapots, vacuum cleaners, kitchen gadgets] helps.
 Q. You're part of a local merchant's association. Are you hearing the same thing from other members?
 A. Everybody's moaning. Being a business owner is hard enough, but our margins are getting smaller and smaller. We're trying to make the neighborhood a more pleasant place to shop, and we're trying to encourage people to shop local.
 Q. Did you sell any air-conditioners this summer?
 A. No. It rained for two months. And a lot of the renters, these young hipsters, are very energy conscious.

HEADLINE: A Hired Gun for Microsoft, In Dogged Pursuit of Google

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash. 

 BODY:
Qi Lu knows as well as anyone just how difficult it is to take on Google. 
 For nearly a decade, Mr. Lu played a leading role in building Yahoo's Internet search and advertising technologies. The effort was so important that Yahoo backed it with billions of dollars to acquire companies, hire armies of engineers and develop and run its own systems. Yet Yahoo fell further and further behind and many analysts said the company was simply outgunned by Google. 
 Mr. Lu, who is 47, left Yahoo 14 months ago, but now finds himself once again leading the charge against Google. This time, he is backed by a patron that vows to spend even more than Yahoo did on the mission: Microsoft. 
 ''It's an unfinished mission that I would like to work on,'' he said. 
 The challenge for Mr. Lu and his team remains enormous, and success appears improbable. But since Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, tapped him to become president of the company's online services division in December, Mr. Lu, a self-effacing engineer who is one of the most private and atypical executives in the upper ranks of the Internet industry, has earned the confidence of Microsoft's troops and helped to bring a dose of optimism to a beaten-down team. 
 Possessing unusual stamina and a maniacal work ethic, he has pushed his team hard to give Microsoft an important victory. In nightly 9:30 meetings over several weeks, he leaned on his managers to find creative ways to structure a sweeping and complex partnership with Yahoo. The deal, signed in July, will give Microsoft something it has coveted for years: a vastly larger audience that will make Bing, its search engine, the runner-up to Google. 
 But Mr. Lu and his team will have a lot of running to do. Even after adding Yahoo's search traffic, Bing's share of the search market will be less than half as big as Google's. Closing that immense gap will be difficult, in part because most users are happy with Google, which is constantly improving its search service. 
 In a lengthy interview last week at Microsoft's headquarters, Mr. Lu said he was not underestimating the challenge. But over time, he said, Microsoft has a chance to offer a service that is different and compelling enough to compete effectively. 
 For Microsoft, succeeding in search is vital to the company's long-term health. For Mr. Lu, it is a mission he felt obligated to take on. 
 ''I do think that this is answering a call to duty,'' he said. Wearing a Bing T-shirt tucked into jeans held up by a black leather belt and wearing brown sandals and white socks, the wiry Mr. Lu looked more like an engineer than a senior executive. 
 And with an engineer's logic, he laid out his reasons for returning to the fray. Search determines where users go online, and search advertising is the most powerful economic force on the Internet. The business is too important to be controlled by a single company, he says.
 Having grown up poor in China, Mr. Lu said, he feels duty-bound not to squander the rare opportunity he was given. He was raised by his grandparents in a rural village with no electricity or running water. 
 His intelligence got him into Fudan University in Shanghai. After finishing his master's degree in computer science, he attended a talk given by Edmund M. Clarke, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon. Impressed by Mr. Lu's questions and research, Professor Clarke invited him to apply to a doctorate program. 
 Mr. Lu, who earned about $10 a month teaching at the university, could not afford even the application fee, so the professor arranged for the fee to be waived and Mr. Lu was admitted.
 Mr. Lu says the challenges he faced growing up turned out to be a blessing: ''You can say it's harsh, but it teaches you so many things.''
 After earning his Ph.D. in 1996, he went to work at one of I.B.M.'s prestigious research labs. 
 He was lured to Yahoo in 1998. A few years later, as Google and Yahoo squared off, he headed the development of Yahoo's search and search advertising technologies. 
 By all accounts, Mr. Lu poured his heart and soul into the mission. Hired as an engineer, he rose through the ranks not by personal ambition but rather through sheer intellectual ability and his willingness to take on ever larger roles. Eventually, he ran a team of about 3,000 engineers.
 ''He shunned the limelight, but he was considered one of the stars of Yahoo,'' said Tim Cadogan, the chief executive of Open X, an advertising technology company, who worked closely with Mr. Lu at Yahoo. 
 Mr. Lu's colleagues at Yahoo and Microsoft say his intellect is matched only by his work habits. He sleeps three to four hours a night. One most weekdays, he wakes up around 4 a.m., goes through his e-mail and runs four miles on a treadmill while listening to classical music or watching the news. 
 He prefers to be in his office between 5 and 6 a.m. to have uninterrupted time to prepare for his day. He is often sending e-mail to his staff until midnight or later. (Mr. Lu, who is married and has two daughters, reserves much of the weekend to spend with his family.)
 When he first met Mr. Lu, Jeff Weiner, a former senior executive at Yahoo who worked closely with him for years, thought his punishing schedule was not sustainable. But Mr. Lu's manager brushed aside Mr. Weiner's concerns, saying ''That's just Qi,'' (pronounced Chee). 
 ''I look back on that because of the number of people who came to me since to express concerns, and I said 'that's just Qi,' '' said Mr. Weiner, who is now chief executive of LinkedIn, a social networking site. ''He is not wired like everyone else. Anyone else doing that would be burnt to a crisp, but Qi was one of the most productive people I've ever worked with.''
 His work ethic and intellectual ability have earned him praise from rivals. ''I have the highest respect for him,'' said Udi Manber, a vice president of engineering for search at Google, who worked with Mr. Lu at I.B.M. and Yahoo. ''He is probably the best competition I can have.'' 
 Mr. Lu's discipline also expresses itself as loyalty. On his last day at Yahoo, for example, a problem came up with a database, and he worked side by side with his engineers trying to fix it. He left only when, at midnight, his e-mail and network access were automatically cut off. 
 Furthermore, Mr. Lu declined to talk with Mr. Ballmer, who had become interested in meeting him, until after his long-planned departure from Yahoo because he thought it would be improper.
 Mr. Lu was contemplating opportunities in venture capital and even thought of returning to China. But he changed those plans after Mr. Ballmer flew to Silicon Valley with two Microsoft engineering executives to meet Mr. Lu to informally discuss the search business.
 Mr. Ballmer was immediately smitten. 
 ''He walked out of the room and I'm talking to the other two guys and I say, 'God, I think we ought to talk to that guy about coming to Microsoft,' '' Mr. Ballmer said in an interview. They immediately called Mr. Lu on his cellphone, Mr. Ballmer said. ''He came on back, and we started the dialogue about him joining the company, which eventually bore fruit.'' 
 Mr. Lu knows it will take much longer for his own mission to bear fruit. ''There is lots and lots and lots of work ahead of us,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In New Orleans, Recovery Is No Longer Enough

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
Houses still sit empty, residents are still scattered and streets still echo with the sounds of hammers and power saws. But on the fourth anniversary of the hurricane that redefined its future, New Orleans is no longer talking about mere recovery.
 Yes, people are returning: the number of households receiving mail is now more than three-fourths of the pre-Katrina figures, according to the latest estimates, up from fewer than half three years ago. Projects stalled by red tape and the bad credit market, like the Lafitte public housing complex, are finally getting back on track. 
 But reverting to the city that existed here before the flood is not the goal. For a city that justly if sometimes self-consciously relishes its own nostalgia, there was much about pre-Katrina New Orleans, from the unstable floodwalls to the stagnant economy, that was best left behind. Employment had not grown for the six years before the storm. The population had been shrinking since the 1960s. In 2005, there were only two Fortune 500 companies with headquarters here -- now there is only one, Entergy, a power company. 
 So instead of returning to a decaying economic structure, New Orleans is talking about revitalization, a buzzword behind the new energy in the city, carried by an intensity and idealism that would have bordered on indecent in the old, charmingly carefree New Orleans. 
 It is there among the legion of young nonprofit workers crowding the bars of the Bywater at night, drawn to what one described as her generation's civil rights struggle. They envision the city as a national example for innovative schools, smart urban planning and a housing stock built to the highest environmental standards.
 And it is there among the swaggering entrepreneurs, who have set up small branding firms, music licensors and green energy companies in the downtown warehouses. Over drinks at a downtown boutique hotel, they seem largely untroubled by the reluctance of Fortune 500 companies to bring their headquarters here. This is not a town for old-line corporate thinking. This is a town for pioneers, risk-takers, they say.
 But this energy is not enough, on its own, for a new, flourishing, functioning New Orleans. A large-scale rejuvenation of the city's economy needs a large-scale commitment, with the city's leadership on board. And the tens of billions of government dollars flowing into the city for the next few years give it a rare, but not unlimited, chance to make that kind of commitment.
 ''This infusion of cash really creates a churn in the economy that otherwise would not be there,'' said Greg Rigamer, a demographer and founder of GCR & Associates. ''We're early enough in the process to take advantage of it, and far enough along that we could lose the opportunity.''
 Some point to the return of tourism as a promising economic sign. The leisure and hospitality industry, the city's largest nongovernment employer and revenue generator, was among the very first to come back after Hurricane Katrina, and considering that tourism is hurting everywhere these days, it is relatively robust. There are sweaty throngs in the French Quarter, even in August, usually an off month. The 1,027th restaurant just opened in town, and the Brennan's restaurant chain said it had its best June and July in 20 years.
 But in spite of all this optimism, there are still fundamental problems that have not been addressed. Many neighborhoods seem barely touched since the flooding four years ago. Empty stores still stare out along commercial strips in Arabi and New Orleans East. Much of the Lower Ninth Ward, with its concrete slabs and grassy lots, still looks like an oversize graveyard. 
 The Gentilly neighborhood at first seems to have bounced back, but a closer look shows how many houses are vacant. According to the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center, New Orleans has roughly the same number of abandoned or vacant residences as recession-ravaged Detroit, a city more than twice as large as New Orleans. 
 The city's unemployment rate is 7.4 percent, compared with 9.4 percent nationally, but many of the jobs are in reconstruction. Some worry that, economically, the city is just falling back onto its old ways.
 ''Our economy was based heavily on low-wage tourism jobs,'' said Allison Plyer, the data center's deputy director. ''It still is. The main impediment was an undereducated work force. And that hasn't changed so much.''
 The city's political leadership remains torn by factionalism, and few people look to it for visionary or inspirational ideas.
 Plans for a public-private partnership for economic development were suspended this month by Mayor C. Ray Nagin, who cited a lack of diversity in the venture's proposed membership, among other reasons. His opponents, including Arnold Fielkow, the president of the City Council, said the move was retaliation for the Council's rejection of the mayor's plan to move City Hall to the vacant Chevron building downtown. 
 Mr. Fielkow may try to succeed Mr. Nagin, who is barred from running again by term limits, and there already seems to be an outsize expectation about the race next spring, which might as well be a referendum on the identity of the city itself.
 There are existing plans for major economic development: from a rejuvenated port to an ambitious (and controversial) medical district to a sports complex or theme park. All of these are largely in the discussion stage, and all of them face serious shortfalls of money, political support, or both.
 For now, Mr. Fielkow said, the city has focused on improving the fundamental barriers to economic development. A radical re-engineering in administration of city schools, once a major drag on the city's reputation, has indeed brought about improvement in the eyes of many New Orleanians. 
 On the other hand, the city's claims of success in fighting crime, while backed by statistics, are diluted somewhat by the fact that New Orleans still has the highest murder rate per capita in the country, a huge impediment to luring back business.
 But perhaps the largest barrier to major private investment is the uncertainty that hangs over every facet of life in the city: the future of the New Orleans economy depends on what happens when the waters rise again.
 The Army Corps of Engineers has a Hurricane and Storm Risk Reduction System scheduled to be ready in 2011, and important projects, like a mammoth storm surge barrier, are well under way. But increasingly, many are concerned that the disappearance of Louisiana's coastal wetlands can make even the strongest levee system inadequate.
 None of this reassures investors. 
 ''It's going to take another hurricane to hit the area to demonstrate the levees will hold,'' said Loren C. Scott, an emeritus professor of economics at Louisiana State University, ''in order to sell that as a good deal.''

HEADLINE: As Banks Repay Bailout Money, U.S. Sees Profit

BYLINE: By ZACHERY KOUWE; Eric Dash contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Nearly a year after the federal rescue of the nation's biggest banks, taxpayers have begun seeing profits from the hundreds of billions of dollars in aid that many critics thought might never be seen again.
 The profits, collected from eight of the biggest banks that have fully repaid their obligations to the government, come to about $4 billion, or the equivalent of about 15 percent annually, according to calculations compiled for The New York Times. 
 These early returns are by no means a full accounting of the huge financial rescue undertaken by the federal government last year to stabilize teetering banks and other companies. 
 The government still faces potentially huge long-term losses from its bailouts of the insurance giant American International Group, the mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the automakers General Motors and Chrysler. The Treasury Department could also take a hit from its guarantees on billions of dollars of toxic mortgages.
 But the mere hint of bailout profits for the nearly year-old Troubled Asset Relief Program has been received as a welcome surprise. It has also spurred hopes that the government could soon get out of the banking business.
 ''The taxpayers want their money back and they want the government out of our banking system,'' Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican and a member of the Congressional Oversight Panel examining the relief program, said in an interview.
 Profits were hardly high on the list of government priorities last October, when a financial panic was in full swing and the Treasury Department started spending roughly $240 billion to buy preferred shares from hundreds of banks that were facing huge potential losses from troubled mortgages. Bank stocks began teetering after Lehman Brothers collapsed and the government rescued A.I.G., and fear gripped the financial industry around the world.
 American taxpayers were told they would eventually make a modest return from these investments, including a 5 percent quarterly dividend on the banks' preferred shares and warrants to buy stock in the banks at a set price over 10 years. 
 But critics at the time warned that taxpayers might not see any profits, and that it could take years for the banks to repay the loans.
 As Congress debated the bailout bill last September that would authorize the Treasury Department to spend up to $700 billion to stem the financial crisis, Representative Mac Thornberry, Republican of Texas, said: ''Seven hundred billion dollars of taxpayer money should not be used as a hopeful experiment.''
 So far, that experiment is more than paying off. The government has taken profits of about $1.4 billion on its investment in Goldman Sachs, $1.3 billion on Morgan Stanley and $414 million on American Express. The five other banks that repaid the government -- Northern Trust, Bank of New York Mellon, State Street, U.S. Bancorp and BB&T -- each brought in $100 million to $334 million in profit.
 The figure does not include the roughly $35 million the government has earned from 14 smaller banks that have paid back their loans. The government bought shares in these and many other financial companies last fall, when sinking confidence among investors pushed down many bank stocks to just a few dollars a share. As the banks strengthened and became profitable, the government authorized them to pay back the preferred stock, which had been paying quarterly dividends since October. 
 But the real profit came as banks were permitted to buy back the so-called warrants, whose low fixed price provided a windfall for the government as the shares of the companies soared. 
 Despite the early proceeds from the bailout program, a debate remains over whether the government could have done even better with its bank investments. 
 If private investors had taken a stake in the banks last October on par with the government's, they would have had profits three times as large -- about $12 billion, or 44 percent if tallied on an annual basis, according to Linus Wilson, a finance professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, who analyzed the data for The Times.
 Why the discrepancy? Finance experts say the government overpaid for the bank assets it bought, because its chief priority was to stabilize the teetering financial system, not to maximize profit.
 ''Had these banks tried to raise money any other way, they probably would have had to pay quite a bit more than the government received,'' said Espen Robak, head of Pluris Valuation Advisors, which analyzes the value of large financial institutions. 
 A Congressional oversight panel concluded in February that the Treasury paid an average of 34 percent more than the estimated fair value of the assets it received.
 Of course, many finance experts suggest that the comparison is academic at best, because there is no way to know what might have become of the banks or the financial system as a whole had the government not acted. 
 ''Taxpayers should heave a sigh of relief that the investment in the banks protected them from even more catastrophic losses from more bank failures,'' said Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University.
 A more direct comparison of profits can be made with the investment performance of other governments that poured money into ailing banks last fall.
 The Swiss government, for example, said last week that it had pulled in a handsome profit for taxpayers on a $5.6 billion bailout it gave to UBS, the troubled Swiss bank, at the height of the financial crisis in October. The government netted $1 billion on its investment, a gain equal to a 32 percent annual return.
 ''They are substantially in the money,'' Guy de Blonay, a fund manager at Henderson New Star in London, said after the announcement. 
 American taxpayers could still collect additional profits on their investments in two other big banks that have repaid their preferred stock but not their warrants: JPMorgan Chase and Capital One. They are expected to yield over $3.1 billion in gains for the Treasury in the next month or so, although the full tally will depend on how much they will pay to buy back their warrants. 
 And the government is owed about $6.2 billion in interest payments from banks that have not yet repaid their federal money.
 But all the profits taxpayers have won could still be wiped out by two deeply troubled institutions. Both Citigroup and Bank of America are still holding mortgages and other loans that were once worth billions of dollars but whose revised values are uncertain. If they prove ''toxic'' because they cannot attract buyers, they could leave large holes in the banks' balance sheets. 
 Neither bank is ready to repay its bailout money anytime soon, even though the banks' stock prices have surged in the last month, leaving the government sitting on paper profits of about $18 billion between them.

HEADLINE: Island News, For Once, Isn't Human

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: MONTAUK, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 What with the rain and the recession and more rain and the hurricanes that weren't but scared people away nonetheless, it was a pretty quiet summer for the folks on Long Island's East End. The last time a whole summer went by without a major tabloid moment, Jackson Pollock was still slinging paint around.
 On the other hand, for the East End's critters, it was a summer for the ages. And absent any celebrity car wrecks, gallery busts, A-list divorces and the like, most of the news that mattered was about creatures of the sea, air and woods. 
 Where to start? There was the first beaver seen on Long Island in more than 100 years, reported by The East Hampton Star, probably a young male who made it across the Sound, maybe on a piece of driftwood. It was photographed in Napeague long after beaver lodges and felled trees indicated that one might be around. Beavers were indigenous to Long Island and trapped out of existence long ago, so more power to the perseverance of this one.
 There were the whales, especially humpback and fin whales, seen in large groups reasonably close to Montauk for the first time in almost a decade. Whale-watching excursions from Montauk were popular in the 1980s and '90s, but after 2002, the whales had moved more than 45 miles offshore. This summer they were back -- humpbacks, which can weigh more than 70,000 pounds; fin whales; minke whales, tails slapping like cars dropped into the sea -- wondrous reminders of the mysteries just out of view.
 There was more -- an 800-pound endangered leatherback turtle, the largest of all sea turtles, found dead on a beach in Springs, apparently after being struck by a boat, its body like a startling bit of marooned marine sculpture; surfers attacked by hungry bluefish in July like something from a bad Hitchcock knockoff; armadas of dolphins; New York State's announcement that there are now so many wild turkeys on Long Island, more than 3,000, that Suffolk County will hold its first sanctioned turkey hunting season in November.
 THE East End dazzle always coexists with the natural world, but given how woozy things were for the bipeds, there was something bracing in the reminder of the power of biological persistence, of the real world around our often illusory one. 
 As for the humans, the best that could be said is that the world did not end. ''Last fall, all I saw was a black hole,'' said Roger D. Blaugh, a real estate broker in Southampton. ''Now I don't think it has as deep as black a color. And given the fact that the 401(k)s that became 201(k)s are now back to 301(k)s, there's got to be a fraction of light in there.'' 
 In fact, he says, sales are beginning to pick up, partly because so much is on the market. The East End for-sale inventory has risen from under 6,800 in January to 7,555 now. Usually, it's around 4,400, Mr. Blaugh said. 
 And a striking number of those sales are for distinctly non-Hamptons prices. 
 Since the beginning of the year, in the broader area including less pricey precincts west of the Shinnecock Canal, more properties sold for under $600,000 -- a price range once thought to be as endangered as the leatherbacks -- than in all other price ranges combined. Even in the Hamptons proper, most sales were for under a million.
 Still, if business was down for almost everyone, and you could easily find motel vacancy signs during prime August weather last week, it is not as if the spending stopped.
 ''There's still lots of money out there, and people don't want to give up things they've had in the past,'' said John DeMaio, who runs the 37-foot fishing boat Vivienne, where fishing trips go for $600 a half day. ''I've had customers hurt by Madoff, but it doesn't mean they ran out of money. And then you have the civil service people who still have plenty of money. It's like czarist Russia.''
 Still, given the economic tides, it felt as if the place to be wasn't the still-pricey precincts of the Hamptons but Montauk, long the happily glitz-deprived corner of the East End. It is the province of old crackerbox seaside motels and the Puff 'n' Putt miniature golf course, shaggy surfers and a smattering of the Manhattan club set who have gravitated out where the T-shirts say something crude about Montauk and advise: ''For your comfort and safety, stay in the Hamptons.'' Even the folks at the chic-crowd hangout, the Surf Lodge, are quick to tout their lack of exclusivity.
 In truth, the global currents, including warming oceans, are not getting any friendlier for the critters. The economic bad news might not be over. The big blow that's missed Long Island since the hurricane of 1938 is out there somewhere. But for creatures large and small, there are worse things than a quiet summer, and few pleasures greater than an August day, light wind, bright sky: the world, for a moment, more or less what we once knew.

HEADLINE: N.B.A. Teams Devise New Ways to Fill Seats

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
In an effort to fill seats during difficult economic times, many N.B.A. teams are hoping to lure new fans with incentives.
 Perhaps no other team has enhanced its marketing game the way the Nets have. They are offering ticket buyers free jerseys, complete with the names of their favorite players -- and their favorite opponents. 
 The Nets are promoting a 10-game plan that includes tickets to see the Los Angeles Lakers, the Boston Celtics, the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Miami Heat and the Orlando Magic. Any fan who buys at least two tickets for the 10-game plan (mininum 20 tickets) will receive a reversible jersey from each of the five marquee games, one side featuring the name of a Nets star, like guard Devin Harris, and the other featuring the name of a marquee opponent: Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Shaquille O'Neal, Dwyane Wade, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce or Ray Allen. 
 ''I don't think it has ever been done before,'' said Chris Granger, the N.B.A.'s senior vice president for team marketing and business operations. ''I don't think any team has ever given premium items as part of a promotion that highlights someone from another team.''
 Brett Yormark, the president and chief executive of the Nets, said the team could only profit by aligning itself with visiting stars. 
 ''We cater to the casual N.B.A. fan, that's our core audience,'' Yormark said. ''So when you think about every arena selling opposing player jerseys at the concession stands, and when you think about attendance always being greater when you have the key matchups and the best players in town, why wouldn't you do it? It gives the fans another added benefit, not only to embrace their favorite local player, but also a member of the opposition that they also came out to see.'' 
 Wade, the Heat's star guard, called the concept ''totally awesome.''
 Wade added: ''It's a very unique idea. It takes a confident organization to give their fans merchandise associated with players from other teams. I look forward to the day when we're in town and I get to see all those Wade reversibles out there.''
 Nets center Brook Lopez was asked if the reversible-jersey promotion was a blow to the egos of him or his teammates.
 ''Not at all,'' he said, laughing. ''I can speak for most of the guys who think this is a very cool promotion. I think it will actually help all the teams involved, and it's a great way to bring enthusiastic fans to the games and raise the energy level in our arena.'' 
 In other N.B.A. cities, marketing officials are stretching their imaginations to persuade fans to stretch their entertainment dollars. Miami has a promotion called All You Can Heat, which caters to fans who are interested in buying partial-season ticket plans. Based on what an announcement on the Heat's Web site calls an ''a la carte philosophy,'' fans can pick and choose any six games. They can also ''customize their fan experience'' with one of a handful of activities, like taking a photograph at center court, participating in postgame free-throw shooting or receiving a customized Heat jersey.
 In Dallas, anyone who buys ''select full-season ticket package'' receives a free ticket to the 2010 All-Star Game, which the Mavericks will host.
 In Philadelphia, the 76ers are running a Back 2 School promotion: four tickets to the home opener, two backpacks, two T-shirts and two hats for $75.
 The Detroit Pistons are offering three options: the Big Game Plan, 12 marquee games for the price of 9; the Weekend Plan, 12 weekend games for the price of 9; and the Economy Plan, 16 games for a minimum of $225.
 In Indiana, the Pacers were offering the first 100 fans who buy full- or half-season tickets a chance to meet the first-round draft pick Tyler Hansbrough.
 Granger said that the N.B.A. was able to ''find out what interests ticket buyers,'' through a recent survey of about 30,000 fans across all 30 N.B.A. cities.
 ''We basically asked all of those fans, What experience would you like to have over and above buying tickets to the games?'' he said. ''As a result, there's clearly an array of very cool, very access-oriented products out there that we haven't had in the past.''

HEADLINE: With Bold Stand, Japan Opposition Wins a Landslide

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; Makiko Inoue contributed reporting from Sayama, Japan.

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Japan's voters cast out the Liberal Democratic Party for only the second time in postwar history on Sunday, handing a landslide victory to a party that campaigned on a promise to reverse a generation-long economic decline and to redefine Tokyo's relationship with Washington.
 Many Japanese saw the vote as the final blow to the island nation's postwar order, which has been slowly unraveling since the economy collapsed in the early 1990s.
In the powerful lower house, the opposition Democrats virtually swapped places with the governing Liberal Democratic Party, winning 308 of the 480 seats, a 175 percent increase that gives them control of the chamber, according to the national broadcaster NHK. The incumbents took just 119 seats, about a third of their previous total. The remaining seats were won by smaller parties.
 ''This has been a revolutionary election,'' Yukio Hatoyama, the party leader and presumptive new prime minister, told reporters. ''The people have shown the courage to take politics into their own hands.'' 
 Mr. Hatoyama, who is expected to assemble a government in two to three weeks, has spoken of the end of American-dominated globalization and of the need to reorient Japan toward Asia. His party's campaign manifesto calls for an ''equal partnership'' with the United States and a ''reconsidering'' of the 50,000-strong American military presence here.
 One change on the horizon may be the renegotiation of a deal with Washington to relocate the United States Marine Corps' Futenma airfield, on the island of Okinawa. Many island residents want to evict the base altogether. 
 The Democrats, who opposed the American-led war in Iraq, have also said they may end the Japanese Navy's refueling of American and allied warships in the Indian Ocean. 
 The White House issued a statement on Sunday saying it was ''confident that the strong U.S.-Japan alliance and the close partnership between our two countries will continue to flourish'' under the new government. ''President Obama looks forward to working closely with the new Japanese prime minister on a broad range of global, regional and bilateral issues,'' the statement said.
 Political analysts expect Japan to remain a close American ally, but one that is more assertive and less willing to follow Washington's lead automatically.
 ''This is what happens when you have a government in Japan that must be responsive to public opinion,'' said Daniel C. Sneider, a researcher on East Asia at Stanford University. ''It will end the habits from decades of a relationship in which Japan didn't challenge the United States.''
 At the same time, the Democrats want to improve relations with other Asian countries, including on the touchy issue of history. Analysts say the party seeks to reverse Japan's growing isolation in the region under decades of right-wing Liberal Democratic rule. 
 Such changes are not likely to come quickly. Diplomatic analysts expect the Democrats to steer clear of security issues for the time being because they could prove too divisive for a party dependent on a broad ideological spectrum.
 And some analysts have played down the rhetoric of Mr. Hatoyama, a bushy-haired former management professor, as a nod to his party's left-leaning base rather than a firm pledge to alter dealings with the United States drastically. In recent interviews, Democratic leaders have insisted there will be no major changes in that relationship. 
 ''It's complete nonsense that a non-Liberal Democratic government will hurt U.S.-Japan relations,'' said Tetsuro Fukuyama, a Democratic lawmaker who oversaw production of the campaign manifesto. ''But there are many things left unchanged from the last 50 years that need to be re-examined.''
 Analysts, however, saw the vote less as an embrace of the Democrats than a resounding rejection of the incumbents. The conservative Liberal Democrats, who with their precursors have held or shared power for 62 of the past 63 years, led Japan from bombed-out rubble to economic miracle, while keeping it firmly in Washington's camp.
 But the party has appeared increasingly exhausted and directionless, and Japan's traditionally apolitical electorate, in a rare display of popular democratic muscle, firmly blamed it for the decline of this former economic superpower and its increasingly cloudy future.
 ''We have been trying to outgrow this old one-party system ever since the collapse of the Berlin Wall,'' said Takeshi Sasaki, a political expert and former president of the University of Tokyo. ''It took two decades, but we finally made it.''
 Prime Minister Taro Aso told reporters that he would take responsibility for the defeat, and stepped down Monday as head of the party.
 The exhilarating sense that Japan had reached a turning point drew long lines of voters to polling stations in Tokyo, where they braved darkening skies from an approaching typhoon. About 70 percent of eligible voters cast ballots, according to NHK, the highest turnout in nearly two decades.
 ''I want the Democratic Party to have a go at running the country,'' said Akiko Tanaka, a 34-year-old nursing home care worker who voted at a junior high school in the Tokyo suburb of Sayama. ''If we keep going like we've been, nothing will get better. We need a new government.''
 A top priority for the new government will be simply maintaining the unity it achieved on Sunday. The largely untested Democrats, a broad coalition of former Socialists and Liberal Democrat defectors, hope to avoid the mistakes of the only previous non-Liberal Democratic government, in 1993, which collapsed in just 11 months because of infighting and defections. 
 That imperative virtually assures no sudden, radical departures in foreign policy. Rather, analysts expect the Democrats to focus at least initially on their more ambitious domestic agenda.
 The party has pledged to change the postwar paradigm here as well, promising to ease growing social inequality by handing more money and social benefits directly to residents rather than to industry or other interest groups. 
 It has promised to strengthen the social safety net and raise the low birthrate by giving families cash handouts of $270 per month per child. And the party has said it will rein in the powerful central ministries in Tokyo, which have run postwar Japan on the Liberal Democrats' behalf. 
 But even here, most people have not embraced the party's platform with much enthusiasm, nor are they optimistic about the Democrats' ability to solve looming problems like the growing government debt and a rapidly aging population. 
 To many voters, the most important fact of this election was that they finally had a choice.
 ''This vote is about making a system where parties that fail get kicked out,'' said Yoshiyuki Kobayashi, 40, one of the white-collar corporate workers known here as salarymen. ''We need to teach politicians to be nervous.''

HEADLINE: A Soup Swaps Football Helmets for Hard Hats

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE Chunky line of soups is sending to the showers the National Football League players who have appeared in its advertising since 1997, supplanting them with the types of everyday men whose idea of a nice dinner in tough times is a can of soup bearing a brand name instead of a store label.
 The Campbell Soup Company, which introduced Chunky in 1969, will present the brand as a reward for a hard day's work rather than as fuel for gridiron greatness. The revised approach is scheduled to begin next week in ads on television and radio, in print and online. 
 Those with long memories -- or memories for marketing trivia -- may recall the beer campaigns of the 1970s and '80s that celebrated men and their jobs. Budweiser ads proclaimed ''For all you do, this Bud's for you'' and Miller High Life told men finishing work: ''When it's time to relax, one beer stands clear. If you've got the time, we've got the beer.''
 Replace the cold brews with hot soup, and add a child or two to demonstrate that men today are family-oriented, and voila, vintage paeans to labor are updated for an economy that evokes the recessions of the '70s and '80s. 
 Executives for Chunky and their agency, Y&R, part of the Young & Rubicam Brands division of WPP, say they are not completely giving up on football. Chunky continues as a sponsor of the N.F.L., for example, and Troy Aiken, the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback, will take part in public relations initiatives.
 ''The brand wouldn't be where it is today without the N.F.L.,'' said Michael Barkley, vice president for ready-to-serve soup at Campbell in Camden, N.J.
 But the football-centric campaigns that featured players like Donovan McNabb, LaDainian Tomlinson and Kurt Warner -- and, in some years, mothers of players -- are being benched. The spotlight is turning to blue-collar men who work in shipyards or quarries and on farms and who come home to children they play with and help care for.
 Instead of slogans replete with football references like ''Meals that fill you up right,'' and comparisons of playing pro football to ''a day working the line,'' the new campaign is more straightforward, offering observations like this: ''A man's got to eat. He just wants to eat better.''
 It is ''a decision that isn't taken lightly,'' Mr. Barkley said, particularly since the football campaigns helped Chunky -- the second-largest Campbell brand, behind only the mainstay red-and-white soups -- double its sales from 1997 to 2o02.
 But research showed that the Chunky brand had recently ''lost some relevance'' with its core consumers, he added, men ages 35 and older.
 And sales have declined for the last three of Campbell's fiscal years, according to data from Information Resources Inc., with the slump accelerating: down 6.4 percent in fiscal 2007, 12.4 percent in fiscal 2008 and 14.7 percent in fiscal 2009. (The Campbell fiscal year typically runs from early August through late July.)
 To reverse that trend, Mr. Barkley said, Chunky ads, previously aimed more at men than women, will also try to speak to the wives and mothers who typically buy the food for their families.
 ''To get to the guy,'' he added, ''we have to get the stamp of approval from the female head of household.'' So ads will run on Web sites like foodnetwork.com and ivillage.com as well as menshealth.com and nfl.com, and in magazines like Cosmopolitan and male titles like Men's Health.
 The media agency for Chunky is Mediaedge:cia in New York, part of the GroupM unit of WPP.
 The differences from the previous campaigns are also meant to signal that there is ''news about the product,'' Mr. Barkley said, in the form of recipe changes like adding more vegetables and lean meat.
 To make the campaign more realistic, the commercials were cast and filmed in Seattle, he said, using ''regular blue-collar workers with day jobs'' instead of actors.
 Each commercial shows a man working hard at a hard job as these words appear on screen: ''Why we made Campbell's Chunky soup.'' As they arrive home, greeting their children, these words appear: ''Why we're making it better.''
 And like a regular guy who puts his money where his mouth is, Campbell will increase the marketing budget for Chunky in fiscal 2010 by 50 percent, to more than $30 million.
 The Chunky changes are being made as some see a trend toward romancing the blue-collar trades, which coincides with the recession's doubts about white-collar pursuits like investment banking, mortgage brokering and whatever it is that hedge fund managers do.
 Although that is not the reason for the overhaul, ''as a brand we need to be the everyday guy's advocate and celebrate him,'' said James Caporimo, executive vice president and group creative director at the Y&R New York office.
 That contrasts with situation comedies and ads in which ''this guy is always the butt of the joke,'' he added, mocked or portrayed as an obtuse dolt despite how ''he breaks his pick all day long'' for his family.
 As valuable as football players have been to Chunky, Mr. Caporimo said, they are celebrities rather than workaday men.
 So a decision was made to focus on ''that blue-collar guy doing his job, not hating it, doing it with a lot of gusto,'' he said.
 Gusto? That invokes another venerable beer campaign, for Schlitz, which advised men to ''grab for all the gusto you can get.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: The new campaign focuses on men working hard at real-life jobs. It also says the product has been improved, with more vegetables and lean meat.

HEADLINE: Let's Wind Down Fannie and Freddie

BYLINE: By ROB CYRAN

 BODY:
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shouldn't be allowed to languish in Uncle Sam's arms. But as the anniversary of their seizure by the government approaches, the mortgage financing giants remain the biggest black holes in the financial firmament.
 Lawmakers seem content to allow the two companies, whose combined value of holdings and guaranteed securities is $5.4 trillion, to slowly expand. That's a shame because forcing them to wind down their portfolios of mortgage-backed securities would be a good first step toward eventually deflating them. 
 The Obama administration won't release its recommendations for what to do with the companies until February. This gives it time to wage battles in areas ranging from climate change to health care. These issues are already drawing heavily on the president's political capital. 
 That may leave little appetite to tackle the problems at the two companies, which are government sponsored enterprises, or publicly traded entities created by the government. The firms have the popular support of some lawmakers and play an increasingly dominant role in the mortgage market. The United States has already committed up to $400 billion to cover the firms' losses, providing enough of a cushion to tempt politicians to let the issue slide. 
 The problem arises from the companies' dual roles. They have a public policy mandate to increase lending to the housing market. And they are supposed to reward shareholders. The conflict between these two goals caused the companies to nearly collapse. 
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's principal business of guaranteeing mortgages caused economic distortions that helped drive the housing boom. As private mortgage lenders pulled in their horns, the two companies' share of the market grew from under 50 percent to around 80 percent by the end of last year, despite the fact that their aggregate portfolios have only increased by about 3 percent since their conservatorship. 
 Their success is the sticking point. Society benefits from the efficiency and lower costs derived from the standardization of mortgage pools, which allows them to be easily securitized. The government sponsored enterprises scale this advantage up significantly. Fannie alone has $2.8 trillion of guarantees on mortgage-backed securities. 
 On the other hand, the guarantees have unintended consequences. Since investors always reckoned the government stood behind the two companies, mortgage rates fell below appropriate risk-adjusted market rates. This acted as a subsidy for home buyers at the expense of other taxpayers and contributed to the housing bubble. 
 Solving this problem without throwing the mortgage market into disarray will be difficult. Winding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac down, or splitting them into smaller firms without government backing would get rid of the subsidy, but could reduce the benefits they brings to the mortgage-backed securities market. 
 In any case, this would be a difficult sell politically because of to the firms' dominant positions. Fannie guaranteed more than half the mortgages for new single-family homes in the second quarter. 
 Policy makers aren't helpless. They can initially take on the companies' portfolios of mortgage-backed securities. Fannie alone holds more than $800 billion worth. The figure has grown at an annualized rate of 6 percent in the year to date.
 The mortgage-backed securities holdings are an arbitrage that benefited the companies' shareholders at the expense of taxpayers. Their quasi-governmental status means they could borrow more cheaply than others and plow the money into higher-yielding mortgage-backed securities. The resulting profits went to shareholders. 
 Moreover, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac successfully lobbied to be able to hold low levels of capital against their investments, bolstering returns. This also gave them little margin for error. Since the government now runs the show, there's little reason these holdings can't be wound down, although this would have to be done gradually.
 True, the two companies can act as mortgage buyers of last resort during crises, when the mortgage markets would otherwise seize. Yet Fannie didn't significantly shrink its portfolio of mortgage-backed securities during the easy money years from 2002 to mid-2007. Also, their purchases -- as distinct from their guarantees -- during this period probably didn't have much of an effect on mortgage rates, since they represented a relatively small part of the overall market. 
 When housing markets crashed, the direct mortgage portfolios left Fannie and Freddie saddled with avoidable losses. These are now taxpayer's problem. A quick way to avoid exacerbating this privatization of gains and socialization of losses would be to ban the two firms from buying more mortgage-backed securities and force them to run off their portfolios. Then the government can turn to the more nettlesome issue of their guarantees.

HEADLINE: Downturn Catches Up To Cafe Frozen in Time

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY; Rebecca White contributed reporting.

 BODY:
No one got the chance to say goodbye to Cafe des Artistes, the storied New York City restaurant that served up Old World fare under the gaze of the painted nubile nudes that perkily graced its walls. 
 The restaurant had closed on Aug. 9 for a monthlong vacation and was to reopen Sept. 14. But on Friday, facing steady losses and a union lawsuit, its owners made what they described as a wrenching decision to close the landmark cafe on West 67th Street for good.
 ''It's a very sad day for us,'' said Jenifer Lang, whose husband, George Lang, has owned the restaurant since 1975. ''It's a death in the family.'' 
 It was also the death of an intrinsic part of old New York. Countless couples got engaged in the glow of the restaurant's dim, romantic lighting. Stars flocked there during its heyday. Business deals were forged. Yet for better or worse, as the latest foodie craze swept the city, the restaurant kept serving its standbys, like pot-au-feu and salmon four ways, considered classics by some and relics by others. It stayed frozen in time, like an Upper West Side Miss Havisham. 
 Mrs. Lang, 58, said that the restaurant's business had been hurt by the economic crash but that its problems ran deeper. Cafe des Artistes was unionized, and she said the restaurant paid about $250,000 a year to cover its employees' health and pension benefits, an amount she said the restaurant struggled to cover. Mrs. Lang also said the couple, whose home is half a block from the restaurant, put in $2 million of their own money to keep it running over the last 10 years. 
 ''It makes it difficult to run a restaurant most of the time,'' Mrs. Lang said of the union benefits. ''When the economy is down, it makes it impossible.''
 The final straw, Mrs. Lang said, was a lawsuit recently filed against the restaurant by the union demanding past benefit assessments. 
 Bill Granfield, president of Local 100 of Unite Here, the union representing the cafe's 50-odd employees, said the restaurant had fallen behind on its payments for medical insurance and welfare funds, forcing the union to demand payment in court. He also said workers in 2003 took a pay cut and agreed to switch to a cheaper medical plan to ease the restaurant's financial pressures. 
 ''And here we are six years later, facing what might've been inevitable,'' said Mr. Granfield. ''We think Mr. Lang is a great figure in the restaurant industry, a great person, and it's a great restaurant. But it feels like time passed it by a while ago.''
 The Cafe des Artistes sits in the lobby of Hotel des Artistes, a part Gothic, part Tudor revival co-op building designed by George Mort Pollard that opened as artists' studios in 1916; the restaurant opened a year later. Howard Chandler Christy painted its walls in the '30s, according to Mr. Lang's memoir, ''Nobody Knows the Truffles I've Seen,'' creating 36 nudes, including one man, speculated to have been modeled after Buster Crabbe.
 It is unclear what will become of the space, or the murals, all of which belong to Hotel des Artistes, Mrs. Lang said.
 Mr. Lang, 85, was a violinist and a child prodigy from Hungary. He bought the restaurant in 1975, transforming it, for a while, into the toast of the town. 
 ''It was one of the places that we would go all the time, after concerts,'' said Itzhak Perlman, the violin virtuoso and conductor, who still fantasizes about a Cafe des Artistes dessert: pound cake flavored with fresh orange and topped with whipped cream.
 The restaurant became a home away from home for many, including journalists at ABC News, whose studios are across the street. 
 ''I loved it,'' said Lynn Scherr, a longtime ABC News correspondent. ''Eating at a place with naked women on the walls is not my favorite venture,'' she added, ''but I guess they're artistic.''
 Cafe des Artistes faced tough competition from illustrious restaurants in the neighborhood, including Picholine on West 64th Street, Jean Georges at the Trump International Hotel and Daniel Boulud's Bar Boulud on Broadway, all vying for the Lincoln Center crowds. ''The pie is certainly smaller for us now,'' said Terrance Brennan, Picholine's chef and proprietor. 
 Passers-by and longtime customers lamented the closing, though several had noted a decline in foot traffic. Richard Perl, who lives in Hotel des Artistes, said while he liked the cafe, he would rather spend the money at Jean Georges. Rita and Bernard S. Berkowitz recently bought an apartment across the street, partly because of its proximity to the cafe where they had been regulars for 30 years. 
 ''Now we'll have to sell the apartment!'' Mrs. Berkowitz said, only half in jest. 
 Through its windows on Sunday, the restaurant was already emanating an abandoned air. Sunlight filtered in weakly, catching dust particles hanging midair. Faint traces of dust lined the stilled ceiling fan, and the leaves of the abundant potted plants had begun to wilt.
 It was only the naked nymphs, with their glowing skin and warm eyes, that seemed able to stay suspended in time.

HEADLINE: After Carmakers Adapt, China Trade Dispute Ends

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
China's decision to comply with the first World Trade Organization decision against it, on auto parts, would make little difference to General Motors, a senior company executive said on Sunday.
 After four years of negotiations and W.T.O. reviews, the Chinese government announced late Friday that it would comply with the organization's ruling that China must reduce its steep tax on imported auto parts for cars that do not meet certain local standards.
 But the delay in changing its trade policies served to limit imports. During the lengthy negotiations, foreign automakers moved production to China on a large scale. The automakers with assembly plants in China have largely stopped using imported auto parts, partly to avoid paying the steep taxes on these parts and partly because international auto parts manufacturers moved production to China. 
 ''It will have virtually no impact on our operation,'' said Kevin E. Wale, the president of G.M. China, in a conference call with reporters. G.M., which accounts for three-quarters of American-brand vehicle sales in China, manufactures or buys in the country so many of its auto parts for vehicles sold in China that the government decision to comply with the ruling makes little difference.
 The Chinese decision had been widely awaited because it is the first time that China has had to comply with a W.T.O. decision. Having failed in an appeal, China faced the possibility of American trade sanctions if it did not act by Tuesday.
 Chinese government officials are still considering what to do about two other recent W.T.O. rulings against them. The organization declared that China had failed to enforce laws against counterfeiting and had unfairly limited imports of movies, music, books and other copyrighted materials.
 The Obama administration welcomed the Chinese move to reduce taxes on imported auto parts. ''Ending these charges will help ensure a level playing field for the high-quality auto parts made in America, and is an important example of the importance of enforcing our international trade agreement rights,'' Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative, said.
 China reduced its prohibitive taxes on imported cars and car parts when it joined the W.T.O. in 2001. But even after the reduction, the taxes have stayed higher than in most markets -- 25 percent for imported cars and 10 percent for imported parts.
 Four years ago, China tightened its rules and declared that importers of car parts would have to pay the higher tax for imported cars, unless only a few imported parts were being installed in cars built mostly from Chinese parts.
 The rule was intended to prevent foreign automakers from importing a good portion of a car's parts and force them to transfer their technology to factories in China.
 American and European trade officials began protesting the decision almost immediately. Negotiations with China moved slowly, so the United States began formal consultations at the W.T.O. with China in March 2006.
 The W.T.O. set up a dispute resolution panel in October 2006, and the panel ruled in July 2008 that China had broken its commitments by charging the higher tax rate on imported parts instead of the 10 percent rate that it had pledged. China appealed, but lost last December, which meant that it had until Sept. 1 to comply or else the United States could impose penalties.
 But while the trade process was slowly proceeding, foreign automakers and auto parts manufacturers moved extensive production to China. China now manufactures practically every auto part and it has earned a reputation for low costs and steadily improving quality. 
 Chinese auto parts exports to the United States have soared, almost doubling during the first three years after the Chinese imposed the tax. Exports receded slightly in the last year as auto production has slumped in the United States.
 Yale Zhang, the director of greater China forecasts for the CSM Corporation, a global vehicle forecasting company, said that the Chinese decision to reduce the tax rate for imported parts back to 10 percent might help foreign automakers that are just starting to produce a new model in China. These automakers might want to import a large percentage of the vehicle at first, before switching to parts factories now established in China.
 Western automakers continue to expand rapidly here. Mr. Wale announced on Sunday morning that G.M. had set up a joint venture to manufacture light delivery trucks with China FAW Group of Changchun. The Chinese now buy more than half the world's light trucks as entrepreneurialism flourishes.
 G.M. is building an entirely new factory with FAW in Harbin, China, that will be completed by the end of next year. It will build 100,000 light trucks a year for the Chinese market, Mr. Wale said.

HEADLINE: Concern Is High That Mob May Seek a Cut of the Stimulus Pie

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
Everybody is looking for stimulus money.
 From bridge builders to food stamp recipients, from roofers to subway riders, from teachers to housing project residents, people are eager to feel some part of a tidal wave of federal dollars in their lives.
 The mob is eager, too. 
 Federal and state investigators who track organized crime believe that some members have geared up to take advantage of the swift and enormous cash influx -- if they have not already -- looking, as the old Sicilian expression goes, to wet their beaks.
 Nimble, innovative and with a seemingly boundless appetite for the taxpayer's dollar, the mob's more sophisticated cadre has plundered municipal, state and federal coffers for generations.
 So the F. B. I. office in New York has conducted an extensive analysis of the money flowing into the area to create a blueprint of its vulnerabilities, a process, an official said, that is being continually updated.
 Also, some of the 28 inspectors general who have oversight of the federal agencies receiving stimulus money are considering having federal agents sit in on selected screening interviews of contractors to tell them that if they lie to a federal officer, they could be charged with a crime, officials briefed on the matter said.
 ''Because there is so much money involved, criminals will look to exploit the system,'' said Guy Petrillo, chief of the criminal division in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, referring to the New York area's five Mafia families.
 Because the money is being widely dispersed -- flowing to federal agencies, then to states and localities and then to contractors and smaller groups -- opportunities for fraud abound at a level rarely seen.
 And despite recent improvements, the screening of contractors sometimes still presents a challenge for local, state and federal agencies, which time and again have failed to halt the flow of public money to companies accused of having ties to organized crime or having otherwise troubling histories.
 Indeed, even with the mob's power waning, some members have profited handsomely in the past few years on projects large and small. They have benefited from new baseball stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets, the city's $3 billion water filtration plant and the post-9/11 cleanup at ground zero, as well as from work on federal buildings, state highways and city schools and playgrounds.
 The audacity and accomplishment exhibited by some contractors seem to match the gusto they have for government work. One mob associate, convicted in 1994 in a case stemming from organized crime's control of lucrative Housing Authority window replacement contracts, pleaded guilty nearly a decade later in a case involving window replacement work on city schools. After serving nearly three years in prison, he got in trouble again last year for improprieties involving another window replacement contract, this one at the same federal courthouse where he was convicted in 1994.
 In another case, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's pet project to spruce up City Hall Park was delayed because two successive concrete contractors were found to have ties to organized crime. The mob also had long cornered the market on the city's lucrative emergency snow removal contracts, as well as controlling city school bus contracts. 
 The distinctiveness of the immediate challenge surrounding the stimulus money is owed in part to the bill's twin imperatives: Get a lot of money out and get it out as fast as possible. And it is compounded by the fact that law enforcement agencies like the F. B. I. and prosecutors' offices are hip deep in the competing priorities of counterterrorism and the explosion of corporate and mortgage fraud cases.
 Making matters worse, the money is flowing into familiar territory for those with a history of feeding at the public trough. Two of the largest portions of the stimulus pie in the New York City area are going to sectors of the economy -- Medicaid and infrastructure projects -- where the mob and Eastern European crime groups have flourished for decades, perfecting old schemes and developing new ones.
 And it is not just criminals who are causing concern. Several officials noted that in an area where close to two dozen state and city legislators have been indicted in recent years, the flow of stimulus funds through government agencies will provide ample opportunity for corrupt public employees.
 Marc La Vorgna, a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, whose administration will dole out nearly $1 billion for infrastructure projects and $2.5 billion in Medicaid and social service money, played down concerns about the vetting of contractors. The amounts to be awarded, he said, are far from astronomical for a city with a $60 billion budget and ''robust fraud- and waste-prevention measures,'' which include a staff that has doubled in eight years and an additional layer of review for stimulus contracts.
 Mr. La Vorgna added, ''The notion that the city's vendor integrity mechanisms will somehow be taxed is false.''
 State officials said they, too, were comfortable with their vetting procedures. Gov. David A. Paterson appointed a panel last month to coordinate the state's antifraud efforts.
 And Congress has appropriated about $220 million in additional money to assist 23 of the 28 federal inspectors general involved in overseeing stimulus money, said Ed Pound, a spokesman for the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, the federal stimulus watchdog.
 But despite these measures, the speed with which the program has been put in place, along with what many officials have called insufficient oversight, has left some in law enforcement with grave concerns.
 ''It's coming out without the internal controls in place,'' said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly. ''It's like putting a bank robber in a toll booth.''

HEADLINE: Tickets Are a Tough Sell For the New Giants Stadium

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE; Ken Belson contributed reporting.

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 

 BODY:
Saturday night's preseason game between the Giants and the Jets drew a crowd announced as 74,255 to Giants Stadium, which seats 80,242.
 The game, a 27-25 Jets victory, was the last between the teams in their current stadium in the Meadowlands. Next year, they will move next door to a new stadium costing $1.6 billion. It will seat about 82,500.
 But in selling seats for both stadiums during a severe recession, Jets and Giants officials are facing economic forces that have been daunting even big-ticket sports franchises in major markets.
 The Giants, who still have seats to sell for some games this season, have not found buyers for about 3,000 club season tickets for 2010, some in the best locations at the highest prices. 
 And the Jets lag behind the Giants. They said they still had ''a few thousand'' season tickets remaining for 2009 and were advertising half-season packages.
 As for 2010 in the new stadium, the Jets are not providing specific sales figures for suites, club seats with personal seat licenses or nonclub seats because, they said, it was too early to know.
 ''Right now, we are sort of in the middle of the process,'' said Thad Sheely, the Jets' executive vice president for stadium development. ''We still have some selling to do.''
 Jim Lites, a senior consultant contracted by the Giants to sell seats in the new stadium, acknowledged that the recession and the higher ticket costs for 2010 were having a chilling effect.
 ''There is a point at some price that people won't purchase a product,'' Lites said. ''It's still a bit of sticker shock. There has been some pushback on the price.''
 The gentrification of stadium seating in sports reached a new threshold this year with the opening of the new Yankee Stadium. Some seats in rows closest to the plate were initially priced at $2,500 a game.
 Some went unsold. And although unsold grandstand seats at N.F.L. games could lead to local television blackouts, the league said that empty club seats or suites would not remove games from local broadcasts.
 Lites said the Coaches Club behind the Giants' bench has 2,093 seats that require a $20,000 personal seat license and $700 per ticket for 10 games, including two exhibitions.
 About 400 are still available, Lites said, as well as about 2,600 other club seats in less-expensive locations. The rest of the main stadium is sold, he said, and demand for those lower-priced seats exceeded the supply.
 But the luxury suites are still available. The Giants said they had leased slightly more than 60 percent of the approximately 200 suites, totaling about 4,000 seats.
 That sales figure has moved only marginally from the Giants' report from almost a year ago of more than 50 percent.
 Mike Stevens, the chief marketing officer for the Giants, said the most expensive suites, costing $500,000 a season, were taken, as were the lowest-priced suites, which cost about $150,000. But the suites in between have not generated as much demand.
 ''At the depths of the recession, it was not an opportune time to talk to people about a product like suites,'' Stevens said. ''But in the last couple of weeks to a few months, receptivity levels have changed. We have a lot of agreements in the pipeline.''
 Suites for Giants games will have from 12 to 26 seats, he said. The Jets' suites, Sheely said, will have 12 to 30 seats, totaling about 5,000.
 The best suites, Sheely said, feature ''outdoor terraces and a private, all-inclusive club modeled after New York clubs like the University Club or the Racquet Club, with fireplaces and dark wood paneling.''
 But when asked how many suites had been sold, Sheely said, ''We are not publicly discussing numbers.''
 As for this season's unsold tickets, Matt Higgins, the Jets' executive vice president for business operations, said: ''That's another number we're not disclosing. We have a few thousand left and we'll be sold out by opening day.''
 Although the top personal seat license for the Giants is $20,000, the Jets sold some through an auction for as much as $85,000, Sheely said. The Jets' Web site lists the most expensive remaining P.S.L.'s at $30,000.
 After Giants fans expressed reluctance to buy some corner mezzanine seats for $400 a game, the Giants reduced the price of 1,596 of them to $250, although the license fees for those seats remained $7,500.
 The P.S.L.'s, a new concept in the New York market, help pay the construction cost of the new stadium. Lites said they could be sold on the secondary market and transferred to new owners.
 P.S.L.'s allow fans the right to buy tickets perpetually. Lites said some customers with $10,000 P.S.L.'s for the Giants were already trying to sell their rights online for $20,000.
 ''I don't know if they're successful,'' Lites said. ''We won't recognize the transfer -- unless it's to an immediate family member -- prior to 2011.''
 The sticker shock, as Lites called it, was felt throughout the waiting list for season tickets. Some fans waited for decades but refused to buy seats for 2010 when given the chance.
 One was Gina Alfonso of Nanuet, N.Y., who waited 24 years. ''I got an e-mail saying there were tickets available and to grab them,'' she said. ''It said, 'Dear Giants Wait List Member.' ''
 But when she read the terms, she said, she was ''surprised and disappointed'' at the prices.
 ''I didn't call them,'' she said. ''It's hard for a normal fan to go.''
 Albert Cruz of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., had a similar reaction when he was asked to renew his Jets season tickets for next year. He has sat in the fourth row for 25 years, he said. His tickets cost $90.
 For next year, he said, he was offered midlevel seats with P.S.L.'s from $8,000 to $9,000 and per-game prices of $400 to $500.
 ''They're just too darn expensive,'' Cruz said. ''As a loyal fan, I feel shafted.''
 The Jets said many customers were financing their licenses through the Jets at 6.5 percent interest over five years, or 8 percent over 15 years.
 The Giants said they had allowed some extended payment plans, but that few customers had requested them.
 ''We decided very early on we did not want to play the role of being a financier,'' Stevens said.
 The Jets' top price for a P.S.L., outside of an auction, is $30,000 and the lowest is $4,000, according to their Web site. The Giants' lowest P.S.L.'s sell for $1,000.
 The Jets will sell 27,000 seats in the upper bowl with no P.S.L.'s. But that will not matter to Ed Ranieri of Staten Island, who has had Jets season tickets since 1986. He is giving them up.
 ''It got too expensive,'' he said, adding: ''They came out with a new stadium we don't need. It's all about the money. They ruined a nice thing. I still love the Jets, but I'll watch on TV.''

HEADLINE: You're Gone. But Hey, You Can Reapply.

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
On Aug. 12, the employees of The Journal News, a Westchester daily owned by Gannett, were told that there would be further staff reductions at the daily paper, which covers Westchester, Putnam and Rockland counties in New York. No surprise there. 
 But the suburban newspaper is at the vanguard of the industry: reporters at The Journal News don't work in a newsroom, they are part of an ''Information Center''; they don't cover beats, they cover ''topics''; and in a new wrinkle to an old story, the staff was not being laid off, but becoming part of a ''comprehensive restructuring plan.'' 
 Specifically, the 288 news and advertising employees at The Journal News were told that jobs were being redefined and that they all would need to reapply for the new positions and that by the time the re-org music stopped, 70 of them would be without jobs.
 What fresh hell is this? 
 For the last three weeks, employees at The Journal News have lived in a netherworld in which they were asked to justify their existence in a changing, shrinking world. After filling out an application on Sharepoint, a corporate Web site, that asked them about their new-media skills, among other things, and then being interviewed by corporate human resources executives pulled in by Gannett, they were called up to the third floor of the offices in Westchester last Thursday and given an offer letter in a thin white envelope -- ''Thank you for your participation in the restructuring of the Information Center department at The Journal News. I am pleased to extend you an offer. ...'' -- or a much thicker manila envelope explaining their departure and severance.
 ''It was an unreal day around here, with people being called up to the third floor and being told. We'd clap when someone came down and gave a thumbs up, but it became obvious that many of the people being called up later would not be sticking around,'' said one person who got an offer and wants to keep it that way by not being identified as being critical of the process.
 Let's take a short breath here. Corporate bloodletting is part of the everyday life of many Americans right now, and people in the journalism business represent a microscopic part of both G.D.P. and a larger misfortune that is falling on all American workers. (Don't look for a lot of that kind of news at The Journal, by the way: The entire business reporting and editing staff was laid off in the reorganization.) 
 But the effort deserves some scrutiny because although it was conceived locally by Michael J. Fisch, publisher and president of the newspaper, it could portend things to come at Gannett, which has 84 daily newspapers and 850 nondaily publications. 
 One longtime worker who received a manila envelope, but still asked to remain anonymous -- ''This is not a great time for me to make waves'' -- was bitter about the process.
 ''How is the fact that I don't have a Twitter or Facebook account relevant to what I do?'' he said. ''After many years of great work here, I have to go into some office and tell a person who I have never met why I deserve to work at The Journal. I probably didn't do a good enough job of hiding my disgust.''
 Confronted by the Hobbesian prospect of lobbying for a job they thought they already had, some simply said no thanks. The majority of the sales staff in the Rockland office -- eight out of 11 people -- declined to reapply and took severance. Most chose to participate, though, because in the current environment, the management has all the leverage. Anybody who leaves journalism right now will probably not find a way back in.
 ''I don't feel like a winner even though I still have my job,'' said Ernie Garcia, a staff writer who covers Yonkers who credited his management with being straightforward and honest throughout the process. Still, he said: ''I wish there had been a straight-up layoff. This was very nerve-racking and agonizing. And everyone in our business has to live with this uncertainty going forward. '' 
 Mike Roy, a photographer with significant video skills, expected to be part of the new future at The Journal News, but he was cut last week. He wondered whether the plan wasn't just a way for the company to slim down while covering itself legally.
 On one level, the plan seems to make sense. Advertising revenue has dropped more than 30 percent in the last year at The Journal News. On the plus side, blogs at the newspaper's highly evolved, highly local Web site account for 20 percent of the traffic there, four times higher than the industry average, according to Ken Doctor, a media analyst at Outsell. Redefining beat reporting jobs with blogging, video and social media baked in is arguably a plan for the long haul. 
 Mr. Fisch, the publisher, said that the reapplication process was intended to reconfigure the business to comport with new realities, not cut salaries. (Six reporters I spoke to said that although their job description had changed, their compensation had not.)
 ''The restructuring or reinvention was really focused on getting the right skill sets to take us forward, given all the challenges in a multiplatform environment,'' he said by phone.
 Past the management-speak, Mr. Fisch did not sound like the kind of ogre that would make for good column copy when I spoke to him on Wednesday as many of his employees were getting the bad news. He sugarcoated nothing and did not try to minimize the damage to morale or news gathering.
 ''It gives us all pause,'' he said. ''You try to do things with the greatest amount of respect for the individual, but we know that the trust between employer and employee has been shaken. If you have been here 10 years or 20 years and you are asked to hit the reset button, you are going to have strong feelings about that.''
 Mr. Fisch, who has been at the newspaper for two years, said that he did not go through the process, but ''as chief executive, I reapply for my job basically every day.''
 His approach to reconfiguration of the newspaper and its Web site, called LoHud for Lower Hudson, could end up being in demand if the process impresses Gannett officials.
 ''Gannett has looked to The Journal News and LoHud.com as one of its leading-edge local news models,'' said Mr. Doctor. ''It just makes sense that 'restaffing' the operation there is another step on the road to reshaping Gannett -- print and broadcast -- across the country.''
 Working reporters already know that if they want to make it out of this business alive, it behooves them to file early and often on whatever platform management puts in front of them. But Gannett, the highest-margin operator in the business in the good old days, is cutting to the chase, effectively putting a premium on new-media output while salaries and staffing remain constant, thereby driving down the per-unit cost of content that it sells ads against. 
 It has its own cold logic. If the news is worth less than it used to be in a new digital economy, we better make more of it and more cheaply. I guess we're going to have to reapply ourselves.

HEADLINE: Latin American Politicians Reverse Gains in Free Press

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Maria Eugenia Diaz contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela.

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
For the family of Jose Sarney, Brazil's Senate president, the daily onslaught of newspaper reports about nepotism and corruption accusations against him was too much to bear. 
 So Mr. Sarney's son Fernando, who manages most of the family's private businesses, turned to a federal judge in Brasilia, winning an injunction to stop a leading newspaper, O Estado de Sao Paulo, from publishing any more reports about the allegations. 
 The court's action, in late July in the midst of a drawn-out battle in the Senate over Mr. Sarney's future, immediately raised cries of censorship. It was widely seen here as a setback after important strides in removing restrictions to a free press, including a decision in April by Brazil's Supreme Court to strike down a dictatorship-era law that imposed harsh penalties for slander and libel.
 Beyond Brazil, though, the Sarney case has underscored concerns across Latin America that despite a decade defined by the rise of populist leaders who have promised to help the downtrodden, many judges continue to bow to the whims of the powerful in censoring journalists. 
 In recent months, journalists across the region have faced opposition not only from courts but also from the leaders of several countries, who have moved to restrict critical coverage and paint the news media as the enemy.
 That tendency has been especially glaring in Venezuela. Since taking office in 1999, the government of President Hugo Chavez has pursued strategies to limit the independence of the media, including the recent endorsement of a move to revoke the licenses of dozens of radio stations and approval this month of an education law that would further restrict the media.
 ''What is happening in Venezuela you can see in other parts of Latin America,'' said Carlos Lauria, senior Americas program coordinator with the Committee to Protect Journalists in New York. In Nicaragua, Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia and Argentina, in particular, he said, leaders ''are reacting with a lot of intolerance to criticism in the media.''
 President Evo Morales of Bolivia has described the press as the main enemy of the government. In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Rosario Murillo, the government's chief of communications, have described the private media as C.I.A.-financed ''children of Goebbels.'' Critical journalists have faced smear campaigns by official government media outlets intended to discredit independent reporters, Mr. Lauria said.
 In Brazil, the Sarney case is just the latest example of a lower court's accepting a request to prevent a media outlet from broadcasting or publishing reports on suspected corruption. A string of news media reports have charged that Jose Sarney used his position as Senate president to award jobs to friends and family, and that he held an illegal bank account, among other claims.
 After O Estado began running articles detailing transcripts of telephone calls recorded by the police, in which Fernando Sarney discussed business deals and his father's Senate influence, the younger Mr. Sarney reached out to the judge in Brasilia, Dacio Vieira, who granted the injunction. 
 Lawyers for the Sarneys have called O Estado's articles libelous and denied the accusations against Jose and Fernando Sarney. The injunction came as the Senate's ethics council -- controlled by supporters of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, an ally of Mr. Sarney -- considered 11 allegations against Mr. Sarney for possible impeachment. 
 On Aug. 12, the president of the ethics council, Paulo Duque, discarded all the allegations; Mr. Duque later explained his decision by saying the charges were based only on ''media reports.'' 
 But Ricardo Gandour, O Estado's editor in chief, said, ''The recordings show a senator with his son and close family members negotiating jobs and benefits as if the Senate were a private company, the property of the family.'' 
 Mr. Gandour called the injunction unconstitutional. He said the paper was appealing the court's decision and continuing its investigation.
 In Venezuela, Mr. Chavez and his supporters have been stepping up efforts to restrict news media coverage. After he denounced in late July what he called a private media ''tyranny'' on the airwaves, regulators revoked the licenses of 34 of the country's radio stations, saying they were not properly licensed.
 Venezuela's information minister, Blanca Eekhout, said those responsible for ''media lies'' should face criminal charges. A draft law on ''media crimes'' presented to the legislature at the end of July makes it an offense, punishable by imprisonment, to provide false information that is deemed to harm the interests of the state or pose a security threat.
 On Aug. 3, more than 30 armed pro-government militants stormed the offices of a private broadcaster, Globovision, setting off tear gas. The station, known for its strident criticism of Mr. Chavez's government, has been the target of continued government harassment, with Venezuelan regulators opening five administrative proceedings against it, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
 Then, just days ago, a dozen journalists who were marching peacefully to protest the new education law were intercepted by Chavez supporters and beaten with sticks, according to photos of the incident. The government at first condemned the attack, but more recently said the journalists had provoked their attackers. The education law prohibits ''the dissemination of ideas and doctrines contrary to the national sovereignty and the hallowed principles and values in the Constitution.''
 A vote in February to change Venezuela's Constitution and allow for indefinite re-election emboldened the Chavez government to go after the media more forcefully, said Marcelino Bisbal, a media professor at Universidad Catolica Andres Bello in Caracas. ''From that moment, the government began a war to neutralize, control and construct ways to self-censor and intimidate the media.''
 Jose Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director for Human Rights Watch, said Venezuela was the ''noticeable exception'' to a trend in Latin America over the last decade toward ''gradual but sustainable progress'' in the area of free speech. ''The region has been able to move in the right direction,'' he said, ''mostly thanks to the leadership taken by superior courts -- either constitutional or supreme courts.''
 Countries in the region have also been moving to enact laws to grant all citizens access to information. Mexico was the first to draft such a law, at the beginning of the decade. The latest example is Chile, which put its law in place in April. It has already resulted in the release by government officials of requested information, including an admission in July by the country's economy minister that Chile was using hundreds of times more antibiotics in its salmon farming than a rival producer, Norway. 
 The government in Brazil proposed a similar law in May that Congress has yet to vote on.

HEADLINE: Still in Development: A Film Culture in Dubai

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

DATELINE: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates 

 BODY:
When the heiress Paris Hilton traveled here in June and July to audition female friends for her show ''My New BFF,'' her producers had access to state-of-the-art studios and a government eager to import a touch of Hollywood glamour to the Middle East.
 But to adhere to the region's Islamic norms, many of the ingredients in reality TV were taboo: there would be no drinking, no cursing, no dramatic displays of affection. The producers thought about filming a scene at a water park, but passed on the option of dressing the contestants in religiously appropriate swimwear.
 Dubai, its rival Abu Dhabi and other Persian Gulf cities face enormous hurdles as they try to diversify their economies by fostering creativity and becoming entertainment capitals. Chief among those hurdles: they operate under Islamic law. Hollywood does not. So far, the oil-rich countries have proved more able to pay for fancy media productions and to build expensive film facilities than to actually lure production to the Middle East, as economic efforts run up against their traditional values and censorship. 
 This month Dubai rejected the producers of the ''Sex and the City'' sequel, who wanted to set part of the film there. The government cited moral reasons for the decision. ''Body of Lies,'' a thriller about fighting terrorists, was turned down in 2007. For now, some of the region's specially constructed studio lots lie mostly vacant, visitors say.
 Michael Hirschorn, an executive producer of the Hilton series, left Dubai impressed by what he called a ''media community truly eager to embrace the international marketplace.'' But that community, he said, has been hampered ''by cultural norms and standards that make a lot of international production difficult to impossible to pull off.'' 
 Some of the other hurdles are logistical. For instance, local requirements for full-time work visas mean that the country lacks a robust freelance market to support productions. Jamal al-Sharif, the executive director of Dubai Studio City, which was founded in 2005 to stimulate the regional film industry, acknowledged that ''a vital ingredient for building the film industry is access to talent.'' 
 Despite the drawbacks, the region's ambitions to house world-class centers for creation and production cannot be written off, partly because of the sheer sums proponents are willing to spend. Last fall, Imagenation, a subsidiary of the government-run Abu Dhabi Media Company, invested $250 million each with Participant Media and Hyde Park Entertainment and $100 million with National Geographic Entertainment to finance feature films. Work on the first phase of Abu Dhabi's own media production zone, one geared toward television, is under way. 
 Abu Dhabi's most expensive joint venture to date is a two-year-old one with Warner Brothers that was said to be worth $1 billion. This month, ''Shorts,'' the first Warner Brothers film financed partly by Abu Dhabi's feature film arm, opened in theaters in the United States. It earned a disappointing $6.6 million in its opening weekend. 
 So far, ''Shorts'' is the only film to come from the joint venture: the partners have not announced any more films, feeding speculation that the authorities in Abu Dhabi are rethinking their Hollywood ambitions. But Edward Borgerding, the chief executive of Imagenation, said in an interview that he was sure ''we'll make another movie with Warner Brothers next year, and the year after that.'' 
 In a statement that cited the ''world economic climate,'' Warner Brothers was more circumspect. It said it was working with Imagenation to ensure that the companies' business objectives were mutually aligned. 
 National Geographic is making more progress with Abu Dhabi. Adam Leipzig, the president of its entertainment division, said the partners plan to make two or three films a year for the next five years. Their first acquisition, ''Amreeka,'' is scheduled for release in New York and Los Angeles on Sept. 4, and their first co-production, ''The Way Back,'' finished filming two months ago. The partnership expects to make more acquisitions at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. 
 The investments by Abu Dhabi are part of a wider push to establish the emirate as a cultural center. Like other Middle Eastern cities, the emirate has invested money and personnel in creating the infrastructure for media production. One year ago it announced a content creation center, which it dubbed Twofour54, and in September its first editing centers and studios will open on the outskirts of the city, said Christopher O'Hearn, the general manager of DMA Media, a consultancy that helped create the hub. 
 Holding a notepad while meeting in a hotel lobby in Abu Dhabi, Mr. O'Hearn sketched out a grander vision for a production center, now in the early planning stages. ''It'll be the sort of facility that a producer from London, L.A. or Sydney can walk into and say, 'This is very familiar,' '' he said. 
 But to carry out the production plans, Mr. O'Hearn and others say, the region needs a skilled pool of creative workers. 
 In an interview, Mr. Borgerding said that a skilled labor force ''doesn't exist here in sufficient numbers yet to put the productions together without flying in a lot of people and putting them in expensive hotels.'' 
 A new training academy is working to change that. 
 Back in Dubai, Tim Smythe, the chief executive of Filmworks, said the tax-free emirates also lack ''incentive packages or rebates'' for producers, so the only advantages are the locations.
 Dubai Studio City's facilities have been used in 26 feature films, mostly from gulf countries and Bollywood. To date, ''Syriana'' and ''The Kingdom'' are the only Western films to be partly shot in the emirates. 
 While expressing confidence in Dubai Studio City's objectives, Mr. Sharif said, ''We do realize it may take a while for us to really make a mark at the global level.'' 
 In rejecting the request from the producers of the ''Sex and the City'' sequel this summer, Mr. Sharif said, the authorities took into account ''the multicultural fabric of the society and its perceptions.''
 According to a government official familiar with the script, its plot lines -- with the women coming to Dubai, spending money lavishly and cavorting -- were perceived to reinforce negative stereotypes about the region. 
 Even more than the staff issues, enduring issues of censorship may be the most stubborn hurdle for the gulf region -- even if, as Mr. Hirschorn jokingly said, ''our government censor turned out to be a really nice guy.''

HEADLINE: Tribune Chief May Remain For the Cleanup

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
The Tribune Company could well emerge from bankruptcy this fall with much of its current top management intact, according to people briefed on restructuring plans, but it remains unclear whether that might include the top dog himself, Samuel Zell, the chairman and chief executive who took the company private.
 From the day Tribune filed for bankruptcy in December, it has been clear that Mr. Zell's $315 million investment and warrants to buy a large share of the company would almost certainly be wiped out. He is being sued on multiple fronts over the $8.2 billion deal that took the company private in December 2007; he has called it a mistake and ''the deal from hell''; and some people familiar with the plans are guessing that, when the dust settles, he will be out. 
 But other people close to the restructuring talks, speaking anonymously because the discussions were supposed to remain private, caution that the major creditors have not yet given a clear indication whether they want Mr. Zell to leave or remain in some capacity. Nor has Mr. Zell said clearly whether he wants to go, though he is used to being the man in charge, and his authority would be diminished under new owners.
 ''I think the jury is out on Sam,'' one of them said. ''That is going to be a point of discussion.''
 Mr. Zell, 67, made billions in real estate by buying depressed assets where others saw more risk than value, and knowing when to sell them. But that touch faltered when, with the Tribune deal, he moved into an unfamiliar field.
 Mr. Zell is not granting interviews, according to Tribune, one of the nation's largest media companies. Its properties include some two dozen television stations and a string of some of the most important newspapers in the country, including The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune and The Baltimore Sun.
 People briefed on the talks say that the company and leading creditors could agree by September or October on a restructuring plan that would wipe out more than $12 billion of the company's roughly $13 billion in debt. Such a plan would need the approval of the bankruptcy court in Delaware.
 In 2007, a group of major banks lent Tribune about $8 billion to go private, but they have since sold much of that debt to other banks and investment firms. Under the anticipated restructuring plan, it is the holders of that senior secured debt -- first in line for some repayment -- who would end up owning the bulk of the company.
 That, too, was considered the likely outcome from the start -- in fact, the bankruptcy filing last December was in part an attempt to protect the interest of those lenders as Tribune's cash reserves dwindled. Mr. Zell told senior secured creditors then that, in essence, the company was in their hands, and that making a scheduled payment on junior debt would leave less for them, and asked what they wanted to do. They endorsed bankruptcy.
 Randy Michaels, the chief operating officer installed by Mr. Zell, recently sent a memo to employees saying that for the most part, management and the lenders agreed on how to run the company. ''While the ownership structure of the company is likely to change, current operating management is committed, and intends to remain in place during and after the restructuring,'' he wrote.
 That may have contained an element of bravado, but people briefed on the matter said the major creditors were not unhappy with the current team. ''They're pretty pleased with the way things are running,'' one said.
 For a few more months, at least, Tribune will remain in the limbo of bankruptcy, unable to make any major moves without court approval and uncertain about who its future leader will be.
 Having stopped payment on its long-term debt, Tribune has continued to cut costs, reached a tentative deal to sell the Chicago Cubs baseball team for $845 million, and built its cash cushion from $317 million when it filed for bankruptcy last December to $743 million by the end of June.
 But Mr. Zell's maneuvering also contributed to more than a year of delays in selling the Cubs and, according to some analysts, may have resulted in a lower price than Tribune would have gotten when the economy was stronger. He sought to sell the team and its home, Wrigley Field, separately -- the Cubs to a private buyer, the stadium to a government agency and possibly the naming rights to the stadium to a third buyer. But that strategy ran into trouble, and Tribune eventually reverted to an earlier, simpler plan to sell them as a package.
 It was also Mr. Zell who engineered the complex deal to take the company private, which nearly tripled the company's debt and left it with too little free cash flow to weather a sharp drop in advertising.
 A group of employees sued this year, saying that the deal was certain to fail. Last week, a group of Tribune bondholders did the same.
 Whether either suit can upend the sort of restructuring plan sought by Tribune and its major lenders, or lower Mr. Zell's chance of remaining in charge, remains to be seen.
 A spate of high-dollar, high-leverage deals in 2006 and 2007 put hundreds of American newspapers, including many of the biggest, under new ownership -- and in most cases put the new owners in financial jeopardy.
 Mr. Zell's Tribune takeover was the biggest of those deals, it was one of the last, and it was the first to land in bankruptcy. Since then, Philadelphia Newspapers, owner of that city's Inquirer and Daily News; The Minneapolis Star Tribune; and others have filed for bankruptcy, while some other publishers have had to restructure their debts to remain solvent.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 2, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about Sam Zell's chances of remaining chairman and chief of the Tribune Company after it emerges from bankruptcy misstated the timing of a lawsuit filed by a group of employees against Mr. Zell over the deal to take the company private. It was filed in September 2008, not this year.

HEADLINE: Under New Treaty With Swiss, France Goes After Tax Cheats

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Just days after France and Switzerland signed a new tax treaty, a French government official said the authorities had achieved a breakthrough in obtaining Swiss bank account data in an effort to catch tax cheats. 
 ''We have obtained the names of 3,000 Swiss bank account holders, of which a part very probably corresponds to tax evasion,'' said Eric Woerth, France's budget minister, in an interview published Sunday by the weekly newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche. 
 He told the paper these accounts at three banks contained about 3 billion euros, or about $4.3 billion. ''This is the first time we've had this type of information, precise, with the names, account numbers and the amounts deposited. It's exceptional.''
 The French authorities are prepared to pursue unregistered account holders who do not quickly ''regularize'' their records, he said. 
 On Friday, the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, and the Swiss president, Hans-Rudolf Merz, signed a revised tax treaty, long sought by Paris, that updated the two countries' 1966 agreement to conform with the latest international standards set by the 30 nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
 Ms. Lagarde hailed the agreement as ''the start of a new era in relations between the two governments'' and said Swiss bank secrecy laws would ''no longer be an obstacle to the communication of this information.''
 The onset of the financial crisis was the trigger for France, along with the United States and Germany, to begin a determined push for international cooperation against tax avoiders. Switzerland is by far the largest tax haven, and it has attracted most of the opprobrium and pressure this year.

HEADLINE: Missing Richard Nixon

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Many of the retrospectives on Ted Kennedy's life mention his regret that he didn't accept Richard Nixon's offer of a bipartisan health care deal. The moral some commentators take from that regret is that today's health care reformers should do what Mr. Kennedy balked at doing back then, and reach out to the other side.
 But it's a bad analogy, because today's political scene is nothing like that of the early 1970s. In fact, surveying current politics, I find myself missing Richard Nixon. 
 No, I haven't lost my mind. Nixon was surely the worst person other than Dick Cheney ever to control the executive branch. 
 But the Nixon era was a time in which leading figures in both parties were capable of speaking rationally about policy, and in which policy decisions weren't as warped by corporate cash as they are now. America is a better country in many ways than it was 35 years ago, but our political system's ability to deal with real problems has been degraded to such an extent that I sometimes wonder whether the country is still governable.
 As many people have pointed out, Nixon's proposal for health care reform looks a lot like Democratic proposals today. In fact, in some ways it was stronger. Right now, Republicans are balking at the idea of requiring that large employers offer health insurance to their workers; Nixon proposed requiring that all employers, not just large companies, offer insurance. 
 Nixon also embraced tighter regulation of insurers, calling on states to ''approve specific plans, oversee rates, ensure adequate disclosure, require an annual audit and take other appropriate measures.'' No illusions there about how the magic of the marketplace solves all problems.
 So what happened to the days when a Republican president could sound so nonideological, and offer such a reasonable proposal?
 Part of the answer is that the right-wing fringe, which has always been around -- as an article by the historian Rick Perlstein puts it, ''crazy is a pre-existing condition'' -- has now, in effect, taken over one of our two major parties. Moderate Republicans, the sort of people with whom one might have been able to negotiate a health care deal, have either been driven out of the party or intimidated into silence. Whom are Democrats supposed to reach out to, when Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who was supposed to be the linchpin of any deal, helped feed the ''death panel'' lies?
 But there's another reason health care reform is much harder now than it would have been under Nixon: the vast expansion of corporate influence. 
 We tend to think of the way things are now, with a huge army of lobbyists permanently camped in the corridors of power, with corporations prepared to unleash misleading ads and organize fake grass-roots protests against any legislation that threatens their bottom line, as the way it always was. But our corporate-cash-dominated system is a relatively recent creation, dating mainly from the late 1970s. 
 And now that this system exists, reform of any kind has become extremely difficult. That's especially true for health care, where growing spending has made the vested interests far more powerful than they were in Nixon's day. The health insurance industry, in particular, saw its premiums go from 1.5 percent of G.D.P. in 1970 to 5.5 percent in 2007, so that a once minor player has become a political behemoth, one that is currently spending $1.4 million a day lobbying Congress.
 That spending fuels debates that otherwise seem incomprehensible. Why are ''centrist'' Democrats like Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota so opposed to letting a public plan, in which Americans can buy their insurance directly from the government, compete with private insurers? Never mind their often incoherent arguments; what it comes down to is the money. 
 Given the combination of G.O.P. extremism and corporate power, it's now doubtful whether health reform, even if we get it -- which is by no means certain -- will be anywhere near as good as Nixon's proposal, even though Democrats control the White House and have a large Congressional majority. 
 And what about other challenges? Every desperately needed reform I can think of, from controlling greenhouse gases to restoring fiscal balance, will have to run the same gantlet of lobbying and lies. 
 I'm not saying that reformers should give up. They do, however, have to realize what they're up against. There was a lot of talk last year about how Barack Obama would be a ''transformational'' president -- but true transformation, it turns out, requires a lot more than electing one telegenic leader. Actually turning this country around is going to take years of siege warfare against deeply entrenched interests, defending a deeply dysfunctional political system.

HEADLINE: Fighting Health Care Overhaul, and Proud of It

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: SPARTANBURG, S.C. 

 BODY:
Senator Jim DeMint, the South Carolina Republican who predicted that President Obama's effort to overhaul the health care system would become his ''Waterloo,'' is doing his best to make that happen.
 Taking questions from a friendly crowd of 500 people here the other day, Mr. DeMint did little to correct their misimpressions about health care legislation but rather reinforced their worst fears.
 When one man said the major House bill would give the government electronic access to bank accounts, Mr. DeMint told him the bill was never about health care. ''This is about more government control,'' he declared. ''If it was about health care, we could get it done in a couple of weeks.'' 
 Mr. DeMint, 57, is a first-term senator, a back-bencher with little influence in Washington's corridors of power. But at home he is stoking anger over the health care issue as he advances his free-market philosophy, gains national attention and, perhaps, helps derail Mr. Obama's agenda. 
 If that agenda is not stopped at health care, Mr. DeMint warned at a town-hall-style meeting in Greenville, ''he'll continue to spend and borrow this country into oblivion.'' 
 Mr. DeMint is popular in the Greenville-Spartanburg area, the reddest region of this ruby red state and the area he first represented in Congress. He is running for re-election next year and so far has no serious challengers. State Senator Brad Hutto, a Democrat, had been considering a run, but Phil Bailey, political director of the State Senate Democratic caucus, said Friday that Mr. Hutto had decided against it. At the same time, most of the state's political oxygen is being consumed by Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican, who has been battling calls for his resignation since he admitted to an extramarital affair.
 All of this has left Mr. DeMint free to fire up his conservative base, arguing for ideological purity at a time when other Republicans might compromise to try to rebuild their numbers.
 Mr. DeMint has a strong following among members of the Club for Growth, the conservative antitax organization, and has endorsed club-backed Senate candidates in Republican primaries in Pennsylvania and Florida, not the ones endorsed by the Republican National Senatorial Committee. (In Pennsylvania, he endorsed Pat Toomey, a former club president, when Arlen Specter, the incumbent, was still a Republican.)
 ''He's playing to the fund-raising base, both here in South Carolina and nationally,'' Mr. Bailey said.
 Mr. DeMint's town-hall-style meetings, where he promotes his new book, ''Saving Freedom: We Can Stop America's Slide into Socialism,'' tend to be more like cheerleading sessions than the angry confrontations faced by lawmakers elsewhere.
 Here, he fueled speculation that a health care overhaul would cover illegal immigrants, although specific language says it would not. He also said senators and members of Congress would ''absolutely not'' pass a new health plan if they had to go on it themselves. 
 The only disruption came from a pig that a farmer had brought to protest ''pork'' in Washington. The pig, roaming within a few feet of Mr. DeMint, snorted and squealed its way through the event, held in the parking lot of the Beacon, a local burger joint.
 Mr. DeMint, a former marketing executive, probably appreciated the stunt, having a knack for messaging and vivid language himself. An advocate of abolishing the tax code, he staged a rally in 2000 in which he went up in a hot-air balloon and threw out thousands of pages of the Internal Revenue Service code. In 2007, he popularized the word ''amnesty'' to describe (and help defeat) a plan to allow illegal immigrants to become citizens.
 More recently, in mid-July, he crystallized what Democrats said was the Republicans' true goal in the health care debate.
 ''If we're able to stop Obama on this, it will be his Waterloo,'' he said in a conference call with conservative activists, according to Politico.com. ''It will break him.'' 
 Now, with Congress set to return to Washington on Sept. 8, polls show that support for health care legislation has indeed eroded, and Mr. DeMint takes partial credit. 
 ''We've definitely got him on the run,'' he said in an interview.
 He said that stopping the overhaul ''has the potential of changing the whole political dynamic in this country,'' both by halting other Obama policies, like the cap-and-trade approach to limiting emissions of the heat-trapping gases that cause global warming, and by reviving the Republicans in next year's elections.
 Even if Mr. Obama's plans are derailed, it is not clear that Republicans will benefit; a recent NBC News poll showed that just 21 percent of respondents approved of how the party was handling health care. 
 But Mr. DeMint distances himself from both parties. As he put it, ''None of us wants the people who ran cash for clunkers or who cleaned up after Katrina to be between us and our doctors.''
 He is sensitive to the accusation of being an obstructionist on health care and has come up with a plan of his own. It would give vouchers ($2,000 for individuals and $5,000 per family) to those not covered by their employers, let people shop in other states for insurance, limit malpractice suits and repeal the bailout to troubled financial institutions so that it would not add to the deficit.
 Mr. DeMint does not get too many questions about it, but it has drawn some criticism. Frank Knapp, chief executive of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, said that the plan had no sustainable financing mechanism and that Mr. DeMint came up with it only to give himself credibility in criticizing Mr. Obama's plan.
 The concept of allowing interstate sales of health insurance has never gone very far. Sandy Praeger, the insurance commissioner in Kansas and past president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, said such a plan would destabilize the nation's insurance market and hurt consumers. It would allow insurance companies to cherry-pick young, healthy people and offer them lower premiums, Ms. Praeger said, while leaving higher risk people in a smaller pool, forcing up their premiums or leaving them unable to find coverage at all. 
 The subject of health care in Mr. DeMint's own state rarely comes up either. But South Carolina, much of which is poor and rural, faces some particular challenges. Its unemployment rate of 11.8 percent exceeds the national rate of 9.4 percent. And 16.2 percent of the population has no insurance, more than the national average of 15.3 percent.
 Rather, voters seem more interested in whether Mr. DeMint might run for president.
 ''I wouldn't get out of my driveway without my wife shooting me in the back,'' he said in Greenville. ''You've got to find somebody who's smart enough to be a great president but dumb enough to want to be president. Right now, I think I'm still too smart to be president.''

HEADLINE: Stronger Prospects For the President On a Health Care Bill

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
If sentiment ever ruled the United States Senate, it does not now. Advocates of health care overhaul should not expect a big boost in memory of Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
 Yet other factors suggest that President Obama still has stronger prospects for achieving his health policy goals than surface impressions of the Congressional recess indicate. He lags behind his own timetable for action, but remains ahead of presidential predecessors who pursued the same objective.
 When the president and Democratic leaders resume work next week, they face big challenges. On substance, the forcefulness of cost controls, the extent of subsidies for the more than 45 million uninsured to buy coverage and mechanisms for changing the insurance marketplace remain under negotiation. 
 On strategy, Democrats face a parliamentary choice. Even without Mr. Kennedy, they retain a chance to clear the Senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold if just one or two Republicans break from their party. 
 If they cannot clear the threshold, Democratic strategists believe that their House and Senate majorities can hold under special ''reconciliation'' rules barring Republican filibusters. In that attempt, Mr. Obama's sagging poll numbers would hold less relevance than memories of Democrats' landslide 1994 defeat after they let President Clinton's health care initiative founder.
 ''They'll get something done,'' predicted former Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a Democrat who was relegated to the minority by that Republican Revolution. ''It'll be a major step.''
 A Slide During Recess
 The August recess has exacted a toll. The president's job approval rating in a Gallup poll, 55 percent in early August, stands at 50 percent.
 Neither the administration nor Senate leaders see much remaining promise in bipartisan Finance Committee negotiations. Given recent gibes from Republican participants, the Sept. 15 deadline for results set by senior Democrats appears a formality.
 In the House, raucous constituent gatherings have disquieted conservative Democrats facing the most competitive 2010 re-election contests. House vote-counters estimate that they have expanded the roster of Democratic opponents to approximately 20, from around a dozen when lawmakers left Washington.
 The good news for Democrats is that the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, could suffer nearly twice that many defections and still pass health legislation on the House floor. That is how much of a cushion Mr. Obama's party secured by winning 257 seats in 2008.
 The party's Senate cushion also remains formidable, though the loss of Mr. Kennedy has for now deprived the majority leader, Harry Reid, of a potential 60th Democratic vote against a filibuster.
 But Democratic leaders believe Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, the strongest Republican supporter of comprehensive legislation, might provide that 60th vote. If Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, the strongest Democratic skeptic, defects on a filibuster, Democrats see one more potential ally in Maine's other moderate Republican senator, Susan Collins.
 In any case, whether they overcome a filibuster or sidestep it through reconciliation, Democrats would then need to hold just 50 votes to prevail, with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. available to break a tie.
 Shaping a Deal
 Some elements of a deal appear set: an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy coverage; subsidies to help them, financed by taxpayers and employers; steps to overhaul the delivery of health services to reduce costly inefficiencies; new regulations allowing consumers to compare insurance plans, and requiring insurers to accept all customers regardless of pre-existing conditions.
 Others remain in flux:
 Stimulating insurance competition. Some Senate centrists favor nonprofit cooperatives over the ''public option'' backed by Mr. Obama and House leaders. But Ms. Snowe, who prefers a public option fallback that would be ''triggered'' by failures in the marketplace, has increasing leverage to dictate that outcome if she chooses. 
 Financing expanded coverage. While the House aims to tax the highest incomes, a Senate plan to tax the highest-cost insurance plans has gained momentum because economists say it would also curb health inflation. But concerns by Democrats in high-cost states, like Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, may lead lawmakers to narrow the value of plans subject to taxation -- thus reducing revenue for extending coverage as well as the impact on health costs.
 The overall price tag. The Finance Committee is pursuing a plan costing roughly $900 billion over 10 years. Dropping that number much further, a potential consequence of deficit worries and the difficulty of enacting tax increases, would make it harder to provide even bare-bones coverage for the vast majority of the uninsured.
 Ultimately, however, elements still in dispute appear less likely to derail comprehensive legislation than to alter its precise effects and pace of implementation. 
 For all the political risks of acting, ''Everyone knows the alternative is worse,'' said Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff and a veteran of the Clinton White House. ''Failure leads to failure.''

HEADLINE: A Star Defeated Only by Himself

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

 BODY:
Roger Federer's range is so far-reaching, he has brought Bill Tilden into play. 
 Tilden was the Federer of the flapper era, a singular performer who won six consecutive United States championships (and seven over all) in the 1920s. Like Federer, who will try for his sixth consecutive United States Open title this year, the 80th anniversary of Tilden's last national championship, Tilden had an arsenal that included a rocket serve and every shot in the instruction books as well as a few more he invented on the run. 
 A backcourt specialist, Tilden was considered the best player of his generation. After World War II, he organized the Professional Tennis Players Association, a precursor to the ATP Tour. He wrote volumes on the game, including an instructional tome, ''Match Play and Spin of the Ball,'' which Jack Kramer and John Newcombe, among others, later quoted like Scripture. 
 And yet, if not for Federer's Open success reviving his memory, Tilden would remain largely forgotten, his tennis legacy overshadowed by his vices. He was attracted to young boys in his later years. Shunned by tennis, he died virtually penniless in 1953, at age 60. 
 ''There's no question Tilden dominated his era more so than maybe anybody had except for Federer,'' said Frank Deford, who wrote the definitive biography ''Big Bill Tilden: The Triumphs and the Tragedy'' while covering tennis in 1975 for Sports Illustrated. 
 But as a public figure, perhaps a more apt comparison for Tilden is to the pop star Michael Jackson, whose musical legacy, while unassailable, was mitigated for some by his conduct. 
 ''I think that's a very good analogy,'' Deford said in a telephone interview, adding: ''Tennis people tried to hush up Tilden's personal life. They actually were afraid it would hurt the sport. I think that's why nobody ever celebrates any of his achievements.''
 The United States Tennis Association has not immortalized Tilden with a trophy, a stadium court or a statue despite the fact that in 1920, when he was 27, he became the first American to win Wimbledon, and seldom lost for the next six years. 
 ''He was a great, great champion,'' said Kramer, a two-time national singles champion and the world No. 1 in the late 1940s and early 1950s. ''He carried the game in the '20s and early '30s.'' 
 In his first visit to London, Tilden impressed with his forehands and his fashion. Decades before Federer walked onto Centre Court at the All-England Club wearing a monogrammed white jacket, Tilden set the English tennis cognoscenti atwitter with his array of V-necked sweaters. He won three Wimbledons and anchored seven consecutive victorious Davis Cup teams, earning the nickname Tilden the Invincible. 
 Tilden stood roughly the same height as Federer, who is 6 feet 1 inch, and he covered the court, as Federer does, without appearing to touch it. He had a powerful serve but usually took speed off it because he abhorred short rallies. (Although adept at the net, Tilden was not a fan of serve-and-volleying for the same reason.) 
 He enjoyed playing to his opponent's strength, the better to break his will, a strategy akin to Federer's trying to subdue his nemesis Rafael Nadal by feeding balls to his forehand. 
 Tilden's forehand was better left unchallenged, said Kramer, who was a teenager when he played against Tilden, then in his late 40s. Kramer would cut classes at Montebello High School and travel on two buses and a streetcar to meet Tilden at the Los Angeles Tennis Club. 
 ''He had a tremendous forehand, even then, and an awfully good serve,'' Kramer, 88, said in a telephone interview. ''He could do anything he wanted with the ball. He could put it any place he liked.'' 
 Tilden had a second serve that kicked like a can-can dancer, an all-court game that framed his artistry, and a showman's flair. Donald Dell, a co-founder of the ATP, was in his teens when he played Tilden, then in his 50s, in an exhibition. ''He'd hit a forehand winner and bow to the crowd,'' Dell said. 
 Deford said, ''Bill was very shy, embarrassed and self-conscious as a child, and then underwent this transformation and became exactly the opposite: a showboat.'' 
 With his powerful game, Tilden obliterated the notion that tennis wasn't a real sport. He carried tennis from the backyards of manors to mainstream America only to be ostracized. He was essentially unemployable in tennis, and teenagers who played practice matches against Tilden were advised not to step into an automobile or a room alone with him. 
 ''Bill had all the rumors floating around about his sexuality,'' Kramer said. 
 In 1946 in Los Angeles, Tilden was found guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a 14-year-old boy he met at the Los Angeles Tennis Club, and was sentenced to one year in prison. He was arrested again in 1949 for making sexual advances to a young male hitchhiker, a probation violation, and was sentenced to another year in prison. He was released in December 1949. 
 Days later, The Associated Press released a poll of the greatest athletes in the first half of the 20th century. Tilden was tops in tennis, taking his place in the sports pantheon with Jack Dempsey, Bobby Jones and Babe Ruth.
