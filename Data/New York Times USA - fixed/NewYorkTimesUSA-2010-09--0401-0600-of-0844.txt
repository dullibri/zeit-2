HEADLINE: In Senate, G.O.P. Digs In to Keep Bush Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate Republican leader proposed legislation on Monday to continue all of the Bush-era tax cuts indefinitely, testing the willingness of Democrats to allow a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans in a weak economy and making clear that a partisan fight will extend deep into the campaign season if not beyond.
The proposal by the Senate leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, came a day after the House Republican leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, suggested a potential compromise, saying he would vote for President Obama's plan to extend the cuts only for households earning less than $250,000 if he had no other choice.
In part, Mr. McConnell's proposal illustrated the greater leverage that Republicans enjoy in the Senate, where they control 41 seats -- enough to filibuster and block any bill. While Mr. Boehner cannot stop House Democrats from forcing a vote on the president's favored tax plan, Mr. McConnell made clear that he would have a say and that he wanted to put a handful of wavering Senate Democrats on the spot. 
But Mr. McConnell's position also served as a political counterweight to Mr. Boehner's statement on Sunday, which suggested that some Republicans wanted to avoid a brawl in which they would be cast as blocking tax relief for the middle class to ensure that tax cuts continued for the wealthy. Senate Republicans, by contrast, seem to relish the fight.
Democrats immediately dismissed Mr. McConnell's plan, noting that he had not offered any way to make up the $700 billion in lost revenue over 10 years that extending the tax breaks at the highest income levels would cost the government.
The White House suggested that Republicans were in disarray and at war with each other.
And President Obama, at a town-hall-style meeting in Fairfax, Va., said that rich households would still benefit from his plan, with lower taxes on their first $250,000 income, but that Republicans stood in the way.
''We could get that done this week,'' he said. ''But we're still in this wrestling match with John Boehner and Mitch McConnell.''
In a forceful floor speech that could serve as a closing statement in his election-year pitch for returning Republicans to power, Mr. McConnell accused the White House and Democrats in Congress of using their one-party control of Washington over the last two years to run up spending and now wanting to raise taxes to spend more.
''Democrats spent the last two years putting government in charge of health care, the financial sector, car companies, insurance companies, student loans -- you name it,'' Mr. McConnell said in his speech, as the Senate resumed work after a five-week recess. ''Now they want the tax hike to pay for it all.''
Mr. McConnell moved quickly to exploit the discord among Democrats who disagree internally about how to handle the expiring tax cuts given the sluggish economy. He noted that five members of the Senate Democratic caucus had said they favored continuing all of the tax cuts, at least temporarily, putting them at odds with Mr. Obama.
One of them, Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut independent who caucuses with the Democrats, called on Monday for extending the cuts at all income levels, for a year. ''I don't think it makes sense to raise any federal taxes during the uncertain economy we are struggling through,'' Mr. Lieberman said in a speech to the Chamber of Commerce in Middlesex, Conn.
''The more money we leave in private hands, the quicker our economic recovery will be,'' he said. ''And that means I will do everything I can to make sure Congress extends the so-called Bush tax cuts for another year.''
At the Capitol later in the day, Mr. Lieberman said he would not block a bill that continued the tax breaks only at the lower levels.
But Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, refused to make a similar commitment, saying he did not expect his party leaders to force a vote only on Mr. Obama's preferred plan. But he said he would not vote for a bill that included only a partial extension. ''It would be very hard for me to support that,'' he said.
In a statement last week Mr. Nelson said he did not want any tax increases until the economy improved. ''I support extending all of the expiring tax cuts until Nebraska's and the nation's economy is in better shape, and perhaps longer, because raising taxes in a weak economy could impair recovery,'' he said.
Democrats, however, were not alone in dealing with internal disagreements. It was clear that Mr. Boehner's willingness to vote for the president's plan did not mark a broader shift among his fellow House Republicans.
Representatives Eric Cantor of Virginia and Mike Pence of Indiana, the No. 2 and 3 House Republicans, respectively, have both said they wanted the tax breaks continued for everyone but pointedly declined on Monday to join Mr. Boehner's pledge to vote for a partial extension just for the middle class.
There were also signs that Senate Democratic leaders were not yet prepared to begin the tax cut debate. The majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, told colleagues that next week he would bring to the floor the annual Pentagon authorization bill, which includes a provision allowing the repeal of the ''don't ask, don't policy'' on gay and lesbian soldiers.
The Senate is expected to be in session for just four weeks before lawmakers return home to campaign full time, and the Pentagon measure normally requires two or three weeks of floor debate. But even just starting the floor debate, however, would show liberal advocates that Democrats were serious about repealing ''don't ask, don't tell.''
Senator John McCain of Arizona, the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said he would try to block the Pentagon measure because he said the White House was moving to repeal ''don't ask, don't tell'' without properly gauging the impact on battle readiness and troop morale.
Mr. McCain said that he did not believe there was time to complete the bill and that Democrats had other motivations. ''Everything that's done around here is done for political reasons,'' he said. ''And Harry Reid does everything for political reasons.''
Democrats need time to draft the tax bill, and also line up their votes. In addition, Mr. McConnell's stance increases the likelihood that the tax fight could be drawn out, and Democrats have other crucial work to do before the sessions ends, including a temporary spending measure to finance the government until after the election.
The tax cuts, approved in 2001 and 2003, were written to expire at the end of this year at all income levels.

HEADLINE: The Engine of Right-Wing Rage, Fueled by More Than Just Anger

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
THE BACKLASH
Right-Wing Radicals, High-Def Hucksters, and Paranoid Politics in the Age of Obama
By Will Bunch
354 pages. Harper/HarperCollins. $25.99.
In his new book, ''The Backlash: Right-Wing Radicals, High-Def Hucksters, and Paranoid Politics in the Age of Obama,'' the progressive journalist Will Bunch serves up his own anatomy of the Tea Party movement, that loose agglomeration of right-wing insurgents, libertarians, conservatives, evangelicals, survivalists, gun-rights crusaders, antitax protesters, deficit hawks, antigovernment zealots, militia members, Ayn Randers, Limbaugh ''ditto heads,'' Glenn Beck fanatics, birthers, Birchers, and supporters of Sarah Palin and Ron Paul.
As Mr. Bunch sees it, there are three main reasons for the rise of the Tea Party:
1. ''Genuine anger and panic by rank-and-file conservatives'' who were deeply frustrated by the election of Barack Obama, and who ''suddenly saw a world in which -- thanks to a growing electoral base that did not think or look like them -- their Reaganist conservative philosophy might be shut out of power for good.'' 
2. ''The electronic media'' -- including the likes of Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh and local talk radio imitators, as well as social networking forces like Facebook and Twitter -- which have enabled ''like-minded Obama naysayers'' to come together ''without actual journalists intervening to filter out untrue information like the canard about the president's birth certificate.''
3. ''The ever-circling capitalists -- the policy pushers who saw a new grass-roots movement as a back-door way to revive the big-business agenda'' that had thrived from the 1980s through the George W. Bush era, along with ''the pure-profit hucksters'' eager to cash in on voter anger.
Mr. Bunch seems to have spent a lot of energy looking into Reason No. 3: He writes at length about the marketing of items like gold coins, solar generators and seed bank kits to survivalist-minded, apocalypse-fearing consumers; and Glenn Beck's sprawling TV-radio-book-merchandise empire. Other sections of ''The Backlash'' -- a title that consciously or unconsciously recalls ''Backlash,'' Susan Faludi's 1991 book about antifeminist reaction to the women's movement -- feature the author's visits to events like the Knob Creek Machine Gun Shoot and the first national convention of Tea Party activists held in Nashville earlier this year.
Although Mr. Bunch -- a senior writer at The Philadelphia Daily News and a senior fellow at the left-leaning research group Media Matters for America -- tries hard in many of his interviews with various Tea Party-affiliated individuals to understand where they are coming from, he occasionally lapses into snarky put-downs that undercut the mostly reasoned tone of his book and his many persuasive observations. For instance, he writes of the numerous retirees and Glenn Beck fans at one event: ''Not only did it turn out that the revolution was televised after all, but it also needed assistance out to its car.'' By far the most compelling, if not terribly original, arguments in ''The Backlash'' concern the current media environment, which has amplified the loudest and most partisan voices, and helped spread fact-free theories about President Obama's not being born in the United States or wanting to take away people's guns. Mr. Bunch invokes Neil Postman -- who argued in his seminal 1985 book, ''Amusing Ourselves to Death,'' that the entertainment values promoted by television are subverting public discourse -- to explore the phenomenon of Mr. Beck and his shameless emotional appeals to his audience's deepest fears about change and the threat of the Other (be it a black president, Mexican immigrants or East Coast liberals).
Mr. Bunch also builds upon the insights of Cass Sunstein (the author of prescient books like ''Going to Extremes: How Like Minds Unite and Divide'') to look at how the echo chamber of partisan Web sites can ratify radical, even dangerous, views, and how group polarization, especially at a time of high employment and economic anxiety, fuels anger and irrational rumors about government conspiracies (like FEMA-run concentration camps and black helicopters). Echoing other reporters and commentators before him, Mr. Bunch uses the writings of Richard Hofstadter -- most notably ''Anti-Intellectualism in American Life'' and ''The Paranoid Style in American Politics'' -- to try to explicate the roots of populist rage that animate many Tea Party gatherings. And he goes on to suggest, not always convincingly, that psychological or personal reasons drive many Americans to seek ''rebirth from the raw energy of the Tea Parties.''
As for the consequences of the so-called backlash movement, Mr. Bunch reviews well-known cases like the Republican Scott Brown's ascension to Edward M. Kennedy's Senate seat in liberal Massachusetts and the Tea Party favorite Marco Rubio's capture of the Republican nomination in the Florida Senate race. But he argues that the ''Tea Party's true success in 2010 was not in electing their own people but moving incumbents'' like Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, to the right.
Mr. Bunch adds that conservative insurgents have tilted the entire national conversation to the right, with Arizona's crackdown on illegal immigration rocking ''any hopes for a realistic federal immigration policy'' and ''Second Amendment paranoia'' driving ''lawmakers to take actions that would make it harder for authorities to keep tabs on guns and possibly increase the supply even further.''
For many decades, Mr. Bunch observes, ''there were grown-ups involved in the conservative movement who tamped down the flames of extremism rather than fanning them.''
''Ironically,'' he continues, ''the main reason that the John Birch Society'' -- which went so far as to suggest that President Dwight D. Eisenhower was a Communist sympathizer -- ''failed to gain much traction in the early 1960s was because mainstream Republican politicians turned against them, even though the party was at low ebb in the Kennedy-Johnson years. Barry Goldwater, the leader of the so-called New Right movement who won the G.O.P. presidential nomination in 1964, did have considerable support from the Birchers, yet not only did he not embrace them but secretly authorized the intellectual leader of 1960s conservatism, William F. Buckley Jr., and his National Review to go after the organization, successfully marginalizing it and helping to keep its Richard Hofstadter-described paranoid style in the shadows, even as that decade grew more tumultuous.''
Today things are different. Republicans are reluctant to speak out against Mr. Limbaugh's invective. Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, has suggested that President Obama ''may have anti-American views.'' And Sharron Angle, a Republican Senate candidate from Nevada, has spoken of citizens arming themselves ''against a tyrannical government.''
By ''shifting the parameters on what is acceptable political speech in America,'' Mr. Bunch says, right-wing insurgents have driven ''distrust of government to its highest level in more than a generation'' and mapped out ''dangerous new territory for our national politics.''

HEADLINE: A Walk Along Stone's Wall Street

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
''You know, half the people in this place could be prosecuted.''
Oliver Stone, the film director, was sitting across from me over a late lunch in the Grill Room of the Four Seasons restaurant in Midtown Manhattan last week.
In one corner was Stephen Schwarzman, the chairman of the Blackstone Group; Felix Rohatyn, a special adviser to the chairman of Lazard, was leaving as I was coming in, as was Barry Diller, the chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp. And Sanford Weill, the former chairman of Citigroup -- ''the mother of all evil,'' Mr. Stone said with a wry smile -- had just dashed out.
If one man epitomizes the populist view of Wall Street and corporate America, it is Mr. Stone, whose new film, ''Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps'' opens next week. It is the sequel to his hit movie ''Wall Street'' in 1987. The original tapped into the zeitgeist of the moment -- ''Greed, for lack of a better word, is good,'' as Gordon Gekko said -- by capturing the lust for money and power that led to the market's crash. 
Two years after the height of the latest financial crisis -- Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in the wee hours of Sept. 15 -- the country is still grappling with the aftermath of a period that looks suspiciously similar to the one Mr. Stone depicted two decades ago.
And so it seemed only fitting that we were having lunch at the epicenter of what's left of moguldom, surrounded by the real-life characters who populate Wall Street. For a moment, I'm a bit worried Mr. Stone won't be able to keep his food down.
''Look, Wall Street's gone crazy. It's banking on steroids,'' Mr. Stone said, getting a bit irritated. ''Banks don't mean what they did. When I was a kid, you had a savings account; you made 3 to 4 percent. Now you make zero, and Goldman Sachs is a bank holding company.''
If Wall Street is ever going to overcome the distrust that so much of the public has about the finance industry, it is going to have to win over the likes of Mr. Stone, whose father worked as a broker under Mr. Weill.
While the industry may think Mr. Stone's point of view is radical -- ''Stone must be a communist here, a liberal; a liberal is worse than a communist,'' he said of himself, talking in the third person -- it is a perspective that has gained, not lost, momentum in large parts of nation's populous, irrespective of political party or ideology. Wall Street as villain, it seems, has bipartisan support.
Mr. Stone had originally passed on remaking ''Wall Street'' in 2006 because he was worried it would send the wrong message. ''It was just wealth, wealth, wealth. Guys like that, having birthday parties, it's not my deal,'' he said, nodding his head in the direction of Mr. Schwarzman's table.
He decided to return to the topic after the financial crisis because he thought that the industry had finally lost some of its swagger and that a fictional account that explored the depths of that period would tap into the national mood. But ultimately, the world of high finance, he said, is just a backdrop for a film ''about trust, love, greed, betrayal.''
While Mr. Stone clearly has his own feelings about Wall Street, he said the film tried to offer a somewhat more balanced view. ''They're mixed bags, and that's what Gekko says at the end of the movie, 'We're all mixed bags. Human beings are mixed. Good and bad.' ''
Mr. Stone added, ''It's silly to be simplifying and say Wall Street is evil,'' pausing for a moment before stopping to correct himself. ''Goldman Sachs is evil, maybe.''
''Most of the people I know on Wall Street are good people. Like my father. He really would like to make some money, yeah, but they would also like to do good for society,'' he said.
His new film gives a voice to the popular rage about what has happened on Wall Street. Michael Douglas returns as Gordon Gekko out of prison, who, oddly enough, articulates the problems with the industry until, of course, he returns to his greedy ways. Shia LaBeouf plays a young trader-cum-banker who is in love with Gekko's daughter.
While the movie is a fictional account, Mr. Stone did take cues from real executives as inspiration for some of the characters.
Before shooting, he and Mr. Douglas met with Samuel D. Waksal, the former chief executive of the biopharmaceutical company ImClone Systems who was convicted of insider trading (and is perhaps even more famous for his friend, Martha Stewart, who was convicted of lying to investigators about her sale of ImClone shares).
''He went to jail, I think perhaps wrongly. It was more scandal, more smoke than fire,'' Mr. Stone said of Mr. Waksal. ''Do you know him at all? He's a dynamo. He came out of jail, and he had the attitude like, 'Nothing is going to stop me.' But Michael has more bitterness.''
Other characters were influenced by real people, too, like the character played by Josh Brolin, a conniving chief executive of a big bank that bails out a failing firm.
''He reminds me of Dimon because he's good-looking,'' Mr. Stone says, referring to Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase. But then he added that there's ''a little bit of Rubin in Josh,'' referring to Robert E. Rubin, the former chairman of Citigroup.
The role of the chief executive whose firm fails is played by Frank Langella, and it was inspired, in part, by James Cayne of Bear Stearns. ''He was out of touch, like Cayne,'' Mr. Stone exclaimed.
Whether Mr. Stone's new film will capture the public's attention the way the original did remains to be seen. The first ''Wall Street'' became a touchstone that the financial industry, oddly enough, embraced. This time, however, the industry may look upon the film less favorably. Mr. Stone appears not to be indicting a few rogue characters, but painting the entire system -- one that he says has suffered from group think (''just following orders'') -- as morally bankrupt.
Before leaving the restaurant, Mr. Schwarzman stopped by our table, and when he realized Mr. Stone was there, the conversation seemed to awkwardly fizzle out. After Mr. Schwarzman left, Mr. Stone looked down.
''That's the problem with these places. If you had Henry Kissinger here,'' he said gesturing over to his regular table. ''What are you going to do? Not shake his hand? It's a real problem. That's the problem with New York society, it's all an interlocking network.''

HEADLINE: A Cultural Shift in the Jobs We Seek?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Genteel Nation,'' by David Brooks (column, Sept. 10):
I doubt that a cultural shift is the reason that Ivy League grads flock to finance and consulting in large numbers. Rather, these jobs pay well, very well. Like it or not, our economy drives talented young people to Wall Street.
The solution to this problem lies not in some hazy cultural reawakening, but rather in the shrewd restructuring of government regulations and the tax code to deincentivize high-stakes gambling and reincentivize technical careers, small business, research and development, and (yes, Mr. Brooks) community service. 
People are flexible. If you change their incentives, their attitudes will change accordingly.
Morgan Huse New York, Sept. 10, 2010
To the Editor:
David Brooks rightly credits the burst of entrepreneurial and technical innovation that began in Europe and America around 1800 with creating vast amounts of wealth. But for the majority of people living at the time the hallmarks of the age were polluted cities, denuded forests, putrefied rivers, child labor and dirty, dangerous 80-hour workweeks in mines, mills and factories, toiling for high-handed robber barons.
Is that the ''hardheaded practical mentality that built the nation's wealth'' to which Mr. Brooks would have us return? If so, I much prefer the more humane but less prosperous future he says awaits us.
Peter Stern Oak Park, Ill., Sept. 10, 2010
To the Editor:
David Brooks writes that our brightest minds have abandoned industry and technology in favor of more lucrative jobs in finance and the service economy.
While the case may be made that greed can motivate college grads to seek careers in finance and consulting, let's not overlook the fact that their choices have been narrowed considerably by the outsourcing of American manufacturing and technical jobs overseas in the past 15 years or so.
Mr. Brooks says that manufacturing companies aren't able to find enough skilled machinists. But isn't that because the skills were no longer required when manufacturing moved abroad?
American industry has been extremely shortsighted. It doesn't seem fair to blame its victims.
Ashleigh Evans San Mateo, Calif., Sept. 10, 2010
To the Editor:
David Brooks ascribes America's economic decline in part to the social breakdown of the lower class, pointing out that up to a third of American children live with one or no parents, ''in chaotic neighborhoods with failing schools.''
Yet, simultaneously, he chides Michelle Obama for encouraging women to become teachers and social workers instead of entering corporate America: ''As talented people adopt these priorities, America may become more humane, but it will be less prosperous.''
Arguing that America's prosperity is threatened if we prioritize the education and mental health of our children, Mr. Brooks lets ideological loyalty trump logic.
Maia Ettinger Guilford, Conn., Sept. 10, 2010
To the Editor:
Does David Brooks really mean to dissuade people from becoming teachers, social workers or nurses? Even the most industrialized society needs a supportive infrastructure -- which is why I left a 20-year career at Procter & Gamble to become a palliative care nurse practitioner and educator.
And while these professions are wonderfully enlightened and meaningful, few of us in them would describe them as ''pleasant.''
Marian Grant Baltimore, Sept. 12, 2010
To the Editor:
In his insightful and provocative column, David Brooks suggests that an American decline may occur because of a shift in people's values from productive, commercial enterprise to service and professional occupations.
While the shifts he describes are evident, there are also a number of factors that militate against decline. Americans have a propensity to start their own businesses, and we attract foreigners who also want to do so. We have a plethora of research universities and laboratories, and a federal government and businesses that generously support research.
We have a large number of venture capital firms that support new enterprises. We have nonhierarchical organizations in which anyone can argue for his or her ideas.
These are the kinds of things that lead to invention and innovation, which are the lifeblood of economic growth.
Allan Collins Lexington, Mass., Sept. 10, 2010
The writer is professor emeritus of learning sciences at Northwestern University.

HEADLINE: Foreign Stimulus

BYLINE: By PIA ORRENIUS and MADELINE ZAVODNY


HIGHLIGHT: Pia Orrenius, a research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and Madeline Zavodny, a professor of economics at Agnes Scott College, are the authors of ''Beside the Golden Door: U.S. Immigration Reform in a New Era of Globalization.''

 BODY:
THE debate over Arizona's controversial immigration law and Congress's passage last month of another border security bill gives the impression that the only problem with our immigration policy is its inability to keep people from entering the country illegally. Not so. The country has an antiquated, jerry-built immigration system that fails on almost every count. The good news is that there is a way to replace it that will promote economic growth while reducing the flow of illegal workers.
First, work-based visas should become the norm in immigration, not the exception. The United States issues about 1.1 million green cards a year and allocates roughly 85 percent to family members of American citizens or legal residents, people seeking humanitarian refuge and ''diversity immigrants,'' who come from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. 
The remaining 15 percent go to people who are immigrating for work reasons -- but half of these are for workers' spouses and children, leaving a mere 7 percent for so-called principal workers, most of whom are highly skilled. No other major Western economy gives such a low priority to employment-based immigration, and for good reason: these immigrants are the most skilled and least likely to be a burden on taxpayers.
With so few slots allocated to work-based green cards, wait times continue to grow. Immigrants typically enter on temporary visas and adjust to permanent status over time. But most green card categories have strict numerical limits that fall far short of the number of immigrants on temporary visas who wish to stay. The most recent data suggest that 1.1 million approved applicants are waiting for employment-based green cards. Immigrants from China and India are among the most adversely affected because, in general, no more than 7 percent of green cards can be allotted each year to applicants from any one country.
There is a better way. Provisional work-based visas, sponsored by employers and valid as long as the holder has a job, should replace green cards as the primary path to legal immigration. These visas should not be subject to country quotas and should be open-ended, so that people who don't seek permanent residency will not get kicked out of the country, as happens now.
The visas would be ''portable'' -- that is, the holder wouldn't be tied to one employer -- to ensure that workers are treated fairly. But because these visas would be tied to employment, immigrants would have to leave the country if the economy deteriorated and they couldn't find work.
In place of our current system's lotteries and ''first-come, first-served'' policies, the government should hold regular auctions where companies can bid for permits to bring in foreign workers. Employers would bid highest for the most-valued workers, creating a selection mechanism that wouldn't rely on the judgment of bureaucrats or the paperwork skills of immigration lawyers.
Separate auctions would be run for high- and low-skilled workers, because permit prices would depend on prospective wages. Bringing low-skilled workers into the program is vital to stemming illegal immigration, as the current system's lack of sufficient visas for the low-skilled is a main reason that people cross the border illegally.
These auctions would be more efficient than the current system because they would respond to changes in labor demand. When prices rose, the government could react by increasing the number of permits, better syncing immigration with the business cycle. Work-based immigration would rise with economic growth and fall with rising unemployment.
Finally, the auctions would provide the government with new revenue in an era of huge deficits. Some of that money might be used to offset costs incurred by states or localities with large numbers of immigrants, or to retrain American workers displaced by immigration.
For the past two decades, policy makers have tinkered on the margins of the immigration system, reacting to the latest crisis or political priority. Greater emphasis on work-based immigration as part of a coherent immigration process would go a long way to enhance our economy's competitiveness and the nation's well-being.

HEADLINE: Newspaper Group Offers a Guarantee to Marketers

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
NEWSPAPERS are joining media like television and magazines in guaranteeing some results for advertisers.
The Newspaper National Network, which is owned by 25 major newspaper publishers and the Newspaper Association of America, will offer a deal to national marketers that sell packaged goods like health and beauty aids, food, beverages and household products: if a series of advertisements they buy does not result in at least a 10 percent increase in sales volume, the last ad in the series is free.
The offer comes after tests during the last two years that involved eight packaged-goods brands sold by giant marketers like Campbell Soup, General Mills, PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble. All eight gained sales, the newspaper network said, with increases that ranged from 7 to 25 percent; the average was 16 percent. 
There are stipulations to the offer, of course, among them that the marketers be new to newspapers, spend at least $300,000 and buy at least a third of an ad page three times. The newspaper network is initially limiting the offer -- available in 170 newspapers in 100 markets -- to five marketers.
And the offer applies only to ads that are ''R.O.P.,'' or run-of-paper, to try to stimulate marketer interest in the ad pages that appear throughout a newspaper. Most national marketers of packaged goods that advertise in newspapers typically buy the bulk of their ad space outside the actual papers, running in the coupon inserts published by News America Marketing and Valassis Communications or the magazine supplements like Parade, Relish and USA Weekend.
For decades, purveyors of mainstay packaged goods bought ads in daily newspapers, particularly in the issues on Wednesdays and Thursdays, known in the industry as ''best food day'' for the food articles that appeared interspersed with ads from local supermarkets and grocery stores.
But sales of such ads have declined significantly, along with so many other types of newspaper ads as the medium confronted challenges from television and, most recently, the Internet.
Although ''the newspaper business has changed a lot,'' said Jason E. Klein, president and chief executive at the newspaper network in New York, marketers still care about sales, and ''this goes to the ability to move product at retail.''
''There was a lot of food advertising in R.O.P.,'' Mr. Klein said, ''and most has gravitated to supermarket circulars or F.S.I.'s,'' using the industry shorthand for free-standing inserts, another term for coupon inserts.
But there are some signs of life, including data from the newspaper association that ''consumer packaged goods advertising in newspapers is up 5 percent in the last 12 months,'' he added. Among the brands that have been advertising in newspaper pages are Campbell's Soup and Kellogg's Corn Flakes.
That gain helped spur the decision to make the offer after the tests were completed. Another reason was the recent increases in ad spending by many makers of packaged foods as they sought to take advantage of the fact that budget-tight consumers were eating more often at home.
The data that the newspaper network will use to determine whether sales grow or shrink for the five marketers will come from the InfoScan tracking-service unit of the SymphonyIRI Group. That is the same outside source that supplied the data used during the tests.
''We will measure results at our expense,'' Mr. Klein said, ''and if we don't drive a 10 percent sales increase, the advertiser will get back a portion'' of what was spent on the ads. So if the advertiser bought five ads, for example, the fifth would be free.
Several executives at media agencies who specialize in print advertising have been given a preview of the offer.
''I'm hoping that it's not too little, too late,'' said Audrey Siegel, president and director for client services at TargetCast TCM in New York.
If newspaper publishers ''can in fact prove that this ad in this paper on this day generated sales, they're beginning to tell a story'' that would catch the attention of agencies and advertisers, Ms. Siegel said. ''But has it been too long since the medium was viable in this area?''
''This is a perfect moment to do it,'' she added, ''but I think they get one shot to do it.''
Martin Cass, president at Carat USA in New York, part of the Carat division of the Aegis Group, echoed Ms. Siegel's assessment of the timing. ''It's exactly the right time,'' he said, because ''we're beginning to see some green shoots of recovery'' in the economy.
''Newspapers have had a really rough ride,'' Mr. Cass said, partly because of ''the measurability and accountability'' that the digital media promise advertisers. So an offer ''to put their money where their mouth is or have skin in the game,'' he added, could be ''a no-lose for clients.''
The brands that took part in the tests included Dayquil and Febreze, sold by Procter; Pace salsa, sold by Campbell Soup; Progresso, sold by General Mills; and Propel water, sold by PepsiCo. The newspaper network spent an estimated $600,000 on the tests.
The newspapers taking part in the offer are published by companies like Gannett, Hearst, McClatchy, Media General, the MediaNews Group and E. W. Scripps.
Media that offer marketers guarantees often use sales volume as the criterion to determine whether the ads worked or not. In some instances, they measure whether awareness of or positive feelings about a brand increased.

HEADLINE: Woody Allen on Faith, Fortune Tellers and New York

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
Asked on Tuesday morning if it was appropriate to wish him a happy Jewish New Year, Woody Allen made it clear that such formalities were not necessary. ''No, no, no,'' he said with a chuckle, seated in an office suite at the Loews Regency hotel. ''That's for your people,'' he told this reporter. ''I don't follow it. I wish I could get with it. It would be a big help on those dark nights.''
At 74, Mr. Allen, the prolific filmmaker and emblematic New Yorker, has hardly found religion. But the idea of faith informs his latest movie, ''You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger,'' which Sony Pictures Classics is to release next Wednesday. In the film, as the marriage of a London couple (Anthony Hopkins and Gemma Jones) unravels, the wife seeks comfort in the supernatural, which has unforeseen consequences on the marriage of her daughter (Naomi Watts) and her husband (Josh Brolin).
''To me,'' Mr. Allen said, ''there's no real difference between a fortune teller or a fortune cookie and any of the organized religions. They're all equally valid or invalid, really. And equally helpful.'' 
Mr. Allen spoke with Dave Itzkoff about his new film, how its themes resonate in his life and whether he has made his last movie in New York. These are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. The ideas of psychic powers and past lives, or at least people who believe in them, are central to your latest film. What got you interested in writing about them?
A. I was interested in the concept of faith in something. This sounds so bleak when I say it, but we need some delusions to keep us going. And the people who successfully delude themselves seem happier than the people who can't. I've known people who have put their faith in religion and in fortune tellers. So it occurred to me that that was a good character for a movie: a woman who everything had failed for her, and all of a sudden, it turned out that a woman telling her fortune was helping her. The problem is, eventually, she's in for a rude awakening.
Q. What seems more plausible to you, that we've existed in past lives, or that there is a God?
A. Neither seems plausible to me. I have a grim, scientific assessment of it. I just feel, what you see is what you get.
Q. How do you feel about the aging process?
A. Well, I'm against it. [laughs] I think it has nothing to recommend it. You don't gain any wisdom as the years go by. You fall apart, is what happens. People try and put a nice varnish on it, and say, well, you mellow. You come to understand life and accept things. But you'd trade all of that for being 35 again. I've experienced that thing where you wake up in the middle of the night and you start to think about your own mortality and envision it, and it gives you a little shiver. That's what happens to Anthony Hopkins at the beginning of the movie, and from then on in, he did not want to hear from his more realistic wife, ''Oh, you can't keep doing that -- you're not young anymore.'' Yes, she's right, but nobody wants to hear that.
Q. Has getting older changed your work in any way? Do you see a certain wistfulness emerging in your later films?
A. No, it's too hit or miss. There's no rhyme or reason to anything that I do. It's whatever seems right at the time. I've never once in my life seen any film of mine after I put it out. Ever. I haven't seen ''Take the Money and Run'' since 1968. I haven't seen ''Annie Hall'' or ''Manhattan'' or any film I've made afterward. If I'm on the treadmill and I'm scooting through the channels, and I come across one of them, I go right past it instantly, because I feel it could only depress me. I would only feel, ''Oh God, this is so awful, if I could only do that again.''
Q. You recently told the European press that shooting movies in New York had become too expensive. Do you think you've made your last film here?
A. My first choice would always be New York. It would be my fondest wish -- to work where you live is of course the most luxurious privilege, and I'm sure I will film here again. But the few dollars I have go further in certain places. The cities I'm talking about -- London, Paris, Barcelona -- these are very cosmopolitan, and they're like New York. I can afford it a little bit easier. To me it's a privilege to shoot in New York, and I don't mind it being extra. I just have to have it, to be able to afford it. I would always make the picture in New York for $15 million that I could make elsewhere for $12 million, if I had $15 million. But if I don't have the money, then I can't do it.
Q. It's not a situation in which these European cities have rolled out the red carpet for you, whereas New York took you for granted?
A. New York has always been cooperative and helpful and a pleasure to shoot in. But the European countries do give you an enormous amount of cooperation. I still occasionally have to make cuts in my film to work there, too. I'm always working with less money than I need. It's axiomatic.
Q. Were you prepared for the firestorm of media coverage you set off by casting Carla Bruni-Sarkozy in your next movie, ''Midnight in Paris''?
A. I was very surprised at the level of journalism that occurred in relation to her. She has a small part in the movie -- a real part, but it's a small part. And I shot with her the first day, and then all the papers said she was terrible, and I did 32 takes with her. Of course I didn't even do 10 takes with her. This was just a magical number that some guy created in a room. Then they printed that her husband came to the set and was angry with her. He came to the set once, and he was delighted. He felt she was a natural actress and couldn't have been happier.
Q. That would make a good blurb for the movie poster.
A. For some reason, the press wanted to say bad things about her. I don't know if they had something against the Sarkozys, or it was a better way to sell papers. But the fabrications were so wild and so completely fake, and I wondered to myself, Is this what happens with Afghanistan and the economy and matters of real significance? This is a trivial matter. That's a longwinded answer to your question: I was not prepared for the amount of press that was attached to the picture because of Madame Sarkozy.
Q. When you've got down time between projects, as you do now, how do you spend it?
A. I do the usual stuff. I take my kids to school in the morning. I go for walks with my wife, play with my jazz band. Then there's the obligation of the treadmill, and the weights, to keep in shape, so I don't get more decrepit than I am. I generally don't see the big Hollywood movies. I saw ''Winter's Bone'' the other day and liked the movie very much, loved all the performers. And when I was in Paris, I got a chance to read a certain amount, Tolstoy and Norman Mailer. Things that had slipped through the cracks over the years.
Q. I half-expected to see you at that 12-hour performance of Dostoyevsky's ''Demons'' that Lincoln Center Festival produced over the summer.
A. No, no, I'm a lowbrow. I read that material, more out of obligation than enjoyment. For enjoyment, for me, it's a beer and the football game.

HEADLINE: Empty Seats at Meadowlands Are Economic Lesson Relearned

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
When the Jets and the Giants decided to build New Meadowlands Stadium, they stocked it with 10,000 expensive club seats, dwarfing the 400 to 500 that each team sold for a relative pittance at Giants Stadium.
But not all those club seats sold out in time for the Giants' opening game on Sunday and the Jets' opener on Monday night. They were clustered in a prominent part of the 82,500-seat stadium, so the empty sections made the teams' failure to sell out glaring.
Still, even though neither team filled up the stadium, they were able to have the games broadcast locally because of N.F.L. rules that exempt club seats from blackout calculations. 
The appearance of the empty seats in a new billion-dollar sports palace echoed what occurred in 2009, when steep prices were imposed for the best box seats at the new Yankee Stadium, a strategy that did not work in the midst of a deep recession.
Some of those seats, costing as much as $2,500 a game, went unsold, and the bald patches were obvious on television cameras, especially in the view looking in from center field. Even now, a year later, some of those seats near home plate and the dugouts remain unsold. And now the Giants and the Jets are enduring the same phenomenon.
''You wonder if these teams overestimated the New York market,'' said Jon Greenberg, the executive editor of Team Marketing Report, an industry newsletter. ''They've just treated their fans like A.T.M.s because there's so much wealth concentrated in that area.''
The high prices of the top tickets at Yankee Stadium and the introduction of personal seat licenses at New Meadowlands have raised the possibility that sellouts will not be that easy to achieve in either place. The Yankees sold out 58 times at their old and larger stadium in 2008, but only seven times in the smaller ballpark last season and just 12 times so far this year.
The Yankees have redefined their economics and do not need the sellouts that once were part of their identity. They average fewer fans than they did in the old stadium but still lead baseball in attendance. They give out thousands of free tickets to sponsors who buy club seats and luxury boxes, and over all generate more revenue than in the past.
As for the Giants and the Jets, they changed their financial dynamics by selling personal seat licenses in a stadium larger than their previous home. But by doing so, they created an instant obstacle to the sellouts synonymous with their teams.
The club seats have proved to be the hardest to sell, with Jets fans required to pay $5,000 to $30,000 in licenses for those seats and Giants fans $7,500 to $20,000. To that are added per-game ticket charges that cost hundreds of dollars.
''I think the pricing was aggressive but fair before the economy fell,'' said Jim Grinstead, the publisher of Revenues From Sports Venues, an industry publication.
John Mara, a co-owner of the Giants, said that the team's 1,200 unsold club seats were a consequence of the economy, and that he was not worried that they would eventually sell.
''Some people are trying to paint this as a negative, and we're not used to seeing pockets of empty seats,'' he conceded.
''But we had over 77,000 people on a rainy day,'' he said in reference to the stadium opener Sunday. ''The best way to get people into the building is to play games. We've only played one.''
Last season, club seats cost Giants fans $550 a game, and there was no seat license attached. In January, the Giants said they had 1,500 club seats available, which means they have sold only 300 since then. The Jets still have 1,500 club seats to sell.
Matthew Higgins, an executive vice president of the Jets, said in an e-mail that the ''concept of walking into a club and standing on the field 5 yards behind the Jets' bench is a new concept,'' referring to the team's most expensive club-seat area. ''Even though they are interested, many fans ask to see it on game day before they'll make a commitment,'' he added.
In Dallas, the Cowboys were so confident that wealthy fans and corporations would embrace expensive club seats that they opened Cowboys Stadium last year with 15,000 of them -- priced from $16,000 to $50,000 per license. Ninety-five percent have been sold.
''You have to look at the time we're living in,'' Mara said. ''No question, price is a big factor.''
Only one game -- Cleveland at Tampa Bay, with paid attendance of 47,211 -- was blacked out in Week 1 of the season.
When the league imposed its blackout policy decades ago, there were relatively few club seats or luxury boxes. As such, blackouts are based on the sale of general-admission tickets.
''We don't want blackouts hinging on the most expensive seats,'' said Eric Grubman, executive vice president of N.F.L. Ventures. ''The average ticket buyer,'' he added, ''isn't a club-seat buyer.''

HEADLINE: The Auto Show Along 11th Avenue Is Expanding

BYLINE: By JOTHAM SEDERSTROM

 BODY:
On 11th Avenue in Manhattan is a stretch of auto dealerships similar to other car malls across the country, with glass-fronted showrooms displaying the latest and greatest models from Detroit, Germany and Japan.
But unlike other automobile rows in places like Boston and Minnesota, where dealerships have closed over the last few years, the stretch from roughly 48th to 58th Street on the far West Side, called Autobahn Alley, is thriving.
In what real estate brokers and auto industry executives are calling the biggest burst of activity in more than a decade, several auto brands are expanding or relocating along the corridor, with a planned Mercedes-Benz flagship on 54th Street the most recent example. 
''As far as development goes, this is easily the most activity we've seen there in years,'' said Mark Schienberg, president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, a trade group that represents about 425 dealerships in nine counties across New York State. ''There's been just an extraordinary amount of activity that's been going on over there.''
Mercedes announced its five-story showroom and service center earlier this year, and a $125 million deal last year will place Volkswagen and Audi in new facilities near 55th Street.
Infiniti of Manhattan is seeking a new location on 11th Avenue to replace a showroom at 608 West 57th Street that it will need to vacate to make way for a residential project, real estate brokers said. Chrysler, meanwhile, has also been discussing expansion plans, the brokers said.
None of those transactions, however, match the size and scope of the new Mercedes-Benz dealership, said Michael Laginestra, a vice chairman of CB Richard Ellis who, with his colleague Michael Geoghegan, signed the deal last year as part of a residential development project.
The 333,000-square-foot dealership, already under way at 770 11th Avenue and scheduled to open early next year, will have glass on three sides, a waiting room with Wi-Fi, a coffee and pastry bar, and a garage with 72 work bays, said Alan McLaren, president of Mercedes-Benz of Manhattan.
The dealership, the only one in the country directly owned by Mercedes-Benz rather than a franchisee, will take the place of a showroom at 536 West 41st Street that has long suffered from its traffic-choked proximity to the Lincoln Tunnel, Mr. McLaren said.
''New York is one of our most critical markets in the country,'' said Mr. McLaren, who added that the search for new space began about six years ago. ''The dealership is consistently one of our top five dealerships in the country, and if ever there's a place where you need to get it right, it's right here, where the performance standards are arguably set higher than anywhere else in the United States.''
The surge of activity on 11th Avenue is in sharp contrast to other areas of the country, where approximately 1,900 dealerships have closed since 2009, said Paul Taylor, the chief economist at the National Automobile Dealers Association in Virginia. Mr. Schienberg of the regional dealers association said that in New York's five boroughs, only 15 dealerships had shuttered in the last 10 years.
The stability in New York, Mr. Taylor said, can be attributed in part to 11th Avenue's proximity to Wall Street and the financial markets, as well as the sheer number of drivers in the city. While dealerships in other areas of the country are suffering from a slump in auto sales and a move toward consolidating multiple brands under a single roof, both luxury brands and mainstream ones like Toyota and Ford are thriving on 11th Avenue.
''The trend toward dealerships opening in Manhattan is driven in part by its province in the financial markets worldwide,'' said Mr. Taylor. ''Luxury brands are typically sold to households with significant incomes and large holdings of security outside of retirement programs. And, of course, many of those households have jobs in Manhattan.''
New York's thirst for luxury brands played a role in the Volkswagen Group of America's decision last year to sign a deal to buy a building that was previously owned by Potamkin General Motors at 798 11th Avenue, giving it 265,000 square feet of showrooms. When it is completed later this year, the space will house not only Volkswagen but also its luxury sister brand, Audi.
Jedd Nero, an executive vice president at CB Richard Ellis who completed the transaction last year after a two-year search by Volkswagen, said that regardless of the faltering economy it was crucial for Volkswagen to establish ties to the 11th Avenue automobile corridor.
''Here was a rare opportunity for Volkswagen to purchase this building and make it their own,'' Mr. Nero said. And because the company is not tied to a lease, he said, executives ''know that it's their choice down the road as to how long they want to be in the market.''

HEADLINE: Walls Fall in a German City, but This Time to Few Cheers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
STUTTGART, Germany -- From his sixth-floor corner office, Wolfgang Drexler spends a lot of time staring down at the growing public uprising against the project he represents, not just any project, but the kind of construction adventure that will be judged by history to have been either visionary or ludicrous.
Mr. Drexler, a former prosecutor and vice president of the state Parliament, agreed to be the lead spokesman for Stuttgart 21, an ambitious plan to link the wealthy industrial region of southwestern Germany to Europe's high-speed rail system.
But when the heavy machines rolled, and walls in parts of the century-old train station began to fall to make way for a modern transit hub, residents of this city decided they would not wait for history's verdict. In a remarkably broad show of defiance in a conservative heartland, thousands of people have poured into the streets in a sustained series of protests that have grown stronger in the face of a political leadership that refuses to stop the demolition. Estimates of the crowds ranged from the low thousands to as many as 60,000. 
This contest of wills may seem familiar to Americans, but it represents a profound change in German politics and governing that has been gathering steam for decades, political experts here say.
While Germany is no stranger to street demonstrations, they have typically been organized by leftists to protest issues like nuclear power and the placement of United States missiles. What has impressed analysts and shaken local officials in Stuttgart is the size and duration of the protests and the cross section of the traditionally conservative population that is taking part, with retirees and middle-age professionals standing alongside college students to demand a voice in government.
''The opposition is a little late, but it is very powerful,'' said Peter Losche, a retired professor of political science from the University of Gottingen. ''The official institutions, the parties, they are going to have to give in. It has taken the parties by surprise.''
And Mr. Drexler as well. ''I am astonished by the number of people in the street,'' he said, shaking his head wearily. And still, he said, with the frustration of a man who has wielded power for many years, there was no room for compromise. ''You can't build half a station,'' he snapped.
Stuttgart 21 is expected to take about a decade and billions of dollars to complete. It is a joint effort of the federal, state and local governments along with Deutsche Bahn, the German rail agency, and it involves tearing down parts of the old station here and putting miles of track underground. The project would open about 250 acres for redevelopment while requiring cutting down about 300 trees, some more than 200 years old.
Mr. Losche and others said that no matter how it turns out, the Stuttgart showdown has already inspired the parties to ''rethink the political process.'' There is talk of creating networks to reach out to citizen organizations, instituting primaries to replace party conferences and perhaps making more use of referendums.
Stuttgart, a city of about 600,000, in the southern state of Baden-Wurttemberg, is the Christian Democrat heartland, home to Mercedes-Benz and Porsche, hardly a hotbed of radicalism.
''Our majority is conservative,'' said Helmuth Haag, head of marketing and communications for the Stuttgart Region Economic Development Corporation. ''We are talking about a work force that is mainly white collar, highly educated, skilled.''
That makes it all the more surprising that a political reckoning is occurring here, and that the train station issue has raised the previously unthinkable possibility that the Christian Democrats could lose control of the state after elections in March. If that happens, and polls suggest it could, the party could also lose control of the Bundesrat, which acts as an upper house of Parliament, severely hampering its ability to get its programs put in effect.
''This is one of the secrets of the protests: It's young and old, left and right, rich and poor,'' said Gangolf Stocker, a painter who is Mr. Drexler's foil in the drama. With his tousle of white hair and water-blue eyes, Mr. Stocker has spent years in the political left protesting nuclear power and an automobile test track. Now, he suddenly finds himself in the political mainstream, and for the last year a member of the local Parliament.
''The second secret of this movement is it keeps coming and it won't stop,'' he said.
Mr. Stocker shows up outside the old station every day, helping to choreograph the carnival of police and protesters, commuters and assorted drifters who happen by. As the jaws of hydraulic shears chew away at the structure, men and women blow whistles and jeer, all day, every day. The police stay in a line, many wearing yellow ear plugs.
''Generally people here only think of cars, jobs, a home and having a nice time,'' said Verena Pantschitz, an economist who was volunteering to work at a makeshift canteen for the protesters. ''So this is really surprising. But people are very angry with the people in charge.''
The station is an imposing building, a stone fortress that could be mistaken for a prison. The hulking building is one of the few structures to have survived Allied bombing in World War II, and there is a lot of sentimental attachment to it. The plan calls for pulling down its two wings and removing the surface tracks that divide the city.
The parties behind the project say it will cost about $5.3 billion, but critics say the true figure could go much higher.
But if the station has sentimental value, and the cost has people concerned, it may well be the majestic trees of Schlossgarten that will force the powers-that-be to rethink the plan. The people here love their trees, and while officials said that they would replant the area with 500 of them, that did not stop hundreds of people from turning out for a prayer service beneath the boughs of a centuries-old beech. Standing beneath the copper-colored leaves, the crowd said prayers with a Lutheran minister, then joined hands and sang ''We Shall Overcome.''
People sobbed for the trees.
Andreas Erdle, an architect, said of the political leaders: ''I know they can hear us, but they don't want to hear us. Soon, they will hear us.''
All of this has the leadership off balance. While they acknowledge a failure of communication, they say that the law was followed and that local and federal parliaments approved the project, as did the courts.
But the opponents say legal does not mean legitimate.
''For me, it's personally hard to see me as a negative figure, as an antihero,'' said the longtime mayor of Stuttgart, Wolfgang Schuster, who said he is taking the blame, but does not have the power to stop the project.
Like Mr. Drexler, Mr. Schuster said he saw no room for compromise. ''At the moment, I must say, I have no solution,'' he said as he attended an event to promote electric vehicles. He had been followed by protesters who ran up to the windows and blew their whistles, which he tried to ignore.

HEADLINE: Single-Industry Buildings Withstand Tough Market

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
When Kenny Horowitz, a longtime worker in the fashion industry, decided to start his own business, he took a 10-year lease on a 10,000-square-foot showroom in 10 West 33rd Street, the Fashion Accessories Center.
''I was in this building before with another company, Steve Madden, and my partner was in this building with a company called Rosetti,'' said Mr. Horowitz, whose company is called Latique Handbags and Accessories. ''We're a new company, and as such you feed off the traffic of the seasoned players in the building. But in an oddball building somewhere, you're not going to get that traffic.''
Specialty buildings in Manhattan like the Fashion Accessories Center have fared better in the recession than the overall office market, some real estate brokers said. Owned by Adams & Company Real Estate, 10 West 33rd Street is 98 percent occupied, which is the average occupancy rate for all 10 of Adams's specialty buildings, said David L. Levy, a principal of the company. Currently, the average occupancy rate in the Manhattan office market is about 88 percent. 
''The tenants in a specialty building want to be there,'' Mr. Levy said, ''and that's why it does better in bad times. They're not going from building to building just to get the best deal.''
Mr. Horowitz said he looked at cheaper spaces within a four-block area of 10 West 33rd Street but decided it was worth it to pay the slightly higher rate of $35 a square foot. ''We feel we can afford the extra rent,'' he said, ''because we're going to do that much more in traffic.''
Mr. Horowitz said he worked for Kenneth Cole a decade ago when the company moved to a relatively remote building on 50th Street and 11th Avenue.
''A lot of people would only come to the building early in the morning or late at night,'' he said, ''never during the day when they'd lose an hour of commuting time. We lost a lot of appointments that way.''
In the commercial real estate world, a specialty building is one devoted to one industry, for example fashion, or a niche within an industry, like menswear. Manhattan's first specialty buildings may have originated in midcentury in the garment industry under the landlord Harry B. Helmsley, said Grant Greenspan, a principal of the commercial real estate firm Kaufman Organization.
''When I came into the business about 23 years ago,'' Mr. Greenspan said, ''there was a coat building, an outerwear building, a hat area -- you name it, they had different specialty buildings.''
Mr. Greenspan said the theory behind specialization was that wholesale buyers in town on purchasing trips during market weeks could maximize shopping time by visiting many manufacturers in only one or two buildings.
That is still the case in buildings like 550 Seventh Avenue, an upscale fashion designer building, or 215 West 40th Street, the Denim Building. In bad times, specialization can insulate landlords from the tumult of the market -- as long as they are not in an industry that goes belly-up in a recession.
''We've seen that a specialty building doesn't have the extreme highs and extreme lows that a normal office building would have, fluctuating with the economy,'' Mr. Levy said. ''They have more of a steady income.'' In fact, brokers said, some specialty buildings were able to command up to 20 percent more than comparable space in a general office building.
Even so, with little turnover in most specialty buildings, landlords will typically not realize the extreme highs in rents in boom times, Mr. Levy said. ''In a specialty building, you really can't gouge the tenants when the market is roaring because you want them to stay as much as they want to stay,'' he said.
At least in the past, specialty buildings tended to be the older, smaller office buildings that did not typically attract the richest tenants. For instance, Steinway Hall at 111 West 57th Street was built by the Steinway & Sons piano company in 1925 as a showroom for its pianos. Now the building, which is near Carnegie Hall, also provides offices for businesses in the arts, entertainment and education sectors, which often have limited budgets, said Mark F. Lauzon, a senior director with the commercial brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.
''The main benefit of specialization is it keeps the building full,'' Mr. Lauzon said. ''You'll get tenants who sign up because that's where they want to be, but you're not going to get top dollar from them.''
One major problem for specialty buildings is that an entire industry may collapse or move. For instance, 1115 Broadway, a building near the former International Toy Center, was being positioned by Adams & Company as a toy specialty building earlier this decade, ''which was working out great for us until the whole toy industry basically moved out of New York,'' Mr. Levy said.
An effort to replace lost toy tenants with companies involved in seasonal products like holiday displays was moderately successful, but that market is too limited, he said. Adams & Company is now considering repositioning 1115 Broadway as a generic office building or a hybrid of seasonal product businesses and offices, said James Buslik, a principal with the brokerage.
''What we're trying to do is consolidate the Halloween and seasonal products into a portion of the space,'' Mr. Buslik said, ''and then we'll make the balance of the space multitenanted office space.''
Hybrid buildings, which might have two industries in them, or one industry paired with generic office space, are becoming a trend in the New York real estate market, said Christel Engel, a senior managing director with the New York office of the commercial brokerage Colliers International.
''It's not necessarily a pure specialty building any longer,'' Ms. Engel said. ''It's going to be a semi-specialty building with an additional component. Those types of hybrids are starting to appear all over the place.''
Hybridization provides the boost to occupancy that specialization offers, but insulates the building from the collapse of an industry, Ms. Engel said. A good example is 57 West 57th Street, where part of the building is used by professional medical offices and another part by entertainment companies.
Tenants from two different industries typically do not require separate entrances, lobbies or elevators but, Ms. Engel said, those in the same industry wanted to be together on a floor.
More frequently, brokers said they were seeing larger, newer buildings turn toward specialization, and some developers have even proposed constructing specialty buildings from the ground up. For instance, Gary Barnett, the president of the Extell Development Company, is building a 34-story skyscraper at 50 West 47th Street called the International Gem Tower for the diamond industry.

PERSON: Ronald W. Waters 

HEADLINE: Ronald Walters, 72, Rights Leader and Scholar, Is Dead

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Ronald W. Walters, who organized one of the nation's first lunch-counter sit-ins to protest segregation as a young man and went on to become a leading scholar of the politics of race, died Friday in Bethesda, Md. He was 72 and lived in Silver Spring, Md.
The cause was cancer, his wife, Patricia Turner Walters, said. 
Dr. Walters was 20 and president of the local youth chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. when he and a cousin, Carol Parks, organized a sit-in at the Dockum Drug Store in downtown Wichita, Kan. That was in July 1958, two years before students in Greensboro, N.C., staged the sit-ins that are often credited with starting the movement in many Southern cities.
Every morning for three weeks, the protesters in Wichita returned to the drugstore, sitting silently until closing time, despite constant taunting. Finally the owner relented and agreed to serve black customers, saying he was losing too much money as a result of the sit-in. That protest received scant national attention, and it was only in 2006 that Dr. Walters received an N.A.A.C.P. award for his role in organizing it.
By then he had made a significant mark on the civil rights movement -- as a teacher, an author, a television commentator and an adviser to activists and politicians.
''He was an indispensable part of the brain trust of the movement,'' Vernon E. Jordan, the civil rights leader and lawyer, said on Monday. ''He was there for all of us, at the other end of the phone, if we needed his thinking, his synthesis of racial issues, political issues, economic issues. And he was always at the ready to get on the train to help the cause.''
Dr. Walters, who for 13 years until his retirement last year was director of the African American Leadership Institute at the University of Maryland, was a deputy campaign manager and debate adviser for the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson's presidential bid in 1984. In the early 1970s, he was instrumental in the establishment of the Congressional Black Caucus, and he subsequently served as a staff adviser to Representative Charles Diggs, Democrat of Michigan, the first chairman of the caucus.
Dr. Walters wrote 13 books and scores of articles on racial politics. In ''White Nationalism, Black Interests: Conservative Public Policy and the Black Community'' (2003), he analyzed the resurgence of conservatism among whites.
Sixteen years before, in ''Black Presidential Politics in America: A Strategic Approach,'' Dr. Walters had envisioned the possibility of an African-American president and laid out the steps that such a candidate would have to take to reach the White House.
Patricia Walters recalled the night President Obama was elected two years ago: ''We were stunned, elated and immediately fell into each other's arms and started crying. My husband looked me in the eyes and said, 'This is the vision I was trying to present when I wrote the book, that this was a great possibility.' ''
Ronald William Walters was born in Wichita on July 20, 1938, the oldest of seven children of Gilmar and Maxine Fray Walters. His father was a career Army officer and later a professional bassist; his mother was a civil rights investigator for the state.
Besides his wife, he is survived by three brothers, Duane, Terence and Kevin, and two sisters, Marcia Walters-Hardeman and Sharon Walters.
Dr. Walters graduated from Fisk University with a degree in history in 1963 and went on to earn a master's in African studies in 1966 and a doctorate in international studies in 1971, both from American University. He taught at Syracuse University in the late 1960s, was a visiting professor at Princeton and a fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard and, in 1969, became the first chairman of Afro-American studies at Brandeis University. From 1971 to 1996 he taught at Howard University, including 15 years as chairman of its political science department.
Dr. Walters wrote a weekly syndicated column that appeared in many newspapers. Last month, in his last column, he recalled the ''progressive spirit of the original nonviolent march'' on Washington in August 1963, ''which held out the hope of racial reconciliation and that America would finally cash a check of justice that would allow all of us to invest in the great project of democracy.''

HEADLINE: Metric Interstate Divides Arizonans

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
GREEN VALLEY, Ariz. -- It is not the mountains or the cactuses that stand out most while driving Interstate 19 from the Mexican border to Tucson. It's the signs.
Distance along I-19 is measured in kilometers, just as it is in Mexico. That means highway markers advise that there are three kilometers until the next gas station, four until the next rest stop, seven until the next desert town.
But the distinctive signs' days may be, well, numbered. 
The Arizona Department of Transportation says the 400 signs along the I-19's 100 kilometers are too old and need to be replaced. The new signs, officials say, would be like all the others in the state and would indicate distance in miles. Exit numbers would be reconfigured as well.
A throwback to an American experiment with the metric system in the early 1980s that did not get far off the ground, the signs not only indicate the number of kilometers to the next exit, but also the exit numbers themselves coincide with the number of kilometers from Nogales, which abuts the border.
''It's a bit different,'' acknowledged Jim DiGiacomo, executive director of the Green Valley-Sahuarita Chamber of Commerce, who has been driving I-19 since the highway was completed in the late 1970s.
If the signs are changed to miles, that would mean that the Inn at San Ignacio, in the retirement community of Green Valley, would no longer be off Exit 56.
''You'd think it wouldn't be a big deal, but it is,'' said the inn's owner, Jim Green, who wants the metric signs to stay put. ''Think about how much money my company has spent directing people to Exit 56. Think about the literature, the brochures, the tour books.''
Some who live along I-19 do not particularly care for the signs, saying they look foreign, are confusing and serve no purpose now that the United States has decided not to give an inch to the metric system.
State officials had originally planned to use $1.5 million in federal stimulus money to replace the signs, prompting Sean Hannity, the conservative Fox News commentator, to lampoon the project last year as one of the most wasteful uses of taxpayer dollars.
It was local opposition to the changeover along I-19, however, that prompted the state to slow the process and miss the March 2 deadline to spend the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act money on the overhaul. The project, which the state calls a ''safety priority'' because the old signs are not reflective enough at night, is now suspended.
''We know there are diverse opinions about the current signs,'' said Timothy Tait, a spokesman for the Transportation Department, indicating that a decision on the I-19 signs would have to be made in the ''short term.''
State transportation officials had come up with what they thought was a compromise: converting the signs to miles but also making note of the old exit numbers. So the sign for the new Exit 43, on Duval Mine Road in Sahuarita, would also have indicated ''Old Exit 69.''
That approach, state officials said, would have given businesses plenty of time to update their addresses.
But some supporters of the metric signs bring up another argument for keeping them in place: the idiosyncratic signs help put the communities along I-19, which include Rio Rico, Tubac and Amado and the San Xavier Indian Reservation, on the map.
The U.S. Metric Association, a group based in California that advocates conversion to the metric system, has tallied numerous metric signs around the country, most near the borders with Canada and Mexico. But I-19 may be the only Interstate highway that is almost completely metric, making it stand out from all the other stretches of concrete crisscrossing the country.
''I've been in the hotel business since 1997,'' Mr. Green said, ''and I've been asked by my guests thousands of times about the metric signs. They aren't complaining. They are intrigued.''
He said he knew of no drivers who had overshot their desired exit because they were not aware that a kilometer is equal to 0.6 miles. ''Someone may think they have five miles to go and they have less than five miles, but so what?'' Mr. Green said.
I-19 is one of the nation's shortest Interstates but one still lined with attractions. There is a decommissioned Titan II intercontinental ballistic missile at Exit 69 that tourists wearing hard hats can inspect in its underground silo. There is the Desert Diamond Casino 11 kilometers to the north. And 34 kilometers from the border is the artist community of Tubac, home to a Spanish fort dating to 1752.
''We're used to the signs,'' said Mr. DiGiacomo, the business leader. ''We did a survey, and most of our members think they should stay the way they are. Leave well enough alone. We think it would cause more confusion if they changed it.''

HEADLINE: For Blacks, Progress In Happiness

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Set aside some prominent success stories, like the current occupant of the White House, and the last few decades have not been great ones for African-American progress.
In 1975, per capita black income was 41 percent lower than per capita white income. Since then, the gap has shrunk only modestly, to 35 percent. The black unemployment rate today is nearly twice as high as the white rate, just as it was in 1975. And by some measures -- family structure, college graduation, incarceration -- racial gaps have actually grown.
But now a new study has found that there is one big realm in which black Americans have made major progress: happiness.
White Americans don't report being any more satisfied with their lives than they did in the 1970s, various surveys show. Black Americans do, and significantly so. 
Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, the University of Pennsylvania economists who did the study, point out that self-reported measures of happiness usually shift at a glacial pace. The share of whites, for example, telling pollsters in recent years that they are ''not too happy'' -- as opposed to ''pretty happy'' or ''very happy'' -- has been about 10 percent. It was also 10 percent in the 1970s.
Yet the share of blacks saying they are not too happy has dropped noticeably, to about 20 percent in surveys over the last decade, from 24 percent in the 1970s. All in all, Mr. Wolfers calls the changes to blacks' answers, ''one of the most dramatic gains in the happiness data that you'll see.''
The new study is part of a deluge of happiness research by economists, who are discovering what the rest of us have long known: money isn't everything. To get a true sense for people's quality of life -- the most basic mission of economics -- you have to try to peek inside the human mind.
Money clearly has a big effect on the mind, just as it has a big effect on health, education and almost everything else. The rich report being happier than the middle class on average, and the middle class report being happier than the poor. The income and wealth gaps between whites and blacks, in turn, explain a big part of the happiness gap.
But they don't explain all of it. Among whites and blacks making the same amount of money, whites tend to be happier. This unexplained gap, however, has shrunk.
Ms. Stevenson and Mr. Wolfers have a good way of making this point. In the 1970s, a relatively affluent black person -- one in a household making more than nine out of 10 other black households, or at the 90th percentile of the black income spectrum -- was earning the same amount as someone at the 75th percentile of the white spectrum. That's another way of saying blacks were making less than whites.
But blacks were far less satisfied with their lives than could be explained by the income difference. People at the 90th percentile of the black income spectrum were as happy on average as people just below the 10th percentile of the white income spectrum, amazingly enough.
Today, people at the 90th percentile of the black income spectrum are still making about as much as those at the 75th percentile of the white spectrum -- but are now as happy on average as people in the dead middle, or the 50th percentile, of the white income spectrum. The income gap hasn't shrunk much, but the happiness gap has.
In the paper, which is awaiting peer review, the two economists acknowledge that they cannot be sure what is causing the change. But it is consistent with patterns that other happiness researchers have noticed, and there are some plausible explanations.
The most obvious is the decrease -- though certainly not the elimination -- in day-to-day racism. ''The decline in prejudice has been astounding,'' says Kerwin Charles, a University of Chicago economist who has studied discrimination. Well into the 1970s, blacks faced ''a vast array of personal indignities that led to unhappiness,'' he noted. Today, those indignities are unacceptable in many areas of American life.
Old polls bear this out. In the early 1970s, 39 percent of Americans said they favored laws against marriage between the two races, according to one long-running poll. When the question was last asked, earlier this decade, the share had fallen below 10 percent. The number saying they are unwilling to vote for a black presidential candidate has also plummeted. That shift is a reminder that jobs once closed to blacks -- Fortune 500 chief executive, A-list movie star, secretary of state, attorney general or president -- no longer are.
It isn't hard to see how the decline in discrimination improves people's lives, above and beyond their pay.
And the decline in discrimination may even be lifting black wages, despite the meager gains in the overall statistics. Jonathan Guryan, a Northwestern University economist, points out that the last three decades have brought a wave of forces that could have led to a widening of the black-white pay gap.
Union membership has dropped, and black workers are more likely to be unionized. Income inequality has risen, and black households are more likely to be middle class or poor. The economic returns of a college degree have soared, and the college graduation gap between whites and blacks has grown. Nonetheless, the black-white pay gap has shrunk slightly.
One intriguing footnote to the new paper is how different it seems from an earlier Stevenson-Wolfers paper about women and men. It found that women have become less happy over the last few decades, in spite of big economic, educational and social progress. Ms. Stevenson argues -- persuasively, I think -- that the combined job and family expectations for women today may have left many less than fully satisfied.
By contrast, the happiness gains for black women have been a bit bigger than for black men, who are still more satisfied than they were in the 1970s, but less so than a decade ago.
With both the race and the gender findings, you get a sense of how much fairer the American economy has become, and yet how unfair it can still be.
A rich vein of research has shown that racial discrimination remains a part of daily life, albeit a reduced one. To take just one example, an experiment found that resumes with typically black names lead to fewer job interviews than similar resumes with different names. Combine the discrimination with the toll of bad schools and broken families, and you end up with those huge lingering black-white gaps.
Closing the gaps would clearly help the economy -- moving families out of poverty, freeing up talent and, in the long run, probably lifting growth. But these wouldn't be the only benefits. There would also be some on which it's hard to put a price.

HEADLINE: Japan's Prime Minister Prevails in Party Leadership Contest

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Prime Minister Naoto Kan won a hard-fought vote within Japan's governing party on Tuesday to stay on as prime minister, surviving a challenge by the party's power broker, Ichiro Ozawa.
In the end, Mr. Kan won by a comfortable margin of 721 points to Mr. Ozawa's 491 points, under a complicated counting system that assigns different weights to votes by lawmakers, local officials and rank-and-file party members.
The final tally failed to capture the drama of a contest that had appeared too close to call. Among Democratic members of Parliament, who cast their ballots in a ballroom of a hotel in central Tokyo, Mr. Kan garnered 206 votes, barely besting the 200 votes for Mr. Ozawa. But the votes of the rank-and-file went overwhelmingly for Mr. Kan, giving him his final margin of victory. 
Before the vote, both men made impassioned final speeches to cap a two-week contest that was unusually open and heated by the standards of Japan's staid democracy.
''I have a dream,'' said Mr. Kan, 63, who took office three months ago. ''That is to break the 20 years of blockage, to point a new way for Japan, to revive Japan and to pass a vibrant Japan on to the next generation.''
The result spared the nation yet another change in leadership as it grapples with a soaring yen, which has contributed lately to its now two-decade-long economic decline, and a simmering diplomatic standoff over a Chinese boat seized near disputed islands in the East China Sea, among other problems. If Mr. Ozawa had won, he would have been the seventh prime minister in four years.
The outcome also promises to calm Tokyo's recently rocky relationship with Washington, its longtime ally and protector. After the victory, Mr. Kan repeated his promise to honor a May agreement to relocate a Marine air base on Okinawa, which Mr. Ozawa had pledged to renegotiate because of intense opposition on the island.
Political experts called the contest a battle of political style rather than policy substance. Mr. Ozawa, a skilled strategist who engineered the Democrats' historic election victory last year, vowed to be a stronger and more assertive prime minister, echoing the public perception that Mr. Kan had failed to show decisive leadership.
For his part, Mr. Kan hammered away at Mr. Ozawa's image as an old-school, back-room operator, saying that it was time for Japan to create a cleaner and more open political system, completing the political revolution the Democrats began last year, when they ended more than half a century of virtual one-party rule by their predecessors, the Liberal Democrats.
''Mr. Kan will be an experiment in what is a new style of politics for Japan,'' said Norihiko Narita, a political science professor and president of Surugadai University near Tokyo. ''He will be very sensitive to public opinion polls and tailor his policies to please the public.''
Mr. Narita and other analysts said Tuesday's defeat might also bring at least a partial withdrawal from the political scene for Mr. Ozawa, 68, who has dominated Japan's opposition movement for nearly two decades, but who called this election his final mission.
Speaking with tears in his eyes, Mr. Kan, a plain-spoken former civic activist, pledged to focus his administration on the task of fixing the ailing Japanese economy by ending deflation and creating new jobs. Yet, at a time when the stricken global economy appears to be slipping yet again, Mr. Kan's job-creation programs and other growth policies for Japan's $5 trillion economy have been criticized as too little, too late.
In the end, political experts said, Mr. Kan prevailed because of the deep unpopularity of Mr. Ozawa, who faced criticism by Japan's major newspapers over investigations by prosecutors into his political financing. However, Mr. Ozawa won support among younger members of his party, as well as among Japan's netizens, by appealing to the hunger here for strong leadership to guide the nation out of its long morass.
In particular, Mr. Ozawa, 68, had vowed to assert more political control over Japan's powerful central ministries, long this nation's de facto rulers, whom many Japanese now blame for its current woes. During the two-week campaign, he criticized Mr. Kan for being under the thumb of elite Finance Ministry bureaucrats, who have traditionally supported higher taxes and lower deficits.
Japanese news outlets have said that one of the biggest challenges Mr. Kan may face after Tuesday's vote could be keeping his party together, especially if Mr. Ozawa and allies decide to break away. However, most political experts dismissed that notion, saying that the lure of power would keep the inexperienced party together.

HEADLINE: U.N. Finds Tally of Hungry Has Fallen, But Stays High

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- The number of undernourished people in the world decreased this year for the first time in 15 years, but the level remains higher than before the 2008 food crisis, and the volatile state of prices gives cause for unease, senior United Nations officials said Tuesday.
The number of hungry people fell to 925 million from the record high of 1.02 billion in 2009, with much of the improvement tied to income growth in the Asia-Pacific region and to a 40 percent drop in food prices from their 2008 peak. 
Still, the hunger number remains ''shockingly high,'' said Josette Sheeran, the executive director of the World Food Program, at a news conference in Rome, especially since success stories in African, Asian and Latin American countries that once suffered chronic malnourishment suggest that a permanent reversal should be possible.
The figures were compiled before the flooding crisis in Pakistan and the jolt in wheat prices in late August, the second in the month, after Russia announced that it would halt wheat exports because of drought and fires.
The numbers in the latest hunger report were released before a meeting next week at the United Nations in New York of more than 100 world leaders, who will consider the fate of eight development goals set in 2000 for 2015, with many of them well short of the targets.
The latest hunger data indicate that the very first goal, reducing the number of hungry people in the world to half of what it was in 1990, will be virtually impossible to meet, Jacques Diouf, the director general of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, said at the news conference, which was broadcast on the Web.
The report estimated that the number of undernourished people in the Asia-Pacific region would decline 12 percent from 2009, to 578 million, because of economic growth there. Seven countries account for two-thirds of the world's hungry people: China, India, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Ethiopia and Pakistan. India and China alone account for 40 percent of the world's hungry, the report said.
But sub-Saharan Africa has the highest proportion of undernourished people, 30 percent of its population, it said.
''The current dramatic situation is a result of the neglect of agriculture in development policies over the past three decades,'' Mr. Diouf said. More than 70 percent of the extremely poor live in rural parts of developing countries, he said, and those areas need investment in seeds and fertilizer and better access to markets to reduce hunger.
The world's 20 most developed countries promised to invest $22 billion in aid to agriculture from 2009 to 2011, he noted, but so far only $425 million has been spent. While all the movement in terms of aid is in the right direction, he said, the pace needs to be accelerated.
Oxfam International, a group of antipoverty organizations, released a report on Tuesday saying that it estimated that an increase in investment of $75 billion a year was needed -- half in overseas aid and half from developing countries' national budgets -- to reach the target of halving the number of hungry people.
Oxfam's report said that the factors contributing to the 2008 food crisis, including biofuels investments, commodity speculation and stagnant productivity in sub-Saharan Africa, still exist and that another food crisis may happen.
The situation is very different in that the cereal harvest this year will be the third largest on record, Mr. Diouf said. There has also been a bumper crop of rice. Still, the turbulence in prices over the past two years, which contributed to riots partly over food in Mozambique last month, is likely a sign that volatility will increase in the future. ''If it persists, it will create an additional obstacle to reduce hunger,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Shares Dip Slightly Despite an Uptick in Retail Sales

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks changed little Tuesday even though promising data from the retail sector fed optimism that the economic recovery was slowly proceeding.
Data showed that retail sales in the United States rose in August for the largest gain in five months. Best Buy also reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its outlook. The news helped lead the Standard & Poor's retail index up 1.2 percent.
After a seesaw session, however, share prices ended mostly lower. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 17.64 points, or 0.17 percent, to 10,526.49. The S.& P. 500-stock index fell 0.80 points, or 0.07 percent, to 1,121.10. The Nasdaq composite index gained 4.06 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,289.77. 
Chip makers led the technology sector higher, with the semiconductor index up 1.7 percent.
Volume was light with about 7.2 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, well below last year's estimated daily average of 9.65 billion.
Gains for the S.& P. 500-stock index were capped as financial shares gave back recent gains leading up to the so-called Basel III rules, which will set new capital regulations for banks.
After hitting an eight-month low on Aug. 30, the KBW bank index rose nearly 12 percent leading into the Basel announcement last weekend before falling 1.4 percent on Tuesday.
JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said in an investor presentation that the new capital rules were expected to increase bank loan prices for customers and may drive some to seek financing from nonbank institutions. The bank's shares slipped 1 percent, to $40.72.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 19/32, to 99 17/32. The yield fell to 2.68 percent, down from 2.75 percent late Monday.
Helping sentiment Tuesday was a further decline in the dollar against the euro and pound, which might indicate investors were turning away from safe-haven assets. Gold, however, rose $22.55, to $1,268.15 an ounce.
Still, the latest economic data led the markets higher earlier in the day. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.4 percent last month after a revised 0.3 percent gain in July. It was the second consecutive month of gains in retail sales, a measure of consumer health. July sales had been previously reported to have increased 0.4 percent.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.3 percent increase; compared with August a year ago, sales were 3.6 percent higher.
Sales of clothing and clothing accessories increased 1.2 percent. Core retail sales, which exclude autos, gasoline and building materials, rose 0.5 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in July. Core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's gross domestic product report.
Data so far for August, including private payrolls and manufacturing, has pointed to a tentative improvement in the economy after a soft patch.
In another report, business inventories in July posted their largest increase in two years, as sales rebounded strongly, the Commerce Department said.
Inventories rose 1 percent, to $1.38 trillion, the highest level since May 2009, after increasing by a revised 0.5 percent in June. July's percentage increase was the largest since July 2008. Markets had expected July inventories to rise 0.5 percent from a previously reported 0.3 percent increase in June.
Inventories play an important role in any changes to the gross domestic product over the business cycle. Investments in inventories helped drive growth during the early part of the recent economic recovery.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Newcomer, in Jolt, Wins Governor's Primary

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and MICHAEL BARBARO; David W. Chen, Nicholas Confessore and Raymond Hernandez contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Carl P. Paladino, a Buffalo multimillionaire who jolted the Republican Party with his bluster and belligerence, rode a wave of disgust with Albany to the nomination for governor of New York on Tuesday, toppling Rick A. Lazio, a former congressman who earned establishment support but inspired little popular enthusiasm.
Mr. Paladino became one of the first Tea Party candidates to win a Republican primary for governor, in a state where the Republican Party has historically succeeded by choosing moderates.
The result was a potentially destabilizing blow for New York Republicans. It put at the top of the party's ticket a volatile newcomer who has forwarded e-mails to friends containing racist jokes and pornographic images, espoused turning prisons into dormitories where welfare recipients could be given classes on hygiene, and defended an ally's comparison of the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who is Jewish, to ''an Antichrist or a Hitler.''
Yet Mr. Paladino, 64, energized Tea Party advocates and social conservatives with white-hot rhetoric and a damn-the-establishment attitude, promising to ''take a baseball bat to Albany'' to dislodge the state's entrenched political class. He also outspent Mr. Lazio, pouring more than $3 million of his fortune into the race, while Mr. Lazio spent just over $2 million. 
''We are mad as hell,'' Mr. Paladino said in a halting but exuberant victory speech in Buffalo shortly after 11 p.m. ''New Yorkers are fed up. Tonight the ruling class knows. They have seen it now. There is a people's revolution. The people have had enough.''
Referring to criticism from what he said were liberal elites, he added: ''They say I am too blunt. Well, I am, and I don't apologize for it. They say I am an angry man, and that's true. We are all angry.''
Mr. Paladino, a first-time candidate who roamed the state with a pit bull named Duke and stayed late after campaign events to hug supporters, swamped Mr. Lazio by a ratio of nearly two to one, lifted by strong showings in Erie and Niagara Counties, where his message of economic populism was especially resonant.
His defeat of Mr. Lazio, 52, raises the possibility of a lopsided general election contest with Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, who has amassed a $24 million war chest and whose commanding lead in the polls has lent him an air of invincibility.
Still, Mr. Paladino's unpredictability and devil-may-care approach to campaigning, coupled with his willingness to say almost anything and to spend millions from his fortune, could pose unwelcome challenges for the exceptionally risk-averse Mr. Cuomo.
Mr. Paladino's platform calls for cutting taxes by 10 percent in six months, eliminating cherished public pensions for legislators, and using eminent domain to prevent the construction of a mosque and community center near ground zero. Those proposals could make Mr. Cuomo's farthest-reaching reform ideas seem meek by comparison.
The sweeping agenda caught fire with Republicans, especially those far from New York City and distrustful of the party's moderate wing.
''Grass-roots conservatives were energized in tidal wave proportions,'' said former Representative Thomas M. Reynolds of New York, an influential leader in the state party. But more moderate Republicans said they feared that Mr. Paladino's rhetoric could alienate swing voters and independents, and doom other Republican candidates in November.
At Mr. Lazio's election-night gathering, just after Mr. Paladino's victory was declared on television, gloom filled the room.
''We just handed him the governorship,'' said Bryan Cooper, 43, a teacher and a Republican district leader from Manhattan. ''We handed Cuomo the governorship.''
The victory capped a topsy-turvy race in which the Republican state chairman, Edward F. Cox, doubting Mr. Lazio's chances, tried to recruit a Democrat to carry the party's banner, but then found himself outflanked by an insurgent whom he and much of the party's leadership had denounced.
A businessman who made millions in real estate in the Buffalo area, Mr. Paladino entered the race in April and mustered only 8 percent of the party's support at its convention in May, after reports of his e-mails drew condemnation from Republican and Democratic leaders alike.
But with Roger J. Stone Jr., the flamboyant former Nixon operative, advising him, he circumvented the party leadership, petitioned his way onto the primary ballot by collecting 30,000 signatures and quietly cobbled together a coalition of disaffected groups.
Mr. Lazio, resting on double-digit leads in polls, refused to debate Mr. Paladino, seeing no gain in giving him the exposure.
''It was a clear mistake not to engage Paladino,'' said John J. Faso, the Republican nominee for governor in 2006. ''He allowed Carl Paladino to speak to the voters in 30-second ads.''
Mr. Paladino unleashed a barrage of direct-mail advertisements and cable television commercials, pouring $650,000 into his campaign the first week of September, and by the weekend, one poll showed the race in a dead heat. Mr. Lazio and his allies responded with last-minute attacks on Mr. Paladino's fitness to be governor, but by Tuesday many party insiders were wringing their hands over whether Mr. Lazio had erred by not doing more to counter Mr. Paladino earlier on.
Both candidates mounted all-out efforts to get their supporters to the polls, with Mr. Paladino relying on a huge turnout upstate.
In Orchard Park, a Buffalo suburb, Darryl Radt, who described himself as a regular primary voter, said he had come to the American Legion post to vote for Mr. Paladino ''because he's mad as hell and so am I.''
Ron Wojcik, 67, a retiree, said he was frustrated with Albany and Washington and wanted someone different. ''I want somebody who's honest and hasn't been sucked into the system already,'' Mr. Wojcik said. ''The system always seems to change people.''
It is not clear how quickly, if at all, Republicans will unite around Mr. Paladino. In his concession speech, Mr. Lazio, who won the nomination of the smaller but influential Conservative Party on Tuesday, fell short of embracing Mr. Paladino's candidacy.
''I am going to be part of the public dialogue,'' Mr. Lazio said as some in the crowd fought back tears. ''I am going to contribute to this effort.''
Democrats on Tuesday night were already discussing ways to exploit Mr. Paladino's vulnerabilities, and they questioned whether he could truly call himself an outsider. They noted that he was a landlord for state agencies and had poured tens of thousands of dollars into the campaigns of Democrats and Republicans in Albany.
In his victory speech, Mr. Paladino alluded to the uphill climb he faces in taking on Mr. Cuomo and repairing the state's battered finances.
''Tomorrow morning begins the toughest part of this campaign, the longest haul, the heaviest lift, and I am going to need every single one of you,'' he said to a room that was a sea of orange, his campaign's color. ''We are going to have to work harder and fight harder than we have ever fought before. We are going to rebuild New York together.''
He demanded that Mr. Cuomo meet him as an equal. ''I have a message for Andrew Cuomo tonight,'' Mr. Paladino said. ''I challenge you to a series of debates. We have so many questions to ask you, Andrew.
''Let's stand toe to toe in an exchange of ideas and let the people decide.''
With that, Mr. Paladino's daughter Danielle took the microphone and led the crowd in singing ''God Bless America.''

HEADLINE: Credit Suisse to Acquire Stake in Hedge Fund

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Credit Suisse agreed Tuesday to buy a minority stake in the hedge fund York Capital Management for $425 million. The bank, Switzerland's second largest after UBS, will acquire a one-third stake in York, which manages about $14 billion in assets, according to people with direct knowledge of the deal who were not authorized to speak publicly. 
The move comes as Wall Street firms wrestle with new federal laws aimed at preventing banks from making risky bets with their own money. The new regulations, including the so-called Volcker Rule, limit how much money banks can place in riskier investments like private equity and hedge funds. By structuring the deal as a noncontrol, minority stake in York, whose management team will continue to operate the business independently, Credit Suisse will comply with the new legislation. The investment ''is consistent with the recently enacted U.S. financial reforms,'' the bank said in a statement. Credit Suisse also said that it would not invest its own money into York's funds, though it would market the funds to its clients. Credit Suisse's asset-management group, led by Rob Shafir, has done a number deals in which it has taken stakes in outside investment firms. The bank has a majority interest in Hedging-Griffo, a large Brazilian asset-management firm. It also owns a stake in Global Infrastructure Partners, a private equity firm that invests in infrastructure deals. United States banks have taken different approaches to their investments in hedge funds and private equity firms. Morgan Stanley is considering spinning off a hedge fund, FrontPoint Partners, that it acquired in 2006. It also holds minority stakes in Avenue Capital, Lansdowne Partners and Traxis Partners. A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman declined to comment. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said at an industry conference on Tuesday that the banking company planned to keep Highbridge Capital Management, a hedge fund with $21 billion in assets under management, as well as One Equity Partners, a private equity unit that manages about $8 billion in assets. And Goldman Sachs sponsors an investment vehicle, Petershill Fund, that takes minority stakes in hedge funds. York was founded with just $5 million in equity capital in 1991 by Jamie Dinan, a former investment banker who is sometimes confused with Mr. Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. York helped pioneer a strategy called ''event-driven investing,'' which grew out of the arbitrage funds of the late 1980s that placed big bets on mergers. York's investments include wagers on the outcome of deals as well as stakes in distressed investments. The firm has performed well during most of its existence, though like many rivals, it suffered during the financial crisis. It reported a 26.4 percent loss in its flagship Multi-Strategy Fund in 2008, according to a letter to investors. It bounced back the next year, reporting a 39.7 percent gain in 2009, according to Hedge Fund Research. York's success has made its founder very wealthy. In 2004, Mr. Dinan paid $21 million for a Fifth Avenue apartment sold by L. Dennis Kozlowski, the fallen former chief executive of Tyco International. Mr. Dinan also owns a horse farm in North Salem, N.Y., about 60 miles northeast of New York City. Under the terms of the Credit Suisse deal, York could receive additional ''earn-out'' payments based on its five-year financial performance. Mr. Dinan and several other principals of the firm also signed retention agreements with Credit Suisse. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Power to the (Blogging) People

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Beijing
This moment was inevitable. Ever since China began to shuck off communism and turn itself into a global economic power, its leaders have followed the strategy of a ''peaceful rise'' -- be modest, act prudently, don't frighten the neighbors and certainly don't galvanize any coalition against us. But in recent years, with the U.S. economic model having suffered an embarrassing self-inflicted shock, and the ''Beijing Consensus'' humming along, voices have emerged in China saying ''the future belongs to us'' and maybe we should let the world, or at least the 'hood, know that a little more affirmatively. For now, those voices come largely from retired generals and edgy bloggers -- and the Chinese leadership has remained cautious. But a diplomatic spat this past summer has China's neighbors, not to mention Washington, wondering for how long China will keep up the gentle giant act. With an estimated 70 million bloggers, China's leaders are under constant pressure now to be more assertive by a populist- and nationalist-leaning blogosphere, which, in the absence of democratic elections, is becoming the de facto voice of the people. 
The diplomatic fracas was a session of the regional forum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, held July 23 in Hanoi. In attendance were foreign ministers of the 10 Asean members, as well as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and China's foreign minister, Yang Jiechi. According one of the diplomats who sat in on the meeting, the Asean ministers took turns subtly but firmly cautioning China to back off from its decision to claim ''indisputable sovereignty'' over the whole resource-rich South China Sea, which stretches from Singapore to the Strait of Taiwan over to Vietnam and carries about half the world's merchant cargo each year. Its seabed is also believed to hold major reserves of oil and gas, and lately China's Navy has become more aggressive in seizing fishing boats alleged to have infringed on its sovereignty there. China also has been embroiled in maritime disputes with South Korea and Japan.
As one minister after another got up at the Asean meeting to assert claims in the South China Sea or argue that any territorial disputes must be resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law, the Chinese foreign minister grew increasingly agitated, according to a participant. And after Mrs. Clinton spoke and insisted that the South China Sea was an area where America had ''a national interest'' in ''freedom of navigation,'' the Chinese foreign minister asked for a brief adjournment and then weighed in.
Speaking without a text, Yang went on for 25 minutes, insisting that this was a bilateral issue, not one between China and Asean. He looked across the room at Mrs. Clinton through much of his stem-winder, which included the observation that ''China is a big country'' and most of the other Asean members ''are small countries,'' The Washington Post reported. The consensus in the room, the diplomat said, was that the Chinese minister was trying to intimidate the group and separate the territorial claimants from the nonclaimants so that there could be no Asean collective action and each country would have to negotiate with China separately.
As negative feedback from the Yang lecture rippled back to Beijing, China's leaders seemed to play down the affair for fear that after a decade of declining U.S. influence in the region they were about to drive all their neighbors back into America's embrace.
How much China's leaders will be able to cool it, though, will depend, in part, on a third party: the Chinese blogosphere, where a whole generation of Chinese schooled by the government on the notion that the U.S. and the West want to keep China down, now have their own megaphones to denounce any Chinese official who compromises too much as ''pro-American'' or ''a traitor.''
Interestingly, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing has begun to reach out to that same blogosphere -- even inviting bloggers to travel in the car with the U.S. ambassador, Jon Huntsman, and interview him when he visits their Chinese province -- to get America's message out without filtering by China's state-run media.
''China for the first time has a public sphere to discuss everything affecting Chinese citizens,'' explained Hu Yong, a blogosphere expert at Peking University. ''Under traditional media, only elite people had a voice, but the Internet changed that.'' He added, ''We now have a transnational media. It is the whole society talking, so people from various regions of China can discuss now when something happens in a remote village -- and the news spreads everywhere.'' But this Internet world ''is more populist and nationalistic,'' he continued. ''Many years of education that our enemies are trying to keep us down has produced a whole generation of young people whose thinking is like this, and they now have a whole Internet to express it.''
Watch this space. The days when Nixon and Mao could manage this relationship in secret are long gone. There are a lot of unstable chemicals at work out here today, and so many more players with the power to inflame or calm U.S.-China relations. Or to paraphrase Princess Diana, there are three of us in this marriage.

HEADLINE: In the Form of a Study, a Salvo From the Left Questions Obama's Trade Goals

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration has set a goal of doubling American exports over five years, and has called on Congress to eventually ratify free-trade agreements that were negotiated by the Bush administration with South Korea, Colombia and Panama.
But a report by a group that is skeptical of trade liberalization questions whether the first goal requires the second. The group, Public Citizen, will release a study Wednesday saying that in the last 12 years, exports to the 17 countries with which the United States has free-trade agreements grew at a slightly slower pace than exports to other countries. 
Public Citizen, a left-leaning group that is critical of globalization, also found that last year, when trade fell worldwide in response to the financial crisis, American exports to free-trade partners shrank at a slightly higher rate than exports to other nations. And free-trade deals, moreover, have helped exacerbate the nation's overall trade deficit, a major source of global economic imbalance.
The report is largely a response to arguments made by the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, two powerful business groups, that believe the free-trade agreements are crucial to the success of President Obama's National Export Initiative.
The extent to which the two goals are linked is a timely topic, as members of the President's Export Council, an advisory committee on trade, are scheduled to meet Thursday. The panel is led by W. James McNerney Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Boeing, and is to deliver recommendations on how to achieve the export goals Mr. Obama laid out in January.
Robert Z. Lawrence, professor of international trade and investment at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that many factors drive export growth, not just free-trade agreements. But he also said that trade agreements that lower tariffs and other trade barriers promote exports as a matter of course.
Arguments on both sides that rely on historical data should be treated with caution, said Mr. Lawrence, who was a member of President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, because it is difficult to isolate the effects of free-trade agreements on export levels, leaving aside other factors.
For example, exports from the United States to Canada increased sharply for about six years after the two countries completed a 1988 trade accord. But the North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect in 1994, did not have an identical effect on American trade with Mexico, in large part because of that country's currency crisis later the same year.
Mr. Obama has directed the United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, to resolve outstanding concerns about a free-trade agreement with South Korea before leaders of the Group of 20 nations meet in Seoul, South Korea, in November. That deal has languished primarily because of American concerns over nontariff barriers in South Korea to American automobiles as well as different concerns by both countries about American beef exports to South Korea.
Mr. Obama has similarly pledged to move forward on pending agreements with Colombia and Panama, though he has not set out a specific time frame. The stumbling blocks include concerns over violence against union organizers in Colombia, and over labor and tax rules in Panama.
But the fundamental political division over free trade is an age-old one: even if trade liberalization has a net benefit for the American economy, it can have vastly disproportionate effects, particularly for workers whose jobs are displaced. For that reason, Mr. Lawrence predicted that Congress would not act on the agreements until next year at the soonest.
Jeffrey J. Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and formerly a longtime trade negotiator for the United States, said that labor unions and groups like Public Citizen were correct that there was not enough of a safety net for workers.
''A lot of opponents to free-trade agreements are not necessarily opposing trade but rather the placement of such a large burden of adjustment on the worker, and that's a legitimate complaint,'' he said. ''Blocking trade or imposing protectionism is not the answer. But neither party has been willing to come up with the types of programs that would create a better balance.''
Carol J. Guthrie, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kirk, said exports of goods had ''grown by leaps and bounds since January'' and that the growth had been led by shipments to countries with which the United States has free-trade agreements, or F.T.A.'s.
''American goods exports to F.T.A. partner countries increased by nearly 27 percent from January through July, compared to a still-excellent 20 percent export growth to non-F.T.A. partners,'' she said.
A spokesman for the National Association of Manufacturers said the group believed that free-trade agreements were necessary but not sufficient for achieving the goal of doubling exports. The government should do a better job promoting exports, making financing for exports available, lowering export controls and successfully concluding the long-delayed Doha round of world trade talks, he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Retail Sales and Business Inventories Top Forecasts

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Two economic indicators -- business inventories and retail sales -- both topped forecasts in government reports released Tuesday.
In one report, business inventories in July posted their largest increase in two years, as sales rebounded strongly, the Commerce Department said 
Inventories rose 1 percent to $1.38 trillion, the highest level since May 2009, after increasing by a revised 0.5 percent in June. July's percentage increase was the largest since July 2008. Markets had expected July inventories to rise 0.5 percent from a previously reported 0.3 percent increase in June.
Inventories are a crucial component of changes in the gross domestic product over the business cycle. Investments in inventories were a chief factor to growth during the early part of the recovery from the worst downturn since the Great Depression.
The increase from the rebuilding of merchandise stock is, however, fading and a small contribution from inventories contributed to a sharp slowdown in growth in the second quarter. But the trend in July, if sustained, could see inventories making a significant contribution to G.D.P. growth in the third quarter.
In July, business sales increased 0.7 percent, the largest gain since March, to $1.09 trillion in July after declining 0.5 percent in June.
The inventory-to-sales ratio, which measures how long it would take to clear shelves at the current sales pace, was unchanged at 1.26 months' worth.
In the other report, sales at American retailers in August increased slightly more than expected, notching their largest gain in five months on strong receipts at gasoline stations and clothing outlets.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.4 percent last month after a revised 0.3 percent gain in July. It was the second consecutive month of gains in retail sales, which are a measure of consumer health. July sales had been previously reported to have increased 0.4 percent.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.3 percent increase; compared with August a year ago, sales were 3.6 percent higher.
Data so far for August, including private payrolls and manufacturing, have pointed to a tentative improvement in the economy after a soft patch.
The recovery from the worst recession since the 1930s has cooled as the benefits from an $814 billion government stimulus package fade and unemployment remains stubbornly high.
Last month, motor vehicle and parts purchases fell 0.7 percent after increasing 1 percent in July. Excluding autos, sales increased by a bigger-than-expected 0.6 percent in August, also the largest increase since March, after a 0.1 percent gain the prior month. Markets had expected sales excluding autos to increase 0.3 percent in August.
Receipts at gasoline stations increased 1.9 percent after a 2.2 percent gain in July. Building materials and garden equipment sales were unchanged after falling 0.4 percent in July, suggesting some stability after sharp declines following the end of a popular homebuyer tax credit in April. Clothing and clothing accessories sales increased 1.2 percent. Core retail sales, which exclude autos, gasoline and building materials, rose 0.5 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in July. Core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's gross domestic product report.
Receipts at sporting goods, hobby and book stores rebounded 0.9 percent in August. Purchases at electronics and appliance stores fell 1.1 percent.

HEADLINE: An All-Around Talent, Obscured by His Pedigree

BYLINE: By CHUCK CULPEPPER; Jonathan Abrams contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PALO ALTO, Calif. -- For all its feverish recruiting, televised ubiquity and legions of self-proclaimed junkies eyeballing talent, the art of assessing a basketball player somehow retains some mystery, a notion upheld in the offbeat case of Jeremy Lin, a 22-year-old N.B.A. signee.
A little-known 6-foot-3 point guard, Lin wowed an N.B.A. summer league crowd by upstaging the league's No. 1 draft choice. He signed a two-year contract with the Golden State Warriors and is edging toward becoming Harvard's first N.B.A. player in more than 50 years. Lin has also become a star among Asian-American fans in the Bay Area.
''Very humbling,'' he said. 
His eight-year route to this place stands out mostly for its obstacles. Even as Lin steered Palo Alto High School to a 2006 state title, he received no N.C.A.A. Division I scholarship offers. Even after he snared national award nominations while playing for Harvard, his name went unspoken on N.B.A. draft night.
Lin was overlooked by talent evaluators, possibly because of scouting methodology, his ethnicity and his Ivy League roots.
Peter Diepenbrock, his high school coach, said Lin's cumulative talents had long been overlooked, eluding harried college coaches catching only snippets of him on videotape.
Those skills include a rare court sense and a Ph.D.-level reading of screens. Diepenbrock's compliments included, ''He knows exactly what needs to be done at every point in the basketball game,'' ''He's able to exert his will on basketball games in ways you would not expect,'' and ''It's just hard to quantify his fearlessness.''
Lin's Palo Alto teammate Kheaton Scott's recalled, ''It was kind of crazy how well he knew the game.''
''He always knew how the defense was set up and where the weak spots were,'' Scott added.
Larry Riley, the Warriors' general manager, eventually came to appreciate Lin's court presence. ''He has that special feel for the game as a point guard,'' he said.
In elementary school, Lin said, ''I was a punk.'' As a 5-3 high school freshman and ace student, he memorably said, ''I'm not here for the science department.''
Lin has appealed mostly to the inveterate observer.
There was a time when Lin was on the junior varsity that Diepenbrock marveled that a 13-year-old would implore teammates, ''There's a double screen!'' There was the state championship game against powerful Mater Dei when, in the waning seconds, Lin dribbled toward a screen, calmly retreated and restarted a play that ended in his clinching layup. There was the state tournament game when his Palo Alto teammates looked listless, so Lin uncharacteristically scored 35 points.
He flourished for a school across a boulevard from Stanford University, and while Diepenbrock knew Lin as an indifferent practice player, his game would sprout to the size of the moment.
''Everybody saw,'' Diepenbrock said. ''Everyone knew about him. It was not a case of a hidden guy where we didn't get the word out.''
Yet videotape could not divulge all of his value. ''It wasn't like we were sitting here in 2006 going, 'All the coaches are idiots!' '' Diepenbrock said. He added: ''Should somebody have given him a Division I scholarship? No question.''
Rex Walters, the University of San Francisco coach since 2008 and the most recent Asian-American to play in the N.B.A., said N.C.A.A. recruiting rules that limit coaches' visits to watch players impeded Lin's discovery.
''So a guy like Jeremy that's a player, he's that much harder to watch,'' Walters said. ''Most colleges start recruiting a guy in the first five minutes they see him because he runs really fast, jumps really high, does the quick, easy thing to evaluate.''
Lin also realized it. ''I just think in order for someone to understand my game, they have to watch me more than once, because I'm not going to do anything that's extra flashy or freakishly athletic,'' he said.
At a summer clinic when Lin was in high school, Diepenbrock asked a coach in Harvard gear about Lin and heard, ''We're not interested.''
''Three weeks later, he calls me and says, 'I may have spoken a little too soon,' '' Diepenbrock said.
That coach, Bill Holden, then a Harvard assistant, still stirs gratitude in Lin, for studying his game and for ignoring supposed shortcomings: Palo Alto's modest basketball image and Lin's Taiwanese-American lineage.
''There's no question he was prejudged,'' said Walters, who played seven N.B.A. seasons after being drafted 16th over all by the Nets out of Kansas in 1993. ''You just don't see a lot of Asian kids playing city basketball, playing A.A.U. basketball.''
Experts continued to overlook Lin even as he became the rare player to grace a conference top 10 in scoring, assists, steals, blocked shots, field-goal percentage and free-throw percentage -- savvy in all, flashy in none. A seasoned summer league coach took a while to notice his team thriving with Lin playing. By then, Lin had smacked into another barrier, the slighting of Harvard.
''People always said you wouldn't be able to make it to the N.B.A.,'' he said.
Not since Ed Smith wore a Knicks jersey in 1953-54 has a Harvard graduate played in the N.B.A. So Lin, an economics major, said he was startled during his sophomore season when the new assistant Kenny Blakeney said, ''You have a shot to play in the N.B.A.'' With Blakeney's tutelage, Lin's skills improved and his skin thickened against ethnic slurs.
Still, once Lin finished his heady stint at an unaccustomed position, shooting guard, the N.B.A.'s workout system loomed.
''In none of the N.B.A. tryouts do they play five on five,'' Diepenbrock said. Eight teams invited him to predraft workouts, then he was overlooked through 2 rounds and 60 players chosen.
Lin understood, saying: ''They're skill work, some shooting, and they're one on one or two on two or three on three, and that's not where I excel. I've never played basketball like that.''
After the draft, Dallas General Manager Donnie Nelson invited Lin to play for the Mavericks' summer team. Lin was encouraged because, he said, ''You have teams, plays and referees.''
Through five games at 19 minutes a game, he played creditably. Then, in the final game, Dallas was facing Washington and John Wall, the No. 1 draft choice, when another Mavericks guard was injured.
In the fourth quarter, Lin forced a jump ball with Wall, made a steal, tore a rebound from a 7-footer, hit a 3-pointer and made a rousing spin move that drew a charging call, dredging boos from the crowd. In the days that followed, the phones rang. Lin chose Golden State.
''We evaluated him throughout summer league,'' the Warriors' Riley said. ''All that had to happen was for him to confirm what we already believed.''
Riley dismissed the notion that Lin's signing was a tactic to generate more interest in the team among the Bay Area's large Asian population. But he said he understood that some people would look at it that way.
The Web site JeremyLin.net received 20,000 hits on July 21, the day he signed. And Walters, whose mother is from Japan and whose father is from Illinois, said: ''Now we actually have a true Asian-American, because I'm half-Asian. It's great for the Bay Area. It's great for the Asian community.''
When Lin's agent, Roger Montgomery, phoned with news of a contract offer, Lin woke one napping brother, shouted to another and called his parents.
''I just remember saying, 'I can't believe this!' '' Lin said. ''I was yelling. I was fist pumping. I was screaming.
''I can't remember all that I said, but if you were anywhere near my house, you probably would have heard me.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about Jeremy Lin, the Asian-American basketball player from Harvard who recently signed with the Golden State Warriors, misstated the surname of the Harvard assistant coach who scouted Lin when he was in high school. He is Bill Holden, not Bill Holdren.

HEADLINE: Maloney, Seeking 10th Term In House, Defeats Challenger

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
Beating back an aggressive challenger, United States Representative Carolyn B. Maloney easily won the Democratic Party's nomination on Tuesday, according to early returns in one of the most expensive Congressional primaries this year. 
With about 90 percent of the precincts reporting, Ms. Maloney, 64, had about 81 percent of the vote, while her opponent, Reshma Saujani, 34, a lawyer who has worked with hedge funds, had about 19 percent. The victory makes Ms. Maloney a heavy favorite to win a 10th term in the general election in November.
She will face Ryan Brumberg, the winner of a three-way race for the Republican nomination.
Ms. Maloney spoke to her supporters at the Grand Hyatt New York in Midtown just before 11 p.m. ''You are my luck, and I am nobody's congresswoman but yours,'' she said. ''I remain unbought and unbossed. It was an amazing win.''
Ms. Saujani, who raised more than $1.3 million in her bid to represent the 14th Congressional District, which includes the Upper East Side and parts of Queens, was Ms. Maloney's most serious opposition to date.
The daughter of Indian immigrants who fled Uganda, Ms. Saujani built a coalition of supporters with the help of Steven L. Rattner, a powerful Democratic financier, and Diana L. Taylor, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's longtime companion and the former state superintendent of banking.
But Ms. Maloney was able to raise more than twice as much money as her opponent and had the strong support of labor unions and the Democratic establishment, including President Obama and the state's two United States senators. The Upper East Side was once a Republican stronghold, but first elected Ms. Maloney to office in 1992.
The two Democrats had only minor differences on the issues but frequently traded snipes, repeatedly accusing each other of being too cozy with the financial industry. Both received sizable donations from Wall Street executives.
Ms. Saujani was a lawyer for several hedge funds, and Ms. Maloney is among the wealthiest members of Congress. Many voters in the district work in the financial industry and have bristled at efforts to regulate Wall Street.
Ms. Maloney helped create the financial reform bill that was signed into law this summer, saying it would bring stability to the industry while preventing excessive risks. She is the chairwoman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee and introduced legislation meant to limit the amount of money credit card companies can charge their customers.
Ms. Saujani referred to Ms. Maloney as a ''reliable but mediocre Democrat'' and, in a radio debate, called her a liar.
Several Democrats, including Geraldine A. Ferraro, a former vice presidential candidate, chided Ms. Saujani for not following the traditional political protocol of running for a lower office first. Ms. Saujani has repeatedly said she intends to run in the next election cycle. ''I have always said that the problem is that people feel like politicians lose and then they leave,'' she said.

HEADLINE: To Serve Marketers on Local TV, A Group Updates Its Approach

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE trade association for the local broadcast television business is changing channels, revamping decades of policies and practices to reflect the significant shifts in how members are doing business.
The changes at the Television Bureau of Advertising in New York, to be formally announced on Thursday, are intended to refocus it as a resource for the advertiser clients of the more than 600 stations that are its members. To underscore that shift, the bureau is replacing a longtime slogan, ''Serving America's television stations,'' with a phrase, ''Local media marketing solutions,'' meant to describe what members are offering Madison Avenue on computer and smartphone screens as well as on the screens of TV sets.
The changes even include the bureau's brand. After being known for years as TVB, it is adopting that as its official name. The rebranding echoes a decision by the American Association of Advertising Agencies to adopt a shorthand designation, the Four A's, as its name. 
''We sat down and asked, 'What would TVB be if we created it today?' '' said Steven J. Lanzano, who became president of TVB on Jan. 1.
A goal of the changes, Mr. Lanzano said, is to acknowledge that when it comes to advertising, ''it's no longer just about local spot television'' and to remind marketers that local stations now also have ''digital subchannels, mobile, Web sites and hyperlocal Web sites'' on which they can buy commercial time and ad space.
In another sign of the new emphasis, TVB, which was founded in 1953, is forming an advisory board composed of executives from major advertisers and large media agencies.
Among the advertisers are AT&T, Kellogg, Kraft Foods, Toyota Motor and GlaxoSmithKline.
''As a major advertiser in local media, it's important for us to work with the TVB to develop best-in-class local media options, which TV is for us,'' Chris Schembri, vice president for media services at AT&T in Dallas, wrote in an e-mail.
The rise of ''multiplatform delivery,'' Mr. Schembri said, referring to the proliferation of digital and mobile media beyond television, means that there is ''a need for more consistent metrics'' for advertisers to analyze as they assess their media spending.
The changes being made by TVB ''are necessary to keep up with the ever-changing local TV space,'' he added.
Among the agencies represented on the advisory board are Horizon Media, MEC and Starcom.
''I think the board is a good idea because it gives agencies, as well as our clients that use local television, the opportunity to collaborate with our trading partners at local TV stations,'' Kevin Gallagher, executive vice president and director for local activation at Starcom USA in Chicago, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group division of the Publicis Groupe, wrote in an e-mail.
Members of the board ''can help prioritize issues and offer our perspective,'' he added, on subjects like ''audience measurement, digital opportunities and the evolution of the medium.''
Another signal of the changes is the formation by TVB of a business development team to work with local and national advertisers on ''building business through the best local television platforms for them,'' Mr. Lanzano said.
The team will be led by Scott Roskowski, who joined the bureau in June as senior vice president for marketing after working on marketing, operations and business development for networks like Univision and Wild TV.
''TVB is going to be the marketing agent of the TV stations,'' said Abby Auerbach, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the bureau, whether they deliver programming and advertising on television, on the Internet or through mobile devices.
That message is to be reinforced by content being developed for the bureau's Web site, which is to get a makeover in mid-October, Ms. Auerbach said. For instance, the home page of the site will promote local TV as ''engaging consumers on the air, online and on the go.''
The Web site will also get new sections devoted to media planning and buying; profiles of 210 local markets; and information about member stations and companies that own multiple stations.
Mr. Lanzano is to discuss the changes at an annual TVB conference, to be held on Thursday at the Time & Life Building in Midtown Manhattan. The event, formerly called the Forecast Conference, is now the Forward Conference, and will cover subjects like the economy, digital media and the health of important advertising categories.
The changes the bureau is making come with a rising tide of money, as local TV ad revenue has been growing after a terrible 2009.
Spending by advertisers on spot, or local, television rose 25.1 percent in the first half of 2010 compared with a year earlier, according to a report released on Monday by the Kantar Media unit of WPP. That was by far the largest percentage gain for any type of media during the first six months.
Contributing to the increase were rebounds in ad spending by automakers and retailers, Kantar reported, along with an upturn in political advertising.
The consulting company BIA/Kelsey said on Tuesday that local ad spending was growing slightly faster this year than had been estimated. As a result, the company is revising upward its prediction of how local ad spending will fare in 2010; instead of a decline of 0.95 percent compared with 2009, BIA/Kelsey now forecasts a gain of 2.1 percent.

HEADLINE: North Korea Wants to Make a Deal

BYLINE: By JIMMY CARTER. 
Jimmy Carter, the 39th president, is the founder of the Carter Center and the winner of the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize.

 BODY:
Atlanta
DURING my recent travels to North Korea and China, I received clear, strong signals that Pyongyang wants to restart negotiations on a comprehensive peace treaty with the United States and South Korea and on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
The components of such an agreement have been fairly constant over the past 16 years, first confirmed in 1994 by the United States and Kim Il-sung, then the North Korean leader, and repeated by a multilateral agreement negotiated in September 2005. 
The basic provisions hold that North Korea's old graphite-moderated nuclear energy reactor, which can easily produce weapons-grade plutonium, and all related facilities and products should be disabled under inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency; that while the reactor is shut down, the United States should provide fuel oil or electric power to North Korea until new power plants are built; that the United States should provide assurances against the threat of nuclear attack or other military actions against North Korea; that the United States and North Korea should move toward the normalization of political and economic relations and a peace treaty covering the peninsula; that better relations should be pursued by North Korea, South Korea and Japan; and that all parties should strengthen their economic cooperation on energy, trade and investment.
The comprehensive agreement reached by the Clinton administration was disavowed in 2002 by President George W. Bush. Nevertheless, although North Korea reprocessed fuel rods into plutonium and tested nuclear explosives in 2006, good progress was made in its talks with the United States, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia.
But conditions have since deteriorated: the talks stopped in 2009, and that same year the United Nations imposed sanctions on Pyongyang after it conducted a second nuclear test and launched a long-range missile. North Korea also prohibited reunions between North and South Korean families.
Tensions grew still higher this year when North Korea detained an American, Aijalon Gomes, whom it accused of crossing into its territory, in January and a South Korean fishing crew in August.
However, there are now clear signals of eagerness from Pyongyang to resume negotiations and accept the basic provisions of the denuclearization and peace efforts.
In July, North Korean officials invited me to come to Pyongyang to meet with Kim Jong-il, the North Korean leader, and other officials to secure the release of Mr. Gomes. Those who invited me said that no one else's request for the prisoner's release would be honored. They wanted me to come in the hope that I might help resurrect the agreements on denuclearization and peace that were the last official acts of Kim Il-sung before his death in 1994.
I notified the White House of this invitation, and approval for my visit was given in mid-August, after North Korea announced that Mr. Gomes would soon be transferred from his hospital back to prison and that Kim Jong-il was no longer available to meet with me. (I later learned that he would be in China.)
In Pyongyang I requested Mr. Gomes's freedom, then had to wait 36 hours for his retrial, pardon and release. During this time I met with Kim Yong-nam, president of the presidium of the North's Parliament, and Kim Kye-gwan, the vice foreign minister and chief negotiator for North Korea in the six-party nuclear talks. Both of them had participated in my previous negotiations with Kim Il-sung.
They understood that I had no official status and could not speak for the American government, so I listened to their proposals, asked questions and, when I returned to the United States, delivered their message to Washington.
They told me they wanted to expand on the good relationships that had developed earlier in the decade with South Korea's president at the time, Kim Dae-jung, and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan.
They expressed concern about several recent American actions, including unwarranted sanctions, ostentatious inclusion of North Korea among nations subject to nuclear attack and provocative military maneuvers with South Korea.
Still, they said, they were ready to demonstrate their desire for peace and denuclearization. They referred to the six-party talks as being ''sentenced to death but not yet executed.''
The following week I traveled to Beijing, where Chinese leaders informed me that Mr. Kim had delivered the same points to them while I was in Pyongyang, and that he later released the South Korean fishing crew and suggested the resumption of family reunions. Seeing this as a clear sign of North Korean interest, the Chinese are actively promoting the resumption of the six-party talks.
A settlement on the Korean Peninsula is crucial to peace and stability in Asia, and it is long overdue. These positive messages from North Korea should be pursued aggressively and without delay, with each step in the process carefully and thoroughly confirmed.

HEADLINE: Wall St.'s September Rally Continues

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks overcame an early slide Wednesday and closed higher as investors kept a September rally alive.
Major indexes opened lower after a poor reading on factory activity in New York, but turned higher around midday after getting better news on industrial production. That report showed that the national industrial sector rose modestly in August. 
Even though September is historically a weak period for the market, better news on manufacturing has propelled stocks higher on nine out of the last 11 days. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 5.6 percent over that time.
On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 46.24 points, or 0.44 percent, to 10,572.73. It was the index's highest close since Aug. 10. The Dow industrials are up 1.39 percent so far this year.
Broader indexes also rose. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 3.97 points, or 0.35 percent, to 1,125.07, and the Nasdaq composite index increased 11.55 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,301.32.
In corporate news, the credit card company MasterCard gained $10.43, or 5.22 percent, to $210.18, after saying it expected its income to rise at least 20 percent this year.
The food conglomerate Kraft Foods jumped 53 cents, or 1.72 percent, to $31.58, after saying its earnings would jump 9 percent to 11 percent over the next three years because of growth in developing markets.
Traders focused on the industrial production report on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve said that output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities edged up 0.2 percent last month. It rose 0.6 percent in July.
Production rose for basic consumer goods, like food, clothing and paper, by more than 1 percent. Factories produced 0.7 percent more business equipment in August.
Manufacturing has helped drive economic expansion over the last year. Companies built up their stockpiles in the first half of the year after slashing them during the recession. But factory output has slowed in recent months. Businesses are no longer rebuilding their inventories. At the same time, demand for goods remains weak because consumers are saving more and spending with caution.
''Consumers have failed to take up the baton,'' said Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Also, on Wednesday the Empire State Manufacturing Survey Index, which measured activity in the state in September, said growth was below expectations in New York's manufacturing sector but there was growth.
Weak demand will most likely keep economic growth slow through the end of 2010, Mr. Ashworth said. ''The best that can be said is that the economy isn't heading back into recession,'' he said in a research note.
European markets were lower, but the Nikkei in Japan surged 2.34 percent after the country's government stepped in to weaken the yen. The yen had been hitting 15-year highs against the dollar, which makes it harder for Japanese exporters to compete on global markets.
Japan sold an undisclosed amount of yen in foreign exchange markets to weaken the currency, which was threatening to endanger manufacturers like Toyota Motor and Sony that export goods around the world. The dollar rose 2.55 percent against the yen on Wednesday.
The price on the 10-year Treasury note fell 12/32, to 99 5/32. The yield rose to 2.72 percent from 2.68 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Election Assured, Victor Over Espada Will Face a Tough Job in Albany

BYLINE: By SAM DOLNICK; Mick Meenan, Mirela Iverac and Tim Stelloh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A wiry man wearing a Yankees cap and a gold chain did a double-take as he walked up Fordham Road on Wednesday. ''Gustavo Rivera!'' he shouted. ''Congratulations, man!''
Mr. Rivera's Bronx-shaking victory over Pedro Espada Jr., the Senate majority leader, was barely 12 hours old, but running on two hours' sleep, he was out thanking voters as he began a new era as the hero of progressives and insurgents, the unlikely first-time candidate who slew the big dragon.
Mr. Rivera, a 34-year-old political aide and part-time college professor, defeated Mr. Espada nearly two votes to one in a Democratic primary election that sent a clear message calling for change in Albany, where Mr. Espada's long list of scandals had done little to diminish his significant power. 
Mr. Espada, Hiram Monserrate, the disgraced former Queens legislator who lost a bid Tuesday to return to the state capital, and three other incumbent Albany lawmakers were victims of the anti-establishment wave that propelled Carl P. Paladino to a surprise triumph in the Republican primary for governor.
Mr. Espada was also unable to withstand the money and volunteers that flooded his district on Mr. Rivera's behalf, and the barrage of headlines detailing corruption allegations against him.
Mr. Espada did not make himself available on Wednesday to talk about his future. Outside his home in Mamaroneck, in Westchester County, visitors came and went as the curtains on the two-story house remained drawn. (The Bronx district attorney's office is investigating whether that is his primary residence, since it lies outside his district, which would be against the law.)
At Mr. Rivera's victory party late Tuesday night, gushing supporters searched for the right accolades -- he's a fighter, no, he's a major player, no, he's a star.
''He is a giant killer in the biggest victory I have seen in 40 years of politics,'' Councilman G. Oliver Koppell told the crowd.
But even though Mr. Rivera won the primary, which is tantamount to a general election victory in this heavily Democratic district, significant challenges remain. He will be expected to help clean up Albany, a daunting assignment for anyone, let alone a freshman legislator who has never before held elected office. And he will have to combat serious problems in his northwest Bronx district, where some of the city's poorest neighborhoods battle unemployment, housing and obesity issues.
''My job is to make sure that I can live up to these expectations,'' he said in a hurried interview on Wednesday. ''I've always said that we need a Democratic majority that is stable and trustworthy to get anything done in the state. I will work toward that goal.''
Mr. Rivera may not be a seasoned candidate, but he said he would be able to draw upon his years working for elected officials and their campaigns. He worked for State Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, helping her topple Nicholas A. Spano, a 28-year veteran of the Legislature, in 2006. He also worked for Barack Obama's presidential campaign in Florida, and for Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, among others.
''I've been around candidates that have done this before,'' he said. ''This is not new for me.''
Mr. Rivera, who grew up in Puerto Rico, has a stocky build, a shaved head and a goatee that can make him look more like a bouncer than a senator. He possesses little of the plastic finish that many politicians share.
''Gustavo is almost like the perfect anti-Espada because he's so down to earth,'' said Dan Levitan, a spokesman for the Working Families Party, which endorsed him. ''He buys his suits at the Burlington Coat Factory. He rides the 4 train every day. He's a really smart guy who works hard for his community and wants to see change.''
The victory helped the Working Families Party burnish its image as a force in New York politics. But Mr. Rivera had an army of supporters -- elected officials who bucked the incumbent to endorse him and unions that provided cash and volunteers -- and he may have a lot of favors to repay.
Bill Samuels, a technology entrepreneur and Democratic activist, said he put in roughly $280,000 to help Mr. Rivera. Mr. Levitan said the Working Families Party spent roughly $100,000. Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union spent $30,000 on mailings and sent hundreds of volunteers to the district.
''People will feel that he should be beholden to them for this victory and they will reach out to him for support with various things,'' said Costas Panagopoulos, an assistant professor of political science at Fordham University.
But Mr. Rivera did not have time to sort that out on Wednesday. He had to draw up a lesson plan before 6 p.m. when his class would meet at Pace University for the first day of ''Public Opinion, Voting and Campaign Strategy.''
One race sure to be on the curriculum: Gustavo Rivera's defeat of Pedro Espada.

HEADLINE: A Professor's Review of Online Cheat Sheets

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT

 BODY:
At this time of year, students are buying textbooks and looking for ways to avoid reading them.
Nothing is new about that. CliffsNotes guides, with their familiar yellow and black covers, have been in book bags since 1958.
What has changed is how many study guides, or cheat sheets, are available online and on mobile phones. Whether you know them as CliffsNotes, SparkNotes or Shmoop, these seemingly ubiquitous guides are now, in many cases, free.
''Two to three years ago, the wisdom was that students do research online, but not study online,'' said Emily Sawtell, a founder of McGraw-Hill's online collaborative study site called GradeGuru. ''That has changed in the last 12 months.'' Ms. Sawtell said she had tracked a significant increase in the search term ''study guide'' on Google.
Professors warn that these guides are no substitutes for reading great works of literature, but concede, grudgingly, that as an adjunct, they can stimulate thought and deepen insight. 
''The problem is when you use a study guide in place of the original book,'' said Cary Nelson, professor of English at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and president of the American Association of University Professors. ''Then they have knowledge that is not just superficial, but wrong.''
Carl Fisher, chairman of the comparative world literature and classics department at California State University, Long Beach, agreed to review the many offerings, starting with the oldest. CliffsNotes guides cover not only literature, but also foreign languages, math, science, history and other topics, and many of the guides are free online.
In booklet form, 159 literature study guides are available, costing about $6 to $10 each. But more than 250 are available online, and all can be viewed free. Downloading them as PDF files costs $5 to $10 each. A comparatively paltry 39 CliffsNotes for literature are available for mobile at $1.99 each for the iPhone.
CliffsNotes, owned by Wiley Publishing, also offers free podcasts called CramCasts, which are three- to five-minute overviews of books with a plot summary.
''CliffsNotes is one of the most thorough, one of the most insightful,'' Professor Fisher said. ''If a student wanted to use it along with the text, it would be worthwhile.'' He liked that, for some books, the complete text was included with the study guide on line. But CliffsNotes lost points for some dated writing. He looked at notes describing ''Candide'' in terms of Voltaire's life and said: ''No one does biographical criticism anymore. They haven't since the 1970s.''
SparkNotes, which is owned by Barnes & Noble and began in 1999, is a newcomer compared with CliffsNotes, but it is well established with today's students. It offers a library of 690 guides, including literature, math, history and biology, all free on the Web.
Most of the guides are available as e-books for Barnes & Noble's electronic reader, the Nook, or any device that runs Nook software, which is available for BlackBerrys and iPhones, and handsets with Google's Android operating system. The electronic editions of the guides and downloadable PDFs are $4.95. The No Fear Shakespeare series, which offers a modern translation next to the original texts, costs $4.99 for each guide. While those are not available as downloadable PDFs, they are available on iTunes for $4.99 each.
About 150 of the SparkNotes are still available in book form for $4.95 each, and the book form of No Fear Shakespeare costs $5.35.
Professor Fisher said SparkNotes' analysis was more contemporary than that offered on some of the other sites. ''It is a generally useful, more nuanced interpretation than the others. Of all the ones I looked at, I'd probably say SparkNotes is the best choice,'' he said.
Shmoop, though, is the newcomer. It has been online for only 18 months. It has set itself apart from the stalwarts by synopsizing the expected canon, like Camus's ''The Stranger'' and Shakespeare's ''Hamlet,'' as well as by analyzing more contemporary and popular culture works. Among its 600 study guides are guides for best sellers like Stieg Larsson's ''The Girl Who Played With Fire'' and song lyrics like Lady Gaga's ''Paparazzi,'' which it likens to ''The Great Gatsby,'' ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' and ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.'' Though Shmoop says the authors come ''from Ph.D. and masters' programs at Stanford, Harvard, U.C. Berkeley and other top universities'' the site still misspelled the last name of Virginia Woolf, the English author. Guides on topics like civics and economics also are available.
All of the guides are free online. They are also available for 99 cents to $2.99 for the Sony Reader, Kindle and Nook e-readers and iPhone, Android and BlackBerry smartphones using the Nook reader app. Shmoop also sells PDF versions for $5. Study guides for Advanced Placement and college entrance exams are $10 to $25.
Dr. Fisher liked the idea behind Shmoop's ''Why Should I care?'' section. It explains the satire in ''Candide'' by comparing it to modern satires like ''The Simpsons'' and ''The Family Guy.'' The problem, he said, is that the writing strains to relate to students. ''It makes an interesting attempt to be hip,'' he said, ''but it is just so high school-y.''
GradeSaver boasts that a majority of its authors are Ivy League-educated. The site offers more than 400 guides covering literature, poetry and short stories, with two film guides. Professor Fisher said that the writing was among the best. ''It is quite readable, if you can get around the blue jeans ads, which are right in the middle of the text.''
The site specializes in essays. It sells copies of 712 college essays that the site said landed the authors in top colleges. It says it also carries 2,715 literature essays. The essays are available through a subscription ranging from $3 for a three days (subscribers are automatically enrolled in the $7-a-month program unless they cancel), up to a one-time charge of $50 a year. GradeSaver has an editing service as well, with charges ranging from $8 a page for proofreading to $150 to edit an essay of a maximum of 1,000 words within 24 hours.
The site offers a forum site where students post opinions (on ''Call of the Wild:'' ''boring ... zzzzzz!'') and cries for help, (''I NEED HELP**ASAP**ON THE UTOPIAS IN CANDIDE'').
Some sites did not make the grade at all. The guides from PinkMonkey -- ---- which also incorporates notes from TheBestNotes.com and Barron's Booknotes -- were ''the least thoughtful, the least insightful and the most disjointed,'' Dr. Fisher said.
BookRags, offered only partial summaries free, and Professor Fisher said what he found there was too elementary. ''BookRags is for really desperate people,'' he said. ''It's simplistic and it forces people to pay up front.'' He found the quality of the writing on Bookwolf offensive. ''They overuse the passive voice, then they have a lot of rhetorical questions. It's banal.''
He advised students to use study guides as additional material to the books. ''Nothing can substitute for the original text,'' he said.
Professor Fisher also had advice for teachers. ''I make my students submit their papers through turnitin.com,'' which is a plagiarism search engine. He says it is very effective at forcing students to offer some original writing, if not some original thought.

HEADLINE: Japan's Move on Yen Lacks Global Support

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI; Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt, and Sewell Chan from Washington.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's decision to intervene in currency markets to weaken the yen and shore up its export-driven economy could be only the first step in a long battle -- one made more difficult because Japan, unable to find support among its trading partners, must go it alone.
Japan moved Wednesday to prop up the United States dollar and weaken the yen, directly manipulating its currency for the first time since 2004. Japanese monetary authorities appeared to have bought dollars and sold yen. That move started a wider market rally that sent the dollar up by about 2.55 percent for the day, to 85.62 yen.
The maneuver by Japan's finance ministry came after the yen had reached 15-year highs in recent weeks, elevated by its status as a haven among risk-averse global investors. The strong yen has hampered Japan's recovery from last year's severe recession by weighing on the competitiveness of its exports, which account for a bulk of the nation's economic growth. 
''We conducted a currency intervention to check excessive volatility in currency markets,'' Yoshihiko Noda, the finance minister, said Wednesday. ''We will continue to watch currency market moves and take decisive steps if necessary, including intervention.''
It is unlikely, though, that intervention by Japan alone will sway currency markets in the long term. The global volume of foreign exchange trading has grown rapidly in recent years, which prevents intervention by a single government from countering bigger market trends.
Other countries are unlikely to help Japan's cause, because they need to keep their own currencies weaker to bolster exports. A weak currency makes a country's exports more competitive and increases the value of overseas earnings.
Much of the yen's weakening came from investors selling the currency on expectations that the Japanese government would be more active in keeping the yen in check. Japan did not disclose how much it had spent in currency transactions, but dealers put the initial amount at 300 billion to 500 billion yen ($3.5 billion to $5.8 billion).
But as Switzerland found this year, a single government's efforts to weaken its currency can prove futile. Switzerland abandoned that effort, after its central bank had lost more than 14 billion Swiss francs ($14 billion) in foreign currency holdings in the first half of the year, after a fall in the euro's value ate into the bank's reserves.
The Swiss franc is also seen by investors as a relative haven and has also strengthened amid global financial unrest. This month, the franc hit a record high against the euro.
''The Japanese authorities need to be aggressive now and hit the market hard, fast and furious, because as time goes on, the announcement effect will dissipate,'' David Bloom, global head of FX Strategy Research, said in a report to clients Wednesday. ''For this to actually work, what is needed is global cooperation.''
The intervention by Japan runs counter to a recent trend among the world's major economies to stay away from market manipulation and let markets decide the strength of their currencies. The United States, for example, has pressured China to stop keeping its currency, the renminbi, artificially weak against the dollar.
Japan's move came after Prime Minister Naoto Kan's victory over a challenger in a partywide ballot on Tuesday. Analysts had initially predicted that the victory by Mr. Kan, who had been less explicit about the need for intervention than his rival, Ichiro Ozawa, would probably not lead to action in currency markets.
Mr. Kan had initially been cautious on outright intervention, opting instead to issue statements hinting at some sort of government action in an attempt to talk down the yen. But Wednesday's action reflected the intense pressure on the prime minister to take more drastic action.
Yoshito Sengoku, the government's top spokesman, indicated Wednesday that the finance ministry -- which orchestrated the intervention -- considers 82 yen to the dollar a benchmark in deciding whether to intervene in markets. The exchange rate had recently neared that point.
He indicated Wednesday that Japanese currency officials were still trying to gauge the reaction of their counterparts in the United States and Europe to the intervention, but he did not disclose any details.
The European Central Bank had no comment on the intervention. European companies, especially German companies, have benefited from the weaker euro, which gives them an advantage over Japanese competitors in the machinery and auto industries.
Natalie Wyeth, a spokeswoman for the United States Treasury, declined to comment on Wednesday.
The intervention drew praise from Japanese exporters. The Nikkei 225 stock average rose 2.3 percent to close at 9,516.56 after losing as much as 1.1 percent earlier.
''We applaud the move by the government and the Bank of Japan to correct the yen's strength,'' Honda Motor, the No. 2 automaker in Japan after Toyota, said in a statement. Tokyo's intervention would have more effect if the Japanese central bank followed with more monetary easing. Such a move would be meant to widen differentials between Japan's rock-bottom interest rates and those of other countries, making holding the yen less attractive for investors and creating more downward pressure on the currency.
Lower interest rates worldwide since the financial crisis -- particularly in the United States, which has engaged in its own rounds of monetary easing -- have reduced the spread, or difference, between Japan's interest rates and those elsewhere. That narrowed gap has changed the habits of investors who for years borrowed yen at low interest rates, then invested in higher-yielding currencies -- a practice that helped to keep the yen weak for much of the last decade.
The Bank of Japan also faces the decision of whether to support the finance ministry's move by letting the money released in the currency transactions continue to circulate -- or whether to counter the move by absorbing the excess money that results from selling the yen. Such a countermove, a measure known as sterilization, would be help keep inflationary side effects in check.
But analysts said they expected the central bank to leave the money in circulation because Japan's sluggish economy was mired in deflation, or the fall in prices, and that any inflation would in fact be a bonus.
And in a statement, Masaaki Shirakawa, the governor of the Bank of Japan, seemed to substantiate that expectation. He said the bank would pursue ''strong monetary easing'' and provide liquidity to financial markets.
The central bank, though, has been averse to what it sees as too much easing, and has been keen to assert its independence from the Japanese government, adding some uncertainty to how effective the intervention will be.
''The biggest question is whether the scale of the intervention will grow and lead Japan into a quagmire,'' said Yasuhide Yajima, senior economist at the NLI Research Institute in Tokyo, ''or whether the yen will weaken enough for Japan to go back to a wait-and-see stance.''

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN: Two Draw Fire From the Right

BYLINE: By BERNIE BECKER

 BODY:
A conservative group that has vowed to play a big role in this year's midterm elections went on the attack Wednesday with television advertisements that knock two Democratic Senate candidates for supporting the economic stimulus package and the health care overhaul. 
The spots from American Crossroads use different scripts against Missouri's Robin Carnahan and Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado. But the commercials certainly have some overlap, with each, for example, showing the targeted candidate literally embracing President Obama.
The Missouri advertisement tries to cast Ms. Carnahan, the secretary of state, as one of ''them'' - them being the president, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader.
A Carnahan spokesman said the advertisement would fail to distract voters from the record that the candidate's Republican opponent, Representative Roy Blunt, has built in Washington.
In Colorado, meanwhile, American Crossroads plays off Mr. Bennet's comment that the country has nothing to show for the national debt.
''Senator, we are outraged you have wasted our money,'' the advertisement's narrator intones.
For his part, Mr. Bennet, who faces the Republican Ken Buck in November, has a new spot that his campaign said would go on the air on Wednesday and touts his business experience. In it, Mr. Bennet says ''the economy should be job one.''
American Crossroads's sibling organization, Crossroads GPS, has previously sponsored advertisements for the Senate contests in Colorado and Missouri. Between them, the two groups - which hope to raise a combined $52 million for this year's election -- have also run spots for the Senate contests in California, Kentucky, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Trade Panel Said to Find Improper Boeing Subsidies

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW and NICOLA CLARK; Nicola Clark reported from Paris and Christopher Drew from New York. James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.

 BODY:
The long-running trans-Atlantic spat over government support of the world's two biggest aircraft makers gained fresh momentum on Wednesday as a trade panel found that Boeing had received subsidies that violated global trade rules, people briefed on the decision said.
American lawmakers said on Wednesday that the subsidies, $5 billion from federal and state agencies, were just a fraction of the $24 billion that Europe had alleged and were far less sweeping than the benefits its rival, Airbus, had received. 
But European leaders said that the finding, by a panel of the World Trade Organization, showed that the United States had also relied on subsidies in the fight for plane sales, and that the ruling would help prompt negotiations to resolve the problems.
The decision is an interim finding and subject to appeal. But it could bring an epic battle over subsidies in the aircraft industry to a climax and redefine the competitive landscape not only for Boeing and Airbus, but also for new competitors in other regions.
In a case decided in June, the W.T.O. found that Airbus had benefited from four decades of improper subsidies to vault past Boeing to become the world's top jet builder.
That ruling concluded that Airbus received the subsidies, including $15 billion in loans from European governments at below-market interest rates and several billion dollars in grants, to produce its six best-selling models. It also concluded that it ''would not have been possible for Airbus to have launched all these models, as originally designed and at the times it did,'' without the subsidies.
Wednesday's ruling came in a countersuit by the European Union, which contended that Boeing had received nearly $24 billion in subsidies since the 1980s from research and development contracts for space and military agencies and in tax breaks from three states.
That assistance, the Europeans argued, had placed Airbus at a competitive disadvantage in the North American market, the world's second-largest in terms of passenger traffic after the Asia-Pacific region.
American and European officials, who spoke anonymously because the ruling was not released publicly, said the W.T.O. panel found that Boeing had received subsidies through some of the research contracts from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Pentagon, as well as through tax incentives linked to its facilities in Washington State, Kansas and Illinois.
Still, the Americans said that only $2.6 billion of the research money was found to involve subsidies, compared with the more than $10 billion claimed by the European Union. And the trade panel pegged the value of the subsidies provided by the three states at about $400 million, a far lower total than the Europeans had claimed.
European officials said the report did not estimate the value of the subsidies that Boeing gained from its military work. Both sides said the panel reiterated an earlier finding that Boeing had received $2.2 billion in export-related aid under a program that was phased out in 2006.
Trade officials said the report was more than 1,000 pages, and it was not immediately clear how the panel had decided which research contracts constituted subsidies.
European officials had contended in their suit that Boeing was able to take advantage of its research for NASA and the Pentagon to make technological advances in its commercial jets.
As a result, France's transport minister, Dominique Bussereau, and the French environment minister, Jean-Louis Borloo, said in a statement that they were ''extremely satisfied'' by the interim findings.
But Boeing released a statement Wednesday night saying that the ruling ''amounts to a massive rejection'' of the European case and maintained that Europe's low-interest loans to Airbus, known as launch aid, stand ''as the single largest and most flagrant illegal subsidy in the aerospace industry.''
Some Congressional aides, however, said the panel found that the federal research subsidies gave Boeing an advantage in its early efforts to develop the first commercial jetliner to be made substantially with lightweight carbon composites.
Boeing hopes to ride a wave of orders for the plane it developed, the 787 Dreamliner, to retake the lead from Airbus in overall sales. Airbus scrapped its first design for a rival plane, the A350, and is working on a new version that could hit the market in 2013.
The trade dispute is also playing out while Boeing and Airbus compete for a $35 billion contract to supply the Air Force with new aerial refueling tankers. European officials said they hoped the new ruling would undercut Boeing's complaints that it was facing a subsidized competitor.

HEADLINE: Despite Struggles, Entrepreneurs Find Ways to Give Back

BYLINE: By JIM WITKIN

 BODY:
The economic slowdown that started in 2008 affected just about every aspect of Gumas Advertising's business -- including the company's long-time support for charities in the San Francisco area. ''In good times, we did not have to scrutinize our charitable giving or employee perks,'' said John Gumas, the company's president. ''But in these economic times, we've really had to think through what we could afford to give and still be able to make a difference.''
By the end of 2008, some 60 percent of small-business owners like Mr. Gumas reported that the economic downturn had affected their charitable giving, according to a study whose sponsors included The Chronicle of Philanthropy, a newspaper that covers nonprofit organizations. Tough times have compelled small-business owners like Mr. Gumas to rethink long-held business practices. But many are finding creative ways to continue their support for good causes -- a practice that can have positive side effects. Here are some suggestions based on the experiences of small-business owners.
GIVE TIME AND SERVICES ''We want to give back,'' said Larry O'Toole, founder of Gentle Giant, a moving company based in Massachusetts. ''That's an important part of our company culture.'' 
A depressed housing market has meant less demand for the company's services, which has forced it to cut back on cash donations. But with more down time, said Stephen Coady, the company's marketing manager, it has been able to do more pro bono work. In the spring a local real estate agent approached Gentle Giant about collecting donated medical supplies for victims of the Haiti earthquake. Volunteering its trucks and movers, the company collected supplies like crutches, canes, walkers and wheelchairs -- filling two large moving vans over the course of two months. Gentle Giant turned the supplies over to Partners in Health, a nonprofit group based in Boston that provides medical services to the poor.
Along with supporting a good cause and bolstering employee spirits, providing the pro bono services enabled the company to build connections with important business contacts, like real estate agents, who are a frequent source of referrals. ''We would do this kind of thing anyway,'' Mr. Coady said, ''but you can also use this time to build relationships that you wouldn't have time to cultivate when you are busy.''
Small businesses can help nonprofit organizations in a number of ways that may not seem obvious at first, said Christine Marquez-Hudson, the executive director of Mi Casa Resource Center, a nonprofit human services group that helps Latino families in Denver. For instance, Mi Casa called upon a multicultural marketing agency, The Idea Marketing, to create brochures and other marketing materials. When the firm recognized that Mi Casa would also need a cost-effective way to distribute this material, it helped negotiate discounts with one of its suppliers for printing and bulk mail services. ''They have the clout and volume of business to get these discounts that we couldn't get if we approached the vendor directly,'' Ms. Marquez-Hudson said.
GIVING AND OUTREACH Trevor Dierdorff, owner of Amnet, an information technology company in Colorado Springs, has continued to support the Humane Society and the local Veterans Day parade, but he said, ''we've had to be more selective this year.''
Before the recession, Amnet spent money every year to entertain crucial customers on expensive golf outings. The company also contributed time and money to several local charities. When the economic crunch hit, Mr. Dierdorff looked for creative ways to combine these efforts.
He had been making cash donations to a local charity, but this year saw the opportunity to use his donation to become one of the sponsors of the charity's annual golf tournament. As a result, not only did Amnet gain visibility, but it also received a round in the tournament that Mr. Dierdorff plans to use to entertain clients.
REBUILD EMPLOYEE MORALE While layoffs and shrinking budgets can take a toll on morale, Mr. Gumas said, getting employees involved in pro bono projects can rebuild enthusiasm.
His advertising company has designed marketing brochures, TV commercials, billboards, and print ads for the San Francisco Giants Community Fund, a nonprofit organization that works with underserved youth in the areas of education, health and violence prevention. Mr. Gumas's employees take part in many of the fund's events. ''It gives us all a rallying point,'' he said, ''and as tough as things are, we are reminded how lucky we are compared to the next guy.''
Research has shown that the most successful company-run volunteer programs allow employees to select the causes they support, said Dr. Dwight Burlingame, who is director of academic programs for Indiana University's Center on Philanthropy. Nonetheless, he suggests that you make sure your small business organizes these volunteer days on behalf of the employees. The most effective morale builders, he said, were programs ''organized by the company, especially where there's a company match of time or money and the company provides recognition for the volunteers' efforts.''
TAKE THE TAX BREAK Amnet used to offer a discounted rate on information technology services for nonprofit organizations, a practice that helped the nonprofits without affording Mr. Dierdorff any tax benefits. When the economy worsened, he decided to eliminate the discounted rate for nonprofits. Instead, he now charges the standard rate but then donates the equivalent of the discount back to the organization in cash, which allows him to take the tax deduction.
FIND A PARTNER Joining forces with other organizations can compound your impact. If you belong to a local service club like the Chamber of Commerce, Lions or Rotary, look for ways to partner with them on their outreach efforts.
For example, said Rick Wells, chief executive of the San Rafael Chamber of Commerce in California, if cash is tight, ''the local business can volunteer employee time, help with logistics, or donate products and services which can be given away as raffle prizes.'' Donating products, he noted, can also help the business clear out excess inventory.
Like so many companies, Dairy Specialists, which designs, builds and supplies commercial dairies in Colorado, has had to trim its work force. But when the decline in revenue put a squeeze on the company's long-standing college scholarship program, Robert Brown, the company's chief financial officer, went looking for partners. He found many of the businesses that served the same agricultural community were receptive to donating matching funds. ''If you can't do these things on your own anymore,'' Mr. Brown said, ''look to some of your bigger business partners to help you.''
REVIEW YOUR STRATEGY ''Businesses are bombarded with requests for contributions,'' said Sandra Miniutti, vice president of marketing with Charity Navigator, a nonprofit organization that tracks public charities. ''It's important to have some standards in place.''
This is also a good time to review the strategic purpose of your philanthropy, said Scott Hauge, president of CAL Insurance, a San Francisco-based agency. Developing a philanthropy ''playbook,'' he said, makes it easier for you to stick to your mission and keep it aligned with your business goals.
While many small businesses are learning to do more with less, said Mr. Gumas, giving to good causes will always be the right thing to do. He subscribes to a karmic view of the business cycle. ''When you are doing the right things for the right reasons,'' he said, ''good things will come of it.''

HEADLINE: PATTAYA JOURNAL; A City Known for Sex Tries to Broaden Its Appeal

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

 BODY:
PATTAYA, THAILAND -- Somewhere in the world there may be a city with a more seedy reputation, a place more devoted to the sex industry and more notorious as a haven for criminals on the lam. But probably not.
When dusk comes to this beach resort, a sea of pink neon bulbs casts a pale glow onto the thickly made-up faces of thousands of women (and some men) who sit on bar stools waiting for their patrons. 
If Las Vegas is Sin City, Pattaya is a bear hug from Lucifer himself.
And yet, amid the back alleys jammed with girlie bars and a beachfront peopled with what the Thais euphemistically call ''service women,'' there are signs of change.
Indian couples, Chinese tour groups and vacationing Russian families stroll around the city. A dozen luxury hotels cater to the weekend crowd of wealthy Thais from Bangkok who mingle with tourists at a huge shopping mall. Pattaya has a growing number of fancy restaurants, an annual music festival and, perhaps most improbably, regular polo tournaments.
Long derided as a city of sleaze, the city is reaching for respectability.
A two-hour drive from Bangkok, Pattaya was little more than a fishing village four decades ago when U.S. soldiers fighting in the Vietnam War discovered a pristine, coral-filled bay. Tens of thousands of lonely soldiers armed with dollars sought respite from the war in a country of relative poverty, lax law enforcement and historically tolerant attitudes toward prostitution. The result was predictable.
Pattaya survived the departure of the G.I.'s by expanding into sex tourism. Visitors to Thailand in the 1970s were offered brochures at the Bangkok airport showing pictures of available companions. The booth at the airport no longer exists, but the business lives on: for at least the past decade, men have outnumbered women as tourists in Thailand. They make up about 60 percent of foreign visitors in Thailand compared with 52 percent in nearby, law-abiding Singapore.
In recent years the Pattaya tourist industry has sought to diversify its client base. Hotel managers learned that, despite jokes about recession-proof industries, relying heavily on a Western male clientele was unwise at a time when the United States and Europe were buffeted by recession.
Tourism agencies now actively seek out visitors from the rising economies of China and India.
''There's definitely been a change,'' said Shyam Anugonda, a 39-year-old lawyer from Bangalore, India, whose first trip to Pattaya was eight years ago, when he was single.
''It was more sex oriented before,'' Mr. Anugonda said as he shopped for Thai fabrics with his wife, Kavitha.
This time, Mr. Anugonda's five-day vacation included an elephant show and parasailing.
The government is encouraging the rebranding of Pattaya by developing a master plan for the city, including a monorail to help relieve traffic-clogged streets, a redrawn waterfront and a high-speed rail line from Bangkok. The plan is awaiting approval from the Thai cabinet.
The police, too, say they are trying to clean up the city's image.
''There are people who say Pattaya is the paradise of criminals,'' said Col. Atiwit Kamolrat, the head of the immigration police. ''It's now going to be impossible for them to hide here.''
His office's Transnational Crime Data Center combs through lists of wanted criminals from foreign governments and cross-references them with hotel registration logs and visa renewal applications. Since the beginning of the year, the office has arrested 12 foreign criminals hiding out in Pattaya, Colonel Atiwit said.
Somchet Thinaphong, a board member charged with the city's redevelopment plan at the Designated Areas for Sustainable Tourism Administration, a government agency, said Pattaya's face-lift would cost 32 billion baht, or about $1 billion. He spoke in generalities about ''sustainable development'' and making the city more ecologically friendly.
But here in Pattaya, officials chuckle derisively at the notion that the city can be totally sanitized. Stamping out Pattaya's sex industry is fantasy, said Niti Kongrut, the director of the Pattaya branch of the Thai government's tourism office.
''You talk about sustainable development, how about prostitutes? They have been around for a very long time,'' Mr. Niti said. ''We can't close down the go-go bars. It's a free country. Besides, it makes money.''
For decades, officials have wrestled with the question of what to do about the seedy side of the city, Mr. Niti said. ''Now we just ignore them and try to promote other activities.''
For visitors who have no intention of partaking in it, the sex industry has become a sort of spectacle, a red-light district that makes its counterparts in other cities seem almost Victorian.
Olga Bidenko, 28, a tourist from Ukraine who came to Pattaya with a colleague from the marketing company she works for, said she was entertained by Walking Street, a thoroughfare stretching a kilometer and a half, or about a mile, blocked to motor traffic and packed with bars. Typical of the bars is Sexy Airline, where women dressed in old-fashioned air hostess outfits call out to prospective patrons passing by.
''We thought Amsterdam was the sex capital of the world,'' said Ms. Bidenko, 28. ''But now that I've been here, I think Amsterdam is a perfectly respectable city.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Consumer Advocate to Lead New Watchdog Agency as Assistant to Obama

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Elizabeth Warren, who conceived of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, will oversee its establishment as an assistant to President Obama, an official briefed on the decision said Wednesday evening.
The decision, which Mr. Obama is to announce this week, would allow Ms. Warren, a Harvard law professor, to effectively run the new agency without having to go through a potentially contentious confirmation battle in the Senate. The creation of the bureau is a centerpiece of the Wall Street financial overhaul that Mr. Obama signed in July.
Ms. Warren will be named an assistant to the president, a designation that is held by senior White House staff members, including Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff. She will also be a special adviser to the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, and report jointly to Mr. Obama and Mr. Geithner. The financial regulation law delegated to the Treasury Department the powers of the bureau until a permanent director was appointed and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term. 
The decision does not preclude the possibility that Ms. Warren could eventually be named director, and at the least, she would play a pivotal role in deciding whom to appoint to the job, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to pre-empt the formal announcement. Several organizations, including ABC, reported the news of Ms. Warren's impending appointment on Wednesday.
Ms. Warren, 61, an authority on bankruptcy law, has developed a following among liberals for her writings and advocacy on behalf of working-class and middle-class families. She has described their financial strains in two books, one of them written with her daughter.
But she has drawn fire from financial institutions for her persistent attacks on abusive, deceptive and unfair lending practices; some banking executives believe she has been overly broad in criticizing those practices.
Labor unions and consumer advocacy groups called Ms. Warren particularly suited for the job she helped to create, and have lobbied the White House for months to make the appointment official. Some called on Mr. Obama to formally nominate Ms. Warren to lead the bureau even if it led to a confirmation battle, arguing that Democrats should embrace such a battle as a means of drawing attention to the bureau's significance.
However, the White House saw drawbacks to that approach, according to the official. If Ms. Warren's nomination were in limbo for months, she would be generally precluded from serving fully as the public face of the bureau, or even testifying before Congress.
''The stakes are too high to delay the standing up of this agency,'' the official said.
The bureau will consolidate employees and responsibilities from a host of other regulatory bodies, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and even the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It is expected to have hundreds of employees and a budget of up to $500 million.
The bureau will nominally be part of the Fed, which is obligated to finance its budget, but the central bank may not influence its personnel or rules.
The bureau will have the authority to write and enforce new standards for mortgages, credit cards, payday loans and a wide array of other financial products, and the White House said it believed it was imperative that Ms. Warren promptly begin to shape that process.
A consequence of the arrangement is that Ms. Warren will be working closely with Mr. Geithner, with whom she has occasionally clashed.
Ms. Warren was picked by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, as chairwoman of the Congressional panel that oversees the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Wall Street bailout effort enacted during the Bush administration.
Under her leadership, the panel has produced a series of reports, many of them critical of how the program has been carried out under Mr. Geithner, who was one of its architects.
In its latest report, to be released Thursday, the panel examined the Obama administration's decision to extend the bailout program until Oct. 3 to provide help for community banks, the credit markets and homeowners facing foreclosure. The report found that the program carried a stigma because of ''deep public frustration that whatever the TARP's successes, it has not rescued many Americans from suffering enormous economic pain.''
The panel added: ''Treasury claims that the pain would have been far worse if the TARP had never existed, but this hypothetical scenario is difficult to evaluate -- in part due to regrettable omissions in data collection on Treasury's part.''
Ms. Warren recused herself from that report, members of the panel said Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Support for Higher Tax on Wealthiest

BYLINE: By MEGAN THEE-BRENAN

 BODY:
Amid heated debate in Washington over the fate of the Bush-era tax cuts, there is strong support for the Obama administration's proposal to allow the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans to expire at the end of the year. However, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll finds the public does not expect that to happen if the Republicans win control of Congress in November. 
The poll found that 53 percent of Americans say Mr. Obama's proposal to increase taxes on households earning $250,000 or more is a good idea, and 38 percent say it is a bad idea.
One area of agreement among the poll's respondents, regardless of party affiliation, is that the tax cuts for those households earning less than $250,000 should be extended, as Mr. Obama has proposed. Republicans have been pressing for the tax cuts to be extended at all income levels, saying that to raise taxes on high-income people would hurt the economy.
In the poll, support for the president's proposal to let the tax cuts on income above $250,000 expire divides sharply along party lines, with 65 percent of Democrats, 57 percent of independents and just 33 percent of Republicans backing the tax increases for the wealthiest Americans.
Sixty-three percent of voters, including majorities in each party, expect that the Republicans will try to make the tax cuts permanent if they win control of Congress.

HEADLINE: U.S. Signals Impatience With China

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is moving to take a harder stance on the Chinese government's trade and currency policies, with anger toward China rising in both political parties ahead of midterm elections.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, in separate hearings before House and Senate panels, plans to acknowledge on Thursday that China has kept the value of its currency, the renminbi, artificially low to help its exports and has largely failed to improve the situation as it promised to do in June.
''We are concerned, as are many of China's trading partners, that the pace of appreciation has been too slow and the extent of appreciation too limited,'' Mr. Geithner plans to say, according to excerpts of his statement released on Wednesday night by the Treasury Department. 
The United States brought two cases to the World Trade Organization on Wednesday, accusing China of improperly blocking imports of a specialty steel product and denying credit card companies access to its markets. The move came just hours before House lawmakers demanded action on the currency issue.
The renminbi has risen about 1 percent against the dollar since Beijing promised new exchange rate flexibility in June.
In his testimony, Mr. Geithner is not expected to rule out declaring China a currency manipulator, a finding that could lead to retaliatory trade measures. The administration has so far refused to take such a step, relying instead on persuasion, though with little success.
The currency issue is increasingly likely to be a focus when leaders of the Group of 20 nations meet in November in Seoul, South Korea. A bill with support from 143 House members from both parties would allow the United States to impose tariffs and other penalties on countries that undervalue their currencies.
But many economists believe that China is unlikely to yield to American pressure, and they have called on the Obama administration to do a better job of enlisting support from the European Union and Japan.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the pressure from the United States would not help resolve the currency issue and could even backfire, Reuters reported.
''I would point out that appreciation of the renminbi will not solve the U.S. deficit and unemployment problems,'' a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, said at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing.
The office of the United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, said the timing of the new W.T.O. cases was unrelated to the other economic tensions with China.
In one case, the United States accused China of violating world trade rules when it imposed antidumping duties and countervailing duties on grain-oriented, flat-rolled electrical steel, which is used to make transformers and reactors used to generate electricity. The two largest makers of such steel are Allegheny Technologies, based in Pittsburgh, and AK Steel, based in West Chester, Ohio.
China imposed duties as high as 65 percent in April after concluding that the American manufacturers had sold the steel at less than fair value and had received improper subsidies from the United States. The Americans say the charges are false.
In the other case, the trade representative's office accused China of illegally blocking American electronic payment companies from access to its markets, through its support of a state-financed company, China Union Pay, which has had a monopoly since 2001 over renminbi-denominated debit and credit card payments in China.
Mr. Kirk said his office was ''fighting for the American jobs threatened by China's actions, and insisting on the level playing field promised in our W.T.O. agreements.''
Leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees trade, applauded the filings. Its chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, called them ''critical steps forward in our effort to enforce our market access rights in China.'' The panel's senior Republican, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, said, ''It's about time the administration decided to act.''
Mr. Grassley added: ''The administration should go one step further and bring a case against China's unfair currency manipulation at the W.T.O.''
On Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee began two days of hearings on China's currency, its third set of hearings this year on the topic.
Its chairman, Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said ''a multilateral approach would be the most likely to yield the broadest results.'' Mr. Levin also called Japan's move to weaken the yen, that country's first intervention in the currency markets since 2004, ''a deeply disturbing development.''
Mr. Levin said that the International Monetary Fund had little power to enforce its rules against currency manipulation, adding that the G-20 should take up the issue. But he warned that ''there does not appear to be anything remotely approaching an international agreement to end predatory exchange rate policies.''
Mr. Levin urged the administration to bring a case before the W.T.O. arguing that China's currency policy amounted to an illegal export subsidy. He said he thought the United States could impose countervailing duties against China without violating its own obligations under world trade rules.
More than 140 House members have signed onto a bill sponsored by Representatives Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, and Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, that would compel the administration to impose such duties.
The United States-China Business Council has said it believes such a move would antagonize China without yielding meaningful results, and the senior Republican on the committee, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, expressed similar skepticism at the hearing.
Manufacturers, labor unions and politicians from the Midwest have been among the most vigorous in calling for sanctions, but there were indications on Wednesday that policy experts were increasingly in favor of tough action.
China permitted the value of the renminbi to rise about 20 to 25 percent against the dollar from 2005 to 2008, before the government reimposed a currency peg to support its export-centered economy after the global financial crisis.
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a leading research organization here, told House lawmakers on Wednesday that a similar increase over the next two to three years would create about 500,000 jobs. He said it would reduce China's current account surplus by $350 billion to $500 billion, and the American current account deficit by $50 billion to $120 billion.
The United States should seek to mobilize the European Union and countries like Brazil, Russia and India to press China to realign the renminbi, and should seek W.T.O. authorization to impose restrictions on Chinese imports if it does not do so, Mr. Bergsten said.

HEADLINE: Challengers Mine a Deep Discontent Among Voters

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN; Marjorie Connelly, Marina Stefan and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Republicans are heading into the general election phase of the midterm campaign backed by two powerful currents: the highest proportion of voters in two decades say it is time for their own member of Congress to be replaced, and Americans are expressing widespread dissatisfaction with President Obama's leadership.
But the latest New York Times/CBS News poll also finds that while voters rate the performance of Democrats negatively, they view Republicans as even worse, providing a potential opening for Democrats to make a last-ditch case for keeping their hold on power.
The poll represents a snapshot of the country's political mood as the campaign pivots from primary contests that have revealed deep divisions among Republicans into the general election, where the parties deliver their competing arguments to a wider audience. 
The findings suggest that there are opportunities and vulnerabilities for both parties as they proceed into the final seven weeks of the campaign.
A case for Republicans: Voters are remarkably open to change, even if they are not sure where Republicans will lead them. Most Americans, including one-third of those in the coalition that elected Mr. Obama, now say he does not have a clear plan to solve the nation's problems or create jobs. Democrats remain highly vulnerable on the economy.
A case for Democrats: They are seen as having better ideas for solving the country's problems. The public steadfastly supports the president's proposal to let tax cuts expire for the wealthiest Americans. And far more people still blame Wall Street and the Bush administration than blame Mr. Obama for the country's economic problems.
Voters have a darker view of Congressional Republicans than of Democrats, with 63 percent disapproving of Democrats and 73 percent disapproving of Republicans. But with less than two months remaining until Election Day, there are few signs that Democrats have made gains persuading Americans that they should keep control of Congress.
''I really think we need to get some new blood in there,'' said Kathy Beckman, 44, an optometrist from Lodi, Calif., who spoke in an interview after participating in the poll. ''Get them all out.''
The mood of the country is similar in many respects to the fall of 1994, when Republicans swept control of Congress. There is an overall low Congressional approval, large numbers of Americans who believe the country is on the wrong track and soaring discontent among voters with their own representative.
It is that particular finding in the poll that underscores the true depths of the disgruntlement among the public and is an ominous sign for Democrats, who have a 39-seat majority in the House and a 10-seat majority in the Senate.
In many election cycles, voters readily acknowledge that they are dissatisfied with government or Congress in general, but they tend to have a stronger connection toward their own representative. That is not the case this year, with 55 percent of voters saying it is time for new leadership and only 34 percent saying their lawmaker deserves re-election. It is a historic high for a question asked in each midterm election year since 1990.
The economic climate is also worse this year, with 8 in 10 Americans rating the economy negatively and 4 in 10 saying that their family's financial situation is worse than it was two years ago. In September 1994, two months before Democrats lost their majorities in the House and Senate, more than half of people said the condition of the national economy was good.
The economy and jobs are increasingly and overwhelmingly cited by Americans as the most important problems facing the country, while the federal budget deficit barely registers as a topic of concern when survey respondents were asked to volunteer their worries.
The national telephone poll was conducted Friday through Tuesday, the day that primary contests unfolded in seven states. The survey included 990 adults, of whom 881 were registered voters. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Voters do not perceive Republicans as having better ideas and disagree with them on the biggest economic issue of the campaign -- whether to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy -- a sign the party has no real advantage on key pieces of their agenda, which makes it more necessary to run as a generic alternative to the party in power.
The Tea Party movement, which showed its strength in Republican primaries in Delaware and New York, has yet to be fully defined for many Americans. Nearly half of voters say they are undecided or have not heard enough about the Tea Party to form an opinion, a sign that offers an opportunity for the movement to define itself to many voters and help shape their views of it before Election Day.
Nearly half of all Republican voters say they have a favorable opinion of the Tea Party. But the view of the movement among independent voters grew more negative since a Times/CBS poll was conducted in April. Now, 30 percent of independent voters have an unfavorable view of the Tea Party, with 18 percent holding a favorable view and more than half offering no opinion.
The president's overall job approval rating is 45 percent, with 47 percent disapproving. On the economy, his rating is worse, with 41 percent approving and 51 percent disapproving. When asked whether Mr. Obama has a clear plan for solving the nation's problems, 57 percent responded that he did not, yet twice as many give him more credit than Republicans for having a plan.
''He had a lot of plans and he's not really sticking to them like he said he would,'' Tammy Danley, 38, an independent voter from Louisburg, Kan., said in an interview after participating in the poll. ''It seems like a lot of talk and not a lot of action.''
With the Democratic majority on the line, and the outcome of the election seen as a referendum on the president, 45 percent of voters said Mr. Obama would not be a factor in their vote in November, while 23 percent said their vote would be for Mr. Obama and 25 percent said it would be against him.
The poll found that the public has an increasingly negative opinion of Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee, with nearly half now holding an unfavorable view of her. Her favorable rating is down nine percentage points since April.
Since then, she has increased her presence in the midterm election campaign, endorsing dozens of Republican candidates across the country, most of whom were also backed by Tea Party activists. Two-thirds of Americans think that Ms. Palin's primary motivation is staying in the public eye, rather than helping conservative candidates get elected.
''I think she is trying to be more in the public eye for her own benefit,'' said Kathy Allen, 51, an unemployed worker from Idaho Falls, Idaho, who spoke in an interview after participating in the poll, ''whether it be or financial purposes or in order to run for something again.''

HEADLINE: Obama the Other, Deployed as Election Tactic

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With every new swipe at President Obama's exotic background or cultural influences, a contingent of Republican leaders are signaling that they believe the coming elections are more than just a referendum on the administration's economic policies. Rather, to a degree that is striking, conservatives are also trying to make the fall campaign about the president himself and the kind of societal change he actually represents.
To understand why, one need only look to the Republican Senate primary in Delaware, where Christine O'Donnell this week became the latest in a series of conservative insurgents to jolt the party establishment. Such divisive primaries have threatened to reopen longstanding rifts within the party. And the increased focus on Mr. Obama's personal history is probably less about persuading the electorate as a whole than it is about unifying the disparate strands of the conservative base. 
The latest controversy over Mr. Obama's identity involves -- once again -- Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, who this week accused Mr. Obama, whose father was a Kenyan economist and spoke out against the occupying force in his country, of exhibiting ''Kenyan, anticolonial behavior.'' Mr. Gingrich was shorthanding an essay in Forbes by the conservative theorist Dinesh D'Souza, who, in exploring Mr. Obama's attitudes toward business, settled on the theory that Mr. Obama was taking directions from the anticorporate apparition of his long-departed father. (That Mr. Obama never really knew his father is apparently beside the point.)
This latest uproar came about a month after prominent Republicans excoriated Mr. Obama for supporting the building of a mosque near ground zero and just a few weeks after Glenn Beck, the television personality, held his faith-based rally on the National Mall. Last week, meanwhile, Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, in tepidly acknowledging Mr. Obama's Christian faith, said to reporters: ''This is a president we know less about than any other president in American history.''
This cultural critique of Mr. Obama -- a general portrayal of otherness based on his age and ideology, his upbringing and, inescapably, his race -- is reminiscent of similar attacks on Bill Clinton, whom 1990s-era conservatives reveled in depicting as a symbol of the socially permissive, self-indulgent hippie left. To this point, these attacks seem to be having little influence on the general electorate. In June, according to Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center poll, only about 28 percent of voters said their vote this November would be a vote against Mr. Obama, and Mr. Kohut said soon-to-be released data would show little change.
David Winston, a Republican pollster, summed up the average voter's response to the Republican attacks this way: ''The mosque is an interesting point, but tell me how you're going to get jobs and fix the economy.''
What's important for Republicans, though, isn't necessarily the viability of this assault with a broad swath of the electorate, but rather that it seems to resonate with Republican constituencies who haven't always been able to find common cause and whose turnout in November could be crucial.
Going back to the 1960s, the modern conservative movement has been an amalgam of three distinct factions: the champions of free enterprise, the foreign policy types often described as neoconservatives, and the social conservatives who became the spine of the party's grass-roots campaign apparatus.
It was a fear of communism that nicely unified all of these groups in the cold war years. The Soviet Union and its satellites were Marxist in their economic outlook, expansionist in their foreign policy and defiantly godless in their culture. Stan Lee could not have dreamed up a more perfect nemesis around which Republicans could coalesce.
For most of the last 20 years, however, Republicans have struggled to keep these groups equally engaged. George W. Bush juggled an agenda of interventionist military policy, tax cuts and opposition to stem cell research and same-sex marriage -- in other words, something for everyone in the fold. But then the war in Iraq and soaring deficits splintered the conservative coalition and led, ultimately, to a Democratic takeover.
If Ronald Reagan was the party's Great Communicator, then Republicans seem to be hoping that Mr. Obama is its Great Galvanizer. The assault on Mr. Obama's cultural affinity, the clear implication that he is neither suitably Christian nor American in his values, adds a sinister subtext to the argument against his economic agenda. It suggests that Mr. Obama is oddly indifferent to the effects of his policies on ordinary Americans because, at the end of the day, he doesn't share their experience.
Mr. Obama's alleged sympathy for so-called Muslim extremists who would desecrate the World Trade Center site, his socialist African ancestry and his early years in Indonesia -- all of this creates a shadowy archetype that every conservative enclave (fiscal, foreign policy and religious) can find a reason to fear.
You can probably expect the tenor of these attacks to grow shriller as 2012 approaches and Republican presidential hopefuls begin courting activists in Iowa. For now, at least, the president has no plans to respond -- perhaps other than to affirm his Christianity more regularly than he used to. White House advisers contend that as the conservative insinuations about Mr. Obama grow more pronounced, the extremism that underlies them will become self-evident to the public.
In the meantime, though, the November elections are less than seven weeks away. And by energizing the grass roots, the constant innuendo about Mr. Obama's allegiances may be doing exactly what Republicans need it to do.

HEADLINE: As Italy's Government Totters, a New Power Broker Rises

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO

 BODY:
VENICE -- The Northern League gathered here this past weekend under a blazing sun to celebrate a peculiar late summer ritual. Stalwarts, dressed in emerald green and some wearing T-shirts with anti-immigrant slogans (''+Rum, -Rom,'' or Gypsies), poured a vial of water drawn from northern Italy's Po River into the Venetian lagoon.
Veneration of the river is central to the group's murky origin myth, which centers on a vaguely Celtic-inspired separate nation called Padania. But this deeply populist group is not a folkloristic fringe. It is, at the age of 21, the fastest-growing and most powerful political party in Italy, having tapped directly into local Italian and broader European fears about the economy, immigration and loss of local identity.
It makes the Tea Party in the United States look quaint -- and today, the very political survival of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi lies in its hands. 
Mr. Berlusconi's political clout is perilously low. Hostility inside his coalition has exploded into open warfare, and he is trying to stave off a government collapse and early elections at a time when $56 billion in government bonds are set to come due and world markets are attentive. Mr. Berlusconi's great wealth and control of the media and government count ever less.
''Today is Berlusconi's weakest moment yet,'' said Roberto D'Alimonte, a political science professor at the University of Florence.
All of which has empowered one man in particular: Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, who is known for extra salty language, wearing tank tops and continuing to smoke cigars even though a stroke took away a good part of his voice.
The current political crisis is so complex as to confound even veteran political analysts, to say nothing of average Italians. But what is clear is that Mr. Berlusconi is struggling mightily to hold his coalition together. The restive co-founder of his center-right People of Liberties party, Gianfranco Fini, a former neo-fascist who is finding more support these days in the center, left the party in late July, arguing that Mr. Berlusconi was in danger of becoming a dictator.
The split also strengthened the Northern League's point man in the government, Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti, who is seen as a contender to one day succeed Mr. Berlusconi.
As the crisis expands, no one is forgetting that the Northern League, though a partner in every Berlusconi government, has not always been loyal. In 1994, Mr. Berlusconi's first government collapsed after the party pulled out, and without its backing he lost the 1996 elections. With its support, he won again in 2001 and 2008.
While Mr. Fini's deputies are in play, as is a centrist party heavily courted by both right and left, Northern League leaders say this time around they will back Mr. Berlusconi -- but, at least for now, they want elections next spring, two years before the government's mandate is set to end.
''As a member of the league, I should say that I want to vote tomorrow,'' said Giancarlo Giorgetti, the chairman of the Lower House budget committee and one of Mr. Bossi's most powerful deputies.
''But in a moment of international financial tension like this, first we have to pass the budget because we can't start in 2011 without the tools to govern.''
In exchange for its support, the party wants Mr. Berlusconi to pass its platform of ''fiscal federalism,'' allowing more tax revenue to stay local in the prosperous North.
What hangs in the balance is the Italian South, which has traditionally backed Mr. Berlusconi, but which the Northern League mercilessly criticizes for its corruption and historic misuse of state resources.
Many say fiscal federalism will further divide the country between the prosperous North and poorer South.
Others disagree. ''Thirty years ago the country was just as divided,'' said Alessandro Trocino, a co-author of ''Razza Padana,'' a history of the Northern League. Fiscal federalism, he added, is ''a propagandistic trick.''
Mr. Giorgetti said fiscal federalism would help the South because ''it would help people who are used to swimming with a life jacket to swim without one.''
But it may be Mr. Berlusconi who needs the life jacket. To survive, he has to perform a difficult balancing act. ''He needs the support of the Northern League, but he cannot forsake the support of the South,'' Mr. D'Alimonte said. ''He has to put together the devil and the holy water.''
The Northern League's rise stems as much from its platform -- fewer illegal immigrants and fiscal federalism -- as from the failure of other parties, not least the center-left Democratic Party, to directly confront Italian fears or present a coherent program to help Italy stay competitive.
While critics say the Northern League has delivered more rhetoric than results, it now commands respectable margins. In last spring's regional elections, it took 30 percent of the vote in the Veneto and 26 percent in Lombardy, two of the country's most powerful regions. For the first time, it also pulled in double digits in historically left-wing Emilia Romagna, where it is increasingly popular among formerly Communist blue-collar workers. It has also gained ground in largely leftist Tuscany.
With the slogan ''Not left or right but forward,'' the Northern League has attracted voters from across the political spectrum. It is openly hostile to illegal immigration, an increasingly loud theme both in Italy and Europe. One Northern League deputy provocatively threw a pig's head on the ground where a mosque was planned, defiling the lot. Popular among agricultural workers, it is fiercely opposed to genetically modified crops and European legislation that it fears would inhibit local food traditions.
The emphasis on local culture was strong in Venice at Sunday's event, called the ''Festival of the Padanian Peoples,'' Padania being an imaginary Northern Italian homeland dreamed up by the party's founders.
''The party attracts people because it represents our values, our culture, our traditions,'' said Oretta Piertotti, a member of the city council of Pavia, outside Milan. ''I have no sympathy for this idea of a united Europe,'' she added.
''We don't believe in integration, we are afraid of an invasion,'' said Gianluca Ghizzardi, 43, a nurse from Sarezzo, outside Brescia, who had dyed his beard green and was wearing a Viking hat and carrying a plastic Celtic sword.
Asked how the Northern League could square its rhetoric on immigration with the fact that businesses in the North -- and indeed, the entire country -- relied on immigrant labor to survive, Mr. Giorgetti smiled knowingly. ''In fact,'' he said in an earlier interview, ''business owners don't vote for the League, it's the workers who vote for the Northern League.''

HEADLINE: 3 Women Claim Bias At Goldman

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Three former female employees at Goldman Sachs sued the investment bank on Wednesday, contending that the firm discriminates systematically against women.
The women claim that Goldman intentionally pays its male employees more than their female counterparts, and promotes them more frequently. A persistent pattern of bias has resulted in women being underrepresented in the firm's management ranks, the complaint said.
''The number of women in management positions at Goldman dwindles as the level of management rises,'' the complaint said, citing Goldman data that showed that women made up 29 percent of the firm's vice presidents, 17 percent of its managing directors and 14 percent of its partners. 
Lucas van Praag, a Goldman spokesman, said, ''We believe this suit is without merit. People are critical to our business, and we make extraordinary efforts to recruit, develop and retain outstanding women professionals.''
The complaint, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, is the latest in a stream of lawsuits filed over the last decade accusing Wall Street firms of denying women the kind of pay packages and job opportunities granted to men.
Other suits have claimed harassment in overwhelmingly male offices and trading floors. In 2004, Morgan Stanley paid $54 million to settle accusations that it had denied rises and promotions to women, paid them less than men, excluded them from company events and subjected them to lewd behavior. The firm denied any wrongdoing as part of that settlement.
Most recently, three investment advisers who worked at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch accused the bank of gender bias in a suit filed in federal court in Brooklyn in March. Bank of America has denied the accusations. The same law firms that represented women in the complaint against Goldman Sachs are representing the plaintiffs in the Bank of America suit.
The complaint against Goldman, which seeks class-action status, is notable because two of the plaintiffs held executive posts. Their accusations highlight a delicate topic on Wall Street: the lack of women executives at the top.
Currently, the most prominent include Sallie Krawchek, the head of global wealth and investment management at Bank of America; and Heidi Miller, head of international operations at JPMorgan Chase. But a number of prominent female executives, including Erin Callan, the former chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers, and Zoe Cruz, a former co-president of Morgan Stanley, were ousted by their firms in the fallout from the financial crisis.
For Goldman, the lawsuit comes at a time when the firm, among the most prestigious and profitable on Wall Street, has taken a public relations beating. This summer, the firm agreed to pay $550 million to settle civil securities fraud charges related to the sale of subprime mortgage securities. The firm has also come under fire for returning to profitability far more quickly than its competitors -- a criticism that Goldman executives find puzzling.
The three plaintiffs in the Goldman lawsuit are H. Cristina Chen-Oster, who worked in the firm's equities division from 1997 to 2005 and was promoted to vice president; Lisa Parisi, who worked in the asset management group from 2001 to 2008 and was promoted to managing director; and Shanna Orlich, who worked in the firm's fixed-income unit from 2007 to 2008 as an associate.
The most detailed accusations come from Ms. Chen-Oster, who worked mostly in sales on Goldman's convertible-bond desk. Ms. Chen-Oster claims in an affidavit that shortly after she joined Goldman in 1997, a celebration for a recently promoted male colleague took place at Scores, a New York strip club, and all the employees were encouraged to join.
The lawsuit contends that at the end of the night, a married male colleague escorted her to her boyfriend's apartment building and in the hallway lobby pinned her against the wall, kissing and groping her.
That episode, which the male colleague reported to his supervisor the next morning, led to Ms. Chen-Oster's experiencing ''increased hostility and marginalization at the firm,'' according to the complaint.
The filing details Ms. Chen-Oster's compensation throughout her tenure. In her second year at the firm, Goldman paid her $475,000, a number she claims was significantly less than that of her male peers.
By 2000, a year in which the stock market peaked, Goldman paid her $800,000, a figure she contends was at least 50 percent less than that paid to male counterparts. Ms. Chen-Oster resigned from Goldman and now works as a managing director at Deutsche Bank.
Ms. Orlich, another plaintiff, portrays a male-dominated trading-floor culture centered on golf and other physical pursuits. Ms. Orlich, who received business and law degrees from Columbia, says in an affidavit that Goldman's management would challenge one of her male colleagues, a former member of the Navy Seals, to do push-up contests and ''other displays of masculinity.'' She claims to have never been invited to frequent golf outings, even though she was a varsity player in high school.
A Goldman managing director also hired scantily clad female escorts wearing Santa hats to attend a holiday party, Ms. Orlich claims.
A portion of the complaint takes aim at Goldman's widely known 360-degree reviews, evaluations of employees that involve feedback from a boss, subordinates and peers, that have become a model management tool for other corporations. The plaintiffs contend that managers' favoritism toward male employees skews the review process, disproportionately placing men in the top quartile of performance.
Janet Hanson, who was an executive at Goldman Sachs for 14 years and the founder of 85 Broads, a professional women's networking organization named after the address of the firm's former headquarters, says that this lawsuit belies the experience of most Goldman women professionals.
''For every woman at Goldman Sachs who feels she has been treated unfairly, I will find a thousand who don't feel that way,'' said Ms. Hanson. ''Unfortunately, the people muzzled in a situation like this are the women who work there but can't talk to the press, but if you asked them if they loved their jobs and are treated equally, the vast, vast majority would say yes.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Gets a Partner, But Who Will Lead?

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
If ever there was proof that the Tea Party and the Republican Party do not necessarily go hand in hand, it is Christine O'Donnell's victory over the establishment in the Republican Senate primary in Delaware.
So what happens now, with the primary season ending, and the Tea Party having defined it? Does the Tea Party remake the G.O.P. in its image, staging a ''hostile takeover,'' as Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, the libertarian advocacy group, urged activists rallying outside the Capitol last weekend to do? Or will the Republican Party co-opt the Tea Party, as Trent Lott, a former leader of the Senate Republicans, said it must?
The embodiment of this question might be Senator Jim DeMint, the South Carolina Republican who has made himself and his Senate Conservatives Fund a kind of Tea Party Good Housekeeping seal of approval. Sitting at the intersection of the Republican Party and the Tea Party, Mr. DeMint could be a model for how the two might co-exist -- or an example of how the drive for ideological purity could turn the Republicans into a niche party. 
Mr. DeMint insists that he would rather have a pure conservative minority than a majority full of Republicans in name only. Republicans say Ms. O'Donnell will not win in the general election; Mr. DeMint says her opponent, Representative Michael N. Castle, would have just been another vote for President Obama and the Democrats' agenda.
''Mike is not going to vote with us on many things anyway,'' Mr. DeMint said. ''Mike supports the bailouts, the stimulus, the financial reform.''
''The people of this country are uniting around these core principles of limited government,'' he said, ''and if the party can reflect that, we'll be the big-tent majority party that we have been talking about for years. And anyone who says that we would be in the majority if we fielded a bunch of moderate candidates, just doesn't understand what's happening in America.''
The Republican tasked with trying to win enough seats to gain the party the majority in the Senate, John Cornyn of Texas, sees it differently.
''Jim has made it clear he wants to support the most conservative candidates,'' Senator Cornyn said. ''I believe we should find the most conservative candidates who can get elected. That's a nuance, but it's important.''
Even some of the primaries that Tea Party candidates lost suggest how much the Tea Party sentiment has already pushed Republicans to the right.
In Tuesday's Republican primary in New Hampshire, for example, two Tea Party candidates in the Second Congressional District lost to Charlie Bass, a former congressman swept out in the Democratic wave of 2006. Mr. Bass was once known as the classic New England moderate. But to win the nomination this year, he campaigned far to the right -- so far that The Concord Monitor editorialized, ''It will take such a long way back to the middle that he'd better pack a lunch.''
Democrats are certainly counting on the Republicans' taking a very long trip to a very remote region of the right.
Facing dispiriting polls and an enthusiasm gap that favors the Republicans, they rejoiced at the victories of Tea Party insurgents over establishment candidates Tuesday.
''When Mike Castle loses in Delaware, that's a sign that moderates are no longer welcome,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ''They've now become the narrowest of ideological parties, and I do think that's going to alarm centrist moderate voters. It's those centrist moderate voters that determine the outcome in these swing districts.''
''The Republican Party had hoped to harness the energy of the Tea Party movement,'' Mr. Van Hollen said. ''Now they have a runaway horse that they can't control.''
But Mr. Cornyn, who has been on the receiving end of anti-establishment anger, argued that the Tea Party had helped Republicans in one important respect, by moving the debate away from social issues. While Tea Party supporters tend to be socially conservative on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, most say they don't want to talk about them; they believe that by spending so much time on those issues, the Republican Party failed to focus on fiscal conservatism.
While social issues tend to be polarizing, Republicans can win on economic issues, Mr. Cornyn said, because the Democrats have been in charge as the economy has gone south.
''As I've traveled,'' he said, ''I've talked to a lot of folks who are basically independents who say: I'm fine with the Republicans as long as we're talking about fiscal responsibility. Where I go off the reservation is when you talk about social issues.''
Still, if the Republicans win a majority in the House or Senate, the pressure will increase to develop coherent policy.
''Having to produce a work product in the majority is much more difficult than saying no when you're in the minority,'' said Tom Davis, a former Republican congressman from Virginia.
''I don't even think the Tea Party agrees with itself,'' said John Feehery, a Republican consultant and former top aide to House Republicans. ''Our message right now is not an aspirational message.''
But Mr. Feehery argued that the debate would not be settled on Capitol Hill. There will be a year of excitement about Congress, he said, until the party begins focusing on picking its presidential candidates.
''That,'' he said, ''will really litigate all the internal inconsistencies within the party.''

HEADLINE: Settled in the City, But Still in a Hurry Every Weekend

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Jeff Gordon is going to the playoffs. Of course, in Nascar, nearly everybody goes to the playoffs, even if they are not eligible for the championship.
''I don't know how to drive without 43 cars,'' Gordon was saying Wednesday, looking forward to the Chase for the Sprint Cup, the race within a race.
Gordon was sitting in Brasserie Cognac -- he ordered a salad and the salmon -- on Broadway and West 55th Street, not far from his apartment on Central Park West. His official home is in North Carolina, the heart of stock-car racing, but Gordon spends enough time on the west side of Manhattan to know where he likes to have lunch and chat about his sport. 
This is playoff time for Nascar. Every sport does it differently -- college basketball is going to let everybody into its tournament one of these years -- but only auto racing makes the top 12 drivers eligible for the championship and then has them race against their colleagues in 10 major races, starting Sunday in New Hampshire.
It sounds odd to me that drivers essentially risk their lives against drivers who do not have a championship at stake, but Gordon said the competition in the Chase felt the same as in every other race.
''Some guys have different agendas,'' he said, ''but we're all going as fast as we can.''
I asked him if the Chase was anything like the final week or so of the Tour de France, in which the front-runners can hang back and keep tabs on each other, letting some of their brethren burn themselves out ahead of the pack.
Turns out, Gordon has become something of a fan of the Tour, since he and Lance Armstrong work together on some charities. He has bikes in his homes; ''I love the loop around the park,'' he said, meaning Central Park.
However, he insisted there was no coasting among the leaders of the Chase.
''Each position is crucial,'' Gordon said, but winning races still counts. That was true in 2007 when Gordon had the most top-10 and top-5 finishes for the season but finished second to Jimmie Johnson, who has won the past four Chases. One tardy pit stop, one bad tire, one bit of bad luck can affect the championship.
Unlike the Tour, where etiquette may demand that everybody slow down when the leader is involved in a spill, the drivers in Nascar do not wait for anybody until they see a yellow light. Gordon would not have it any other way. At 39, he thinks he is just as aggressive as he was in his early years.
Some racing fans might debate that. Gordon won four championships under the old season-long point system but has not won the title since 2001; in fact, he has not won a race since April 2009.
Has he grown conservative, in racing middle age, with a wife, the model Ingrid Vandebosch, and daughter, Ella, and son, Leo, born last month? He said no.
''If somebody runs into me, I've got to run into him,'' he said.
But Gordon does think there is a difference between, let us say, youth and maturity.
''I tore up a lot of cars,'' he said, explaining that in his younger days he did not have a good feel for the space between his car and other cars and walls. Now he knows where things are -- ''experience,'' he said.
He said that consistency and fitness should win the Chase for him one of these years. He says he keeps pace through one-hour workouts three times a week.
I asked Gordon about the economic slowdown, which has produced gaps in stands that used to be packed and has forced racing teams to consolidate. Racing depends on companies with sponsorship money and fans with pocket money, Gordon said.
''For a long time, everything was up, up, up, up,'' he said waving his hand like a jet taking off. He seemed to feel that racing would be fine.
These days, Gordon is having fun as an icon of racing. He was at the United States Open on Sunday, but the men's final was rained out. He was at the Jets-Ravens game on Monday.
It's an old story with racing fans that Gordon is not the classic good old boy from the South (he was born in California and grew up in Indiana). It would come as no surprise to fans that he knows his way around New York, preferring the subway to taxis -- ''efficiency,'' he said. He smiled as he recalled the singers in Santa outfits, serenading subway riders last December. For money, of course.
It used to be that only construction workers and police and fire officials recognized Gordon on the city streets. But lately, he said, doormen in apartment buildings spot him and ask if they can win the Corvette being raffled off through the Jeff Gordon Children's Foundation.
All the tickets are sold, he tells them as he keeps moving, but not as fast as he will move Sunday. Jeff Gordon is going to the playoffs.

HEADLINE: Income Till Death Do You And Your Annuity Part

BYLINE: By FRAN HAWTHORNE

 BODY:
BURDENED with a reputation for being inflexible and expensive, annuities have never been popular in retirement plans. But insurance companies and Wall Street investment firms have produced a new crop of products that fiddle with the standard structure.
Their idea is that these products can promise employees the security of a traditional pension, while freeing employers from the task of paying for it. However, they are still having trouble breaking through the A-barrier.
Only 2 percent of 401(k) plans include some sort of annuity or insurance option as an investment choice alongside standard stock and bond funds, according to Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill. An additional 3 percent are ''very likely'' and 17 percent are ''somewhat likely'' to add the category this year, Hewitt says. 
Promoters hope that hearings this week, sponsored by the Treasury and Labor Departments, will lead to federal regulations that clarify some of the administrative concerns.
''Most people would want, as they approach age 50, to have some sense of what level of income they would have at retirement,'' said Thomas J. Fontaine, global head of defined contributions at the investment management firm AllianceBernstein, one of more than a half-dozen insurance companies and money managers devising these products. ''And they will want to know that they will have that income for life.''
The products work in two basic ways. The most common varieties are tied to target-date funds -- premixed funds that base their investment strategy on the date the employee hopes to retire, automatically changing the mix as the date draws nearer.
In the AllianceBernstein model, an increasing portion of the target-date assets are shifted to a special guaranteed fund starting at age 50, with 100 percent in that fund by five years before the retirement date. Although the product isn't complete, Mr. Fontaine said he expected it to guarantee a 5 percent rate of return for life, for a fee of about 1 percent of the assets.
Prudential Retirement has a product that combines a group variable annuity with a target-date fund, basically insuring against market downturns, also for a 1 percent fee. It guarantees that each year for the first 20 years of retirement, an investor can withdraw an amount equal to 5 percent of the assets that were in the target-date fund at its highest year, even if the market crashed the year before retirement. After 20 years, Prudential starts paying that 5 percent.
MetLife's Personal Pension Builder takes a wholly different approach, akin to a deferred fixed annuity. Each time someone makes a 401(k) contribution, all or part of the money essentially buys a mini-annuity (also known as a laddered annuity), getting the prevailing interest rate at that time. Thus, a person who contributed every two weeks would be purchasing 26 mini-annuities that year.
What all these products have in common is that employees use their 401(k) assets to buy a guaranteed, steady payout for the rest of their lives after they retire. The cost is usually around 1 percent of the assets guaranteed, on top of the regular 401(k) fees.
For many people, the added security is worth the price.
''We insure everything -- disability, our car, our house -- but we don't insure the risk that we could outlive our assets,'' said Pamela Hess, Hewitt's director of retirement research. She recommended that people use this kind of guarantee for around half of their 401(k) assets.
There are other concerns, however. Because so many parts are movable -- including the interest rate, the retirement date and the amount of the contribution -- companies worry about the administrative difficulties. It is not as simple as having one small-company stock fund for the whole work force.
Like a standard annuity, some of the new products depend on a single insurance company's staying in business long enough to keep paying out the guarantees, maybe for decades.
''How do you fix this if it's not the right provider?'' Ms. Hess asked.
Jody Strakosch, MetLife's director of retirement products in the United States, has a ready reply for that sort of criticism: ''MetLife has been meeting our financial obligations for 140 years.''
And John Kalamarides, the senior vice president of retirement strategies and solutions at Prudential, said new ''safe harbor'' rules from Washington could relieve some employers' fiduciary concerns in selecting insurance companies.
On the plus side, the target-date-related products are more flexible than annuities. Investors can pull out their money at any time, although that means they will have paid the extra fee for nothing.
The firms pitching these products say demand is growing. In a survey of 1,300 companies last fall, MetLife found that 44 percent of employees ''would like my employer to offer an annuity option'' in their 401(k) or similar retirement plan. A MetLife spokeswoman acknowledged that the statement could refer to rolling over the 401(k) into an annuity at retirement, as well as having an investment option.
Stephen P. Utkus, who runs the Center for Retirement Research at the Vanguard Group -- which does not sell any of these new products -- said that trying to buy security with a 401(k) investment was a mistake. The best approach, he says, is simply to build a bigger nest egg.
''Our clients view having a portfolio of assets itself as a form of security,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Investing After A Flight To Safety

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
SHAKEN by what seemed to be an earthquake in the world's financial markets two years ago, millions of retirees fled to safety, shifting their holdings into savings accounts, Treasury bills, money market funds or certificates of deposit. Now they are suffering the aftershocks: with short-term interest rates well below 1 percent, their assets are not producing enough income for daily living expenses.
What should they do? There is no quick answer to that question, but four leading financial advisers offered a variety of ideas for investing with significantly better yields while limiting risk. 
Diversifying portfolios is a main theme, and it is important to analyze one's cash flow and to assess financial priorities, distinguishing between needs like money for food and utilities and favorite outlays like family gifts that may no longer be practical.
Some people may discover that although portfolio values have fallen in the last two years, their assets are still sufficient for their long-term needs. Others may have to rethink their financial plans and tailor their portfolios accordingly. What follows are the advisers' suggestions:
JASON T. THOMAS, chief investment officer of Aspiriant, a fee-only wealth management firm with offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles, emphasized the need for a diverse portfolio with a strong equity stake meant to provide solid cash flow. In trying to avoid risk, many people have incurred ''purchasing power risk,'' he said, because the return is lower than the level of inflation.
''Think globally,'' he said, adding that some American companies, notably Nike and Caterpillar, were investing in emerging markets with strong growth prospects. That makes them a good way for investors to take a global position while holding dollar-denominated investments in companies subject to American law and accounting standards. For a single global equity holding, he suggested the ACWI, or All Country World Index, fund from iShares Trust.
Dr. Thomas also favors real estate investment trusts because they are ''an opportunity to buy into a depressed market,'' and many pay dividends of 5 percent and higher. The iShares Trust based on the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index has had an annualized return of 4.76 percent.
Commodities are ''an unloved asset class,'' he said, but holding them or an exchange-traded fund that holds them is a way to hedge against rising prices of raw materials in the future.
Turning to credit markets, he recommended the Nuveen High Yield Municipal Bond Fund, which is yielding 7 percent. When buying high yield, he prefers a fund because of its professional management and diversified holdings. He said he would avoid most Treasury and corporate bonds for now because interest rates are so low. As rates rise, bond prices fall, so holders may have to keep the bonds until maturity to get their principal back.
In repositioning a portfolio, Dr. Thomas said, ''don't do it all at once; do it in steps.''
MARK L. POLLARD, a wealth management adviser and senior vice president for investments of Merrill Lynch in Princeton, N.J., warned, ''In desperate times, people do desperate things. Don't. If you blow your capital, it's gone. It may be necessary to temper your expectations.''
Still, Mr. Pollard said, a prudent investor can do much better than staying in cash or Treasury bills. A portfolio of high-quality stocks can yield dividends of 3 to 4 percent over all and offer a potential for long-term capital appreciation.
Among the stocks he likes are AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Procter & Gamble, Pfizer, General Electric and Merck.
Enhanced returns are available through certain structured investments, Mr. Pollard said, describing a Merrill Lynch product called STEP Income Securities. They are senior unsecured debt securities issued by Merrill's parent, Bank of America, for terms of six months to two years. Their payouts are linked to the performance of an underlying stock, including Ford, JPMorgan, Apple, Google and Schlumberger.
Each one is a bit different. Some offer yields of 7 to 10 percent, with limited downside protection if the stock declines. Last month, a note linked to Pfizer was offered with a potential yield of 14 percent but no downside protection.
Retirees who have enough income for basic living expenses from other holdings, pensions or Social Security and are bullish on the underlying stock might find the notes attractive for generating income, provided they are comfortable with the downside risk.
JAMIE KALAMARIDES, senior vice president for retirement strategies and solutions at Prudential Retirement in Hartford, pointed out that retirees in their late 60s may live for 20 or 30 more years. Many fear they may outlive their money. Yet, as investors, they tend to be risk averse.
He recommended slowly shifting to a diversified portfolio from money market funds and C.D.'s. Traditionally, he said, that would include preferred stocks and bonds, and perhaps a fixed annuity for guaranteed income. Today, he said, Prudential and others are offering a new generation of annuities with a guaranteed minimum-withdrawal benefit.
The product is intended to overcome misgivings about traditional annuities while providing lifetime income, appreciation if the market rises, flexibility in withdrawing money and some money for the estates of holders who die within 20 years. At present, the annual income is 4.5 to 5.5 percent a year, depending on the purchaser's age, he said.
ELIZABETH SCHLUETER, national practice leader for the private wealth management group of JPMorgan Chase in Indianapolis, advised retirees to look at the total return of their portfolios, not just at interest and dividends. ''We believe as a firm that it is important to stay invested,'' she said, with diversified holdings of equities, bonds, mutual funds and alternative investments like hedge funds, commodities and currency, but changes in a portfolio should be made over time, not suddenly.
For living expenses, ''spending rate is as important as asset allocation,'' Ms. Schlueter said. ''Look at asset basis. What percentage can I pull out of that asset basis?'' In other words, recognize some capital gains, rather than relying only on portfolio income. ''At some point, inflation will creep back,'' she added, and that is why a diversified portfolio with some appreciating assets is important.

HEADLINE: Aftershocks From a Political Jolt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Tea Party, Grabbing Foothold in Delaware, Is Jostling G.O.P.'' (front page, Sept. 15):
Christine O'Donnell? They must be kidding! We now have the likes of Ms. O'Donnell, Sharron Angle, Michele Bachmann and Carl P. Paladino running for elected office in November. These Tea Party-supported candidates are the best thing that's happened to the Democratic Party since election night 2008!
Republicans were all but assured of winning the Senate seats in Delaware and Nevada, thereby sharply increasing their chances to take back that body, but the triumphs of Ms. Angle and Ms. O'Donnell in the primaries now raise serious questions about the outcome. 
Republican leaders are scratching their heads and wondering what is going on in their party, while Democrats are quietly hoping that the Tea Party movement is the answer to their election prayers.
Henry A. Lowenstein New York, Sept. 15, 2010
To the Editor:
The American people are upset over our country's direction under the leadership of President Obama and the Senate and House leaders, Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi. This should mean sweeping gains in both the Senate and the House by Republicans in November. This may not happen because of the failures of Republican Party leadership.
First, what the American people want to hear is what specific plans and alternatives the Republicans are offering on the economy, jobs, health care, immigration, national security and all the key issues facing our country today. No specific plans are evident. This is a major failure.
The Republican establishment seems to suffer the same problem as the Democrats -- a failure to listen to the American people and, most important, its own constituency. Republicans seem to want to play both ends against the middle, waffling on key issues, leaning toward the middle when their constituents are crying for conservatism.
Finally, and most important, there is a failure by the Republican Party establishment in understanding and paying serious attention to the major grass-roots force that exists with the Tea Party. Instead of embracing and incorporating the Tea Party movement, the Republican establishment seems to be fighting it.
The Republicans stand poised to take back control of the House, and possibly even the Senate, as a backlash against the current leadership. This may not happen.
Al DiLascia Chicopee, Mass., Sept. 15, 2010
To the Editor:
No Tea Party member was ever going to vote Democratic anyway, so dissension will only hurt the Republicans. I suspect that the Tea Party is the best thing that could happen for the Democrats, without which they would have a much more difficult task.
The irony is that the so-called insurgents, even if they were to be elected, would ostracize themselves and be mostly powerless, unless they caved and joined the incumbent ranks.
Eric C. Welch Forreston, Ill., Sept. 15, 2010
To the Editor:
This Tea Party victory in Delaware mirrors the Proposition 8 battle in California, where enormous amounts of out-of-state money overwhelmed the pro-same-sex-marriage contributions.
In Delaware's case, in-state contributions were pitifully small for Christine O'Donnell, but vast amounts of out-of-state money and advertising poured in, largely from a newly formed California-based political action committee. As always, the real story can be revealed if you ''follow the money''; thanks to the Citizens United decision of the Supreme Court, that's now far more difficult to do.
David Witz Philadelphia, Sept. 15, 2010
To the Editor:
Tea Party folks want to have their cake and eat it, too. They want the career politician ''bums'' thrown out, but they don't want anyone to tinker with their Social Security retirement benefits and other third-rail issues.
Before the economy tanked, they mostly didn't care about offshoring of jobs or use of illegal alien labor. Now that the economy has hit quicksand, they are screaming for action on these fronts.
It's a new world -- and as Americans we have to realize it. Tea Partiers naively believe that we can simply turn the clock back to the ''good old days'' through xenophobia.
The best thing about nominating someone like Christine O'Donnell is that it will drive turnout against such vitriol -- at least I hope so.
Leonel G. Gutierrez Dallas, Sept. 15, 2010
To the Editor:
Groups of formerly apathetic people grow restless and form a political organization. Their mode of operation is to shout down people with whom they disagree. They have little in the way of substantive ideas except for vengeful anger, and nationalist delusions.
They are financed by a few overly wealthy brokers who themselves seek to influence government for their own benefit. They are dismissed for the most part by civil society as being a fringe.
If this sounds like bad fiction, it is also the history of the world. And it is not confined to any particular nation.
Marc Reuben Langhorne, Pa., Sept. 15, 2010
To the Editor:
Re ''Rangel Easily Defeats Five Primary Rivals, Virtually Assuring His Re-election'' (news article, Sept. 15):
The fact that Representative Charles B. Rangel won the Democratic primary despite the ethics charges shows that the voters in his district understand one important thing: In the United States, you are presumed innocent until proved guilty.
Sadly, that's a point that his critics seem to have forgotten.

HEADLINE: Slight Rise in U.S. Industrial Production in August

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Industrial production rose modestly in August and the manufacturing sector grew for the 12th time in 13 months, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday. 
The Federal Reserve said that output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities edged up 0.2 percent last month. It rose 0.6 percent in July.
Production at factories, the largest single element of industrial production, slowed to 0.2 percent after growing 0.7 percent in July. Much of the softness came from a decline in auto production, which spiked in July. Excluding autos, manufacturing rose 0.5 percent.
Production rose for basic consumer goods, like food, clothing and paper, by more than 1 percent. Factories produced 0.7 percent more business equipment in August.
Manufacturing has helped drive economic expansion over the last year. Companies built up their stockpiles in the first half of the year after slashing them during the recession. But factory output has slowed in recent months. Businesses are no longer rebuilding their inventories. At the same time, demand for goods remains weak because consumers are saving more and spending with caution.
''Consumers have failed to take up the baton,'' said Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Weak demand will likely keep economic growth slow through the end of 2010, Mr. Ashworth said.
''The best that can be said is that the economy isn't heading back into recession,'' he said in a research note.
The nation's factories were operating at 74.7 percent of their capacity in August, up 0.1 percent from July. That is still well below the average since 1972 of 80.6 percent.
Production at mines grew 1.2 percent. The nation's mines are operating at 86.3 percent of their capacity, just 1.1 percent below the average since 1972. Utility production fell by 1.5 percent.

HEADLINE: A Hesitancy to Restore Those 401(k) Matches

BYLINE: By FRAN HAWTHORNE

 BODY:
TWICE in the last decade -- in 2002-3 and 2008-9 -- thousands of companies suspended or shrank their 401(k) matching contributions to save money during economic downturns.
The more recent dropouts are trickling back now, but fewer than half of the companies that shed their match have restored it so far, and many are paying a lower amount than previously. Some companies are considering permanent changes in the way they calculate their share. Consultants and investment managers say it could take at least a year before many employees again get the contribution they received previously -- and many never will.
Part of the caution reflects the uncertain economy. But many companies are rethinking their whole benefits strategy. 
''There's a hesitancy to put a match back in this time around, unlike last time,'' said Robert A. Liberto, a senior vice president for Segal Advisors, an investment consulting firm based in New York. ''They don't want to suspend it again in a short period of time.''
Companies have compelling reasons to resume the practice, in which they match, though often not fully, the amount that employees themselves put into their 401(k) plans, up to a specific percentage of salary. Fidelity Investments says as many as 9 percent more people join these plans when a match is offered.
Thus, about 95 percent of plans offer a match (including the 2008-9 suspensions), according to Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill.
After the economy collapsed in fall 2008, approximately 8 percent of plans suspended their match and an additional 1 to 2 percent reduced it, Hewitt says. About 5 percent took similar actions in 2002-3.
As balance sheets have improved over the last nine months, the matches have reappeared in fits and starts.
When Fidelity surveyed 300 corporate clients in March, it found that 44 percent said they had reinstated their match or planned to. In October, only 27 percent had said so. However, Hewitt found the opposite when it queried 300 companies late last year and again in mid-August: although 80 percent in the first poll had expected to bring their match back in 2010, only about one-third had done so by August. That is a much slower pace than in 2002-3.
Many are returning in stages. FedEx suspended its match in February 2009, brought it back at half the original level last January and recently announced that it would restore the full contribution next January.
At the time of the first restoration, ''the economy seemed to be beginning to emerge from the recession, but there was still uncertainty in the global economy,'' Jess Bunn, a FedEx spokesman, said. Now, he added, ''our financial performance is considerably stronger, due to an increase in global trade.''
But the new matches may not look exactly like the old ones.
Fidelity clients are tweaking the match formula to provide incentives for employees to save more, said Beth McHugh, the vice president for market insights. Instead of going dollar-for-dollar on the first 3 percent of salary that an employee contributes, for instance, an employer could match half of the first 6 percent. The maximum cost to the company would be the same, but the new formula could spur workers to increase how much they save.
A more radical potential change is to tie the corporate donation to profitability, rather than giving a fixed percentage. Robert McAree, a senior vice president for Sibson Consulting (a sister company to Segal Advisors), said that as many as one-fourth of the clients that had cut back their match were considering this approach. So are 2 percent of the 60 match-dropping companies surveyed this spring by Towers Watson, another benefits consulting firm.
Many companies that explored the profit-sharing strategy decided against it, said Robyn Credico, a senior retirement consultant in Towers Watson's Alexandria, Va., office. ''It sounded like a good idea, but you have to come up with metrics,'' she said. ''You have to define 'profit.' ''
Another 2 percent of the respondents in the Towers Watson survey expected their match to be permanently smaller, but experts say that even a shrunken or unreliable match is better than none.
''You should still save in the plan,'' Ms. Credico said, ''because the match is free money, no matter how small it is.''

HEADLINE: Looking Ahead to the Spend-Down Years

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SARANOW SCHULTZ

 BODY:
IMAGINE you're 30 and trying to figure out how much to save for retirement. You consult a Web site that can show you what you will most likely look like at 65 -- and that shows the more you save now, the happier you will look then.
Behavioral-finance researchers are already testing and thinking about such online tools, hoping they will become available in the next few years. Their goal is to help people make better decisions about both accumulating retirement assets and then drawing on them -- a process they call decumulation.
Until relatively recently, most retirees drew their retirement from a combination of employer-provided pensions and government-provided Social Security. But increasingly over the last two decades, employers have shifted away from defined-benefit plans -- which spell out how much you will receive in retirement -- to defined-contribution plans like 401(k)'s, where you know what you contribute, but don't know how well your investments will perform and what your account will be worth when you need it. 
Now, as the first holders of defined-contribution plans start to retire, the uncertainty of retirement income is compounded by other issues: people continue to live longer, rely on their children less in old age and face ever-higher medical expenses. So researchers are increasingly trying to come up with effective approaches for retirees to turn their accumulated savings into retirement income.
The government is also focusing on the issue. The Labor and Treasury Departments are reviewing retirement plan rules to determine if retirees would be more secure if they had access to options like annuities, which provide a lifetime stream of retirement income. This year, the agencies requested comments on the topic and received close to 800, and this week they held hearings on lifetime income options for retirement plans.
''Our goal is to start a national dialogue on these critically important issues,'' Phyllis C. Borzi, assistant secretary of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, part of the Labor Department, wrote in a blog post on the department's site last week.
Behavioral-finance researchers try to first understand how people behave and then create principles to guide behavior. They also are working with financial services companies to help them develop products to offer to the public.
After two decades of focusing on the accumulation of assets -- when they established that people would save more for retirement if they set up a payment schedule in advance -- the focus now is on decumulation.
Without the right approach to decumulation, a crisis may develop as more baby boomers with 401(k) accounts start retiring, possibly make the wrong payout decisions and run out of money, said Shlomo Benartzi, a professor specializing in behavioral finance at the University of California, Los Angeles, and chief behavioral economist for Allianz Global Investors.
But setting rules of thumb for decumulation is more complicated than for accumulation, researchers say, because with accumulation, the goal of saving more is known and financial advisers just have to figure out the best approach for reaching it.
With decumulation, researchers aren't sure of what people most want to achieve in retirement. It could be maintaining a similar quality of life, keeping financial autonomy, leaving money to children, philanthropy, hanging on to money to cover health expenses or a combination of these options or others. And not all these options would be best served by annuities, said David Laibson, an economics professor at Harvard, adding, ''It is not clear how much wealth should be annuitized -- that's the key debate.''
Another complicating factor for retirees is that it is much harder for them to increase their savings, if the need arises, than it is for people who still work. Other uncertainties include the possibility that retirees will, at some point, have declining cognitive abilities, and that future medical expenses and longevity are unknown.
So what are some of the new ideas and approaches being explored? Here's a look at some of the most creative thinking from behavioral-finance experts.
The Annuity Puzzle
From a traditional economist's point of view, annuities would seem to be an attractive and rational option for retirees trying to hedge the risks of living a long time in retirement and possibly experiencing cognitive decline that would curtail the ability to make financial decisions.
When you buy an annuity, you are generally guaranteed a certain monthly income over the remainder of your life. But annuities haven't proved to be all that popular among retirees. One explanation is that for many retirees, the pain of giving up money to buy the annuity trumped the pleasure of ensuring a stream of future income, said Eric Johnson, a professor of marketing at Columbia Business School.
Researchers have already shown that investors experience the pain of financial loss more than the pleasure of financial gain. In 2007, research conducted with AARP and focused on a limited range of ages among retirees, Professor Johnson found respondents were particularly loss averse, and the more loss averse they were, the less likely they were to buy an annuity.
''I could not have designed a product from a behavioral economics perspective that would have been a harder sell than current annuities,'' he said.
Professor Johnson said he was studying data from a broader range of ages to confirm his findings and also analyzing whether older people viewed future money differently than other age groups. Eventually, he said, he hoped to determine whether loss aversion was connected to cognitive decline.
''We don't know the solution -- we just know that current annuities are not very attractive,'' he said. ''The bottom line is that a behavioral economic analysis of annuitization is useful.''
In one possible solution, some companies are selling annuities that can be paid for over time, rather than all at once, he said, hoping to address retirees' uneasiness.
Alessandro Previtero, an assistant professor of finance at the Richard Ivey School of Business at the University of Western Ontario, found that new retirees were much more likely to buy an annuity after a period of poor stock market returns and more likely to opt for lump-sum distribution after a positive trend.
''The main explanation of this relationship between past stock market returns and annuitization is people think the past will continue into the future,'' he said.
Professor Previtero examined a database of information of about 100,000 retirees who, from 2002 to 2008, had to choose between receiving defined-benefit funds as a guaranteed lifetime income or a lump-sum distribution. ''The most important determinant in economic terms of this decision seems to be past stock market returns'' of the last six months to a year, he said.
The relationship between stock market returns and annuities grows stronger with age, he said, which is consistent with the notion that the elderly tend to rely on rules of thumb more for complicated decisions as they age.
Professor Previtero said he could envision potentially more successful annuity products that might allow retirees to experience some of the upside of the stock market or might be easier to enroll in because they were more readily available within retirement plans.
Cognitive Decline
Half of people in their 80s suffer from either dementia or significant cognitive impairment that prevents them from making sound financial decisions, Professor Laibson of Harvard and fellow researchers concluded in a 2009 paper. They also found that cognitive decline happened rapidly as people passed age 65, with the prevalence of dementia doubling every five years.
This suggests that any solution that requires older adults to make complicated financial decisions needs to address the fact that ''about half the people in their 80s are not up to that challenge,'' he said. Possible solutions, he said, include creating new fiduciary standards for retirees' savings, forcing some sort of annuitization, and having more regulatory oversight of financial products for retirees.
Mental Accounting
That people tend to divide their money into separate mental accounts for various purposes (travel or dining out, for example) and that earmarking savings to specific goals (college savings, for instance) tends to increase saving rates has long been known.
Some researchers have suggested using this concept to help people with decumulation. For instance, George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, recently suggested that retirees keep separate accounts for various purposes and use different investment strategies with different levels of risk for each.
Since some might find it especially painful to spend money from a nest egg, ''we might encourage retirees to put some of their money into an annuity and then invest the rest in a more risky fashion and give themselves license to spend the riskier fund,'' he said.
Think of separate ''pay the rent'' and ''spoil the grandchildren'' accounts, with the rent fund in some kind of guaranteed annuity and the other invested more aggressively. His ideas were included in Allianz Global Investors' response to the government's request for comments on future retirement products.
Seeing Your Future Self
Can seeing a representation of what you'll look like later in life persuade you to save more for retirement? Some recent studies say yes.
Hal Ersner-Hershfield of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and fellow researchers created images of college-age participants that showed how they looked as they aged.
They then put the participants in a virtual reality environment, showed them either an image of what they looked like now or of what they might look like as they aged, then asked them questions about retirement allocation. Participants who saw the aged image of themselves allocated twice as much to retirement as people who saw their current appearance, the researchers found.
''Our hunch is that exposure to one's future self is creating somewhat of an empathic response,'' similar to the feelings of protectiveness one might feel when seeing an aged parent, said Professor Ersner-Hershfield.
The researchers then tested a Web-based tool where the facial expressions of participants changed based on the savings rate selected using a slider tool. The higher the savings rate, the happier the expressions on the images appeared. ''You could imagine a similar tool for decumulation,'' said Professor Ersner-Hershfield, who, with his colleagues, is going to work with Allianz on making such tools for accumulation and decumulation available to investors. ''While such tools don't exist yet, I think we have to work hard and develop them.''
But he cautioned: ''If you take a 65-year-old and say here is an image of what you will look like at 90, that could be potentially very scary. It might have the opposite effect from what we want and make people want to spend now.''

HEADLINE: As Europe Kicks Coal Habit, Hungarian Town Feels Pangs

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
OROSZLANY, Hungary -- When the directors of Hungary's last remaining coal-fired power plant announced that they would close the coal mine and begin dismantling the plant at the end of this year, the news sent shock waves through this weathered industrial city, where a statue of three miners stands in the square.
It was well known that the legendary Vertesi plant and its mine were kept afloat only by more than $30 million in annual state subsidies. But more than 3,000 of Oroszlany's 20,000 residents work in industries related to coal. The government-owned plant is one of the town's biggest taxpayers. And the area's 5,000 homes, its stores and its factories all get their heat from the Vertesi plant.
''We know that coal is an old technique that is not sustainable here, but we have not found an alternative,'' said Gabor Rajnai, Oroszlany's mayor. ''Everyone is thinking about how are we going to keep warm in winter.'' 
The Vertesi plant will be allowed to continue limited operations for three years after the mine's closure, in part to buy time for the town to find a heating alternative.
Determined to reduce Europe's reliance on coal, the European Commission is fighting a complicated battle against the subsidies that have long sustained coal, an influential but polluting industry in Europe and in the United States. In May, the Brussels-based governing body for the European Union announced that economic bailouts and favors for coal mines and power plants were forbidden after this year, precipitating Vertesi's demise.
As countries endeavor to reduce their fossil fuel emissions, many are trying to wean themselves from over-reliance on coal, the most highly emitting fuel. But coal is also the lifeblood of communities from Hungary and Germany to Kentucky and West Virginia, providing jobs, power and warmth. Last year, when President Obama's budget proposal included the elimination of some tax credits and deductions tied to coal, as well as oil and natural gas, there was furious protest from coal states, and Congress never enacted the changes. A similar presidential budget will be voted on again this fall.
Though the European Union generally prohibits national subsidies, coal, considered a vital source of energy, had long been an exception. But that logic has shifted as concerns over global warming have grown and better sources of renewable energy have become available.
In 2007, the European Union committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, producing 20 percent of its energy from renewable energy sources.
''If we want to lower our carbon emissions, why on earth -- of all industries -- does the coal industry get this preferential treatment?'' asked Connie Hedegaard, the European Union's commissioner for climate action. Coal is often referred to as a ''cheap'' fuel, but that designation is not always accurate, energy analysts say. In some places where coal is used, cheaper resources are now available, and the label does not take into account the pollution caused by burning coal.
The European Union's emissions trading system effectively forces power companies to pay for some of coal's excessive emissions. But even in the United States, where no such penalty exists, generating electricity from wind turbines, which draw on local resources, may be cheaper than importing coal in some places.
In many parts of the world, coal-fired plants and mines rely on government assistance for some of their profits, if not their survival. In the United States, the coal industry benefits from federal tax breaks and gets indirect support through the availability of tax-exempt bonds, loan guarantees and lien accommodations to support investment in coal plants. The European Union's goal is not to completely eliminate coal but to replace it, where it is not economical, with cleaner forms of power. But ending coal subsidies is not easy.
In Europe, Germany and Spain objected vigorously to the proposed Dec. 31 deadline, arguing that the recession made revoking subsidies this year impractical. Coal accounts for 30 percent of electricity production and 17 percent of energy consumption in the European Union.
In fact, Europe passed the first law phasing out operating subsidies to the coal industry in 2002 -- and the deadline had been moved back repeatedly. Some countries, like France and Italy, have ended subsidies. Some subsidies, like those intended to retrain former miners or to clean up mining sites, were not prohibited.
Bowing to pressure, the exasperated ministers of the European Union said in July that they would grant a very limited extension of certain subsidies until 2014, but with a host of new stipulations. For example, subsidies can now be awarded ''only in the context of a closure plan'' that fully shuts the plants by January 2014, and they have to be reduced 33 percent every 15 months. And money cannot be used to obtain access to new coal reserves. The proposal will be voted on this year.
''In many places, European coal is not competitive but quite a lot of people work in the sector,'' said Marlene Holzner, a spokeswoman for Energy Commissioner Gunther Oettinger. ''The idea was to help these regions phase out coal so there wouldn't be such a hard effect on employment.''
Like a number of coal towns, Oroszlany has spent recent years running in front of a tidal wave of environmentalism that now threatens to drown it. The town had previously been told that the coal mine would close in 2014 and the plant in 2020.
Before the global recession, Oroszlany built a new industrial park to attract small manufacturing -- General Electric has a factory there -- to provide jobs once coal had died. But that effort is still young.
''We knew the mine wouldn't work forever, but this is just too fast,'' said the mayor, who was previously the principal at a school run by Vertesi. He noted that Hungary had in part replaced coal by buying natural gas from Russia, which does not have to live up to European Union emissions standards.
In the 1990s, there were 6,500 people working at the power plant; now there are 1,500. In 2009, 800 people lost their jobs and 300 are still unemployed, despite programs for job retraining. Vertesi still provides about 5 percent of the country's electricity.
Vertesi's leaders have spent much of the last decade upgrading ancient systems in an attempt to prove that the plant can be environmentally friendly. In 2005, they erected a new smokestack with fancy filters, and they have gotten grants to drastically revamp the power plant so that coal is now mixed 50-50 with renewable fuels like tree trunks and agricultural waste.
Today, men in shorts, baseball caps and wraparound sunglasses maneuver bales of hay to mix with the coal so that the plant qualifies for higher tariffs paid for green electricity, although its furnaces will not tolerate less than 50 percent coal.
But the miners, whose extended families have never known another profession, face greater uncertainty.
''After 20 years of work in the mine, your body is pretty damaged and so you're not so employable,'' said Csaba Fekete, 39, preparing for his shift.
Judit Bertalan, the local member of Parliament, who opposes the closure of the mine, said, ''Even though we are in the E.U., people in Hungary here think of it as a local issue.''
Beyond Fossil Fuels: Articles in this series examine innovative attempts to reduce the world's dependence on coal, oil and other carbon-intensive fuels, and the challenges faced.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 17, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the phasing out of European Union subsidies for coal mining and coal-fired plants misstated the nature of a goal set by the union for reducing member nations' reliance on fossil fuels. The union is committed to using renewable sources to produce 20 percent of its energy, not 20 percent of its electricity.

HEADLINE: Concerns Rise About Continuing-Care Enclaves

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
FOR middle- and upper-income retirees who had the money, it was almost a no-brainer in recent years to choose living in a continuing-care retirement community. They could move, as the need arose, from independent living to assisted care to skilled nursing care -- all without leaving the community.
Well-off older people like Charles W. Prine Jr. of Pittsburgh, a former home building executive, plunked down six-figure entrance fees for a spot in a spacious, well-kept colony with amenities like organized outings, prepared meals and musical performances.
''We thought it would be a great place to be,'' said Mr. Prine, 84, who, along with his wife, Elizabeth, moved into an independent living unit in nearby Mount Lebanon, in southwest Pennsylvania, in 2002. ''It was a kind of insurance so you could be taken care of, at the same price, when you or your spouse needed more care eventually.'' 
The community, then called the Covenant at South Hills, was one of about 1,900 aging-in-place operations -- many with waiting lists -- that sprouted around the country, especially in California, Florida, the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic states, and provided homes for 900,000 people.
Few of the communities -- about 80 percent of which are operated by nonprofit organizations -- have closed or gone bankrupt. But concerns are rising about their financial stability, entrance fees and how the fees are used, and reduced services. Governmental inquiries at several levels have voiced concerns and called on the communities' operators to disclose more information about their finances to residents and prospective customers.
Choosing to enter a continuing-care retirement community ''can be a difficult decision and is not without significant financial and other risks,'' said the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, in a report released in July.
Buyers should consult a lawyer before committing their savings to a promise of lifetime health care, said the G.A.O., which examined industry practices at the request of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. The committee produced a separate study of five communities.
Larry Minnix, president of the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, an industry group, said his group supported the G.A.O.'s recommendations because ''putting up an entry fee is a risk, perhaps a little risk, but it is a risk.''
According to the studies, the financial risk is that the operators could use the entrance fees, which this year averaged about $250,000, to cover operating costs or to pay debts from construction. The entrance fee is generally refundable to residents who move out or to their heirs.
Only 875, or fewer than half, of all such communities require entrance fees, said Robert G. Kramer, president of the National Investment Center for Services, Housing and Care, which provides financial data on housing for older residents.
In addition to the entrance fee, most residents pay a monthly bill of $2,000 or more that goes to pay for services and maintenance. Because the labor-intensive care for residents in poor health often costs more than the monthly fee, the money from new, healthier residents is sometimes used to help pay for the care of the less healthy.
But the flow of new customers has been endangered by the housing downturn, which has made it difficult for the elderly to sell homes or, at least, to sell them for the price they had anticipated. The communities are ''particularly vulnerable during economic downturns, as stagnant real estate markets drive down occupancy levels in independent living units,'' the G.A.O. report found.
The communities' financial models have also come under scrutiny as some heirs and former residents have begun to ask legislators to look into lengthy delays in recouping entrance fees.
Recently, questions have also been raised over whether entrance fees are taxable. One operator, the Classic Residence by Hyatt, now renamed Vi, tangled with the Internal Revenue Service over whether entrance fees were prepaid rent, which is taxable income. Tax officials decided that in Hyatt's case, the refundable portion was a loan and not taxable. But the I.R.S. cautioned that in other situations such fees might be counted as income.
Shivers also went through the industry when Erickson Retirement Communities, one of the largest operators with 19 communities and more than 23,000 residents in a dozen states, filed for bankruptcy protection last year after it accumulated $3 billion in debt in a major expansion effort. It emerged from bankruptcy in April after being sold to an investment firm.
State insurance regulators need to keep better tabs on the finances of such communities, Alicia P. Cackley, the G.A.O.'s director for financial marketing and community investment, told the Senate Aging Committee at a hearing in July.
The government's report noted that 12 states and the District of Columbia do not have specific rules governing the communities. The report looked specifically at the practices of eight states: California, Florida, Illinois, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.
Florida, which has 73 licensed continuing-care retirement communities with 30,000 residents, is stricter than most states and closely oversees the $1.4 billion industry there, the state insurance commissioner, Kevin M. McCarty, testified at the hearing.
After several prominent bankruptcies in Florida and nationally years ago, the regulatory climate for continuing-care retirement communities evolved, Mr. McCarty said. Florida's Legislature this year increased the amount of financial data that must be disclosed to prospective and current residents.
If that had been the case in Pennsylvania, Mr. Prine said, his community might have avoided bankruptcy last year. ''That cost the residents the $26 million we paid in refundable deposits,'' he said. ''We didn't get a penny back.''
Concordia Lutheran Ministries, of Pittsburgh, bought the community, renamed it Concordia of the South Hills, and honored the residency agreements and the life-care contracts. But about 100 residents are suing the previous owner, B'nai B'rith Housing, a nonprofit affiliate of B'nai B'rith International, as well as the parent organization, to recoup their entrance fees.
Michael Plummer, a lawyer for Mr. Prine and other residents, said: ''B'nai B'rith International set up an affiliate called Covenant at South Hills, and had its own directors and officers serving as the affiliate's directors and officers.
''B'nai B'rith International contracted with the affiliate to receive a $1 million licensing fee and half of the facility's net operating income in exchange for use of its name and logo in marketing. Seniors relied on B'nai B'rith's reputation when they decided to move into the facility and pay their entrance fees.''
In effect, Mr. Plummer said, B'nai B'rith Housing and the Covenant at South Hills, ''were shell organizations run by B'nai B'rith International.''
B'nai B'rith Housing submitted written testimony to the Senate aging committee after its July hearing, explaining that ''for a variety of reasons, including unfavorable economic conditions, the Covenant failed to meet all of its pro forma projections.''
The project was weighed down by debt, the statement said, but the testimony -- which did not list any names -- insisted that B'nai B'rith executives had participated ''in many personal visits, town-hall style meetings and teleconferences, all of which gave the residents a forum to share concerns.''
Sharon Bender, spokeswoman for B'nai B'rith International and the housing affiliate, said the two groups were ''affiliated nonprofit companies, neither of which has ownership interest in the other.'' The written statement to Congress, she said, ''stands as what we have,'' adding, ''We're not going beyond that testimony.''
Mr. Minnix of the industry group said that a clear majority of such communities were nonprofits, adding: ''This concept extends back 150 years or more. Masons, Catholics and others sponsored them to take care of the aging. Later they were called 'life care'; then about 40 years ago, the modern version, with comprehensive-care campuses, started. It was a form of insurance for prepaid care.''
The Senate Aging Committee study, which did not identify the communities it had examined, found that ''all five of the entities are either experiencing cash flow problems, struggling with debt or both.''
Despite investing their life savings, residents and their concerns have often been ignored, and they have been excluded from their community's governing council, said Katherine C. Pearson, a Pennsylvania State University law professor who specializes in legal issues and aging.
''My sense is that facilities are moving in the direction of complexity'' in their finances, she said, ''sometimes driven by the need for more cash or resources to stay solvent.''
Few residents complain, she said, because ''they fear they will be shunned, encouraged to leave their homes or subjected to other negative response if they talk about what they perceive as problems.''
Even so, residents' groups call her weekly, she said, to ask for advice.
''We have to see whether we're past the worst, or if we're at the start of a more difficult period for these facilities financially,'' said Professor Pearson. ''They're not out the woods yet.''

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption in the special Retirement section on Thursday, with an article about some financial risks in continuing-care communities, misstated the target of a lawsuit by residents of one such community, Concordia of the South Hills, in Mount Lebanon, Pa. A suit seeking to recover entrance fees was filed against the community's previous owner, B'nai B'rith Housing, and its parent, B'nai B'rith International; it does not name the community itself, which is now owned by Concordia Lutheran Ministries of Pittsburgh.

HEADLINE: A G.O.P. Rebel Marches On, the Past in Her Way

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and JIM RUTENBERG. 
Jennifer Steinhauer reported from Dover, and Jim Rutenberg from New York. Barclay Walsh contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
DOVER, Del. -- In the bright light of Wednesday morning, Christine O'Donnell, whose Republican primary victory upended the calculus for future control of the United State Senate, became quickly known to Americans as the woman who once made dire warnings about the negative impact of masturbation.
But Ms. O'Donnell's decisive victory over one of the state's most popular and longest-serving Republicans was also the latest and perhaps most stark example of the chasm between the standard-bearers of the party, whose calling card over a decade of elections has been discipline and unity, and the disenchanted and highly motivated Tea Party movement on the right.
Ms. O'Donnell, 41, who grew up in New Jersey and has lived in Delaware for roughly a half-dozen years, spent the 1990s helping run a sexual morality movement aimed at fellow Gen Xers. But she is largely unknown statewide, in spite of other runs for the Senate. 
Even in this woolly primary season, Ms. O'Donnell emerges as a striking departure from the typical Senate candidate. She has struggled for years with personal finance problems -- she has reported earnings of only $5,800 between most of this year and last and she has defaulted on her mortgage -- and fudged her educational background and past campaign achievement, much of which was dredged up and disseminated by her own party.
She was also attacked by Republicans and Democrats both for her right-of-center positions -- including her role in an abstinence organization in the 1990s that denounced masturbation as a form of adultery and her characterization of President Obama in 2008 as ''anti-American'' -- in a state that has been traditionally proudly centrist.
She was ripped into in an interview with a conservative talk radio host for overstating how close she once came to beating Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose former Senate seat she seeks again, and denounced by Karl Rove as unelectable and untruthful, with Ms. O'Donnell saying ''a lot of nutty things'' moments after her victory.
If Ms. O'Donnell is concerned about beginning her campaign with something less than unbridled enthusiasm from her party (the state Republican Party's Web site did not even acknowledge her victory) and what that may portend for raising money in a state that a month ago looked solidly in Republican hands, it is not evident.
''Karl Rove said I could never win a primary,'' she said Tuesday night in a brief interview. ''It would be great if I could have their help, but if they choose to be sore losers that's O.K..'' Grass-roots supporters would get her through the general election, too, she said.
By tapping into regional and ideological strongholds in the state -- largely in the south -- like other Tea Party candidates who claimed victories in Alaska and New York -- she was able to push out Representative Michael N. Castle, who had won multiple statewide races and was widely seen as a senatorial shoo-in.
''South Delaware Republicans have been strongly anti-abortion, against gun control of any kind, and far more conservative on a host of social issues,'' said Joseph A. Pika, a political science professor at the University of Delaware.
Tuesday's primary represents ''a major chapter in the civil war among Republicans,'' he said, ''that has been building for some time and the Tea Party's involvement has brought that below-the-surface tensions to a head.''
But in a general election a concern among seasoned Republican political operatives is Ms. O'Donnell's policy positions, which, while generally in keeping with fellow conservatives, could make her a tough sell in a generally liberal state like Delaware.
When Ms. O'Donnell ran for the Senate in 2006, she described herself in an interview as, ''Republican, but not a Delaware Republican.''
Ms. O'Donnell has taken positions against federal financing for stem cell research, is opposed to abortion even in cases of rape and favors tough penalties against businesses that hire illegal immigrants. She has also suggested in past television interviews that evolution is soft science, and questioned the utility of financing AIDS programs.
Ms. O'Donnell's political and religious interests grew in tandem in her early 20s, said Kelli Horta, who shared her childhood with the Senate candidate in a middle-class neighborhood in southern New Jersey.
''She really got on fire with politics, and that is when her faith started to grow,'' Ms. Horta said, ''and she got on this path of things that were important to her. She wanted to make a change.''
In the 1990s, Ms. O'Donnell, a Roman Catholic who for a time considered herself an evangelical, founded SALT (the Savior's Alliance for Lifting the Truth'') and appeared on MTV's ''Sex in the Nineties'' to explain the values of chastity.
Ms. Horta said Ms. O'Donnell delighted in debating matters of faith: ''I have been with her and when she's sharing she does it in a loving way, she doesn't do it in a condescending way. She feels she is following biblical principles.''
Ms. O'Donnell, an avid cook, was disappointed that she had not married and had children, Ms. Horta said. ''That is one thing she had hoped for in her life, but again because of her faith she felt, 'Whatever God has for me, I will accept.' ''
Calls to Ms. O'Donnell were not returned Wednesday, though in an interview Tuesday night at the Elks club here, she said her priorities as a senator would be to repeal the health care law, create health care vouchers for veterans and block any attempts at cap-and-trade legislation.
''We need a private-sector free-market approach to economic recovery,'' she said.
But Ms. O'Donnell's personal and political economies have suffered turmoil. In her unsuccessful 2006 bid for the Senate, federal election officials cited Ms. O'Donnell several times for failing to properly disclose campaign donations. A file in a 2007 Federal Election Commission dossier features a note she wrote by hand pleading, ''We are not professionals and for many of us, this was our first campaign!''
Campaign finance issues resurfaced this time around, with her campaign showing debt of more than $20,000 as of last spring. Before that, she received a warning to appoint a new treasurer after the abrupt resignation of Susan Dixon from the position.
On Wednesday, Ms. Dixon refused to discuss why she left the campaign, or, for that matter, whether she continued to support Ms. O'Donnell. ''I don't really reveal that to anyone,'' Ms. Dixon said.
On Election Day, another ex-aide, Kristin Murray, a campaign manager for her in 2008, said in a recorded phone call to state voters, ''As O'Donnell's manager, I found out she was living on campaign donations -- using them for rent and personal expenses.''
Ms. O'Donnell responded to that call -- sponsored by the Delaware Republican Party -- by denying many of the charges and saying she had fired Ms. Murray.
Yet, she told a reporter for The News Journal of Wilmington last March that her campaign had paid half the rent on her town house there because it doubled as her headquarters, one of several financial oddities enumerated in an article in that paper. Also included was an Internal Revenue Service lien for $11,744 in back taxes and penalties from 2005 which Ms. O'Donnell attributed to an error made by the federal agency and a 2008 mortgage default judgment on her home.
Further, while Ms. O'Donnell claimed for several years that she was a graduate of Fairleigh Dickinson University, in fact she attained her bachelor's degree in English literature only this summer. She said that while she participated in the cap-and-gown ceremony nearly two decades ago, she was unable to formally graduate because of unpaid tuition.
In the campaign's final weeks, her Republican opponents constantly raised these issues, but none of it was enough to dampen the Tea Party enthusiasm that propelled her to victory.
National Republican officials believe this all adds up to an unelectable candidate. The National Republican Senatorial Committee on Wednesday committed $42,000 to her campaign, but it was unclear whether it would support her efforts with the extensive advertising it affords to its promising candidates. Without flipping the seat formerly held by Vice President Biden, it would be difficult for Republicans to take back the Senate.
Ms. Horta said she predicted her old friend would prevail. ''She is extremely resilient,'' she said.

The error also appeared in an editorial on Thursday about the results of the primary elections.

HEADLINE: Fiat Shareholders Approve Plan to Split the Company

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
The Fiat Group gained approval from shareholders on Thursday to spin off its industrial business from its automotive unit, a move the company hoped would lead the stock market to view the two halves more positively than the whole. 
''The demerger of the group and the creation of two separate entities will finally solve a strategic issue that has for years been a thorn in the side of Fiat,'' Sergio Marchionne, the Fiat chief executive, told shareholders at a meeting in Italy.
He said investors had long speculated about the potential value that could be realized from splitting up the company. The automotive side is essentially a retailing business, he said, while the industrial side is essentially a capital goods business.
Mr. Marchionne, who also runs Chrysler, said the American automaker could hold an initial public offering by the end of next year. He said Fiat, which bought a 20 percent stake in Chrysler last year, hoped to raise its stake to 35 percent by then.
Fiat's deal with the United States, worked out when Chrysler was in bankruptcy, gives Fiat the right to raise its stake to 51 percent, subject to meeting performance targets.
Fiat announced in April that it planned to spin off Fiat Industrial, which makes Iveco trucks as well as agricultural and marine equipment. It will operate independently, with its own management and board, and a listing on the Milan stock exchange is expected next year.
The automobile business includes the Fiat, Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari and Maserati car brands, as well as Magneti Marelli and Teksid auto parts, Comau robotics and FPT Powertrain Technologies.
''The capital goods component has been undervalued within the group,'' said Gabriele Gambarova, an analyst at Banca Akros in Milan. ''The car business is more of a long-term play.''
The market views the industrial business as more valuable because research and development costs in the business are low and profit margins are high, he said.
Michael Tyndall, an auto specialist at Nomura International in London, said capital goods companies tended to trade at one or more times sales, while European automakers tended to trade at only 15 percent to 40 percent of sales -- a strong incentive to split the group.
''These are different kinds of businesses with different capital needs and also different possibilities in terms of alliances,'' Mr. Tyndall said. The move could help Fiat to prepare for an outright combination with Chrysler, he said, but any such effort would be ''quite a ways'' into the future.
Nonetheless, Mr. Gambarova said, Chrysler was ''part of the solution'' to Fiat's troubles, as the American company would help it reap economies of scale and gain access to overseas markets.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Ends Mixed as Data Reflects a Sluggish Recovery

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stock prices were little changed on Thursday as investors reacted cautiously to data suggesting that the recovery remained halting.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's survey of regional business conditions showed that manufacturing activity was nearly flat in September, while claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a two-month low but still remained high.
The mildly reassuring data reduced investors' expectations that the Federal Reserve, which meets on Tuesday, would renew quantitative easing in the form of large debt purchases aimed at stimulating the economy. 
The latest snapshot of the labor market and the regional factory sector data reinforced the view of a slowing economy but not one on the cusp of slipping into recession or deflation.
''We are just in the same growth path we were before the double-dip fears -- that is why the market is just kind of stuck, volumes are kind of low, and there is no conviction one way or the other,'' said John Canally, investment strategist and economist for LPL Financial in Boston.
He added: ''Jobless claims were good, corporate earnings data not so good, and that's the tug of war you are in today.''
The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 22.10 points, or 0.21 percent, at 10,594.83. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 0.41 point, or 0.04 percent, at 1,124.66. The Nasdaq rose 1.93 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,303.25.
Shares in FedEx fell 3.7 percent to $82.72 after the delivery company forecast quarterly profit below Wall Street's expectations and warned that the recovery might slow. FedEx is seen as an economic barometer because of the wide number of industries it serves.
In overseas markets, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares ended 0.8 percent lower, its lowest closing level in a week, after a report of disappointing British retail sales in August, a sign that its economy was on a slow growth path.
''Times are difficult because of the combination of high unemployment, banks not lending yet and governments starting to implement austerity measures. All these factors are not going to be resolved overnight,'' said Franz Weis, a fund manager at Comgest in Paris.
The dollar rose slightly against the yen a day after Japan's huge intervention to weaken its currency. The Bank of Japan's money market data showed that the yen-selling intervention may have totaled around 1.76 trillion to 1.86 trillion yen ($20.52 billion to $21.69 billion).
Gold rose to a record high, before closing up $7.20 at $1,275.25 as worries about further yen selling and broader economic uncertainty enticed more investors to the safe-haven commodity. Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Japan would take further action in currency markets, if needed.
The dollar was trading late in the day in New York at 85.78 yen, compared with 85.62 on Wednesday.
The currency intervention was intended to protect Japanese exports from a competitive exchange rate and ward off job losses. But analysts said Japanese authorities might have a hard time fighting the yen's strength, given narrow yield spreads between Japanese and United States government bonds.
''It is almost inevitable that the Japanese authorities will have to continue intervention heading into year end with dollar/yen likely to remain under downward pressure as the U.S. economy slows and the Fed moves toward renewed monetary easing,'' said Lee Hardman, currency economist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London.
The euro rose to its highest level in more than a month against the dollar, climbing to $1.3080 from $1.3006 a day earlier.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 10/32 to 98 27/32, with its yield rising to 2.76 percent from 2.72 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: China's Rise Complicates Goal of Using Less Energy

BYLINE: By IAN JOHNSON and KEITH BRADSHER; Ian Johnson reported from Beijing and Keith Bradsher from Chengdu, China.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Despite huge investment in new technologies, China is finding it difficult to make its economy more energy-efficient, a senior official said Thursday.
The acknowledgment of difficulties by Zhang Laiwu, deputy minister for science and technology, comes as China has become the world's largest auto market and is spending heavily on high-speed rail and other infrastructure projects that require a lot of steel and cement, which are energy-intensive to make.
A top Chinese auto executive predicted Thursday at a conference in Chengdu that annual auto sales in China would reach 40 million vehicles by 2020, more than twice the peak of the American market before the recent economic downturn. That could add to China's energy-efficiency challenges, as more people drive cars rather than use mass transit. 
Mr. Zhang said the country still hoped to reach a self-imposed goal of reducing ''energy intensity'' by 20 percent over the five-year period ending at the end of 2010. After strong progress from 2007 to 2009, this year saw some slippage, Mr. Zhang said at a news conference.
''We still have a lot of challenges,'' he said. ''We should not be too optimistic about this.''
During the first quarter the trend moved in the wrong direction as energy intensity -- measured as energy use per unit of output -- actually increased, Mr. Zhang said. Analysts say that this mainly reflected infrastructure investments associated with China's substantial stimulus program in 2008 and 2009.
In response, China's cabinet in May passed a series of measures to cut energy use, including closing thousands of factories with outdated equipment. Those measures helped China reverse the trend, Mr. Zhang said.
Some of the measures are continuing, including a recent announcement that China's largest steel producer, the Hebei Iron and Steel Group, would cut production 6 percent. The measures are already being felt overseas; in a report Thursday, HSBC said the measures would help bolster global steel prices by limiting the supply of steel from China.
China's struggles show that the country is determined to make progress, said Deborah Seligsohn, a Beijing-based senior fellow at the World Resources Institute. In years past, officials might have doctored statistics to get the result they wanted, but now they want the numbers to reflect real change, she said.
''They are treating this incredibly seriously,'' Ms. Seligsohn said. ''Local officials are expressing anxiety about not meeting the targets.''
The long-term solution is for China to move beyond its current structure as a low-cost, high-resource economy, Mr. Zhang said. ''The essential issue for us is whether we are able to move from a low-end to a high-end and to a science-based and knowledge-based economy,'' he said.
Beijing has aimed at 16 major areas for increased efficiency and has channeled more than $300 million into electric cars. Over all, China has invested $1.5 billion in green technologies over the last five years, he said.
But critics say China's green-energy programs so far are focused more on exporting products like solar panels, rather than domestic use of such technology. The American-based United Steelworkers union filed a detailed petition last week with the United States government, accusing the Chinese government of providing export subsidies for clean-energy equipment in violation of the World Trade Organization's prohibition on export subsidies.
Mr. Zhang said that China's clean-energy policies did not violate W.T.O. rules. ''After China acceded to the W.T.O., every decision has been in line with W.T.O. rules, and this is no exception,'' he said.
While China is investing heavily in electric cars, they are still years away from reaching the market in numbers large enough to affect overall Chinese energy consumption, executives said Thursday at the Global Automotive Forum in Chengdu.
Xiao Guopu, vice president of the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, one of China's largest automakers, said his company planned to sell 20,000 plug-in hybrids in 2012 and 50,000 in 2015, with electric cars still being developed.
Wang Dazong, the president of Beijing Auto, said China's vehicle market would rise to 40 million in 2020 from about 17 million this year.
By comparison, the American market leveled off at 16 million to 17 million in its best years before the current economic downturn and is on track for closer to 12 million this year, said Yale Zhang, a vehicle market forecaster in Shanghai, who added that he expected the market in China to be closer to 30 million in 2020.

HEADLINE: A Baby Step Toward Rules On Bank Risk

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Two years later, the banks hope we have forgotten.
It should be well known how we got into the financial crisis that brought on a worldwide recession and financial crisis. The banks acted horribly irresponsibly and had far too little capital and liquidity to survive without bailouts.
This past weekend, the Basel committee of banking regulators put out their new capital standards. The best that can be said about the new standards is that they are better than the old ones. But opposition from many European countries, as well as Japan, assured that the rules were not nearly as tough as they could be.
A worldwide consensus that new rules were needed to assure that banks had sufficient liquidity -- resources they could convert to cash, even in a panic -- came to little. The Basel group still promises to come up with something, but don't hold your breath.
Similarly, there was a consensus that a new regulatory regime had to force banks to build up capital in good times, so it would be available in bad times. But there are no new rules on that. 
Bank stocks spurted up on the news. But the banks still found reason to complain.
''It is imperative that capital requirements do not weaken banks' ability to assist in the economic recovery,'' said Steve Bartlett, the president of the Financial Services Roundtable, an organization of large American financial institutions.
''Every dollar of capital is one less dollar working in the economy,'' the roundtable added.
The banks would like us to forget that it was undercapitalized financial institutions that got us into this mess. They created a shadow financial system that could make loans with far less capital than even the inadequate amount the regulations then in effect demanded. They hid their risks off their balance sheets even though, when push came to shove, they still were liable for the losses.
Now, however, their mantra is that the only way to revive the economy is for regulators to refrain from imposing tough rules.
There are competing academic papers now circulating on this issue. The Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' central bank and the parent body of the Basel accords, released one study this summer that concluded there would be minor short-term reductions in economic activity stemming from tougher capital rules, but that in the longer run the effect would be minimal. Bankers see worse effects, but, of course, they assume that what happened in 2008 will never happen again.
Another paper, by three academics from Stanford and one from the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods in Bonn, Germany, concluded that the bankers' arguments ignored the social costs of bailouts. ''The bottom line is that leverage is not essential to any of the functions of the bank that create value,'' said Anat R. Admati, a Stanford professor and one of the authors. Capital requirements, she added, ''should be increased dramatically.''
In the Basel deliberations, which led to the decision to punt some issues and to stretch out needed capital increases for many years, the split seems to have been between the really major financial centers -- whose regulators have learned a lesson and now want tough regulations -- and the others.
That split makes sense. In the world we were in a few years ago, we now know, the bankers could take excessive risks and reap the profits until the risks came home to roost. Then governments would take the losses via bailouts needed to avert financial collapse.
That worked well for bankers and for those who lent money to the banks, if not for their shareholders. But governments with very large financial systems learned that the costs could be excessive. Ireland now has a bailout bill it may not have the capacity to pay.
The proponents of tougher capital standards are said to have been the United States, Britain and Switzerland. Those are also the homes to the largest banks and the countries with the most to lose if another crisis blows up.
Other European countries and Japan were much less worried. Germany has a large group of state-owned banks that will need more capital, and it pushed to delay as long as possible. Some other countries, like France, have long supported whatever their banks wanted, whether it was weak capital rules or accounting standards that would let them hide losses.
It is now up to the major regulators to forge ahead and impose tough standards. In doing that, they will face the threat of two types of ''regulatory arbitrage.'' The first comes from bank threats to move their headquarters to another country, something British banks have warned they will do if they are taxed too heavily. The countries need to keep that in mind, but they also need to be willing to stand up to it. Will investors seek a premium interest rate when lending to a bank that obviously fled strong regulation? If so, the potential for such arbitrage is reduced.
The second type of arbitrage is what happened in the last cycle. That was the siphoning of financial activity out of the regulated financial system and into the shadow banking system.
That may not be as easy to do this time around. The Dodd-Frank financial regulations in the United States and the new Basel requirements both have provisions aimed at reducing the capital advantages of lending through the securitization market. The accounting rules have been -- belatedly -- changed to make it much harder to hide obligations off bank balance sheets. And for now at least, burned investors show little desire to finance new private securitizations.
In the end, though, the ability of the banking system to avoid a new crisis will depend in part on whether regulators are able to keep up with financial innovations -- which are often created primarily to avoid capital restraints -- and willing to step in even when things seem to be going well and when bankers warn, as they do now, that more regulation will damage the economy.
Some such innovations will nonetheless slip by, and credit standards will slip again. There is likely to be a new and different financial crisis well before the new Basel rules are fully phased in.
Then the question will be twofold. First, have the new rules left banks with enough capital to withstand the crisis? For some, the answer will be they have not. But it does not make much difference to the national economy, let alone the world economy, if a small bank in Boise goes under. It is what regulatory jargon now calls the Sifis, standing for ''systemically important financial institutions'' and pronounced something like ''sissies,'' that really matter.
So the second question is, what will happen to the Sifis? The Dodd-Frank law requires the Federal Reserve to come up with stronger regulations for them, and grants it the authority to apply the label to companies other than banks and to then regulate them. How well the Fed does that may determine whether the next crisis proves to be as debilitating as the recent one was.
That is why the response this week from the Financial Services Roundtable -- an organization whose members include all the American Sifis -- was so disheartening. To say that ''every dollar of capital is one less dollar working in the economy,'' is to ignore the lessons of the recent past.
As I thought about it, I recalled an exchange I had in business school nearly three decades ago. A fellow student, having taken classes I had not yet encountered, was spouting what sounded like nonsense to me.
Having learned of the tax deductibility of interest payments on borrowed money, and of the fact that return on equity would rise if a company could spread the profits over as small an equity base as possible, he announced that companies should borrow all the money they could. Having a strong balance sheet was, he said, stupid.
What, I asked, if they went so far into debt that they went bankrupt?
Well, he responded after thinking it over, they should stop just short of borrowing enough to leave them broke.
In the real world, it is never easy to know just how much that may be.
If your corner dry cleaner borrows too much, the impact on the economy is negligible and there is little reason for the government to try to prevent it.
But the collapse of Lehman Brothers two years ago this week showed the systemic impact of allowing a major financial institution to become dangerously overleveraged. Whatever the hesitations of politicians in Paris and Tokyo, regulators in Washington, London and Zurich must act to prevent a recurrence. If that means rules that are tougher than those in other countries, so be it.

HEADLINE: A Take on Faith and Capitalism

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
Bizarre and beautiful, disturbing and droll, ''The Temptation of St. Tony'' wonders what it means to be a good man. Kicking off with a quotation from Dante's ''Inferno,'' this delirious sophomore feature from the Estonian filmmaker Veiko Ounpuu observes Tony (Taavi Eelmaa), a triumphantly depressed middle manager. Dissatisfied with his adulterous wife and a boss who orders him to sack all his factory workers, Tony descends into a midlife crisis that manifests itself as a series of increasingly hilarious, horrific visions. 
Or are they? Looking like a grown-up version of the hero of ''Eraserhead,'' Tony seems at times a two-dimensional character traversing a multidimensional, Lynchian landscape. Greeting every experience -- his father's funeral, a pile of severed hands, an abused girl (Ravshana Kurkova) -- with a single, stunned expression, he questions not only his faith but also the utility of morality. At the same time, his marriage, friendships and emptied-out factory, defined by depravity and desolation, symbolize an ethical void that's terrifyingly familiar.
Etched in glowing black and silver, Tony's more extreme adventures --in satanic nightclubbing, in cannibalism -- occasionally verge on schlock. But the cinematographer Mart Taniel (who also shot Mr. Ounpuu's terrific first film, ''Sugisball'') is rarely less than inspired. Soaking the screen in five shades of gray, he films vast scrublands where dead trees and sucking swamps offer reluctant cover to dismembered women and jobless men. As Townes Van Zandt's ''Dollar Bill Blues'' strums on the soundtrack, Mr. Ounpuu, like an Estonian Michael Moore, questions whether capitalism and goodness can coexist. We're all still waiting for the answer to that one.
THE TEMPTATION OF ST. TONY
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.
Written and directed by Veiko Ounpuu; director of photography, Mart Taniel; music by Ulo Krigul; produced by Katrin Kissa; released by Olive Films. At the Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village. In Estonian, Russian, English and French, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 50 minutes. This film is not rated.
WITH: Taavi Eelmaa (Tony), Ravshana Kurkova (Nadezhda), Tiina Tauraite (Tony's Wife), Sten Ljunggren (Herr Meister), Denis Lavant (Count Korzybski) and Rain Tolk (Kleine Willy).

HEADLINE: Hoping to Keep Majority, Democrats Wield It

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Thursday approved a multi-billion dollar package of tax breaks and government-backed loans for small businesses, as Democrats sought to use the muscle of their majorities to pursue a Congressional agenda that would make their case for retaining control in the House and Senate this fall.
After surmounting months of Republican opposition to approve the small-business measure and send it to the House, Democrats -- over sharp Republican objections -- set up a floor showdown for next week over a Pentagon policy bill that also touches on the politically charged issues of immigration and gay men, lesbians and bisexuals in the military. 
The Pentagon bill would not only allow the repeal of the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy, but would also include legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who arrive in the United States before age 16, reside here for five years, earn a high school degree and complete two years of college or military service.
The immigration language is being added at the behest of the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, who is eager to mobilize Hispanic voters for his re-election campaign in Nevada, and it reflects a broader Democratic effort to secure support from Hispanic Americans nationwide by promising a comprehensive immigration bill in the future.
To underscore that commitment, President Obama met in the Oval Office on Thursday with three prominent Hispanic Democrats: Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Representatives Nydia M. Velazquez of New York and Luis V. Gutierrez of Illinois.
In the House, Democrats are pressing forward with legislation to promote American manufacturing, an issue of major resonance in some of the battleground states of the Rust Belt, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.
The renewed effort by Democrats to use their power in Congress to promote their agenda comes as a New York Times/CBS News poll shows voters dissatisfied with Democrats but even more so with Republicans. That could give Democratic incumbents, who are trailing in many polls, an opening in a year when they seem certain to lose seats.
Most of the measures are not likely to be completed before lawmakers leave Washington to campaign in early October, but Democrats said the legislative push was a good way to show voters, particularly their party's base, that they were battling on numerous fronts.
''We live in an information age,'' said Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington. ''Every day that can define what you are for and what you're not for is helpful.''
With the two parties also locked in a major fight over what to do about a set of expiring tax cuts, the legislative maneuvering was infuriating Senate Republicans, who said the Democrats were abusing the floor to try to score political points.
Senator John McCain of Arizona, the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said the Democrats were turning a normally bipartisan military measure into a vehicle to advance social policy priorities like immigration and gay rights.
''The majority leader is turning legislation on our national defense into a political football,'' Mr. McCain said.
Mr. Reid seemed only to inflame Republican anger when he conceded in a floor speech that the Pentagon measure had virtually no chance of being adopted until after the election but nonetheless called on Republicans to allow debate to begin next week.
''This bill should be an easy one,'' said the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. ''We should be a united body and give our troops a responsible defense policy bill they need, and then the defense appropriations bill they need. Without strings. Without games. And save the politics for the campaign trail.''
Mr. Reid scheduled a procedural vote for Tuesday, and Democrats need the support of 60 senators to bring the bill to the floor. The Democrats now nominally control 59 seats.
Democrats said they also intended to offer an amendment to the military bill that would end the practice of ''secret holds'' in the Senate, by which lawmakers can block a bill under the cloak of anonymity.
With the prospect of potentially steep losses in November, Democrats, led by President Obama, are counting on the small-business measure to illustrate their efforts to revive the faltering economy, and to define Republicans as obstructionists.
The vote on the small-business measure was 61 to 38, with just two Republicans, George V. Voinovich of Ohio and George LeMieux of Florida, joining Democrats in favor of it.
Mr. Voinovich is retiring after this year, and Mr. LeMieux is leaving after serving as a temporary successor to Mel Martinez, who retired last year. Every other Republican voted no except Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, who was absent.
In addition to providing tax breaks and enhancing a number of existing aid programs within the Small Business Administration, the legislation will create a $30 billion lending program within the Treasury that will channel government-backed loans through community banks.
Asked if he was disappointed that more Republicans had not supported the measure, Mr. LeMieux said, ''I'm just glad we were able to pass it.'' He noted that Florida has more than two million small businesses that stand to benefit from the legislation.
Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, the primary author of the bill, said she wished it had been approved eight months ago and blamed Republicans for delaying it. ''Every week that we've waited to pass this bill has been another tough week for small businesses throughout this country,'' Ms. Landrieu said.
She said that local bankers were eager to begin making loans and that credit could begin flowing shortly.
House Democratic leaders said they hope to pass the bill quickly and send it to Mr. Obama, who is eager to sign it.

HEADLINE: The Recession's Awful Impact

 BODY:
The Census Bureau's latest report on poverty and health insurance coverage is bleak. With millions of Americans out of work, it could hardly be otherwise.
The record number of people last year without health insurance -- 50.7 million, up from 46.3 million in 2008 -- provides stark evidence of why the country desperately needs the health care reforms enacted in March. It is also another reminder of why government safety-net programs, despite all of the recent demagoguery, are so essential in times of trouble. 
The report details the recession's huge human toll. The number of people living in poverty last year climbed to almost 43.6 million, up from 39.8 million in 2008. The percentage of people living in poverty also climbed -- to 14.3 percent, the highest rate since 1994. Poverty was defined as pretax cash income below about $22,000 for a family of four.
Federal assistance kept the damage from being even worse. Expanded unemployment benefits helped keep three million families above the poverty line. Food stamps and tax credits helped ease the pain for millions.
The driving force for the huge jump in the number of uninsured was a 6.5 million drop in private health care coverage as employers laid off workers or eliminated health benefits. The percentage of people covered by employment-based health insurance dropped to 55.8 percent in 2009 from 58.5 percent the previous year. That is the lowest level of employer coverage since 1987.
Again government programs picked up some of the slack. Medicaid, in particular, performed yeoman work, covering many of the laid-off workers with low incomes. That put a further strain on state budgets.
The new health reform law will ease these problems. It will greatly expand Medicaid for the poor (mostly at the federal government's expense) and will provide subsidies to middle-income people to help buy policies on new insurance exchanges. Most of these changes start in 2014, but some measures, such as tax credits to help small businesses cover their employees, will help people retain coverage right now.
These latest dismal numbers from the Census Bureau underscore why health care reform is vital. And they show, once again, why Republican vows to repeal it are exactly what the country doesn't need.

HEADLINE: Showdown on Emissions Attracts Out-of-Staters

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- A ballot initiative to suspend a milestone California law curbing greenhouse gas emissions is drawing a wave of contributions from out-of-state oil companies, raising concerns among conservationists as it emerges as a test of public support for potentially costly environmental measures during tough economic times.
Charles and David Koch, the billionaires from Kansas who have played a prominent role in financing the Tea Party movement, donated $1 million to the campaign to suspend the Global Warming Solutions Act, which was passed four years ago, and signaled that they were prepared to invest more in the cause. With their contribution, proponents of the proposition have raised $8.2 million, with $7.9 million coming from energy companies, most of them out of state.
This latest embrace by the Koch brothers of a conservative cause jolted environmental leaders who are worried that a vote against the law in this state -- with its long history of environmental activism -- would amount to a powerful setback for emission control efforts in Washington and statehouses across the country. 
''It would have big implications,'' said George P. Shultz, the former secretary of state, who is a chairman of a campaign to defeat the ballot initiative. ''That is one reason why these outside companies are pouring money in to try to derail the same thing. At the same time, the reverse is true: they put this fat in the fire and if we win, that also sends a message.''
Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, who has been traveling California to rally support against the proposition, called it ''by far the single most important ballot measure to date testing public support for continuing to move to a clean energy economy.''
The campaign against California's greenhouse gas law comes as business groups have invested heavily across the country in trying to defeat members of Congress who voted for a cap-and-trade bill that also mandated emission reductions; the bill passed the House but failed in the Senate in the face of strong opposition from lawmakers in industrial states.
Traditionally, public support for environmental measures suffers during tough economic times. Here in California, backers of the initiative have seized on that anxiety -- which is particularly acute in this state, with its 12.3 percent unemployment rate -- in search of a victory.
''I believe the battle over cap and trade in America is taking place in California on Nov. 2 of this year,'' said Dan Logue, a Republican assemblyman from north-central California who wrote the ballot initiative. He added: ''What we're saying is, this is not the time for political correctness. This is a time for putting America back to work; let the experiments happen later.''
The law in question, known as A.B. 32, mandates slashing carbon and other greenhouse emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, by forcing power companies and industries to cap their emissions and by slashing carbon in gasoline. Some oil industry leaders said it would force them to invest millions of dollars to comply, and asserted that it would force companies to cut jobs and raise the price of gas at the pumps.
Although the vast majority of the money being contributed to fight the law is coming from oil companies, the oil industry is clearly not united in opposition: some major California oil refineries, including Chevron, have notably stayed out of the battle so far.
The ballot initiative, known as Proposition 23, would suspend the law from going into effect as scheduled in 2012 until state unemployment falls to 5.5 percent or lower for at least four consecutive quarters. That has happened only three times over the last 40 years, state officials said; thus, the proposition could have the practical effect of killing the law.
''The company believes that implementing A.B. 32 will cause significant job losses and higher energy costs in California,'' said Katie Stavinoha, a spokesman for Flint Hills Resources, the petroleum company in Wichita, Kan., owned by the Koch brothers. ''What's more, the company thinks it sets a bad precedent for other state and federal governments to do the same thing.''
That said, the issue hardly breaks cleanly along business lines, reflecting in part the diverse business environment in California, which has always had a strong research and development sector, powered by venture capitalists ready to finance cutting-edge technology. Many business groups have opposed the drive to suspend the greenhouse law, and the list of contributors backing the measure is notable for the absence of venture capitalists.
''There is a huge clean energy revolution going on: this is going to happen,'' said Thomas F. Steyer, founder of Farallon Capital Management, a hedge fund in San Francisco, and a co-chairman with Mr. Shultz of the campaign to defeat the proposition. ''If we're not careful, it's just not going to happen in the United States.''
Mr. Steyer has contributed $2.5 million to the effort to defeat the initiative and said he was prepared to contribute an additional $2.5 million.
Mr. Schultz said that since the passage of the law, ''a whole industry is developing here, and I might say a lot of jobs are connected with it.''
''There's been a virtual eruption of research and development activities of all kinds on alternate ways to produce and use energy,'' he said.
In most years, this should not be a worrisome battleground for environmentalists. The greenhouse gas law enjoyed strong support from the public when it passed four years ago, according to polls. The roster of opponents to Proposition 23 includes Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, who views the law as a defining accomplishment of his career here.
Early polling suggests that voters who know about the measure are evenly split.
Yet supporters said they were concerned that the proposition could slip through at a time when Democratic spirits are low. More significant is the question of how much more supporters of Prop 23 can raise to finance their campaign. Of the $8.2 million raised so far, $1 million came from the Koch firm, $4 million from the Valero Energy Corporation and $1.5 million from the Tesoro Corporation; both corporations are based in San Antonio.
''We have every reason to believe that they are going to put the money in to run a big television campaign in the most expensive media market in the country,'' said Annie Notthoff, the California advocacy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. ''We certainly are expecting to have a fight on our hands.''
Supporters of the law, if nervous about the proposition, remain optimistic than they can beat it back at the polls in November, and hope that such an outcome would have the opposite effect nationally that opponents of the bill are seeking. ''If the proposition loses, the lesson is going to be there's no going back,'' said Wesley P. Warren, director of programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

HEADLINE: Jobs Recovery in City Outpaces State and U.S.

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The job market in New York City continued to recover more strongly than in the rest of the state and the nation through the end of the summer, according to figures released Thursday by the State Labor Department.
Indeed, the city has accounted for all of the private-sector job growth in the state in the past year, the numbers show. During that time, the number of jobs in the private sector in the city has risen by 48,500, an increase of 1.6 percent. That is more than five times as fast as the nation's private-sector employment has grown over the same period.
Virtually all of the job growth in the city has occurred since the start of the calendar year. By one economist's calculation, the city has generated more than 10 percent of the nation's private-sector job gains in 2010. 
Much of that hiring is happening in retail stores, restaurants, private schools and health care facilities, said Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist with Eastern Consolidated, a real estate services firm in Manhattan. Last month, construction, which was one of the weakest industries during the recession, was a prime area of job growth, Ms. Denham said.
''These gains illustrate the strength of the city's economy compared to the national economy,'' she said.
The recovery of the city's job market has been quite broad: since August 2009, more industries have added jobs than have shed them, said James Brown, principal economist for the state's Labor Department. That had not happened since 2008, Mr. Brown said.
''It's been steadily broadening,'' he said.
Surprisingly, financial services was one of the industries that employed more people in the city last month than it had a year before, Mr. Brown noted. That gain, though it amounts to just 500 jobs, reflects how quickly Wall Street and the rest of the financial sector rebounded from the crisis that led to the collapse of two of the city's biggest investment banks, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.
''It's a very small gain, but it's notable because if you go back to last year, we were losing 35,000 jobs in that sector,'' Mr. Brown said. ''It's been apparent for the last few months that the bulk of the bleeding has stopped and financial services is not shedding jobs anymore.''
Still, there were more than 375,000 unemployed people in the city and more than 800,000 in the state last month. Less than two-thirds of them, about 515,000 state residents, collected unemployment benefits last month, according to the Labor Department.
The city actually lost about 3,800 private-sector jobs in August, but that decline was only about half as large as the typical loss in August. After it is adjusted for the usual late-summer drop, that loss will translate into a gain.
The city's unemployment rate, which is adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, held steady at 9.4 percent in August, after falling for the first seven months of 2010. It remained lower than the national unemployment rate, which rose to 9.6 percent in August.
The state's unemployment rate, which has been lower than the city's since the recession began more than two years ago, edged up to 8.3 percent in August from 8.2 percent in July.
But the jobs data paints a starkly different picture for the rest of the state than for the region around New York City.
Over the past year, the city and Long Island have added almost 60,000 private-sector jobs, while the rest of the state has lost several thousand jobs.

HEADLINE: Outdoor Recreation Chain Will Open Store in SoHo

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Yosemite. Denali. SoHo?
The downtown Manhattan neighborhood known for tourists and chain stores is, with New York City itself, becoming something of a destination for outdoor types. Or so a big West Coast retailer is betting.
Recreational Equipment Inc., an outdoor company based in Kent, Wash., announced Thursday that it would open its first New York City store in SoHo next fall, a few blocks from the New York flagship store of Eastern Mountain Sports.
REI had surveyed the Manhattan market for some time, the chief executive, Sally Jewell, said. The city's recent push to create accessible outdoor spaces had been a big factor, she said. 
''The effort put forth by New York to make it more safe and friendly for people to commute and make it safe to ride their bikes, and the work you're doing around urban greenways, ways for people to get green space in very packed urban areas,'' she said, had been ''encouraging.''
Thousands of New Yorkers shop at REI already, on the Web and in its stores, the company said. Nationwide, each of REI's 112 stores had a Manhattan resident among its shoppers in 2009, in places as far-flung as Tualatin, Ore. and Buford, Ga., the company said.
Frank Hugelmeyer, president and chief executive of the Outdoor Industry Association, a trade group, said it was no longer a secret among retailers that New York was ''an active city,'' especially as the bad economy had many Americans ''looking to recreate closer to home.''
He said nonprofit groups like Sustainable South Bronx had transformed urban areas into parks, and the city itself, particularly during the Bloomberg administration, had contributed by opening bike lanes and other open spaces. ''There's an incredible infrastructure that's been built,'' Mr. Hugelmeyer said.
Will Manzer, chief executive of Eastern Mountain Sports, said he had seen increasing demand from New Yorkers in recent years.
''It's probably one of our top, most vibrant markets,'' Mr. Manzer said. ''It's amazing the kind of outdoor business we actually do in Manhattan. We do a lot of gear business, where a lot of people might think we do a lot of apparel.''
Sales of bicycles and related equipment in particular, he said, had grown significantly.
''Mayor Bloomberg's my hero -- he's beat a lot of the other leaders of urban areas in bike paths,'' Mr. Manzer said. ''The economy's kind of built that trend as a reality. It's a cheap form of transportation.''
Businesses catering to the New Yorkers' sports whims, including rock-climbing gyms and Chelsea Piers, also helped create demand, as did the needs of traveling New Yorkers, he said, jetting off to helicopter-ski in Argentina or rock-climb in Australia.
REI's 39,000-square-foot space will occupy three stories of the Puck Building at 295 Lafayette Street, in what had been an event space. Faith Hope Consolo, chairman of the retail leasing, marketing and sales division at Prudential Douglas Elliman in New York, which did not work on REI's lease, said the location was a good one.
''SoHo is it,'' Ms. Consolo wrote by e-mail. ''This customer is much more likely to pack up the kids for a weekend of skiing, or hiking or camping outside the city, than in certain other areas. They also are more likely to use bicycles to get around, so the emphasis on services and repair will quickly endear REI to the community.''
In addition to selling equipment, REI will offer trips and educational programs as it does at its other retail stores. REI Outdoor School will run instructional programs outside of the store, like rock climbing in a local park or bicycle riding lessons for adults.
Mountaineers or explorers will visit the store to give lectures, and REI Adventures will offer longer trips, like a three-day kayaking outing on the Hudson. It will also offer bike repair, both a quick drop-in service and a full-service bike shop.
REI's arrival is likely to set off fierce competition for the outdoor dollar.
Although some sports retailers have stronger New York roots -- Modell's Sporting Goods opened in 1889 on Cortlandt Street, and Paragon Sports has been around since 1908 -- Mr. Manzer said he considered Eastern Mountain Sports ''New York's outdoor outfitter.'' The retailer, based in Peterborough, N.H., has been in the city since 1983.
Mr. Manzer said he received an e-mail Wednesday night from Ms. Jewell telling him about REI's SoHo plans.
''She's kind of a newcomer from the West,'' he said, ''so she'll kind of have to Yankee up, if you will, but she's good people.''

HEADLINE: The Backlash Myth

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Many of my liberal friends are convinced that the Republican Party has a death wish. It is sprinting to the right-most fever swamps of American life. It will end up alienating the moderate voters it needs to win elections.
There's only one problem with this theory. There is no evidence to support it. The Republican Party may be moving sharply right, but there is no data to suggest that this has hurt its electoral prospects, at least this year. 
I asked the election guru Charlie Cook if there were signs that the Tea Party was scaring away the independents. ''I haven't seen any,'' he replied. I asked another Hall of Fame pollster, Peter Hart, if there were Republican or independent voters so alarmed by the Tea Party that they might alter their votes. He ran the numbers and found very few potential defectors.
The fact is, as the Tea Party has surged, so has the G.O.P. When this primary season began in early February, voters wanted Democrats to retain control of Congress by 49 percent to 37 percent, according to an Associated Press-Gfk poll. In the ensuing months, Tea Party candidates won shocking victories in states from Florida to Alaska. The most recent A.P./Gfk poll now suggests that Americans want Republicans to take over Congress by 46 percent to 43 percent.
Nor is there evidence that the Tea Party's success has changed moderates' perceptions about Republicans generally. According to a survey published in July by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, Americans feel philosophically closer to the Republicans than to the Democrats. Put another way, many moderates see Democrats like Nancy Pelosi as more extreme than Republicans like John Boehner.
Nor is there any sign that alarm over the Tea Party is hurting individual Republican candidates. In Ohio, Republican Rob Portman has opened up a significant lead on his Democratic opponent. In Kentucky, Republican Rand Paul is way ahead, as is Marco Rubio in Florida. In Illinois, Republican Mark Kirk has a small lead, and Linda McMahon has pulled nearly even in Connecticut. Sharron Angle, a weak candidate, is basically tied with Harry Reid in Nevada.
This does not mean that moderate voters are signing up for the Glenn Beck-Sarah Palin brigades. Palin has a dismal 29 percent approval rating, according to a June Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. But it does mean that the essential dynamic of this election is still the essential dynamic. Voters are upset about the economy, the debt and the culture of Washington. The Democrats are the party of government and of the status quo. They have done their best to remind people of that. This week, Democratic voters renominated Charles Rangel, the epitome of Washington scandal. Democratic voters in the District of Columbia ousted Mayor Adrian Fenty, one of the nation's bravest education reformers, and replaced him with an orthodox pol.
Most voters want a radical change in government but not a radical change in policy. According to a New York Times/CBS News poll released this week, only 34 percent of Americans say their own representative deserves re-election. This is an astounding number.
It doesn't matter that public approval of the G.O.P. is now at its all-time low. It doesn't matter that the Tea Party rhetoric is sometimes extreme. The poll suggests that roughly 50 percent of Americans haven't thought about the Tea Parties enough to form an opinion. They're not paying attention because they don't see it as one of the important dangers they face. Who knows? Maybe they even sort of like the fact that a ragtag band of outsiders is taking on the establishment and winning.
This doesn't mean that the Tea Party influence will be positive for Republicans over the long haul. The movement carries viruses that may infect the G.O.P. in the years ahead. Its members seek traditional, conservative ends, but they use radical means. Along the way, the movement has picked up some of the worst excesses of modern American culture: a narcissistic sense of victimization, an egomaniacal belief in one's own rightness and purity, a willingness to distort the truth so that every conflict becomes a contest of pure good versus pure evil.
The Tea Party style is beginning to replicate itself in parts of the conservative world. Dinesh D'Souza's Forbes cover article, ''How Obama Thinks,'' contained the sort of untethered assertions that have become the lingua franca of this movement. Obama got his subversive radicalism from his father's grave, D'Souza postulated: ''He adopted his father's position that capitalism and freedom are code words for economic plunder.'' The fact that Newt Gingrich embraced this offensive theory is a sign of how severely the normal intellectual standards have been weakened.
But that damage is all in the future. Right now, the Tea Party doesn't matter. The Republicans don't matter. The economy and the Democrats are handing the G.O.P. a great, unearned revival. Nothing, it seems, is more scary than one-party Democratic control.

HEADLINE: RECESSION RAISES U.S. POVERTY RATE TO A 15-YEAR HIGH

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM; Reporting was contributed by Rebecca Cathcart in Los Angeles, Emma Graves Fitzsimmons in Chicago, Malcolm Gay in St. Louis, Robert Gebeloff in New York and Malia Wollan in San Francisco.

 BODY:
The percentage of Americans struggling below the poverty line in 2009 was the highest it has been in 15 years, the Census Bureaureported Thursday, and interviews with poverty experts and aid groups said the increase appeared to be continuing this year.
With the country in its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, four million additional Americans found themselves in poverty in 2009, with the total reaching 44 million, or one in seven residents. Millions more were surviving only because of expanded unemployment insurance and other assistance.
And the numbers could have climbed higher: One way embattled Americans have gotten by is sharing homes with siblings, parents or even nonrelatives, sometimes resulting in overused couches and frayed nerves but holding down the rise in the national poverty rate, according to the report.
The share of residents in poverty climbed to 14.3 percent in 2009, the highest level recorded since 1994. The rise was steepest for children, with one in five affected, the bureau said. 
The report provides the most detailed picture yet of the impact of the recession and unemployment on incomes, especially at the bottom of the scale. It also indicated that the temporary increases in aid provided in last year's stimulus bill eased the burdens on millions of families.
For a single adult in 2009, the poverty line was $10,830 in pretax cash income; for a family of four, $22,050.
Given the depth of the recession, some economists had expected an even larger jump in the poor.
''A lot of people would have been worse off if they didn't have someone to move in with,'' said Timothy M. Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin.
Dr. Smeeding said that in a typical case, a struggling family, like a mother and children who would be in poverty on their own, stays with more prosperous parents or other relatives.
The Census study found an 11.6 percent increase in the number of such multifamily households over the last two years. Included in that number was James Davis, 22, of Chicago, who lost his job as a package handler for Fed Ex in February 2009. As he ran out of money, he and his 2-year-old daughter moved in with his mother about a year ago, avoiding destitution while he searched for work.
''I couldn't afford rent,'' he said.
Danise Sanders, 31, and her three children have been sleeping in the living room of her mother and sister's one-bedroom apartment in San Pablo, Calif., for the last month, with no end in sight. They doubled up after the bank foreclosed on her landlord, forcing her to move.
''It's getting harder,'' said Ms. Sanders, who makes a low income as a mail clerk. ''We're all pitching in for rent and bills.''
There are strong signs that the high poverty numbers have continued into 2010 and are probably still rising, some experts said, as the recovery sputters and unemployment remains near 10 percent.
''Historically, it takes time for poverty to recover after unemployment starts to go down,'' said LaDonna Pavetti, a welfare expert at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research group in Washington.
Dr. Smeeding said it seemed almost certain that poverty would further rise this year. He noted that the increase in unemployment and poverty had been concentrated among young adults without college educations and their children, and that these people remained at the end of the line in their search for work.
One indirect sign of continuing hardship is the rise in food stamp recipients, who now include nearly one in seven adults and an even greater share of the nation's children. While other factors as well as declining incomes have driven the rise, by mid-2010 the number of recipients had reached 41.3 million, compared with 39 million at the beginning of the year.
Food banks, too, report swelling demand.
''We're seeing more younger people coming in that not only don't have any food, but nowhere to stay,'' said Marla Goodwin, director of Jeremiah's Food Pantry in East St. Louis, Ill. The pantry was open one day a month when it opened in 2008 but expanded this year to five days a month.
And Texas food banks said they distributed 14 percent more food in the second quarter of 2010 than in the same period last year.
The Census report showed increases in poverty for whites, blacks and Hispanic Americans, with historic disparities continuing. The poverty rate for non-Hispanic whites was 9.4 percent, for blacks 25.8 percent and for Hispanics 25.3 percent. The rate for Asians was unchanged at 12.5 percent.
The median income of all households stayed roughly the same from 2008 to 2009. It had fallen sharply the year before, as the recession gained steam and remains well below the levels of the late 1990s -- a sign of the stagnating prospects for the middle class.
The decline in incomes in 2008 had been greater than expected, and when the two recession years are considered together, the decline since 2007 was 4.2 percent, said Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard. Gains achieved earlier in the decade were wiped out, and median family incomes in 2009 were 5 percent lower than in 1999.
''This is the first time in memory that an entire decade has produced essentially no economic growth for the typical American household,'' Mr. Katz said.
The number of United States residents without health insurance climbed to 51 million in 2009, from 46 million in 2008, the Census said. Their ranks are expected to shrink in coming years as the health care overhaul adopted by Congress in March begins to take effect.
Government benefits like food stamps and tax credits, which can provide hundreds or even thousands of dollars in extra income, are not included in calculating whether a family's income falls above or below the poverty line.
But rises in the cost of housing, medical care or energy and the large regional differences in the cost of living are not taken into account either.
If food-stamp benefits and low-income tax credits were included as income, close to 8 million of those labeled as poor in the report would instead be just above the poverty line, the Census report estimated. At the same time, a person who starts a job and receives the earned income tax credit could have new work-related expenses like transportation and child care. Unemployment benefits, which are considered cash income and included in the calculations, helped keep 3 million families above the line last year, the report said, with temporary extensions and higher payments helping all the more.
The poverty line is a flawed measure, experts agree, but it remains the best consistent long-term gauge of need available, and its ups and downs reflect genuine trends.
The federal government will issue an alternate calculation next year that will include important noncash and after-tax income and also account for regional differences in the cost of living.
But it will continue to calculate the rate in the old way as well, in part because eligibility for many programs, from Medicaid to free school lunches, is linked to the longstanding poverty line.

HEADLINE: Educating Women Saves Children, Study Finds

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
LONDON (AP) -- Giving young women an education resulted in saving the lives of more than four million children worldwide in 2009, according to a new study published Friday. 
American researchers analyzed 915 censuses and surveys from 175 countries tracking education, economic growth, H.I.V. infection rates and child deaths from 1970 to 2009.
By using statistical models, the researchers found that for every extra year of education women had, the death rate for children under 5 dropped by almost 10 percent. They estimated that 4.2 million fewer children died in 2009 than in 1970 because women of child-bearing age in developing countries were more educated. In 1970, women in developing countries ages 18 to 44 had attended about two years of school. In 2009, it was about seven years.
The study was paid for by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and was published Friday in the London-based medical publication Lancet.
''Investments in education pay off'' by providing better health in the future, said the study's lead author, Emmanuela Gakidou, an associate professor at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.
Educated women tend to use health services more and often make better choices on hygiene, nutrition and parenting.
''This reminds us that in addition to having crucial interventions like immunization, we need to invest more into education,'' said Dr. Mickey Chopra, the health chief at Unicef, who was not involved in the research. Dr. Chopra said more money should be invested in education but not at the expense of health programs.
Professor Gakidou said considerable progress had been made in Asia and Latin America, where women in some countries are more educated than men. But she noted a dismal situation in six countries where women typically go to school for less than a year: Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger and Yemen.
Not everyone was convinced that the study's conclusions were right.
''It sounds plausible that education is related to child mortality, but finding a correlation does not prove causation,'' said William Easterly, a professor of economics at New York University who specializes in foreign aid.
He questioned the statistical methods used in the paper and said the authors had not adequately considered other factors that might have been responsible for the fall in child deaths.
Others said the focus should be on economic development rather than on specific health or education initiatives.
''Education is not much good if the health facilities and infrastructure don't exist,'' said Philip Stevens, a senior fellow at International Policy Network, a London-based research institute. ''If a country is massively misgoverned, like Sierra Leone, no amount of education is going to put bread on the table for children.''

HEADLINE: A Feud Between Airbus and Boeing Has Given Neither Side a Clear Advantage

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
After years of hearings, millions in legal bills and political posturing on both sides of the Atlantic, the dispute over aircraft subsidies is, in many ways, back where it started five years ago.
The latest salvo in trade frictions came after a panel concluded on Wednesday that Boeing had benefited from improper subsidies. Most industry analysts agreed that Europe, which had been cited earlier, had used more blatant and aggressive types of subsidies to help Airbus overtake Boeing as the world's top plane maker.
But the newest developments will most likely add to the acrimony, making it harder for the two sides to end the practices, especially as new threats emerge from state-sponsored competitors in China and Russia. 
''It would be nice to live in a world of unicorns where they could come up with an international framework that globally regulated government support,'' said Richard L. Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group, an aviation consulting firm in Fairfax, Va.
As long as aircraft manufacturing remains a source of national pride and high-paying jobs, ''politicians on both sides will give till it hurts,'' he said.
The trade case started in 2005, when the United States complained to the World Trade Organization that European countries had given Airbus more than $20 billion in questionable aid, including $15 billion in low-interest loans to develop its jetliners.
Boeing's supporters cheered last June when a W.T.O. panel finally ruled that Airbus had used the loans, known as launch aid, to steal sales from Boeing. The panel concluded that it ''would not have been possible for Airbus to have launched all these models, as originally designed and at the times that it did,'' without the subsidies.
But European officials countersued, and in a twist, the trade organization issued a preliminary ruling on Wednesday that found that Boeing had received at least $5 billion in federal research contracts and other subsidies that violated trade rules.
Boeing's chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr. , said Thursday he was ''heartened'' by the decisions. ''There was nothing like direct launch aid that was found in their case found in ours, so the proportionality remains pretty significantly different,'' he said.
But while Mr. Aboulafia agreed with Boeing's view that the European aid seemed more brazen, he said that the American company would still have a tough time making that case politically.
Analysts said Boeing had hoped to use the trade case to block Airbus's expansion. Both Mr. Aboulafia and Scott Hamilton, who runs the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm in Issaquah, Wash., said that Boeing was trying to slow Airbus's drive to develop a plane to compete with its best-selling new 787 Dreamliner, the first commercial jetliner made substantially from lightweight carbon composites.
And Boeing's supporters have cited the ruling against Airbus in urging the Pentagon to keep it from using subsidies to underbid Boeing for a $35 billion contract for aerial refueling tankers.
The W.T.O has no enforcement mechanism, and its findings will have to be settled through talks between United States and European officials.
But in the meantime, Airbus has been moving forward with plans to raise several billion dollars in loans from European countries to develop its own plane with fuel-efficient composites, the A350 XWB.
''I think there's a belief by some in the U.S. that there's the slightest hope in disrupting funding for the A350 XWB,'' Mr. Aboulafia said. ''And that's just very unlikely.''
The W.T.O. has ruled that the European aid loans would be legal if they were made on commercial terms, and it is not yet clear how the European countries would set the interest rates.
But Mr. Hamilton said that with private capital markets constrained by the worldwide economic pressures, ''their governments would still be a source of funding that they might not have in the capital markets,'' even if the Europeans tied the loans to market rates.
European trade officials contend that military research contracts helped Boeing get a head start on the composites. They say that it would be hypocritical to penalize Airbus in the tanker bidding since Boeing also had subsidies.
If anything, the stakes seem higher now than in 2005. Problems with suppliers have delayed Boeing's first Dreamliner by nearly three years, reducing its sales advantage over the A350 XWB.
Efforts to resolve the trade dispute could also be complicated by other subsidized competitors.
Dreamliner deliveries should start in 2011. Airbus hopes to introduce its plane in 2013. It has also been slowed by cost overruns on new, larger passenger and military models.
As Brazil and Canada took over the regional jet markets roughly a decade ago, the W.T.O. ruled that each had improperly subsidized their exports. Now, Bombardier of Canada is building a midsize jetliner. Longer-term threats to Airbus and Boeing are also coming from China and Russia.
''If you think this trade dispute is tough, what do you do with an emerging aerospace power that gets all its working capital from the government?'' Mr. Aboulafia asked.

HEADLINE: Higher Energy Costs Pushed Up Producer Prices in August

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Higher energy costs pushed the overall measure of producer prices higher in August, the government said Thursday, a modest increase that many analysts said reduced concerns about the possibility of deflation even as the economy continued to recover.
The Labor Department said that its Producer Price Index, which follows prices that producers are paid for goods before they are sold to consumers, rose 0.4 percent in August after a 0.2 percent increase in July. That increase was the first in the index in three months.
The August rise was attributed to a 2.2 percent increase in energy prices. When volatile food and energy prices are removed, the core index rose 0.1 percent in August, compared with a 0.3 percent increase in July, which was the largest gain since January. Food prices fell 0.3 percent in August, the fourth decline in five months. 
Analysts had forecast a 0.3 percent increase in the August month-on-month figure with the core index up 0.1 percent.
''The figures were positive for both the total and the core level,'' said Lawrence R. Creatura, vice president at Federated Clover Investment Advisors. ''There are no symptoms of inflation here, nor are there symptoms of deflation. Prices in the pipeline are going up, not down.''
Economists have been watching the index to help analyze the prospects for price pressures in a period of slow growth. Consumer prices for August will be released on Friday, and the consensus calls for an increase of 0.3 percent in the broader index and 0.1 percent in the core index, the same as July.
But the reports reflect aggregates of different parts in the economy, so consumer prices could still rise in some contexts.
''Just because the total doesn't show dislocation, it does not mean things are calm under the surface,'' Mr. Creatura said. ''It is possible to have deflation in housing offsetting inflation in commodities, and that could result in what appears to be benign C.P.I. But that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt when you get to the checkout in the supermarket.''
With the risk of inflation below the Federal Reserve's implicit goal of 2 percent, some officials had expressed concern that the economy could enter a period of falling wages and prices. Last month, the Federal Reserve, signaling its worries about the risk of deflation, voted to use proceeds from its mortgage bonds to buy long-term Treasuries to bolster the economy.
Cliff Waldman, an economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, said with the year-on-year core consumer price index falling, and less subject to the volatility of raw materials prices than the producer index, deflation was still a ''big question mark.''
''We are in an interesting no man's land with inflation and deflation,'' he said. ''We will probably skirt deflation, but just barely.''
In another report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said that the current-account trade deficit increased to $123.3 billion in the second quarter, a 12.9 percent increase from the first three months of the year. The current account is the broadest measure of America's international trade, tracking the flow of goods and services as well as investments.
Exports in the quarter totaled $316.1 billion, a 3.4 percent rise from the previous quarter, while imports grew to $485.7 billion in the quarter, up 6.3 percent.
Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said he had forecast a 1 percent increase for the broader index in the producer price report because of the increase in gasoline prices in August compared with July. ''I do not place a lot of significance in that because gasoline prices have come down since then,'' he said.
But he said it was likely the economy would go through a prolonged period of very low inflation, with depressed use in industry and unemployment.
Analysts and economists have been sifting through economic figures that have suggested a sluggish economy, with gross domestic product revised down to an annual growth rate of 1.6 percent, unemployment of 9.6 percent and a weak housing market.
In addition to the producer prices, new figures on weekly initial jobless claims, which fell last month to their lowest level since July, were released on Thursday.
The Labor Department said Thursday that new claims for jobless benefits fell by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 450,000. It was the third decline in four weeks, and defied economists' expectations of an increase to 459,000.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's survey of regional business conditions was released, suggesting nearly flat manufacturing activity in September.
It said for the second consecutive month, companies in the Philadelphia region, which covers Delaware, eastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey, reported a decline in new orders and shipments, and although employment levels held steady, companies reported declines in average work hours. The index of current activity was on an upward trend of minus 0.7 in September from minus 7.7 in August.
John Lonski, a chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets, said the reports, and concerns over sliding home prices, were likely to capture much of the financial market focus on Thursday.
''I think it would be a surprise if the P.P.I. boosted fears of price deflation,'' he said. ''We are not there quite yet.''

HEADLINE: PATTAYA JOURNAL; A City Known for Sex Tries to Broaden Its Appeal

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

 BODY:
PATTAYA, THAILAND -- Somewhere in the world there may be a city with a more seedy reputation, a place more devoted to the sex industry and more notorious as a haven for criminals on the lam. But probably not.
When dusk comes to this beach resort, a sea of pink neon bulbs casts a pale glow onto the thickly made-up faces of thousands of women (and some men) who sit on bar stools waiting for their patrons. 
If Las Vegas is Sin City, Pattaya is a bear hug from Lucifer himself.
And yet, amid the back alleys jammed with girlie bars and a beachfront peopled with what the Thais euphemistically call ''service women,'' there are signs of change.
Indian couples, Chinese tour groups and vacationing Russian families stroll around the city. A dozen luxury hotels cater to the weekend crowd of wealthy Thais from Bangkok who mingle with tourists at a huge shopping mall. Pattaya has a growing number of fancy restaurants, an annual music festival and, perhaps most improbably, regular polo tournaments.
Long derided as a city of sleaze, the city is reaching for respectability.
A two-hour drive from Bangkok, Pattaya was little more than a fishing village four decades ago when U.S. soldiers fighting in the Vietnam War discovered a pristine, coral-filled bay. Tens of thousands of lonely soldiers armed with dollars sought respite from the war in a country of relative poverty, lax law enforcement and historically tolerant attitudes toward prostitution. The result was predictable.
Pattaya survived the departure of the G.I.'s by expanding into sex tourism. Visitors to Thailand in the 1970s were offered brochures at the Bangkok airport showing pictures of available companions. The booth at the airport no longer exists, but the business lives on: for at least the past decade, men have outnumbered women as tourists in Thailand. They make up about 60 percent of foreign visitors in Thailand compared with 52 percent in nearby, law-abiding Singapore.
In recent years the Pattaya tourist industry has sought to diversify its client base. Hotel managers learned that, despite jokes about recession-proof industries, relying heavily on a Western male clientele was unwise at a time when the United States and Europe were buffeted by recession.
Tourism agencies now actively seek out visitors from the rising economies of China and India.
''There's definitely been a change,'' said Shyam Anugonda, a 39-year-old lawyer from Bangalore, India, whose first trip to Pattaya was eight years ago, when he was single.
''It was more sex oriented before,'' Mr. Anugonda said as he shopped for Thai fabrics with his wife, Kavitha.
This time, Mr. Anugonda's five-day vacation included an elephant show and parasailing.
The government is encouraging the rebranding of Pattaya by developing a master plan for the city, including a monorail to help relieve traffic-clogged streets, a redrawn waterfront and a high-speed rail line from Bangkok. The plan is awaiting approval from the Thai cabinet.
The police, too, say they are trying to clean up the city's image.
''There are people who say Pattaya is the paradise of criminals,'' said Col. Atiwit Kamolrat, the head of the immigration police. ''It's now going to be impossible for them to hide here.''
His office's Transnational Crime Data Center combs through lists of wanted criminals from foreign governments and cross-references them with hotel registration logs and visa renewal applications. Since the beginning of the year, the office has arrested 12 foreign criminals hiding out in Pattaya, Colonel Atiwit said.
Somchet Thinaphong, a board member charged with the city's redevelopment plan at the Designated Areas for Sustainable Tourism Administration, a government agency, said Pattaya's face-lift would cost 32 billion baht, or about $1 billion. He spoke in generalities about ''sustainable development'' and making the city more ecologically friendly.
But here in Pattaya, officials chuckle derisively at the notion that the city can be totally sanitized. Stamping out Pattaya's sex industry is fantasy, said Niti Kongrut, the director of the Pattaya branch of the Thai government's tourism office.
''You talk about sustainable development, how about prostitutes? They have been around for a very long time,'' Mr. Niti said. ''We can't close down the go-go bars. It's a free country. Besides, it makes money.''
For decades, officials have wrestled with the question of what to do about the seedy side of the city, Mr. Niti said. ''Now we just ignore them and try to promote other activities.''
For visitors who have no intention of partaking in it, the sex industry has become a sort of spectacle, a red-light district that makes its counterparts in other cities seem almost Victorian.
Olga Bidenko, 28, a tourist from Ukraine who came to Pattaya with a colleague from the marketing company she works for, said she was entertained by Walking Street, a thoroughfare stretching a kilometer and a half, or about a mile, blocked to motor traffic and packed with bars. Typical of the bars is Sexy Airline, where women dressed in old-fashioned air hostess outfits call out to prospective patrons passing by.
''We thought Amsterdam was the sex capital of the world,'' said Ms. Bidenko, 28. ''But now that I've been here, I think Amsterdam is a perfectly respectable city.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Europe and South Korea Agree To Lift Trade Barriers in 2011

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE; Choe Sang-hun contributed reporting from Seoul.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Union said Thursday that it would sign a sweeping free-trade agreement with South Korea, its first with an Asian trade partner.
Officials welcomed the deal as proof that protectionist pressures were being resisted despite the temptations of governments to shield their industries from competition at times of economic uncertainty. 
''This is the first generation of bilateral trade agreements which will bind Europe and Asia together in an ever-closer economic bond,'' said Steven Vanackere, deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Belgium, which holds the union's rotating presidency. ''This is a very big step in opening markets in Asia for our companies.''
The agreement is expected to be signed at a meeting of the European Union and South Korea in Brussels next month and will take effect July 1, 2011, Mr. Vanackere said during a news conference.
Italy had initially resisted the pact, which required backing from the 27 European Union member states, because of worries about the effect on its automobile industry. Italy dropped its objections after it achieved a small concession, under which the introduction of the agreement was put off by six months.
The deal will remove nearly all tariffs between the two economies, as well as many other barriers. The European Commission estimates that it will be worth as much as 19 billion euros ($25 billion) in new trade for European Union exporters and will create jobs.
Trade between the union and South Korea was worth about 53 billion euros last year.
In Seoul, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the deal would help South Korean businesses through the lifting tariffs on important exports like cars, televisions, textiles and shoes.
President Obama has been trying to win support for a free-trade deal between the United States and South Korea but the accord is strongly opposed by the American beef and auto industries, and by labor unions, which say it fails to end what they see as unfair restrictions on sales in South Korea.

HEADLINE: The Tax-Cut Racket

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''Nice middle class you got here,'' said Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader. ''It would be a shame if something happened to it.''
O.K., he didn't actually say that. But he might as well have, because that's what the current confrontation over taxes amounts to. Mr. McConnell, who was self-righteously denouncing the budget deficit just the other day, now wants to blow that deficit up with big tax cuts for the rich. But he doesn't have the votes. So he's trying to get what he wants by pointing a gun at the heads of middle-class families, threatening to force a jump in their taxes unless he gets paid off with hugely expensive tax breaks for the wealthy.
Most discussion of the tax fight focuses either on the economics or on the politics -- both of which suggest that Democrats should hang tough, for their own sakes as well as that of the country. But there's an even bigger issue here -- namely, the question of what constitutes acceptable behavior in American political life. Politics ain't beanbag, but there's a difference between playing hardball and engaging in outright extortion, which is what Mr. McConnell is now doing. And if he succeeds, it will set a disastrous precedent. 
How did we get to this point? The proximate answer lies in the tactics the Bush administration used to push through tax cuts. The deeper answer lies in the radicalization of the Republican Party, its transformation into a movement willing to put the economy and the nation at risk for the sake of partisan victory.
So, about those tax cuts: back in 2001, the Bush administration bundled huge tax cuts for wealthy Americans with much smaller tax cuts for the middle class, then pretended that it was mainly offering tax breaks to ordinary families. Meanwhile, it circumvented Senate rules intended to prevent irresponsible fiscal actions -- rules that would have forced it to find spending cuts to offset its $1.3 trillion tax cut -- by putting an expiration date of Dec. 31, 2010, on the whole bill. And the witching hour is now upon us. If Congress doesn't act, the Bush tax cuts will turn into a pumpkin at the end of this year, with tax rates reverting to Clinton-era levels.
In response, President Obama is proposing legislation that would keep tax rates essentially unchanged for 98 percent of Americans but allow rates on the richest 2 percent to rise. But Republicans are threatening to block that legislation, effectively raising taxes on the middle class, unless they get tax breaks for their wealthy friends.
That's an extraordinary step. Almost everyone agrees that raising taxes on the middle class in the middle of an economic slump is a bad idea, unless the effects are offset by other job-creation programs -- and Republicans are blocking those, too. So the G.O.P. is, in effect, threatening to plunge the U.S. economy back into recession unless Democrats pay up.
What kind of political party would engage in that kind of brinksmanship? The answer is the same kind of party that shut down the federal government in 1995 in an attempt to force President Bill Clinton to accept steep cuts in Medicare, and is actively discussing doing the same to Mr. Obama. So, as I said, the deeper explanation of the tax-cut fight is that it's ultimately about a radicalized Republican Party, which accepts no limits on partisanship.
So should Democrats give in?
On the economics, the answer is a clear no. Right now, fears about budget deficits are overblown -- but that doesn't mean that we should completely ignore deficit concerns. And the G.O.P. plan would add hugely to the deficit -- about $700 billion over the next decade -- while doing little to help the economy. On any kind of cost-benefit analysis, this is an idea not worth considering.
And, by the way, a compromise solution -- temporary tax breaks for the rich -- is no better; it would cost less, but it would also do even less for the economy.
On the politics, the answer is also a clear no. Polls show that a majority of Americans are opposed to maintaining tax breaks for the rich. Beyond that, this is no time for Democrats to play it safe: if the midterm election were held today, they would lose badly. They need to highlight their differences with the G.O.P. -- and it's hard to think of a better place for them to take a stand than on the issue of big giveaways to Wall Street and corporate C.E.O.'s.
But what's even more important is the principle of the thing. Threats to punish innocent bystanders unless your political rivals give you what you want have no legitimate place in democratic politics. Giving in to such threats would be an economic and political mistake, but more important, it would be morally wrong -- and it would encourage more such threats in the future.
It's time for Democrats to take a stand, and say no to G.O.P. blackmail.

HEADLINE: U.S. Steps Up Criticism of China's Practices

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Ian Johnson contributed reporting from Beijing.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration increased its criticism of China's economic policies on Thursday, as Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner told Congress that China had substantially undervalued its currency to gain an unfair trade advantage, tolerated theft of foreign technology and created unreasonable barriers to American imports.
But the election year anger from lawmakers seemed to surpass even Mr. Geithner's tougher posture. Lawmakers expressed impatience with the administration's familiar reliance on persuasion and negotiation, saying such tactics had yielded little. 
In Beijing, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry said that China would not respond to pressure and that a revaluation of the currency, the renminbi, would do little to affect the United States trade deficit with China. But the renminbi strengthened by 0.27 percent to end trading at 6.72 per dollar Thursday as the government appeared to belatedly permit the greater currency flexibility it had promised in June.
Dismay over China's currency interventions -- it buys about $1 billion a day to maintain the renminbi's peg to the dollar -- has been a recurring theme for years. The election-season rhetoric, the carefully calibrated strengthening of the Chinese currency on the eve of Mr. Geithner's appearance, and the administration's struggle to negotiate a diplomatic line set the stage for predictable political theater.
But now, with the United States in a stalled economic recovery and lawmakers facing a restive electorate, the administration is clearly looking for alternative ways to bring pressure on the Chinese.
Mr. Geithner urged China to allow ''significant, sustained appreciation'' of its undervalued currency and even suggested that anything less would strain the relations of the world's two largest economies. He made it clear that President Obama would press the issue with China's leaders, giving rise to a potentially pivotal moment in November when leaders of the Group of 20 economic powers meet in South Korea.
Still, Mr. Geithner's plan did not appear to mollify lawmakers.
''There is no question that the economic and trade policies of China represent clear roadblocks to our recovery,'' Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and the chairman of the Banking Committee, told Mr. Geithner at a hearing. ''I've listened to every administration, Democrats and Republicans, from Ronald Reagan to the current administration, say virtually the same thing, producing the same results. China does basically whatever it wants, while we grow weaker and they grow stronger.''
Mr. Dodd, who is not seeking re-election, added: ''It's clearly time for a change in strategy.''
Successive administrations have declined to formally designate China a currency manipulator -- a finding that could initiate American retaliatory measures -- something that has frustrated lawmakers.
''There is no question that China manipulates its currency in order to subsidize Chinese exports,'' said the top Republican on the committee, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama. ''The only question is, Why is the administration protecting China by refusing to designate it as a currency manipulator?''
Pointing to Mr. Geithner, Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said: ''I'm increasingly coming to the view that the only person in this room who believes China is not manipulating its currency is you.''
Mr. Geithner avoided using any version of the word ''manipulation,'' making it clear that he thought such a finding would only antagonize the Chinese without having much practical effect beyond requiring American officials to engage in talks -- something the administration has already been doing.
Partly in response to American pressure, China permitted the renminbi to rise about 20 to 25 percent from 2005 to 2008, but then stopped the currency from strengthening as the financial crisis threatened the strength of its export-oriented economy.
C. Randall Henning, a political scientist in the School of International Service at American University in Washington and an authority on exchange-rate policy, said it was in China's interest to allow the renminbi to rise in value. The currency interventions have raised the threat of inflation and asset bubbles, hurt the poorer sectors of the country's economy and depressed domestic consumption.
But export interests dominate policy-making within the Chinese government, and consumers have little voice within the communist regime, so ''we are likely to see policy shift toward appreciation only when price stability, financial stability or exports are threatened,'' Mr. Henning said.
Business interests in the United States are sharply divided on the currency issue. Domestic manufacturers and labor unions say that China's currency policies have eviscerated industrial employment. But large multinational companies, particularly those with extensive production facilities in China, benefit from a weak renminbi just as Chinese manufacturers do.
Those companies, along with Wall Street firms, are fearful -- as Mr. Geithner acknowledged -- that excessive pressure could lead China to retaliate against their operations in China. In the worst case, they are worried that the two countries could get mired in a trade war.
A House bill with more than 140 sponsors would virtually compel the administration to find China to be a manipulator and impose duties or other trade barriers in retaliation. Mr. Geithner does not support the proposal, which the administration says would violate United States obligations as a member of the World Trade Organization.
Mr. Geithner said the Treasury would ''take China's actions into account'' in preparing the administration's next foreign exchange report, which is due to Congress on Oct. 15 but will probably be delayed, as previous reports have been, as officials continue to talk to the Chinese.
The secretary also laid out other concerns about China's policies, including ''indigenous innovation,'' a set of practices that American officials say result in discrimination against foreign products and technology.
The secretary attacked what he called ''rampant'' violations of intellectual property rights and an ''unacceptable'' level of theft of technology.
He also criticized a proposal by China to require that certain products be accredited before being sold to its government. The United States says that such requirements might violate standards of the W.T.O., which China joined in 2001.
Mr. Geithner pledged that the administration would be ''aggressively using the full set of trade remedies available to us,'' including filing new cases with the W.T.O. The United States trade representative's office filed two such cases on Wednesday.
He said the administration was ''reviewing carefully'' a complaint by the United Steelworkers union over Chinese practices in the renewable energy sector.

HEADLINE: Report Says Drilling Ban Had Little Effect

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The moratorium on deepwater oil and gas drilling imposed after the BP accident has had only modest impacts on jobs and on the Gulf Coast economy, the Obama administration said in a report issued Thursday. 
That conclusion, echoing earlier statements by officials defending the drilling pause, was immediately attacked by Louisiana lawmakers and drilling companies, who said it was based on flawed assumptions and incomplete evidence.
The report, prepared over the past two months by administration economists and presented Thursday to the Senate Small Business Committee, found that roughly 2,000 of the 9,700 workers aboard the 46 offshore rigs affected by the moratorium had lost their jobs or moved away from the gulf since the moratorium was imposed in late May.
Another 6,000 to 10,000 workers in associated industries also lost work because of the moratorium, the study found.
But overall employment in the five Louisiana parishes most dependent on offshore oil and gas activity remained constant, the study found, largely because of the jobs created by the cleanup. BP has already spent more than $8 billion on the cleanup and to compensate businesses hurt by the spill.
The administration declared a halt to deepwater drilling after the April 20 explosion of the rig leased to the British oil giant BP that killed 11 workers and spilled nearly five million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.
Many companies involved in drilling have kept on a majority of their workers so that they have a trained cadre on hand when the moratorium is lifted, now scheduled for Nov. 30, although it could end sooner for some activities.
The administration's relatively rosy assessment drew fire from both of Louisiana's senators. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Democrat and chairwoman of the Small Business Committee, said the study ignored the widespread costs to small businesses throughout the Gulf Coast and gave an unrealistic estimate of how quickly drilling would restart after the moratorium ended.
She said the moratorium was a ''government-imposed economic disaster'' that caused as much or more financial harm to her state as the spill itself.
Senator David Vitter, a Republican, chastised Rebecca M. Blank, under secretary of commerce for economic affairs, who presented the report to the committee, for both the content and the timing of the study.
The Shallow Water Energy Security Coalition, a group of companies that operate in shallower gulf waters and are not technically under the moratorium, also criticized the study.
James W. Noe, executive director of the group, said: ''The Obama administration's report on the economic effects of the deepwater drilling moratorium is little more than an unjustifiably optimistic attempt to glaze over the real, devastating impact of the ban on deepwater drilling. The report twists facts, makes unrealistic assumptions and wholly ignores the de facto moratorium on shallow water drilling.''
Relief Well Reaches Target
NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The federal government says a relief well has intersected BP's blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico. Thad W. Allen, the retired Coast Guard admiral leading the government's response to the spill, said in a statement late Thursday that data showed the two wells were joined. The next step will be to pump mud and cement down through the relief well to seal the blown-out well from the bottom.

 BODY:
10 P.M. (ABC) 20/20 In 1985, Kathryn Eastburn, an Army wife, and two of her three daughters were found dead in their home near Fort Bragg, N.C. Timothy B. Hennis, above, a master sergeant who had visited the home days earlier when he answered an ad placed by the Eastburns, was found guilty in 1986 of raping and murdering Ms. Eastburn and killing her daughters. He was sentenced to death. But when defense lawyers argued in 1989 that photographs of the grisly crime scene had been projected on a screen over the defendant's head, an appeals court declared that the case should be retried, and Mr. Hennis was acquitted. DNA later linked Mr. Hennis to Ms. Eastburn's body, and the military took up the case in 2006. In April a military jury found Mr. Hennis guilty and sentenced him once again to death. Elizabeth Vargas reviews the case and interviews Jana Eastburn, the youngest of the daughters, who was left alive inside the house. Ms. Vargas also speaks with Gary Eastburn, Jana's father, and with the lawyer who represented Mr. Hennis in his first two trials.

HEADLINE: How to Reduce the Trade Deficit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Trading Away the Stimulus'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 10), Alan Tonelson and Kevin L. Kearns offer a cleverly packaged argument that, if implemented, would redistribute wealth from the many to the few.
Every Economics 101 college student learns that competition helps everyone (consumers) a little (by keeping prices low), but protectionism helps a few (industries protected by tariffs) a lot (by keeping the prices of their goods artificially high). 
A study done in the 1980s estimated that restricting imports costs $105,000 for each auto worker's job saved and $750,000 for every steelworker's job saved.
As Alan Blinder, former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, wrote in ''Hard Heads, Soft Hearts,'' ''Tariffs and quotas are often politically popular because they impose diffuse and subtle costs on the many to pay for concentrated and highly visible benefits for the few.''
Richard Rampell Palm Beach, Fla., Sept. 10, 2010
To the Editor:
There are far better ways to address the very real challenges faced by much of American manufacturing than the counterproductive proposals in ''Trading Away the Stimulus.''
It is surely long past time to begin seriously reducing one of the industrial world's highest corporate tax rates, replacing our current tax system, which places its primary burden on work and investment, with one that puts the burden on consumption. Most important, we need to radically improve our public education system.
Instead the authors would impose ''protective tariffs on foreign goods and services that compete directly with existing and start-up domestic producers.'' Such overt protectionism by the United States would have an absolutely devastating impact on export jobs here at home, on the world trading system and on the global economy as a whole.
Bill Brock Annapolis, Md., Sept. 11, 2010
The writer was United States trade representative and secretary of labor in the Reagan administration.
To the Editor:
Alan Tonelson and Kevin L. Kearns suggest that we need to abandon free trade. They will not get many economists to agree; free trade is virtually the economists' religion.
Nevertheless, it is obvious that workers in developed countries are now being offered a kind of competition that they never had to face before: people abroad who can do their job well enough, yet will work for wages that are a small fraction of theirs.
Our workers are facing a substantial drop in their standard of living and continued high unemployment. The political results of such a trend could be disastrous.
There used to be barriers against low-wage competition -- namely, the inability of low-wage workers to be sufficiently productive -- but these barriers now are gone. New ones have to be erected, mainly in the form of tariffs.
Barbara R. Bergmann Washington, Sept. 11, 2010
The writer is professor emerita of economics at the University of Maryland and American University.
To the Editor:
As the head of a pro-trade organization, I couldn't disagree more with Alan Tonelson and Kevin L. Kearns's prescription for curing the United States trade deficit by imposing extensive new duties on imports.
Recent efforts in this direction have backfired. A report prepared for the International Chamber of Commerce estimated that the 43,000 jobs that the United States government claims to have saved with last year's ''Buy American'' rule in the stimulus package will be overshadowed by the loss of more than 200,000 jobs because of retaliation by our trading partners.
At a time when our economy is on the brink of a double-dip recession, we need more trade, not less, to get growth back on track.
Peter M. Robinson President and C.E.O. United States Council for International Business New York, Sept. 11, 2010
To the Editor:
Alan Tonelson and Kevin L. Kearns make an appealing case for doing something about the trade deficit, but then ignore the elephant in the room as they argue for erecting various trade barriers.
Half of the trade deficit is because of petroleum imports, not any of the factors they mention. A tax on oil consumption comparable to that levied by most developed countries would be the simplest and perhaps most effective way of reducing the trade deficit.

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Managers Set Up for Next Acts

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
James J. Pallotta, a legend of the hedge fund industry, is calling a do-over.
After shutting his giant fund following a humbling loss, Mr. Pallotta, the money manager who is an owner of the Boston Celtics, is doing what hedge fund types do in tough times: he is opening a new fund.
There have been plenty of mulligans in the rarefied realm of hedge funds these days. Mr. Pallotta, 52, is one of a number of prominent money managers who are trying to start afresh after the tumult of the financial crisis.
By closing one fund and opening another, managers can, in a stroke, wipe clean their investment records and start collecting fees from new investors. 
Who would entrust their money to a hedge fund washout? Plenty of people, it turns out. Before the financial collapse, Mr. Pallotta had a record of handsome returns. His new fund, called Raptor Evolution (his old one was Raptor Global), will in all likelihood have no trouble drumming up investors, analysts said.
''Will it be easy for him to raise money? Yes,'' said Tim Berry, a head of hedge fund investments at Private Advisors, a Richmond, Va., firm that advises large institutions on their investments. ''He has a long track record of success.''
Others hoping for a comeback include Gabe Nechamkin, a former trader for George Soros, and John W. Meriwether, whose Long-Term Capital Management failed spectacularly in 1998. Mr. Nechamkin is on his second fund, Mr. Meriwether his third.
Not everyone will get a second or third chance. Hedge funds, whose outsize returns -- and paydays -- defined an era of Wall Street riches, are in the midst of a painful shakeout.
Over the last two and a half years, investors have withdrawn nearly $320 billion from these private investment pools, leaving the industry's combined assets at $1.5 trillion, according to data from BarclayHedge.
Small funds have been hit hardest. Since their number worldwide peaked at 12,000 in 2007, it has fallen to about 8,400, according to research from the executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles.
The industry as a whole struggled in 2008 and 2009, and this year is not looking much better. For the year through the end of August, the average hedge fund was down 1.4 percent, according to Lipper, a unit of Thomson Reuters. Investors are increasingly asking themselves whether they would be better off putting their money in a low-cost index fund. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 0.5 percent.
Given that showing, nearly half of the hedge funds included in the Hedge Fund Research Index have been running below the levels they need to attain to earn their rich performance fees for the last three years. (Hedge funds typically charge a management fee of 1 to 2 percent and take a 20 percent cut of profits provided they pass performance milestones known as high water marks.)
''It's a pretty crowded field with very high fees,'' said Todd Buchholz, a former managing director at Tiger Management, the hedge fund firm run by Julian H. Robertson Jr.
''I don't see that this is the death or the last gasp of hedge funds, but there is certainly a shaking out going on here,'' said Mr. Buchholz, who now oversees a real estate hedge fund called Two Oceans. Some managers are closing underperforming or money-losing funds and trying to persuade their old investors, plus some new ones, to provide new capital.
These funds face two challenges, however. Many have to agree to make up past losses before earning a performance fee from their previous investors -- if those investors return at all.
Most also have to indicate to investors that they have learned their lessons and that the investment strategies of their new funds -- at least on the surface -- will address past problems.
Jeffrey Gendell's firm, Tontine Capital Partners, averaged returns of 38 percent from 1997 to 2007. Tontine Capital oversaw $7 billion before it closed two funds that had lost more than two-thirds of their value in 2008; a few months later, in 2009, Mr. Gendell opened a new hedge fund.
The new fund, Mr. Gendell said in a letter to investors, would invest only in easy-to-trade securities and would not use leverage, or borrowed money, to improve its returns. Mr. Gendell vowed he would not collect performance fees until investors had recouped their previous losses. A spokesman said Mr. Gendell declined to comment.
It is unclear whether Mr. Nechamkin and Mr. Meriwether, neither of whom returned a call, are using new and improved strategies or offering to make legacy investors whole before collecting new performance fees.
The looming question for these and other managers is whether investors are willing to forgive and forget.
Hedge fund managers and their employees are reluctant to discuss their attempted comebacks. One individual who worked at a fund that closed and is now trying to raise money for a new fund said many in the industry were trying to play up their past success, rather than their recent losses.
''It creates a weird dynamic,'' this person said, who asked not to be named so as not to jeopardize the new fund. ''You want to be part of the good, but not part of the bad.''
For Mr. Pallotta, whose Raptor funds had more than $12 billion in assets at their height, there were a lot of good years.
Mr. Pallotta -- who recently built a 27,000-square-foot home in one of Boston's wealthiest enclaves -- posted average annual returns of 19.2 percent in the 15 years he worked for the billionaire Paul Tudor Jones and five years before that at Essex Investment Management.
Raptor was spun out of Tudor Investments in late 2008, after the fund lost 20 percent. Turning in a flat performance in the first few months of 2009, Mr. Pallotta shut the fund n that June, telling investors in a letter that he had doubts about ''the sustainability of certain aspects of the industry's structure and short-term focus.''
A spokesman said Mr. Pallotta declined to comment.
With his new fund, Mr. Pallotta is going back to Square 1, recreating the conditions that he had at the start of his career, said a person with knowledge of the fund, who declined to be named because of continuing efforts to raise capital.
Using a small team and focusing on a small number of securities, Mr. Pallotta is not looking to become a megafund for now, this person said. So far, Mr. Pallotta has won back some old investors, as well as new ones. But he will not earn a performance fee on the new fund until previous investors recoup their losses.
As Mr. Berry put it: ''If he's passionate about investing and doesn't mind working with a smaller capital base for a while and wants to prove to investors he's still got it, then he'll do fine.''

'Ahead of Time' (No rating, 1:13, in English and Hebrew) The career of Ruth Gruber -- reporter, photographer, civil servant, memoirist, humanitarian and riveting raconteur, now almost 99 -- is remarkable, and not only for a woman of her generation. This documentary covers the striking breadth of its early years (the '30s and '40s), enlivened by her lucid memory and sensible, compassionate bearing. (Andy Webster)20100916
'The American' (R, 1:45) George Clooney is a shadowy assassin-type who settles down in an Italian village, where trouble follows him and he falls for a local prostitute played by Violante Placido. It all looks good -- Mr. Clooney, Ms. Placido, Italy -- and the director, Anton Corbijn, manages a quiet, oblique tone. But in the end the movie is not much more than an anthology of beautiful shots and world-weary attitudes. The Henry James novel by the same name is much better. (A. O. Scott)20100916 
- 'Animal Kingdom' (R, 1:52) The relative absence of gun battles and car chases in ''Animal Kingdom,'' a powerfully acted Australian answer to ''Goodfellas,'' helps it sustain a mood of deepening dread. It goes out of its way to deglamorize the criminal life and portray its family of crooks as warped psychotic thugs in a losing enterprise. (Stephen Holden)20100916
- 'Avatar' (PG-13, 2:46) With his latest, James Cameron has turned one man's dream of the movies into a trippy joy ride about the end of life -- our moviegoing life included -- as we know it. A song to the natural world that was largely produced with software, an Emersonian exploration of the invisible world of the spirit filled with Cameronian rock 'em, sock 'em, the movie is glorious and goofy and blissfully deranged. (Manohla Dargis)20100916
'Cairo Time' (PG, 1:29) Patricia Clarkson and Alexander Siddig play a melancholy romantic duet, with the Egyptian capital as an entrancing, chaotic backdrop. (Scott)20100916
'Change of Plans' (No rating, 1:40, in French) Daniele Thompson, who wrote the script with her son and frequent collaborator, Christopher (he also appears in the film), brings a light, sweetly cynical touch to this tale of a very complicated dinner party. Secrets are kept and divulged, marriages are broken and repaired, and though the plot is thin and crowded, the movie manages to occupy a pleasant middle ground between melodrama and farce. (Scott)20100916
'The Concert' (No rating, 1:47, in French and Russian) This messy, comedic sprawl lunges wildly between satirical farce and teary sentimentality as it follows the misadventures of a ragtag symphony orchestra that travels to Paris from Moscow under false pretenses. Paris Theater, 4 West 58th Street . (Holden)20100916
'Despicable Me' (PG, 1:28) That's a bit strong. But this story of a villain (voiced by Steve Carell) with a soft heart is mediocre in all the ways that animated children's entertainment can be, with little of the necessary charm, wit or originality. (Scott)20100916
'Dinner for Schmucks' (PG-13, 1:50) A winningly silly remake of a French comedy, with Steve Carell and Paul Rudd as mismatched buddies and a very funny supporting cast that includes Jemaine Clement, Lucy Punch and Zach Galifianakis, who is perched on the brink of either stardom or overexposure. (Scott)20100916
'Eat Pray Love' (PG-13, 2:13) Post-divorce spiritual globe-trotting, starring Julia Roberts, from Elizabeth Gilbert's best-selling memoir. Nothing to change your life, but honest and satisfying all the same. (Scott)20100916
- 'Exit Through the Gift Shop' (No rating, 1:27) Looking like a documentary but feeling like a monumental con, this film from the reclusive British street artist Banksy follows Thierry Guetta, an antic French videographer who embarks on a film about street artists and finally becomes one himself. Scrutinizing the lemminglike behavior of many enthusiasts, Banksy mischievously exfoliates the next-big-thing hunger and the posers who pursue it. (Jeannette Catsoulis)20100916
'The Expendables' (R, 1:43) Sylvester Stallone and a whole lot of other tough guys in the most extravagant display of dry aged beef outside of a Chicago steakhouse. (Scott)20100916
- 'A Film Unfinished' (R, 1:29, in English, Hebrew, German, Polish and Yiddish) Embarking on a critical analysis of an unfinished Nazi propaganda film of the Warsaw Ghetto, the Israeli director Yael Hersonski positions familiar Holocaust horrors within a provocative commentary on the way we view images. Moving and mysterious, the film, anchored by the reactions of five Ghetto survivors, repeatedly emphasizes the hand behind the celluloid curtain, freezing again and again on Nazi cameramen inadvertently trapped in their own fabrications. In the end, the value of this work lies less in what is shown than in its persistent reminders of what is not. (Catsoulis)20100916
'Genius Within: the Inner Life of Glenn Gould' (No rating, 1:46) This thorough biography of the Canadian pianist acknowledges his eccentricities and examines some previously unknown details of his personal life, but spends most of its energy making the case that he was an artist whose importance went far beyond his innovative interpretations of Bach and other composers. (Scott)20100916
- 'Get Low' (PG-13, 1:42) Robert Duvall plays a Tennessee hermit who arranges his own funeral while he is still alive. Bill Murray is the undertaker who agrees to organize the service, and Sissy Spacek is an old flame of the not quite deceased. The story, based on a real-life anecdote of Depression-era Appalachia, veers into some corny and overfamiliar territory, but the telling is easy and assured, and the cast is hard to beat. (Scott)20100916
'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' (No rating, 2:32, in Swedish) As the tattooed, nose-ringed, scowling computer hacker of the title, Noomi Rapace more or less looks the part that the filmmakers don't let her fully play in a slack, second-rate Swedish adaptation of the Stieg Larsson best seller. (Dargis)20100916
'The Girl Who Played With Fire' (No rating, 2:09, in Swedish) Lisbeth Salander returns, framed for murder and embroiled in an investigation that leads in the direction of her monstrous father. This Swedish-language adaptation of the second novel in Stieg Larsson's best-selling trilogy is better than its predecessor, but apart from Noomi Rapace's ferocious performance as Lisbeth, it doesn't rise about the level of not-bad television. (Scott)20100916
'Going the Distance' (R, 1:36) A surprisingly not bad romantic comedy -- high praise indeed -- thanks in no small part of Justin Long and Drew Barrymore, playing a couple whose love is tested by geographical separation and a tough job market. (It's funnier than that makes it sound.) (Scott)20100916
'Heartbreaker' (No rating, 1:44, in French) This slapstick-infused French imitation of a Hollywood romantic comedy is saved by Romain Duris's frisky portrayal of an ethical gigolo who is hired to break up mismatched couples, without sleeping with the women. (Holden)20100916
- 'I Am Love' (No rating, 2:00, in Italian) A visually lush melodrama from Luca Guadagnino about the young matriarch (Tilda Swinton) of a wealthy Milanese family whose passions and suffering fuel this art-house gloss on the women's picture. (Dargis)20100916
'I'm Still Here' (R, 1:48) The actor Joaquin Phoenix puts himself front and center in this gloss on the mutually parasitic worlds of celebritydom and the entertainment media. His brother-in-law, the actor Casey Affleck, plays the director. (Dargis)20100916
'Inception' (PG-13, 2:32) This elegantly action-filled brainteaser from Christopher Nolan (''The Dark Knight,'' ''Memento'') stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a spy for hire who burrows into the dreams of his targets and nearly gets lost in his own subconscious, where a mysterious woman played by Marion Cotillard is waiting for him. The film is entertaining enough but not quite up to its grandest ambitions, and it works best as a heist movie with a few extra twists and visual surprises. (Scott)20100916
- 'The Kids Are All Right' (R, 1:45) American family life in all its imperfections, perfectly captured by the director Lisa Cholodenko and a flawless, peerless cast led by Julianne Moore and Annette Bening as a lesbian couple with two teenage children and a couple of decades worth of unspoken tensions and frustration. These pop to the surface when Mark Ruffalo shows up, playing the children's biological but heretofore invisible father. What follows is brilliantly funny without exaggeration, and heartbreaking without a hint of melodramatic manipulation. (Scott)20100916
- 'The Last Exorcism' (PG-13, 1:28) Perched at the intersection of faith, folklore and female puberty, this genuinely eerie little movie trails a Louisiana preacher (Patrick Fabian) as he films an expose-exorcism of a teenage girl (Ashley Bell). Relying on dry humor and an accumulating atmosphere of psychological dysfunction, Daniel Stamm directs his single-camera viewpoint cleanly and with a confidence that falters only in the final reel. (Catsoulis)20100916
- 'Last Train Home' (No rating, 1:27, in Mandarin language and Sichuan dialect) Lixin Fan's wrenching and compassionate documentary examines a complex and overwhelming social phenomenon -- the role of migrant laborers in China's fast-changing economy -- from the standpoint of a family that is tested and fractured by globalization. (Scott)20100916
- 'Lebanon' (R, 1:32, in Hebrew and Arabic) The 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, experienced by a group of young soldiers inside a tank. Unsparing and formally impressive. (Scott)20100916
- 'Life During Wartime' (No rating, 1:37) Todd Solondz's new movie revisits many of the characters from ''Happiness'' (1998) and matches that film for creepy comedy while expanding on its sense of compassion and ethical seriousness. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village . (Scott)20100916
'Lottery Ticket' (PG-13, 1:35) Erik White's crowd-pleasing comedy, about a high school grad (Bow Wow) in hot water in the projects after hitting the jackpot, is buoyed by a well-oiled script and a big, vivid supporting cast, including Ice Cube, winning as a reclusive, sagacious ex-boxer and the movie's heart. (Webster)20100916
'Machete' (R, 1:45) The pace is swift, the tone playful, and the screenplay peppered with one-liners in the splatter comedy that takes on the immigration debate. Whether mowed down by gunfire or dispatched by sheaves of blades, the bodies pile up in split-second blasts of carnage. (Holden)20100916
'Mao's Last Dancer' (PG, 1:57) In Bruce Beresford's film, based on the true story of a Chinese dancer who was allowed to come to Houston to study in the early 1980s and subsequently defected, ballet and modern Chinese history are window dressing for what's essentially a deluxe old-fashioned tear-jerker. (Mike Hale)20100916
- 'Mesrine: Killer Instinct' (Part 1) and 'Mesrine: Public Enemy No. 1' (Part 2) (R, 1:53 and 2:14, in French) ''Mesrine'' may not be a tragic gangster epic in the tradition of the ''The Godfather'' movies; it is too flighty and episodic. But it has a monumental lead performance by Vincent Cassel. The performance fuses the cobralike menace of the young Robert Mitchum with the whipsaw, shape-shifting volatility of classic Robert De Niro. (Holden)20100916
'Modus Operandi' (No rating, 1:30) Frankie Latina's lovingly assembled oddity, an homage to 1960s and '70s exploitation and art-house films, isn't boring -- the copious nudity, including male full-frontal, helps with that -- but it isn't as much fun as it should be. Genre fetishists will eat it up, but the dirty kick of the films he's mimicking is mostly absent, replaced by self-consciousness. (Hale)20100916
- 'My Dog Tulip' (No rating, 1:23) Its hand-drawn animation by the directors Paul and Sandra Fierlinger and Christopher Plummer's understated conversational voice, tossing off profound, heartfelt observations, combine to make this film, based on J. R. Ackerley's celebrated memoir, one of the most sophisticated dog movies ever created. (Holden)20100916
'Never Let Me Go' (R, 1:43) Mark Romanek directs this pretty, emotionally arid adaptation of the Kazuo Ishiguro novel, with Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley as three young people raised to become organ donators. (Dargis)20100916
'The Other Guys' (PG-13, 1:47) Mostly the same guy -- Will Ferrell -- doing some goofy stuff in a buddy-cop action-comedy, with Mark Wahlberg as his partner. Pretty funny for a while, then runs out of steam. (Scott)20100916
'Piranha 3D' (R, 1:22) Lots of flesh, naked and chomped. Should be funnier and scarier, but makes a decent, nasty effort to be both. (Scott)20100916
- 'Prince of Broadway' (No rating, 1:40) When an ex-girlfriend abandons an 18-month-old boy in the arms of Lucky (Prince Adu), a silver-tongued street hustler in New York City, the event subtly realigns the priorities of everyone around him. Skirting the saccharine moralizing and sticky moments of parent-child bonding that usually accompany babies into screenplays, Sean Baker's third feature, like its scrabbling hero, is sharp, charismatic and so light on its feet we never know which way it will turn. (Catsoulis)20100916
'Resident Evil: Afterlife' (R, 1:30) More moribund than its thronging undead, this witless fourth installment in the video-game-derived saga of a comely zombie hunter (Milla Jovovich) spends most of its running time in a Los Angeles prison surrounded by hordes of pustular flesh-eaters. Assisted by helpful freeze-frames to allow us to admire the extra dimension, a small band of survivors fights off the infected and finally heads for the sewers. The script follows. (Catsoulis)20100916
'The Romantics' (PG-13, 1:35) Another wedding movie of half-baked suspense wondering whether the bride- and groom-to-be will go through with the ceremony or back out at the last second. There you have the outline of ''The Romantics,'' a formulaic rom-com with an Ivy League pedigree and a higher-than-average SAT verbal score. (Holden)20100916
'Salt' (PG-13, 1:39) Angelina Jolie runs and jumps and shoots and does all the expected action-movie things with such velocity and verve that the emptiness and absurdity of this thriller (cleanly directed by Phillip Noyce) may not register until the last explosion has stopped echoing. (Scott)20100916
- 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' (PG-13, 1:48) A video game, a comic-book adaptation, a romance, an action movie, an almost-musical -- and most of all a fast, clever burst of clever, winning youthful energy. (Scott)20100916
'La Soga' (No rating, 1:40) In this Dominican Republic-based thriller, a government assassin (Manny Perez, who is also the film's screenwriter) seeks revenge on the drug dealer who murdered his father. The film moves with a crazed energy that rebuffs moral nuance, but the banal narrative (based on events in Mr. Perez's life) is elbowed aside by Josh Crook's eccentric direction and images that the cinematographer, Zeus Morand, brands with near-poetic intensity. (Catsoulis)20100916
'Step Up 3D' (PG-13, 1:47) This second sequel in the ''Step Up'' series is business as usual, which means that every 20 minutes or so the story, such as it is, grinds to a halt for another overproduced, impressively athletic, numbingly repetitive dance-crew routine. The most interesting thing about Jon M. Chu's film is its 3-D cinematography, which is unusually natural-looking and unobtrusive. (Hale)20100916
'The Switch' (PG-13, 1:41) The first third of this comedy, about a sperm-donation mix-up, is so bizarre it leads you to wonder if, through some miraculous lack of oversight, the movie will blaze an unpredictable path. No such luck. (Holden)20100916
'Takers' (PG-13, 1:47) A movie about guys who take stuff that is every bit as imaginative as its title. The clothes are nice, though, and there are some decent action sequences and performances (notably from Matt Dillon and Tip Harris, better known as the rapper T. I.). (Scott)20100916
- 'The Tillman Story' (R, 1:34) The clear-sighted, emotionally steady documentary tells the story of Pat Tillman, the football hero who was killed by so-called ''friendly fire'' in Afghanistan. Chronicling his family's deepening inquiry into the circumstances of his death, it sympathizes with their mounting rage at the military's propagandistic misappropriation of the facts to portray him as a war hero. (Holden)20100916
- 'Toy Story 3' (G, 1:38) The further adventures of Buzz, Woody and the others, and also a richly emotional meditation on love, loss, consumer capitalism and the passing of time. (Scott)20100916
'The Twilight Saga: Eclipse' (PG-13, 2:04) No surprises -- Bella is still mooning over Edward while Jacob is mooning over Bella, against a backdrop of intravampire warfare -- but this third installment in the popular series is in many ways the most enjoyable so far. There is more action, juicier (though still chaste) romance and even a few welcome hints of self-conscious humor. (Scott)20100916
'Winter's Bone' (R, 1:40) Debra Granik's flinty Ozark noir follows a teenage girl's search for her missing father, an expert methamphetamine cooker who has fallen afoul of his own outlaw kin. Jennifer Lawrence's lead performance is flawless and helps to lift this film above at least some of the usual independent-movie assumptions about rural poverty in America. (Scott)20100916
'A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop' (R, 1:35, in Mandarin) Joel and Ethan Coen's ''Blood Simple'' is not necessarily a movie that was crying out to be remade, but the Chinese director Zhang Yimou did it anyway, and the result is a genre exercise that discovers both gravity and absurdity in a sturdy old story of lust, greed and revenge. (Scott)20100916
Film Series
'Bela Lugosi's Dead, Vampires Live Forever' (Friday through Thursday) And so, apparently, does this continuing retrospective of vampire movies at BAMcinematek, which is including some offshore variations on the theme: Claire Denis's French film ''Trouble Every Day'' (Friday); Tomas Alfredson's Swedish sleeper ''Let the Right One In'' (Saturday); Ricky Lau's lively 1986 Hong Kong variant, ''Mr. Vampire II'' (Tuesday); and Jean Rollin's French exploitation film of 1971, ''Thrill of the Vampires'' (Wednesday). And on Monday, a screening of Tod Browning's 1931 ''Dracula'' is accompanied by a seven-minute interview with its charismatic star, Bela Lugosi, who reveals himself as the continental gentleman he was. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene , (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $12. (Dave Kehr)20100916
Bertrand Bonello (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Bonello, who divides his time between filmmaking and concert music, will be present Tuesday evening at the French Institute Alliance Francaise to introduce his most recent feature, ''On War,'' about a filmmaker (Mathieu Amalric) who stumbles across a secret society of mind explorers (led by Asia Argento). He'll also be at Anthology Film Archives on Wednesday to present three of his short films, including the 2007 ''film for the ears,'' ''My New Picture.'' French Institute Alliance Francaise, Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6100, fiaf.org; $10; Anthology Film Archives, 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village , (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $9.

'Desperately Seeking Susan' (Thursday) The Film Society of Lincoln Center celebrates the 25th anniversary of Susan Seidelman's bohemian comedy, about a New Jersey housewife (Rosanna Arquette) who assumes the trademark jacket and, inadvertently, the identity of a Lower East Side hipster (Madonna, in her first major role). The 7:30 p.m. screening will be followed by a discussion with Ms. Seidelman; the screenwriter Leora Barish; the producers Sarah Pillsbury and Midge Sanford; and ''special guests.''

HEADLINE: Economy Creates an Opening for Democrat in Texas Race for Governor

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- A few months ago, Texas political consultants thought that a Democrat had about as much chance of winning statewide office as a donkey would have of winning the Kentucky Derby. Those odds seemed to grow longer as the anti-tax, anti-government movement known as the Tea Party gathered more followers.
Yet recent polls suggest Texas has a horse race for the governor's office after all. The Democratic candidate, former Mayor Bill White of Houston, has pulled within striking distance of the incumbent Republican, Rick Perry, trailing by no more than 6 percentage points in four polls. 
The tightening contest comes as Texas feels the effects of the national economic crisis, weakening one of Mr. Perry's chief arguments for re-election: that his fiscally conservative policies have buffered the state from the worst of the recession.
Now, a budget gap has opened in the next two-year spending plan that has been estimated by the state's Legislative Budget Board at $18 billion. The state already has a bare-bones spending plan, and closing the new gap would mean raising taxes, which Mr. Perry has vowed to oppose, or cutting spending about 10 percent.
Mr. Perry has tried hard to tie Mr. White, a lawyer and businessman who was mayor for two terms, to President Obama's efforts to provide health insurance to everyone and to stimulate the economy through government spending.
Mr. Perry has been so focused on bashing Washington that he at times appears to be running for governor of the United States. In Dallas this week, he said that Texas voters faced a choice between ''the Obama style of government'' of debt and high spending, or his own style -- low taxes, no-frills services and minimal regulation.
''There is a land of opportunity still left in America,'' Mr. Perry said. ''It's called Texas.''
Mr. White has done his best to undermine Mr. Perry's claim to having steered the state to prosperity with a tight hand on the fiscal reins. Unemployment here is lower than the national average, but at 8.2 percent the rate is still twice what it was in 2008 and higher than at any point since 1986.
The governor also balanced the budget in 2009 with the help of stimulus money from Washington, the same money that Mr. Perry now complains should never have been appropriated, Mr. White has pointed out.
Mr. White has also attacked the governor's character, calling him a ''career politician'' who oversees ''a political machine.'' He has pointed out that Mr. Perry has been living in a $10,000-a-month apartment since the governor's mansion was destroyed by an arsonist in 2008. Mr. White has needled Mr. Perry for the size and cost of his security detail.
And Mr. White has also resurrected accusations that the governor has made some of his friends wealthy with state largess over his nine years in office, and has questioned Mr. Perry's use of public funds to entice large corporations to Texas.
Mr. Perry has avoided committing to a debate, saying he will not agree to one until Mr. White releases his tax returns from the 1990s. ''Bill White is hiding something on his tax returns,'' he said Thursday.
Mr. White called the request absurd, pointing out that he has disclosed tax returns for all his years in elected office and his financial disclosure statements from his years as a deputy energy secretary in the Clinton administration. Mr. Perry, he asserts, is dodging a debate to avoid being held accountable for the state's budget woes, among other things.
The debate over the debate ended in a stalemate this week, and it looks unlikely that a debate will ever be held, both sides now say.
Whether Mr. White's punches are landing is hard to gauge, political strategists and pollsters say. Some Republican strategists say the race has tightened only because Mr. White's campaign, and a Democratic group called Back to Basics, have been advertising since July, often with negative messages, while Mr. Perry put his first television advertisements on the air this week.
Though one advertisement was a positive spot boasting of job growth during Mr. Perry's tenure, three others are attack ads, claiming Mr. White had profited from decisions he made during Hurricane Rita and criticizing his handling of the Houston budget. ''Obama and White. Washington-style spending,'' says the announcer in one ad. On Thursday, the governor also painted Mr. White as a ''liberal trial lawyer'' who is soft on gun rights.
''Once the Rick Perry machine kicks into gear, they are very, very good and at what they do and they are going to tear Bill White apart,'' said Mark Sanders, a Republican strategist from East Texas. ''He's an easy target.''
Some political scientists say, however, that Mr. Perry has never enjoyed widespread popularity, and it appears some of the general anti-incumbent sentiment is affecting him. Republicans, after all, control all the statewide offices and the Legislature here.
''The Republican campaign narrative nationally is that the people running government are doing a bad job of it,'' said Jim Henson, a political scientist and pollster at the University of Texas. ''Perry's message is ideologically consistent with this, but the Republicans here run all the offices.''
Democratic strategists, meanwhile, are not yet running to the betting windows to put big money down on a victory. But some are saying the governor appears more vulnerable than had been predicted.
''Mr. White is an underdog, but he's not a far-away underdog,'' said Glenn Smith, who managed the campaign of the last Democrat to win in Texas, Ann Richards, in 1990. ''This could be a far more competitive World Series than people think.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sept. 17 about the unexpected tightening of the race for Texas governor misstated the number of terms the Democratic candidate, Bill White, served as mayor of Houston. He served three two-year terms, not two three-year terms.

 Gov. Rick Perry (PHOTOGRAPHS BY ASSOCIATED PRESS) MAP: Texas Governor Race: Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican who has been in office for nearly a decade, is arguing that his pro-business, anti-tax policies have buffered the state from the national economic malaise. He is facing a strong challenge from former Mayor Bill White of Houston, a moderate Democrat who portrays the governor as a machine politician with a penchant for luxuries.

HEADLINE: In Skyscraper at Ground Zero, Sentiment Trumped Numbers

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Timing is everything.
I had originally planned to write this column last week, on the ninth anniversary of the terrorist attacks that brought down the World Trade Center, killing nearly 3,000 people who were working in the two buildings that awful morning. The topic is the economics of 1 World Trade Center -- the building, formerly known as the Freedom Tower, with one of the most tortured construction histories in New York history -- that is finally being erected at ground zero. When it is finished, it will stand 1,776 feet in the air, making it the tallest building in New York.
With an expected completion date of 2013, 1 World Trade Center is the most expensive skyscraper ever constructed in the United States, with a price tag currently estimated at $3.3 billion. By contrast, the spanking new Bank of America Tower in Midtown Manhattan cost about $2 billion. That is pretty much the going rate for building new skyscrapers in New York City. Just to break even, 1 World Trade Center will require rents far higher than the going rate in Midtown, much less downtown New York, where the building is located and where rents are considerably lower. 
Since 1 World Trade Center is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, it seems fair to assume that any shortfall between the building's annual rental income and its carrying costs will most likely be borne by the people who pay the toll to cross the George Washington Bridge, or use the Lincoln Tunnel, or ride the PATH rail system, all of which the Port Authority controls. It also seems fair to say that no private developer in his right mind would build a $3.3 billion high-rise office building in a marketplace that tops out at $2 billion. Only a government entity would do such a thing. My plan was to question whether 1 World Trade Center really made sense for the city and its taxpayers.
But I blinked last week. Even nine years later, the events surrounding 9/11 remain so emotional that it seemed somehow sacrilegious to ask tough questions about 1 World Trade Center on the day of the anniversary. Although the Port Authority claims it changed the name from Freedom Tower precisely because it wanted the building to be viewed as a commercial office building and not a civic symbol, it is difficult to rid the building entirely of its symbolism.
It is, after all, going up on the same hallowed ground where the twin towers once stood. Part of the reason it costs so much is that its first 200 feet are reinforced concrete and steel -- designed to deter future terrorist attacks. (Another reason is that it will have a 408-foot spire, allowing it to reach that 1,776 foot mark.)
But as I discovered this week, I'm not the only one who's been blinking. It turns out that there are plenty of people, including former New York State officials and New York City developers, who believe that 1 World Trade Center is folly. ''An emotionally induced misuse of money,'' said one such person. ''You can only understand this as a political statement,'' said another. ''It makes no sense as a commercial real estate endeavor.''
Not one of these people, however, would go on the record; there was simply no percentage in it. As a result, the notion that a government agency would spend $3.3 billion constructing an uneconomical high-rise in a depressed market has drawn far less scrutiny than it deserves. Better late than never.
When the twin towers went down, New York City lost 10 million square feet of office space. But the initial impetus to rebuild had less to do with reclaiming that lost office space and more to do with showing the terrorists that we wouldn't be cowed. Over time, however, as the rebuilding got bogged down in disputes over design and financing, it gradually became clear that the city didn't really need the 10 million square feet it had lost on 9/11. It had a glut of office space. Rents were falling. Especially after the bubble burst in 2007, commercial real estate developers struggled.
Yet there was never a moment when anyone in government was willing to question whether 1 World Trade Center -- with its 2.6 million square feet of office space -- still made sense. Former Gov. George Pataki pushed the Freedom Tower -- a name he came up with -- with every fiber of his being. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg never wavered in his support. Former Gov. Eliot Spitzer came into office professing to be more skeptical of the project, but did nothing to stop it.
In those earlier years, the building's economics were even worse than they are now. In 2006, with no potential tenants in sight, the Port Authority actually negotiated deals with federal and state agencies to occupy parts of the building at above-market rents. In other words, taxpayers were going to take a hit so that the building could have some occupants. Thankfully, those deals eventually disappeared.
Even so, the building's economics are still nothing to write home about. One World Trade Center is going to cost somewhere on the order of $1,300 a square foot to build, more than double the cost of most new skyscrapers. And because it is what's called Class A office space, meaning that everything is top of the line, maintaining the building is also going to be very expensive. My real estate sources say they believe that the Port Authority will need to charge $130 a square foot to break even on the building.
But of course the Port Authority can't possibly charge anything close to that -- not in this real estate market or any market in the foreseeable future. The average rent for a downtown high-rise is $55 to $60 a square foot. Even if the Port Authority were able to charge higher, Midtown rents, it would still only be getting, at best, $80 a square foot.
A few weeks ago, the news leaked that the Port Authority was negotiating with Conde Nast to become a tenant in the building. Because Conde Nast is one of the most glamorous companies in New York, it would be a boost to the prospects of 1 World Trade Center to have it in the building. But it won't be economical: the Port Authority told me that, assuming a deal goes through, Conde Nast would most likely be paying the current market rate for downtown space -- that is, less than half what it needed to break even. It will also undoubtedly be locked into that rate for many years. Luring Conde Nast downtown is going to be expensive for the Port Authority.
Not surprisingly, the Port Authority disagrees with my analysis. It points to the fact that it has close to $1 billion in insurance proceeds that it is using to defray the cost of the building. And it says its break-even number is much lower than $130 a square foot.
''It is not going to get a typical developer's rate of return,'' conceded Rich Gladstone, the Port Authority's point man on the project. ''But it will be cash-flow positive.'' He insisted that the commuters who pay their $8 a day to cross the George Washington Bridge would never have to support 1 World Trade Center. Of course that's easy to say now, with the building still two years away from completion.
Still, the Port Authority made another recent move intended to ensure the success of the building. It sold a small piece of the equity in 1 World Trade Center -- around 5 percent -- to the Durst Organization, for a reported $100 million. It is a great deal for Durst, one of the biggest and savviest commercial developers in New York. (It built the Bank of America Tower, for instance.) Its investment values the building at $2 billion, far less than it cost to build, so if it rises in value, Durst gets the upside. And in return for its $100 million, Durst gets to manage the building for the Port Authority, an arrangement that will allow it to reap fees for everything from finding tenants to reconfiguring office space. It is also a deal filled with a certain, undeniable irony, which has not been lost on anybody in New York real estate circles.
You see, Douglas Durst, the company's 65-year-old patriarch, has been one of the few people willing to criticize 1 World Trade Center on the record. When the Port Authority was negotiating with those government agencies back in 2006, Mr. Durst told The New York Times that saddling ''already overburdened taxpayers of New York with the rent necessary to pay for it makes no sense at all.'' He even took out advertisements opposing the project.
When I called Mr. Durst this week, he did not appear to be exactly embracing this newest addition to the New York skyline, even though it was going to put money in his company's pockets. ''I've always been against it,'' he said. ''I have always felt that the private sector should develop and build office buildings'' -- not government agencies. He pointed out that the original World Trade Center, which had also been built by the Port Authority, took several decades to become even modestly successful. But, he added, since 1 World Trade Center was a done deal, it made more sense to have a company like his operating the building instead of the Port Authority.
''There is a constant need for new office buildings,'' he said, in defense of the new building. ''The fact that Conde Nast is going to go down there shows that there is demand for it.'' As it happens, Conde Nast is currently a tenant in another Durst building, in Times Square, but Mr. Durst insisted that was merely a coincidence. To make the building work, he'll need a few more coincidences along those lines.
We talked for a while longer about the building and its finances. Mr. Durst said he expected it to become cash-flow positive ''by 2018 or 2019,'' which struck me as awfully optimistic. Then, before hanging up the phone, he said, ''I want to reiterate that, as in the Times Square redevelopment'' -- another initiative he initially opposed before coming around and making a fortune -- ''I was against it before I was for it.''
Timing is everything.

HEADLINE: In Diversity Case, City Rejects A Plan for Hiring Firefighters

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
The City of New York said Friday that it would not hire a new class of firefighters using proposals laid out by a federal judge, who had ruled that the test used to screen Fire Department applicants discriminated against African-Americans and Hispanics. 
In a letter to the judge, Nicholas G. Garaufis of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn, Michael A. Cardoza, the city's corporation counsel, said all of the judge's five hiring methods involved race-based quotas that were ''both illegal and unwise public policy.''
The city's decision is the latest move in a long-running legal battle over how to diversify a firefighting force that remains overwhelmingly white.
Judge Garaufis ruled in August that the exam for firefighters used by the department discriminated against blacks and Hispanics, and he issued a temporary order prohibiting the city from hiring firefighters.
But in hearings before Judge Garaufis, the city said that if it was not able to hire a new class of firefighters, it would incur millions of dollars in overtime costs per month. The city wanted to hire about 300 firefighters.
In response, Judge Garaufis offered the city five methods it could use to hire a new class, which would, he wrote, ''adequately balance the court's duty to eradicate illegal discrimination with the need to safeguard New York's citizens and firefighters.''
Some of his proposals were meant to ensure that the class of firefighters that was hired would have the same percentage of blacks and Hispanics as the applicant pool that took the test. Other proposals would diversify the pool of those eligible to be hired by replacing the lowest-scoring white candidates with minority candidates who had lower scores.
''I'm a little bit surprised and confused by the city's response,'' said Darius Charney, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, which is representing the Vulcan Society, an organization of black firefighters. The group is suing the city, claiming discrimination.
''They've been saying all along they wanted to hire a new class as soon as possible,'' Mr. Charney said. ''They were presented with a way to do that that complied with civil rights laws, and they chose not to. They're contradicting themselves.''
The city, however, saw it differently.
''All of the options were quota based, and the city does not believe that that's good public policy,'' said Georgia Pestana, one of the city lawyers involved in the case.
Ms. Pestana said the city's need for new firefighters was ''just as urgent as it was last month when we held the hearings.'' But, she added, ''we decided it was important to stick to our principles; we'll figure out a way to deal with the economic hardship this is going to cause.''

HEADLINE: Lives Under the Streets Turn Into Lives for Puppets

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Life must be hell when a subway beggar doesn't want your money.
Meghan Healey was a design student and flat broke several years ago when she handed a man her pocketful of pennies. ''I really was giving him all the money I had,'' Ms. Healey recalled. ''And he threw them back in my face! I couldn't believe a homeless person was telling me my money was no good.''
But humiliation turned to inspiration: she has transformed the penny-flinging panhandler into Homeless Bob, the surly yet selfless soul of her play-in-progress ''Subterraneo: A Cruel Puppet's Guide to Underground Living.'' The piece is a puppet mash-up of Dante's ''Inferno'' and real-life subway stories gathered by Ms. Healey and a half-dozen student volunteers at Queens College, where she is an assistant professor of costume and scenic design. 
Plans call for Homeless Bob to guide the Commutrix -- an earnest rider not unlike Ms. Healey -- through the subway the way Virgil led Dante through the nine circles of hell, from Limbo to Betrayal. Along the route, they will be serenaded in Spanish by the Undead Mariachi Trio and watch beggars like Legless Joe bewail their afflictions to tug on the heartstrings and purse strings of weary commuters.
Depending on the scenes, to be written by Ms. Healey and several collaborating playwrights, Homeless Bob will be funny, friendly or furious. ''I think of him as a modern-day New York Virgil, if Virgil was homeless in New York,'' Ms. Healey, 34, said. ''He's not as benevolent. He's angry.''
One quiet morning, she and her students were intently working on puppets inside a softly lighted studio at the college. One student gently stuffed crumpled newsprint into Bob's plastic-bag body, while another dug her thumbs into a chunk of clay being molded into another puppet's head. Mariachi skeleton puppets lay on a table awaiting decorations for their tiny charro jackets.
Music, it turns out, is one thing people like about the subway, said her students, who went out several times a week to interview commuters about their underground likes, dislikes and strangest encounters. Late trains or dirty stations still top many riders' most-hated lists, and plenty have had more than a few run-ins with subway psychos.
Sex and violence have come up a lot in their interviews, even if people are reluctant at first to share risque tales with the puppet masters. But as Ms. Healey explains, ''Pinocchio'' this isn't.
''By calling them 'Cruel Puppets,' I wanted to make sure people knew this was a grown-up thing,'' she said. ''And the stories are so surreal and strange, that puppets are the perfect way to tell them.''
She has had no shortage of odd run-ins since she came to New York 15 years ago to study at New York University and work in the theater, witnessing all sorts of spectacles on late-night rides home. There was the time, she said, that a man decked out like a rhinestone cowboy threatened to stab a female security guard who had -- unprovoked -- threatened to shoot him. Ms. Healey and a businessman watched in alarm, then grabbed each other's hands and bolted for the doors when the train stopped.
''The guy and I nodded and went our separate ways,'' she said. ''For all I know, those two could have killed each other.''
The notion of turning those moments into drama was also prompted by her work with community-based theater, where plays are based on something -- a neighborhood or an interest -- that the group has in common. Aided by a grant from the college's provost, who wanted to spur faculty-student collaborations, Ms. Healey and her students went looking for shared experience below the streets.
''You ride the subway from one end to the other and you come across every economic sector,'' she said. ''It's the real New York City. Millions of people, body to body. The fact people don't kill each other, why does that happen?''
It took the students a while to learn to approach strangers on the train, and then to learn that they would fare better outside major stations than on bustling platforms. In recent weeks they have trolled Union Square Park.
Younger people are more friendly, they said, though their elders offer surprising insights. ''They say the conditions have improved a lot in terms of safety and cleanliness,'' said Elyse Price, a senior. ''I was shocked when I heard that. I'm from Queens, and the 7 train has not been good to me over the years. They still have the red cars.''
Many riders said they enjoyed the musicians on the platforms, taking the edge off their commute. Others talked about regulars they saw every day, especially artists, who made them feel part of a rolling community.
As for the subway's infernal parts, the students found enough stories to flesh out the second circle, Lust.
''One person told me she had a bet with her friend that she could find somebody to sleep with on the train,'' Ms. Price said. ''She went over and started taking to one guy and wound up sleeping with him. On the train.''
Another commuter provided potential fodder for the first circle, Limbo.
''He said everyone who is on the train is alone,'' said Henry Cheng, a senior. ''We are surrounded by people, but all alone in our bodies. It reminded me of something I read in a play, that trains travel so fast that it takes time for the soul to catch up to the body. When you're in transit, you lose a bit of your personality.''
That could apply to those who live in transit, like the homeless people Mr. Cheng has seen over the years. Yet he has come to see them as a small community of people who help one another out -- say, pooling money for meals or clothes for the laundry.
Indeed, in Ms. Healey's reimagining of Dante, which she intends to perform for the first time next spring, she has lent a touch of nobility to her panhandler, who sacrifices himself for those who would otherwise shun him. She based the episode on recent news reports about a homeless Queens man who was stabbed as he defended a woman against an assailant, then went ignored by passers-by as he bled to death.
Maybe she has been influenced by her other underground interest: photographing people reading religious texts on the train. Given that she takes four trains and a bus from her home in the north Bronx to the college campus in Flushing, she has plenty of time to behold the varieties of religious experience.
''You're alone with your thoughts,'' she said. ''It becomes a place of unexpected spirituality and refuge.''

HEADLINE: More Clout at I.M.F. Seen for Developing Economies

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
PARIS -- Leaders from the Group of 20 nations should be able to sign off soon on agreements to bolster the weight of developing economies at the International Monetary Fund, while also increasing the fund's resources, a senior South Korean official said Friday.
The accords should be approved at a summit in Seoul on Nov. 11-12, according to Sakong Il, who is coordinating the program of the meetings for the South Korean president. 
It would represent the first step in handing more clout in the global institution to fast-growing economies like China, India and Brazil at the expense of more advanced economies, notably in Europe. Such agreements would not compromise the U.S.'s pivotal role at the fund, he said.
''It should be done -- it must be done -- for the G-20's credibility, because leaders have already agreed on a 5 percent quota shift by November,'' Mr. Sakong said during an interview.
A former Korean finance minister, Mr. Sakong was in Paris to meet the French economy minister and officials at the presidential Elysee Palace. He had just arrived from Washington, and meetings with Larry Summers, the White House economic adviser.
The change would alter the so-called quotas, or proportion of funds, held at the I.M.F. by different members. It would involve a capital increase of probably 100 percent, according to international officials. The details are likely to be finalized at fund meetings in Washington next month.
For this increase, European economies would pay proportionally less than they previously had, while emerging economies would pay more, using a complex formula that would bring a 5 percent shift between the two camps on average.
Decisions by the fund require an 85 percent vote, which are almost exactly the same as the quotas. The United States has 17 percent of votes, giving it a blocking veto.
Mr. Sakong said the U.S. veto was ''not on the formal agenda'' of the G-20 leaders' meeting and ''will have to be a continued discussion for coming summits.''
There are also likely to be at least some changes in the composition of the I.M.F.'s 24-member board. The United States wants Europe to give some of its nine board seats to emerging market countries to reflect their growing global economic weight.
Germany, France and Britain have their own seats on the board, while European Union members Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Denmark represent constituencies of countries. Switzerland, though not part of the Union, also has a chair.
''It's not easy, it's a kind of zero sum game,'' Mr Sakong said of the allocation of board seats. ''Someone has to give ground.''
Until recently, Europeans had appeared reluctant to alter the status quo, fearing a dilution of their power. But Washington took an unprecedented step in August of declining to back a resolution that would have retained Europe's dominance. Europe now appears ready to go some way by allowing a partial rotation of the chairs for some of its groups.
A European official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the initial loser would be Belgium, which has agreed in principle to rotate the presidency of its constituency with Turkey.
The possibility of rotating the chair of another constituency -- led by the Swiss and containing the Poles -- is also being discussed. The changes are likely to take effect next year or in 2012.
Mr. Sakong also expressed confidence that the Seoul summit would bring agreement on another capital increase for the fund. Apart from allowing for the quota changes, the planned capital increase at the fund would help in the creation of new credit lines at the fund.
''Asians are willing to put more money in,'' he said.
European capitals also appear to have backed this plan.
As a result of the crisis, the G-20 agreed in 2009 to treble the fund's lendable resources, from $250 billion. Not all members have ratified this increase yet, with just over half of the $500 billion already committed.
Last month, the IMF approved would extending and removing limits on its so-called flexible credit line, reserved for countries with sound fundamentals. A new credit line, with additional policy requirements for economies with ''moderate vulnerabilities'' was also created.Mr. Sakong said he was hopeful that a third mechanism -- tentatively referred to as a Global Stabilization Mechanism, -- will soon be finalized. Details remain to be finalized but this could act as a framework to allow existing regional financial support mechanisms -- like the $250 billion Chiang Mai Initiative in Asia and the $750 million Europe Financial Support Fund -- to assist struggling economies in conjunction with the I.M.F.

HEADLINE: Two Different Worlds

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
I didn't notice much when a terrific storm slammed into parts of New York City on Thursday evening. I was working at my computer in a quiet apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The skies darkened and it began to rain, and I could hear thunder. But that's all. I made a cup of coffee and kept working.
While I remained oblivious, the storm took a frightening toll in the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. A woman who was trying to walk home with her 10-year-old daughter from Prospect Park in Brooklyn told me the next day that it had been the most harrowing experience of her life. ''With the wind and the rain, it was like being trapped in a car wash,'' she said. ''And then a tree crashed down on a car right in front of us.'' 
They ran soaking wet up the steps of a brownstone and the owner, a stranger, let them come inside.
The winds reached tornadolike intensity. Trees were uprooted and blown into electrical power lines. Roofs were blown from buildings. One woman was killed, and several neighborhoods were devastated.
I eventually heard about it on the news.
The movers and shakers of our society seem similarly oblivious to the terrible destruction wrought by the economic storm that has roared through America. They've heard some thunder, perhaps, and seen some lightning, and maybe felt a bit of the wind. But there is nothing that society's leaders are doing -- no sense of urgency in their policies or attitudes -- that suggests they understand the extent of the economic devastation that has come crashing down like a plague on the poor and much of the middle class.
The American economy is on its knees and the suffering has reached historic levels. Nearly 44 million people were living in poverty last year, which is more than 14 percent of the population. That is an increase of 4 million over the previous year, the highest percentage in 15 years, and the highest number in more than a half-century of record-keeping. Millions more are teetering on the edge, poised to fall into poverty.
More than a quarter of all blacks and a similar percentage of Hispanics are poor. More than 15 million children are poor.
The movers and shakers, including most of the mainstream media, have paid precious little attention to this wide-scale economic disaster.
Meanwhile, the middle class, hobbled for years with the stagnant incomes that accompany extreme employment insecurity, is now in retreat. Joblessness, home foreclosures, personal bankruptcy -- pick your poison. Median family incomes were 5 percent lower in 2009 than they were a decade earlier. The Harvard economist Lawrence Katz told The Times, ''This is the first time in memory that an entire decade has produced essentially no economic growth for the typical American household.''
I don't know what it will take, maybe a full-blown depression, for policy makers to decide that they need to take extraordinary additional steps to cope with this drastic economic and employment emergency. Nothing currently on the table will turn things around in a meaningful way. We're facing a jobs deficit of about 11 million, which is about how many new ones we'd have to create just to get our heads above water. It will take years -- years -- just to get employment back to where it was when the recession struck in December 2007.
If Republicans take over the policy levers, forget about it. The party of Palin, Limbaugh and Boehner -- with its tax cuts for the rich and obsession with the deregulatory, free-market zealotry that brought us the Great Recession -- will only accelerate the mass march into poverty.
The G.O.P. wants to further shred the safety net, wants to give corporations even greater clout over already debased workers, and wants to fatten the coffers of the already obscenely rich.
While working people are suffering the torments of joblessness, underemployment and dwindling compensation, corporate profits have rebounded and the financial sector is once again living the high life. This helps to keep the people at the top comfortably in denial about the extent of the carnage.
Millions of struggling voters have no idea which way to turn. They are suffering under the status quo, but those with any memory at all are afraid of a rerun of the catastrophic George W. Bush era. An Associated Press article, based on recent polling, summed the matter up: ''Glum and distrusting, a majority of Americans today are very confident in -- nobody.''
What is desperately needed is leadership that recognizes the depth and intensity of the economic crisis facing so many ordinary Americans. It's time for the movers and shakers to lift the shroud of oblivion and reach out to those many millions of Americans trapped in a world of hurt.

HEADLINE: In Great Recession, Other Nations Have Suffered More

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
THE Great Recession in America more than earned that title. But by international standards, it was not that bad.
The recession caused a greater decline in gross domestic product in the United States than any American downturn since World War II. It is also in the process of setting the record for the longest downturn, measured in the time it takes for the economy to recover to its prerecession level.
Yet among the world's major industrialized economies, the American recession was among the least severe. And the United States is ahead of most other countries in recovering the lost ground. 
From the peak level of economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2007, the American economy shrank 4.1 percent by the time it hit bottom in the second quarter of 2009. Since then, it has recovered most of what was lost, but the size of the economy remains 1.3 percent below the peak, according to preliminary figures for the second quarter of this year.
The accompanying charts show detailed performances of four large industrialized economies, the United States, Japan, Germany and Britain. The other three fell further than the United States, with drops ranging from 6.4 percent in Britain to 8.7 percent in Japan; each has further to go to recover to prerecession levels.
The charts also show the performance of 49 economies around the world. Included are all countries for which data is available and whose lowest quarter was at least 2 percent below the earlier peak level.
Many of the countries that had the worst time of it are former members of the Soviet bloc. The economies of the three Baltic states -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia -- all shrank by at least 18 percent. The only other economy to perform that poorly was Ukraine, also a former Soviet republic. Former Soviet bloc countries have also lagged in recovering from the downturn.
In other parts of Europe, the performance was generally better. But some countries -- notably Iceland and Ireland -- were severely damaged in part because major financial institutions collapsed.
It may be surprising that Greece's national output declined less than Germany's. But Greece's economy is still shrinking, while Germany has recovered much of its losses. But the figures are only as good as the national statistics office compiling them, and Greece's reputation on that score is not good.
All figures are measured in local currency, adjusted for inflation.
Until the recent recession, the deepest fall for the American economy since World War II was a 3.7 percent drop during the brief but steep downturn in 1958.
In the 1970s recession brought on by soaring oil prices, the economy took seven quarters to grow back to where it was before the recession, longer than any other postwar downturn. The figure now is 10 quarters and counting.
When the recent financial crisis was at its height, few countries escaped downturns. World trade volumes collapsed, devastating exporters in Asia and Latin America. But most of those countries quickly recovered; their economies are now larger than before the crisis hit.
China does not report exact quarterly figures, making it impossible to know how bad the situation became, but Hong Kong and Taiwan, which do provide numbers, were hurt. Taiwan and Turkey are the only countries that have completely recovered from a double-digit fall in G.D.P.
Some countries managed to escape a downturn or, at worst, had only a small and brief decline. Argentina, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Tunisia, Israel and Jordan are in that group. Poland's economy, unlike those of its Eastern European neighbors, has regained more than it lost in its shallow downturn.
Developed countries with robust natural resources sectors also fared well. Australia performed better than any other major industrialized economy; its G.D.P. fell less than 1 percent even at the worst of the crisis. Canada did experience a recession, but it has recovered nearly all of what was lost.

HEADLINE: Slight Rise In Shares As Signals Are Mixed

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks gave up most of their gains for the day to end slightly higher on Friday, extending a two-week rally that has slowed in recent days.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.2 points, but the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up less than a point. Both indexes traded close to the break-even level all day.
The market started on a positive note after surprisingly strong profit news late on Thursday from two technology leaders, Oracle and Research In Motion, which makes BlackBerrys. 
Technology and industrial shares were higher, though energy companies were weak after a drop in crude oil. A decline in a measure of consumer confidence from a University of Michigan/Thomson Reuters poll also kept a lid on buying. Gold set another record, and Treasury prices edged higher in a sign that investors remain cautious.
The S.& P. 500, the measure used most widely by professional investors, briefly edged above a technical trading threshold, but not enough to convince analysts that the market is ready to move sharply higher. Stocks have been on a nearly unbroken upward march in September, driving the S.& P. up 7.3 percent.
Traders watch such technical barriers closely for clues about where the market might go next. Right now the key level for the S.& P. 500 is 1,131, its intraday high for June 21 and the top end of its recent trading range. It exceeded that level Friday but did not stay above it, a sign that the market needs good news on the economy or corporate profits before moving higher again. It ended the day up 0.93 points or 0.1 percent, to 1,125.59.
Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, said that if the index could rally past 1,131, it could surge even further in the next couple of weeks. But if it cannot significantly eclipse that level and falls back below 1,115, roughly its low for the week, ''we could go to 1,000 pretty fast,'' Mr. Landesman said.
On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,607.85.
The Dow is up 5.9 percent in the month to date, defying skeptics who predicted a decline in September, which is historically a weak month for stocks.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index held onto some of its gains, rising 12.36 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,315.61.
For the week, the Dow and S.& P. are both up 1.4 percent, and the Nasdaq is up 3.3 percent.
In corporate news, Oracle reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that easily topped forecasts after the market closed Thursday. Shares jumped $2.12 on Friday, or 8.4 percent, to $27.48.
Research In Motion also reported a big jump in earnings as it added subscribers. Investors have been worried about competition to the BlackBerry from the AppleiPhone and mobile phones running Android, a Google product. R.I.M. shares closed up 23 cents, at $46.72.
Money flowed into Treasury notes again after the weak consumer sentiment reading and a report from the Labor Department showed consumer prices rose slightly in August.
The 10-year note rose 1/32 to 102 25/32. The yield fell to 2.74 percent, from 2.76 percent late Thursday. The note's yield is often used to set interest rates on mortgages and other consumer loans.
Gold touched a record high again Friday of $1,282.97 an ounce before pulling back to $1,274.30 an ounce.
Benchmark oil for October delivery fell 91 cents to settle at $73.66 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, helping to send energy shares lower. Chevron fell 59 cents to $78.46.

HEADLINE: Mr. Geithner and China

 BODY:
It is clear that China is going to keep manipulating its currency -- and crowding out every other exporter -- until the world pushes back. So it was good to hear Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner speaking out this week on Capitol Hill, warning that an undervalued Chinese currency ''makes it more difficult for goods and services produced by American workers to compete.'' 
The problem is that if the United States is the only one pushing back then Beijing will find it all too easy to ignore -- claiming that it is resisting the American bully.
The policy is not in China's long-term interest -- as Mr. Geithner made clear in his testimony. It yields little employment growth and represses household spending. But Beijing has been reluctant to give up a strategy that has underpinned years of stellar economic growth.
It is once again swamping the world with exports. And it is unlikely to change until more countries -- in Europe and Asia but especially India, Brazil and other developing countries, which China sees as its political constituency -- start complaining. They are also the countries most hurt by Beijing's currency manipulation. Mr. Geithner told Congress that he would look at the Obama administration's entire ''mix of tools.'' The decision this week by the United States trade representative to bring cases at the World Trade Organization against China's punitive tariffs on American steel and its discrimination against American debit card companies is a start.
The administration will also have to be careful not to unleash something it can't control. Protectionist impulses run frighteningly deep in Congress.
At the hearing, Senator Charles Schumer declared that ''China's currency manipulation is like a boot to the throat of our recovery. This administration refuses to try and take that boot off our neck.'' Nearly 100 members of the House from both parties recently sent a letter to the leadership asking for a vote on legislation that would impose new tariffs on Chinese imports to make up for its artificially cheap currency.
That can be a dangerous game. Unilateral trade sanctions could quickly lead to retaliation and escalate into a bilateral trade war that would benefit nobody and damage everybody.
The administration's softly-softly approach has made very little headway. China announced in June that it would release its currency peg to the dollar. Its currency, the renminbi, has appreciated less than 2 percent against the dollar since, and it has declined against the euro, the yen and other currencies.
It is good to hear Mr. Geithner speaking out. It was also good to hear Japan this week criticizing China's currency manipulation. The Obama administration now needs to persuade more countries to speak up. That may be the only way to get China to abandon its victim act and its policy that is doing huge economic damage around the world.

HEADLINE: After a Challenge, Japan's Leader Shuffles His Cabinet

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Fresh from surviving a leadership challenge, Prime Minister Naoto Kan shuffled his cabinet on Friday, seeking a new start as he faces the uphill task of regaining public confidence in his party's ability to end Japan's long stagnation. 
While the new cabinet contained a few fresh faces, it offered a relatively staid lineup of party veterans that appeared aimed at conveying a greater sense of political maturity and competence than was demonstrated by the often erratic administration of Mr. Kan's unpopular predecessor, Yukio Hatoyama.
Getting the most attention was the new foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, a hawkish young foreign policy expert who has favored amending Japan's pacifist Constitution and keeping close ties with the United States.
Mr. Maehara, 48, will face the thorny task of fulfilling Japan's pledge to relocate an American Marine air base on Okinawa, while also facing a diplomatic argument with China over disputed islands in the East China Sea.
Mr. Kan, whose governing Democratic Party took power in a historic election last year, won a hard-fought party leadership election this week against the party's power broker, Ichiro Ozawa. On Friday, Mr. Kan vowed to reunify the party and restore it to its original goals of changing the way Japan is governed and tackling the nation's growing fiscal and economic problems.
''This year has in many ways been a year of trial and error,'' said Mr. Kan, 63, a former civic activist who took office three months ago. ''From now on, I want everyone to call us a cabinet that can carry out its word.''
Public opinion polls published in recent days by major newspapers already show a bounce in approval ratings for Mr. Kan, especially after his government surprised financial markets this week by intervening to push down the soaring Japanese yen, which has hurt Japan's exporters.
Despite his talk of unity, Mr. Kan excluded from his cabinet close allies of Mr. Ozawa, a powerful presence in the party whose financial scandals were one reason Mr. Hatoyama was forced to step down. Mr. Kan appeared to be trying to weaken his rival's grip on the party.
Indeed, Mr. Kan filled top posts in the cabinet and the party with well-known opponents of Mr. Ozawa. One was Katsuya Okada, a critic of Mr. Ozawa who was moved from foreign minister to the party's No. 2 post, secretary general. Mr. Okada, 57, will be the point man in the difficult task of pushing bills through a divided Parliament in which the Democrats do not have control of the upper house.
His replacement, Mr. Maehara, will be asked to overcome intense local opposition to a May agreement to move the Marine base to a different location on the island.
But Mr. Maehara's first job may be dealing with a more assertive China, which has reacted angrily to Japan's arrest of a Chinese captain whose fishing boat collided with Japanese Coast Guard vessels last week in disputed waters. On Thursday, Mr. Maehara flew to an island near where the accident happened and praised Coast Guard personnel for their actions.

HEADLINE: Obama Chooses Warren to Set Up Consumer Bureau

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard law professor who became a darling of the left for her championship of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was appointed by President Obama on Friday to oversee the agency's establishment by mid-2011, until a director is named later.
The appointment will allow Ms. Warren, ''a janitor's daughter,'' as Mr. Obama called her in a Rose Garden introduction, to effectively get the agency up and running without having to go through a contentious confirmation battle in the Senate -- a fight that a leading Democrat, Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, predicted she could not win given opposition from Republicans and the financial industry. 
Mr. Obama said Ms. Warren would recruit staff and initiate policies for regulating mortgages, student loans and other consumer credit products, and would have a voice in picking the first director. The favorite among administration officials is Michael S. Barr, an assistant secretary of Treasury for financial institutions who is an authority on financial regulation and on services for low and moderate-income households.
The interim role for Ms. Warren averts a political problem for Mr. Obama in this election season. Rejecting her would have angered many party liberals, who already are demoralized by administration policies they view as too centrist and friendly to Wall Street. Liberal and consumer groups had lobbied hard for her, along with some lawmakers including Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
''This is the boldest step Obama's taken so far to rein in the big Wall Street banks,'' the leaders of the group MoveOn.org, who often are critical of the president, wrote in an e-mail to members.
Business groups, while disappointed, privately acknowledged relief that Ms. Warren appeared unlikely to become director.
The creation of the bureau was a central piece of the legislation overhauling the financial regulatory system that Mr. Dodd sponsored and Mr. Obama signed into law in July. Its genesis was an article that Ms. Warren wrote a year before the near collapse of the financial system in 2008, a crisis blamed in part on abusive mortgage practices.
''Basically, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will be a watchdog for the American consumer, charged with enforcing the toughest financial protections in history,'' Mr. Obama said.
Ms. Warren was named an assistant to the president, a designation that is held by senior White House advisers. She also will be a special adviser to the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, and report jointly to him and the president.
While Mr. Geithner nodded vigorously in approval as he stood in the Rose Garden with Mr. Obama and Ms. Warren, his dealings with her have been the subject of much speculation. Ms. Warren, as the chairwoman of the Congressional panel that oversees the Troubled Asset Relief Program, has often been critical of Mr. Geithner and his department for the management of the financial rescue program. Privately, Mr. Geithner promoted Mr. Barr for the consumer post.
Under the financial regulation law, Treasury will have the powers delegated to the bureau until a permanent director is nominated and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term. Next July the bureau will assume the regulatory power for consumer rights now vested in a range of agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which have been widely criticized for not making consumer protection a priority.
Once a director is confirmed, the bureau can issue regulations and enforce new standards for mortgages, credit cards, payday loans and a wide array of other financial products.
It is expected to have a budget of up to $500 million and hundreds of employees, many of them drawn from the agencies that will give up responsibilities for consumer protection. The bureau will nominally be part of the Fed, which is obligated to finance its budget, but its personnel and rule-making decisions are to be made independent of the central bank.
Ms. Warren, 61, an authority on bankruptcy law, developed her following among liberals with her writings and advocacy on behalf of working-class families. But she has drawn fire from financial institutions for her persistent attacks on abusive, deceptive and unfair lending practices. Banking executives as well as some Treasury officials say she has been overly broad in criticizing those practices, and showed some misunderstanding of financial markets.
Republicans were quick to criticize Mr. Obama for circumventing a Senate confirmation. Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee in the Senate, said in a statement, ''This appointment lacks transparency and represents the latest power grab by the president to expand the reach of an intrusive government into the lives of Americans.''
Ms. Warren, writing on the White House Web site, said, ''The new law creates a chance to put a tough cop on the beat and provide real accountability and oversight of the consumer credit market. The time for hiding tricks and traps in the fine print is over.''

HEADLINE: A State Of Two Minds

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
PETERSBURG, Alaska
It is very hard to have a conversation in Alaska without Sarah Palin's name coming up.
''It's because of the media,'' said Alan Stein, an adviser to Joe Miller, the Republican nominee for the United States Senate. He looked at me accusingly.
I swear I didn't say a word. Alaskans are very hospitable, and they offer strangers a plate of Palin anecdotes just as they would cookies. I spent the week here, and almost everyone I talked to wound up revisiting Sarahland unprompted, from a woman who said they went to the same gym, to a Republican who once ran against Palin and told me how, after a debate, she had complimented him on his grasp of figures and policy, and then added: ''But then I look over the crowd and wonder -- does that really mean anything?'' 
Currently, a lot of Alaskans are blaming Palin for the Republican primary in which Senator Lisa Murkowski was upended, depriving the state of its last bastion of seniority power. (The state's lone congressman, Don Young, has been in office forever. But he was stripped of his seniority over an earmark he stuck in the budget for a connector road that was slightly outside his district -- being located in the state of Florida.)
Now the Republicans have Miller, a far more conservative candidate, who got the nomination after Palin's endorsement was followed by a big last-minute infusion of Tea Party money. He's a rather professorial 43-year-old attorney who believes unemployment benefits are probably unconstitutional and that Social Security is a definite rip-off. ''I want to make sure that in the future I can put my money where the government can't steal it from me,'' he said.
Democrats are hoping their candidate, an earnest mayor named Scott McAdams, can win on likability. However, Miller seems to be trying to increase his own warmth factor by toting along his wife (''Wave to everybody, Kathleen'') and continually pointing out they have eight kids.
On Thursday, in the beautiful fishing town of Petersburg, Miller and McAdams mixed it up in a candidate forum. The organizers seemed unsure about whether Miller would show up, but he walked in halfway through the proceedings to murmurs of excitement in the school gym where people had been listening to a rather unthrilling discussion on a transportation reauthorization act.
It was one of the first times in this campaign season that a Tea Party insurgent had any sort of joint appearance with his or her Democratic opponent. Quite a few of the new ultraright candidates seem to have gone to the ground, where they keep busy renovating their old positions. (In Nevada, Sharron Angle has evolved from ''privatizing'' Social Security to ''personalizing'' it.)
McAdams frequently says that he went into the race expecting to have ''great debates about the great issues with somebody I have a great deal of respect for'' until Murkowski was dumped. (Now that Murkowski has decided to run a write-in campaign, it will be interesting to see if his enthusiasm for her virtues cools.)
But there he was instead, going mano a mano with Miller. History was being made in the Petersburg gym. And it turned out that the two men's worldviews were so different that they could have been running on different continents.
McAdams said he wants to bring home the bacon. (''We are a young state. We have great needs.'') Miller said the pig is dead, the barn is on fire and a killer tornado is headed for the farmhouse. Social Security can't be saved over the long run. Instead of fighting to protect Alaska's huge federal aid, Miller wants to make Washington give up control of Alaskan lands and waters so private enterprise can develop the resources untrammeled. Otherwise, he said, Alaska will be in big trouble ''when the government goes.''
Since Alaska depends on the federal government for about a third of its budget, it's reasonable to wonder why voters are attracted to Miller, who is pretty much opposed to federal spending on anything that doesn't have to do with national defense. The answer is that he and McAdams represent the two sides to Alaska, which simultaneously regards itself as a land of free-spirited adventurers as well as an infrastructure-poor newbie in need of government help before it can walk on its own. ''By and large, we're a schizophrenic state,'' said Andrew Halcro, the Republican who once ran against Palin on an independent line.
And the Palin spirit lives on in the Alaska Senate race. For most of their history, Alaskan officials regarded their state as needy and wheedling money out of the federal government as a sacred crusade. When Sarah teamed up with John McCain, she added on the anti-earmark campaign line. The state didn't get rid of its dependency on federal cash. It just learned how to entertain two opposing views in the head at the same time.

HEADLINE: WIDE G.O.P. FIELD TESTS THE WATERS FOR 2012 CONTEST

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY; Ashley Parker contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- The Republican presidential field for 2012 is beginning to take shape in a period of intensive upheaval set off by the rise of the Tea Party movement, expanding the roster of potential candidates but presenting a more complicated road to the nomination.
The opportunities and pitfalls were on full display Friday -- in some ways a kickoff to the Republican contest -- as no fewer than six possible contenders made appearances in Washington and, in one especially closely watched case, here in Iowa, the first stop on the path to the White House. At least as many more Republicans are already taking steps to test candidacies of their own.
At a gathering of conservatives called the Values Voter Summit in the capital, Mitt Romney hewed closely to the issues of small government and low taxes that have driven Tea Party members this year, suggesting the Obama administration's economic policies are ''one reason they will serve only one term.'' Mr. Romney, who has assiduously courted conservative support since his unsuccessful campaign in 2008, mocked those who once declared Republicans an ''endangered species.'' 
But the political spotlight on Friday truly belonged to former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, whose keynote speech at the party's annual Ronald Reagan dinner here set off a new round of ''will she, won't she?'' speculation that has made it hard for other potential candidates to find their place in the growing field.
Ms. Palin was coy about her intentions, jokingly recalling that her husband, Todd, urged her to skip an afternoon jog to avoid headlines like ''Palin in Iowa, decides to run.'' She did not mention her political future, but delivered a sharp critique of party leaders who have been skeptical of some winning Tea Party candidates.
''We can't blow it, G.O.P., but we won't wait for that political playbook to be handed to us from on high from the political elites. We won't do that,'' Ms. Palin said, speaking over applause. She added, ''It may take some renegades to get us there. It may take folks shaking things up to get us there.''
The Iowa debut of Ms. Palin did not go unnoticed by the White House. The press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said, ''It's normally around this time of year you go dip your toe in the water.'' Shortly before her speech, the White House said President Obama would make an appearance of his own in Iowa on Sept. 29.
Ms. Palin's role in the race is just one of the great imponderables -- and a point of frustration -- giving other candidates pause as they try to plot for the jockeying that will begin in earnest immediately after Election Day and assess whether the upheaval brought about this year by grassroots conservatives is an enduring movement.
As she left the stage here on Friday evening, she said she did not have a timeline for making a decision. She added with a smile, ''I know that you can make a big difference in America without even having a title.'' But as she lingered to sign autographs and pose for pictures, she added, ''I want to get back to Iowa soon.''
Seldom has a week gone by this summer when potential candidates have not passed through Iowa, seeking an introduction to party activists.
The roster includes: Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, former Speaker Newt Gingrich; former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, former Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and Representative Ron Paul of Texas.
Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi sent a greeting by mail to Iowa Republicans. Senator John Thune of South Dakota has made quiet inquiries, but has not visited his neighboring state. And Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, who emerged from the primary season of the Congressional elections as something of a kingmaker, was urged on Friday by Bob Vander Plaats, a conservative activist, to visit Iowa.
In interviews, strategists for several potential candidates said they were eager to see just how potent the new brand of enthusiasm on display in Republican primaries proves to be in the general election campaign -- and, more important, whether it was enough to wrest Congress from the Democrats.
Yet there is no mistaking that the recent string of unexpected primary victories by Tea Party-supported upstarts over party-backed Republican regulars is only adding to the increasingly enticing prospect of running for the White House on the Republican ticket.
''In a year where you've had this many upsets, generally every person can look in the mirror and say, 'Why not me?' '' said Mr. Gingrich, who has already made several scouting trips to Iowa this year as he ponders the same question. ''I expect a dozen people to be running.''
Yet, Mr. Gingrich said in an interview, the potential candidates will have to navigate not only one another, but also a new and unsettled order in a party being reshaped by new grass-roots players resistant to its once-vaunted top-down form of discipline, which has been upended.
''What will attract more candidates to the field is an increasing likelihood of President Obama losing,'' said former Gov. John H. Sununu of New Hampshire, chairman of the state's Republican Party.
In the wake of unexpected victories on Tuesday by Christine O'Donnell in the Republican primary for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s former Senate seat in Delaware, and of Carl P. Paladino in the Republican primary for governor in New York, political Washington was consumed with talk about what it meant for 2012 presidential candidates: Would they face perils of being either too closely associated with politics as usual? Would a rush to court the hard-right Tea Party activists during the primaries create complications for the general election, where independent voters often hold sway?
But presidential strategists involved in building organizations for 2012 said it was too soon to answer any of those questions.
Bill McInturff, a longtime Republican pollster who was involved in Senator John McCain's presidential campaign in 2008, said his party would be wise to remember that the lessons of a midterm Congressional election do not generally apply to a presidential election two years later.
''The worst absolute projector of a presidential year that's coming is looking at a midterm result,'' Mr. McInturff said.
For instance, he said, the dynamics that led the Democrats to pick up 26 House seats toward the midpoint of Ronald Reagan's first term in 1982 -- unemployment was at more than 10 percent and Mr. Reagan's approval rating was in the mid-40s -- did not exist two years later when he won re-election comfortably.
And, several strategists said, the process of nominating a Republican presidential candidate in a national race is not the same as nominating a Republican in a local or statewide contest.
But some party leaders said candidates would be unwise to disregard the message from these primary contests. A test of purity, they said, could play out with even greater prominence.
''The Republican establishment must get out of the way,'' said Steve Scheffler, a longtime social conservative leader in Iowa who is a member of the Republican National Committee. ''They need to have faith in the activists that we will pick the right winner who can win.''

HEADLINE: Labor Frets Over Base As Election Approaches

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The Democrats will depend on labor unions -- the shock troops of their political campaigns -- to offset two new developments this election cycle: Tea Party enthusiasm and corporations' ability to spend unlimited amounts thanks to a Supreme Court ruling.
Labor leaders, alarmed at a possible Republican takeover of one or both houses of Congress, promise to devote a record amount of money and manpower to helping Democrats stave off disaster. But political analysts, and union leaders themselves, say that their efforts may not be enough because union members, like other important parts of the Democratic base, are not feeling particularly enthusiastic about the party -- a reality that, in turn, further dampens the Democrats' chances of holding onto their Congressional majorities.
''The problem for us is to really re-excite the rank and file to the greatest degree possible,'' said Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and chairman of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political committee. ''They've been disappointed that the House and Senate haven't done more, especially to create jobs.'' 
It is a measure of the dread among Democrats and their labor allies that several unions are no longer threatening to withhold endorsements from some conservative or moderate Democrats, like Representative Zack Space of Ohio, because they had bucked labor on health care legislation or other issues. Now, unions are generally backing those Democrats, feeling labor cannot afford such a strategy when the Democrats' prospects seem so troubled.
''People are evaluating this a little bit differently from three months ago,'' said Jon Youngdahl, political director of the Service Employees International Union. ''Our goal obviously is to have a majority for Speaker Pelosi next year. That's driving a lot of decisions.''
The stakes of labor's participation may be even higher this year than in 2008 when new voters, including students, came out in droves, overwhelmingly supporting President Obama and the Democrats. Political experts say these midterms, unlike in 2008, will not be a ''surge'' election -- students, for instance, are markedly less passionateabout the Democrats this year.
In a base election, the party that gets its traditional supporters out to vote is more likely to carry the day. And the Republicans' base, even if parts of it are insurgent and unpredictable, is highly motivated to topple the Democrats.
Unions feel a need to respond, and that means energizing their rank and file. ''You have to go educate your base, mobilize your base, inspire your base,'' said Larry Scanlon, political director of the state, county and municipal employees' union.
Moreover, corporations -- freed by the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in January that lifted restrictions on direct corporate and union spending on political campaigns -- are expected to spend record amounts in this election cycle, making labor's vaunted ground war all the more important to Democrats, who hope it will neutralize the corporate dollar advantage in the advertising air war.
A.F.L.-C.I.O. leaders say that they will spend around $50 million on races in 26 states and that unions already have 1,500 full-time campaign workers on the ground. The service employees have budgeted $44 million for the election, while other unions will spend tens of millions of dollars more. All told, labor strategists say their ground troops will make more than 10 million phone calls to members' homes, distribute millions of fliers at workplaces and knock on millions of doors.
But Charlie Cook, a nonpartisan political handicapper, questioned how successful labor's push will be. ''The question is, how effective can labor be when so many of their people are unemployed or underemployed and just not happy campers?'' he said. ''How effective will they be in getting people to do the hard work -- to do the phone banks, the get-out-the-vote?''
Patricia Elizondo, president of the 2,000-member Milwaukee local of the International Association of Machinists, fears just that.
''People have been unemployed for two years, and they're unhappy that the health care bill was not as good as they expected,'' she said. ''Two years ago, I had many members going door-to-door to campaign. Now they're saying, 'Why should I? We supported that candidate, but he didn't follow through.' ''
For the union brass, turning around voters like Mike DeGasperis, a steelworker from Martins Ferry, Ohio, could prove difficult; two years ago he was motivated by his ''anti-Bush'' feelings.
''We heard everything was going to change, but there hasn't been much change and the unemployment is still bad and the area we live in is still really depressed,'' said Mr. DeGasperis, who was laid off for 10 months last year.
He said he had not decided whom to back in the House, Senate and governor's races -- all key in Ohio, a pivotal swing state. ''I'm going to keep my options open.''
Union leaders say Mr. Obama's recent speeches -- at a union picnic on Labor Day in Milwaukee and later in Cleveland should help whip up rank-and-file enthusiasm.
Labor leaders, once frustrated themselves about Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats, have warmed to them recently after they enacted a $23 billion package to save the jobs of teachers, police and firefighters and after the president proposed a $50 billion infrastructure plan. Now they are asking Mr. Obama for another favor -- to order trade penalties against China over charges that it illegally subsidizes its clean energy industry.
''There's no ambivalence here with the leadership,'' said Richard Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''We hope to provide union members with the facts to show that there are stark choices in this election -- whether we go forward to build an economy that works for everyone or whether we go back to an economy where corporations and Wall Street run wild.''
Doug Heye, communications director for the Republican National Committee, voiced respect for labor's operation.
''They're always effective,'' he said. ''The union leadership is wedded to the Democratic Party. But what we've seen cycle after cycle is the membership demonstrates real independence and votes independently of the union bosses.'' (According to a national exit poll conducted by Edison/Mitofsky, 60 percent of union members voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and 37 percent for Senator John McCain.)
Mr. Heye voiced confidence that Republicans would outdo the Democrats in November, even with labor's big push, because the enthusiasm gap greatly favors the Republican Party.
Mr. Trumka said: ''I don't think the Republicans even want our votes. They just want us to get so frustrated and angry that we don't even vote so then they'd have an easy walkover.''
To wit, labor leaders are telling the rank and file that Mr. Obama and the Democrats have done good things for working people -- the $787 stimulus package, the health care overhaul, Wall Street reform and the rescue package for Detroit automakers. They note that Mr. Obama has appointed a union-friendly labor secretary and union-friendly members to the National Labor Relations Board.
Labor leaders say Mr. Obama and the Democrats wanted to enact more stimulus to create jobs, but say the Republicans often stymied them. They also note that many Republicans have vowed to privatize Social Security and repeal the health care law and Wall Street reform.
''A lot of people are frustrated, and we have to turn that frustration into positive energy,'' said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Primary Day 2010: The Tea Party's Snarl'' (editorial, Sept. 16):
You correctly call on ''dispirited Democrats, independents and mainstream Republican voters'' to get back in the fight for the November elections. If any of us expected to elect President Obama and then sit back for four years while he waved a magic wand to solve problems years in the making, it's time to get over it.
Special interests have much at stake if elected officials succeed in curbing their excesses. These interests are cynically playing to the most dangerous fringe elements. Stand up, brush yourself off, take a deep breath and get involved. 
Julie Bannerman San Francisco, Sept. 16, 2010
To the Editor:
On reading ''Obama the Other, Deployed as Election Tactic,'' by Matt Bai (Political Times column, Sept. 16), I am filled with hope, disgust and amazement.
I am hopeful because there are sufficient level-headed voters in the United States who can see through the likes of Newt Gingrich, who accused President Obama of exhibiting ''Kenyan, anticolonial behavior.''
I am disgusted by the craven politics employed by the Republicans and Tea Party loyalists, who can't engage in reasoned political discourse on the issues that confront the country: a recession largely precipitated by Bush-era economic laissez-faire; societal polarization, where people are targeted for their religious and social differences, their country of origin and their concern for the less fortunate among us; and regionalism, reflecting the persistence of Civil War divisions.
I am amazed that the leaders of the Democratic Party have not been able to develop a strong voice to counter the virulent ranting during this election cycle. I am afraid that we will wake up after Election Day and wish that more thinking people had spoken up. I hope I'm wrong.
W. Lionel Williams Hempstead, N.Y., Sept. 17, 2010
To the Editor:
Newt Gingrich's accusing Barack Obama of anticolonialism (''Who's the Con Man?,'' by Maureen Dowd, column, Sept. 15) puts our president in good anticolonial company: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison et al., as well as two of my favorites, Patrick Henry and Paul Revere.
There of course have been many others. Perhaps Mr. Gingrich has forgotten our nation's historical roots.
Larry Hoffman Chatham, N.J., Sept. 15, 2010
To the Editor:
In ''The Day After Tomorrow'' (column, Sept. 14), David Brooks speaks about a less intrusive government as the goal of Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and others on the right. That view is challenged, rightly, by Mr. Brooks as simplistic and not hewing to historical fact. The ''nanny state'' frightens Mr. Ryan. It should not.
Without government participation, we would not share the benefits of many medical advances, from polio vaccines to the yearly flu shots. We would not have meaningful crash standards for our cars, Social Security or the project that led to the Internet.
The list of government ''intrusion'' for the general welfare is nearly endless, and I'm happy for it.
Robert Hirst Massapequa, N.Y., Sept. 14, 2010
To the Editor:
David Brooks correctly points out to those on the right in the Republican Party that there are roles that the federal government must play in furthering the common good. It has been obvious for years now that the Republican Party has no coherent domestic agenda other than lower taxes and reduced government.
Whatever happened to compassionate conservatism? If the Republicans have any real program to address the challenges of high unemployment, increasing levels of poverty, failing schools, a lack of affordable housing and crumbling infrastructure, I haven't heard or seen it.
It would be great, for a change, to hear something from the right of center other than ''No!''
Pat McCoy Charlotte, N.C., Sept. 15, 2010
To the Editor:
Thanks to David Brooks for speaking some sense regarding the Republican ideology of small government. Republicans say they encourage entrepreneurship and traditional family life.
But consider how much easier it would be to leave your job and start a business if the government, rather than your employer, guaranteed your health coverage.
And think how much easier it would be to raise a family if the government provided greater support for family leave, child care, education, transportation and unemployment coverage.
I don't want government out of my life; I want it helpfully in my life.

HEADLINE: Tax Increase Would Hit Few Small Businesses

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
As Congress and President Obama wrestle over whether to let the Bush tax cuts expire for the wealthiest Americans, one of the most heated aspects of the debate, in Washington and in neighborhoods across the country, is how a tax increase would affect small businesses.
Mr. Obama wants to extend the cuts for most taxpayers. But he proposes eliminating them for the top 2 percent of wage earners, whose taxes would rise. Opponents of the plan warn that a tax increase would batter hundreds of thousands of small businesses -- from Silicon Valley start-ups to mom-and-pop convenience stores -- and prevent them from creating the jobs that might lift the sagging economy.
''It's a body blow to the small-business community,'' said Grover Norquist, president of the conservative advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform.
Despite that emotional appeal, Internal Revenue Service statistics indicate that only 3 percent of small businesses would be subject to the higher tax, and many studies of previous tax increases suggest that it would have minimal impact on hiring. 
According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 97 percent of all businesses owners do not earn enough to be subject to the higher rates, which would be levied on income of over $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for families.
Even among the 750,000 businesses that would be subjected to the higher rates in 2011, many are sole proprietors -- a classification so amorphous it can include everyone from corporate executives who earn income on rental property to entertainers, hedge fund managers and investment bankers. Because 80 percent of America's 32 million businesses are sole proprietorships, 90 percent of the tax cut would be derived from businesses without employees.
Trade groups lobbying to extend the tax break for wealthy Americans argue that when hobbyists and home-based enterprises are removed from the equation, the total number of businesses affected is closer to 8 percent. Those companies are responsible for nearly half of all business revenue generated in the country, and according to the conservative American Enterprise Institute, would be less likely to invest or hire if subjected to higher rates.
But much of the research over the last two decades has found that increases in top tax rates can lead to an increase in the formation of small businesses, as wealthy individuals apparently begin start-ups to avail themselves of the more generous tax breaks offered to businesses.
''Higher taxes may lead individuals to seek self-employment because the opportunities for tax evasion and avoidance are greater,'' according to a report released this month by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, which surveyed more than 20 studies on the effects of taxes on hiring.
The intensity of the debate is a testament to the place that small businesses hold in the culture as a symbol of American ingenuity. That reverence has grown stronger in recent decades, as the decline of large manufacturers has made the economy rely on start-ups and small businesses to create jobs and entire growth industries.
But the way the I.R.S. classifies small businesses is vastly different from the public perception of the neighborhood dry cleaner or the small tool-and-die shop. A report released by the Joint Tax Committee in July found that many of the tax returns categorized as small businesses were actually filed by wealthy taxpayers who earned business income through limited partnerships or S corporations to allow their firms to avoid paying corporate taxes.
The study found that in 2005, 19,000 of those small businesses had revenue of more than $50 million.
Democrats say they are trying to aim tax relief at the small businesses that most need it. On Thursday, they won Senate approval of a bill to offer $12 billion in tax breaks intended to encourage small-business investment and to create a $30 billion fund to encourage community banks to lend to modest-size companies. The measure is expected to pass the House and be signed into law by President Obama.
With an eye on the deficit, Mr. Obama has said that the country cannot afford the $700 billion it would cost to extend the tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans over the next decade. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she supports Mr. Obama's proposal, but it is unclear whether she has enough support in her caucus for the measure.
''The tax cuts at the high end have not produced any jobs; it only increased the deficit,'' Ms. Pelosi, a California Democrat, said Thursday. ''We're still paying the price that they have contributed to the deficit all along.''
But Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, warned that eliminating the tax cuts on top individuals would quash many businesses just as they started to grow.
''If you own a 100-worker metal fabrication plant, and your taxes go up 17 to 24 percent, you'll likely stop hiring or lay off workers to compensate,'' he said. ''Small businesses create 70 percent of new jobs, so it's disastrous for job creation to raise taxes on small businesses.''
Ben Thompson, a business owner in Zanesville, Ohio, said his company would be forced to make modest cuts in capital spending if the tax breaks expired, but would not change its hiring decisions.
Mr. Thompson and his brother Tim own Primary Aim L.L.C., which operates 29 Wendy's fast-food restaurants in Ohio and West Virginia and employs 1,000 people. Although the company averages $42 million in revenue a year, Mr. Thompson said, he draws a salary of less than $250,000 and files as a limited liability company because the rates are lower than the corporate business tax. The company also pays him in dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate, but he declined to specify how much.
''We're in the restaurant business, so you have to have enough people to serve your customers,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''We wouldn't have as much for capital, upgrades like paving the parking lots, new technology like cash registers, remodeling.''
Bill Rys, tax counsel for the National Federation of Independent Business, said a survey of his organization found that the businesses most likely to be subject to the tax increase were those employing 20 to 250 workers.
''Those are the businesses that employ a quarter of the work force and the ones that are most likely to be hiring,'' Mr. Rys said. ''A tax increase means that's less money that those businesses have to spend on growing their business and more money that they're sending to Washington.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 29, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 18 about the potential effect on small businesses of the Obama administration's proposals for extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts described imprecisely the businesses that would continue to enjoy lower taxes. Companies with no employees would derive 90 percent of the tax benefits if the cuts were extended. Most, but not all, of those businesses are also sole proprietorships, but being a sole proprietorship does not necessarily mean the company has no employees.

HEADLINE: M.D.G.'s for Beginners...And Finishers

BYLINE: By BONO. 
Bono, the lead singer of the band U2 and a co-founder of the advocacy group ONE and (Product)RED, is a contributing columnist for The Times.

 BODY:
I've noticed that New Yorkers, and I sometimes try to pass for one these days, tend to greet the word ''summit'' with an irritated roll of the eyes, a grunt, an impatient glance at the wristwatch. In Manhattan, a summit has nothing to do with crampons and ice picks, but refers instead to a large gathering of important persons, head-of-state types and their rock-star retinues in the vicinity of the United Nations building and creates, therefore, a near total immobilization of the East Side. Can world peace possibly be worth this? Never, never...Eleanor Roosevelt, look what you've done ... .
Recent global summit meetings, from Copenhagen to Toronto, have frankly been a bust, so the world, which may not know it yet, is overdue for a good multilateral confab -- one that's not just about the gabbing but about the doing. The subject of the summit meeting at the United Nations this week is one whose monumental importance is matched only by its minuscule brand recognition: the Millennium Development Goals, henceforth known as the M.D.G.'s (God save us from such dull shorthand). 
The M.D.G.'s are possibly the most visionary deal that most people have never heard of. In the run-up to the 21st century, a grand global bargain was negotiated at a series of summit meetings and then signed in 2000. The United Nations' ''Millennium Declaration'' pledged to ''ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world's people,'' especially the most marginalized in developing countries. It wasn't a promise of rich nations to poor ones; it was a pact, a partnership, in which each side would meet obligations to its own citizens and to one another.
Of course, this is the sort of airy-fairy stuff that people at summit meetings tend to say and get away with because no one else can bear to pay attention. The 2000 gathering was different, though, because signatories agreed to specific goals on a specific timeline: cutting hunger and poverty in half, giving all girls and boys a basic education, reducing infant and maternal mortality by two-thirds and three-quarters respectively, and reversing the spread of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. All by 2015. Give it an A for Ambition.
So where are we now, 10 years on, with some ''first-world'' economies looking as if they could go bang, and some second- and third-level economies looking as if they could be propping us up?
Well, I'd direct you to the plenary sessions and panel discussions for a detailed answer...but if you're, eh, busy this week...my view, based on the data and what I've seen on the ground, is that in many places it's going better than you'd think.
Much better, in fact. Tens of millions more kids are in school thanks to debt cancellation. Millions of lives have been saved through the battle against preventable disease, thanks especially to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Apart from fallout from the market meltdown, economic growth in Africa has been gathering pace -- over 5 percent per year in the decade ending in 2009. Poverty declined by 1 percent a year from 1999 to 2005.
The gains made by countries like Ghana show the progress the Millennium Goals have helped create.
At the same time, the struggles of places like Congo remind us of the distance left to travel. There are serious headwinds: 64 million people have been thrown back into poverty as a result of the financial crises, and 150 million are hungry because of the food crisis. And extending the metaphor, there are storms on the horizon: the poor will be hit first -- and worst -- by climate change.
So there should be no Champagne toasts at this year's summit meeting. The 10th birthday of our millennium is, or ought to be, a purposeful affair, a redoubling of efforts. After all, there's only five years before 2015, only five years to make all that Second Avenue gridlock worth it. With that in mind I'd like to offer three near-term tests of our commitment to the M.D.G.'s.
1. Find what works and then expand on it. Will mechanisms like the Global Fund get the resources to do the job?
Energetic, efficient and effective, the fund saves a staggering 4,000 lives a day. Even a Wall Streeter would have to admit, that's some return on investment. But few are aware of it, a fact that allows key countries -- from the United States to Britain, France and Germany -- to go unnoticed if they ease off the throttle. The unsung successes of the fund should be, well, sung, and after this summit meeting, its work needs to be fully financed. This would help end the absurdity of death by mosquito, and the preventable calamity of 1,000 babies being born every day with H.I.V., passed to them by their mothers who had no access to the effective, inexpensive medicines that exist.
2. Governance as an effect multiplier. In this column last spring, I described some Africans I've met who see corruption as more deadly than the deadliest of diseases, a cancer that eats at the foundation of good governance even as the foundation is being built. I don't just mean ''their'' corruption; I mean ours, too. For example, multinational oil companies. They want oil, and governments of poor countries rich in just one thing, black gold, want to sell it to them. All well and good. Except the way it too often happens, as democracy campaigners in these countries point out, is not at all good. Some of these companies knowingly participate in a system of backhanders and bribery that ends up cheating the host nation and turning what should be a resource blessing into a kind of curse of black market cabals.
Well, I'm pleased to give you an update on an intervention that some of us thought of and fought for as critical: hidden somewhere in the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill (admit it...you haven't read it all either) there is a hugely significant ''transparency'' amendment, added by Senators Richard Lugar and Benjamin Cardin. Now energy companies traded on American exchanges will have to reveal every payment they make to government officials. If money changes hands, it will happen in the open. This is the kind of daylight that makes the cockroaches scurry.
The British government should institute the same requirement for companies trading in Britain, as should the rest of the European Union and ultimately all the G-20 nations. According to the African entrepreneur Mo Ibrahim, who has emerged as one of the most important voices on that continent, transparency could do more to transform Africa than even debt cancellation has. Measures like this one should be central to any renewed Millennium Development Goal strategy.
And the cost to us is zero, nada. It's a clear thought in a traffic jam.
3. Demand clarity; measure inputs and outputs.
Speaking of transparency, let's have a little more, please, when it comes to the question of who is doing what toward which goal and to what effect. We have to know where we are to know how far we've left to go.
Right now it's near impossible to keep track. Walk (if you dare) into M.D.G. World and you will encounter a dizzying array of vague financing and policy commitments on critical issues, from maternal mortality to agricultural development. You come across a load of bureau-babble that too often is used to hide double counting, or mask double standards. This is the stuff that feeds the cynics.
What we need is an independent unit -- made up of people from governments, the private sector and civil society -- to track pledges and progress, not just on aid but also on trade, governance, investment. It's essential for the credibility of the United Nations, the M.D.G.'s, and all who work toward them.
And that was the deal, wasn't it? The promise we made at the start of this century was not to perpetuate the old relationships between donors and recipients, but to create new ones, with true partners accountable to each other and above all to the citizens these systems are supposed to work for. Strikes me as the right sort of arrangement for an age of austerity as well as interdependence. (The age of interrupted affluence should sharpen our focus on future markets for our sake as well as theirs.)
No leader scheduled to speak at the summit meeting is more painfully aware of this context than President Obama, who one year ago pledged to put forth a global plan to reach the development goals. If promoting transparency and investing in what works is at the core of that strategy, he can assure Americans that their dollars are reinforcing their values, and their leadership in the world is undiminished. Action is required to make these words, these dull statistics, sing. The tune may not be pop but it won't leave your head -- this practical, achievable idea that the world, now out of kilter, can re-balance itself and offer all, not just some, a chance to exit the unfathomable deprivation that brings about the need for such global bargains.
I understand the critics who groan or snooze through the pious pronouncements we will hear from the podium in the General Assembly. But still in my heart and mind, undiminished and undaunted, is this thought planted by Nelson Mandela in his quest to tackle extreme poverty: ''Sometimes it falls upon a generation to be great.''
We have a lot to prove, but if the M.D.G. agreement had not been made in 2000, much less would have happened than has happened. Already, we've seen transformative results for millions of people whose lives are shaped by the priorities of people they will never know or meet -- the very people causing gridlock this week. For this at least, the world should thank New Yorkers for the loan of their city.

HEADLINE: Reasons Not to Refinance

BYLINE: By MARYANN HAGGERTY

 BODY:
LEW ALTFEST knows how clients will react when he tells them they shouldn't refinance their mortgages.
''Their faces move from smiley to glum,'' because they thought that by refinancing, they would be ''outfoxing someone,'' said Mr. Altfest, the principal adviser at Altfest Personal Wealth Management in Manhattan. Cutting your mortgage rate seems like finding cash in the street.
''But if you have rational reasons,'' he said, ''they thank you.'' 
With mortgage rates at historical lows, almost all the loans being written these days are refinancings -- 80.5 percent of applications in the week ended Sept. 10, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
But not everyone should refinance a mortgage, Mr. Altfest and other experts point out. ''It depends on what you have, it depends on your time frame, and obviously it depends on what you can save and whether you can qualify,'' said Timothy G. Parker, the president of Hudson Capital Management in Ridgewood, N.J.
As with most financial matters, this decision involves a bit of math. At the very least, homeowners will need to determine their closing costs and monthly savings. Divide closing costs by savings; that tells you how many months it will take to break even. If you plan to stay put that long, a refinance might work. People with high loan balances may find the numbers favor refinancing, but those who don't owe much may determine that closing costs overshadow savings.
Those who have lost jobs or whose homes have lost value may not qualify for a favorable loan. Jorie Johnson, a planner at Financial Futures in Manasquan, N.J., has a client whose home value has plunged to $675,000 from $750,000 since it was purchased five years ago. The client's 5.125 percent seven-year adjustable mortgage has a balance of $570,000. The client could get a lower rate now, but with most lenders willing to lend no more than 80 percent of a home's appraised value, the biggest loan available would be $540,000. ''So this client would have to have a free $30,000 to pay down the principal to complete the refi, which adds to the cost of refinancing considerably,'' she said.
Here are some other situations in which a borrower should think hard before refinancing:
When taxes mean you aren't saving as much as you thought. Most mortgage interest is tax deductible; a lot of closing costs aren't. Especially in New York, the mortgage recording tax makes costs high. You can't deduct this on your federal returns. If you save $10,000 a year in interest and pay $10,000 in closing costs, it will take you more than a year to break even, said Gary Schatsky of Objectiveadvice.com, a personal finance company in New York.
When cutting costs means extending the term of a loan too far. Refinancers frequently take out 30-year loans. Particularly if you have been paying for years, stretching payments means you're improving monthly cash flow, but increasing lifetime interest costs substantially. It's simple to check this, said Robert B. Walsh, a partner at Lighthouse Financial Advisors in Red Bank, N.J. There's an Excel mortgage calculator to test what-ifs, as well as Web calculators. If total payments soar, ''you're going to end up paying more over the life of the loan, so your house is going to cost you more,'' he said. ''You're using your house as a checkbook, and that's what got people in trouble before.''
When taking cash is too easy. For people with equity in their homes, ''it's very tempting to say, 'I'll take an extra $40,000 or $50,000 out,' '' said Ray Mignone, the president of Ray Mignone & Company, a financial adviser in New York. ''They'll pretty much blow that.''
If you've refinanced before and used cash to pay down credit cards, then run balances back up, ''you swear you'll never do it again,'' said Mr. Altfest of Altfest Personal Wealth Management. ''But your wife knows you will, and your financial adviser knows you will.''

GOLD BOY, EMERALD GIRL
By Yiyun Li
221 pp. Random House. $25
In the summer of 2009, the atrium of the Museum of Modern Art in New York was the site of a remarkable installation by the conceptual artist Song Dong. Its title, ''Waste Not,'' referred to a Communist government slogan exhorting the Chinese people to cope with their near-constant shortages and privations by practicing a vigilant form of salvage: nothing durable, however worn or dubious its utility, should be discarded. Song Dong's mother appears to have followed the directive with unusual zeal, and after his father died in 2002, Song Dong decided her grief might be assuaged if she collaborated with him on a project that would alchemize into art the vast heaps of detritus she had accumulated over decades of state-encouraged hoarding. The result -- an ingeniously arranged labyrinth of pens, cookware, buttons, magazines, clothing, shoes, plastic bottles, toys -- was powerfully affecting. Walking through the grid of ribbons, buttons, toothpaste tubes, combs and gramophones was a challenge to consider how much our possessions say about us, how eloquently the humblest domestic artifacts communicate the joys and sorrows of family life, and how we can never save enough to protect ourselves from the inevitability of loss. 
I found myself thinking of ''Waste Not'' each time I finished one of the stories in Yiyun Li's ''Gold Boy, Emerald Girl'' and put down the book to recover from the shock of commingled pleasure and melancholy each of them delivers. Like China's best contemporary visual artists, including Song Dong and Yunfei Ji, and along with fellow writers like Ha Jin and Ma Jian, who grew up under Chinese Communism, Yiyun Li -- whose much praised work includes a novel, ''The Vagrants,'' and an earlier story collection, ''A Thousand Years of Good Prayers'' -- succeeds in making the details of a very particular (and very sharply drawn) time and place express something broader and more universal.
While the circumstances in which Yiyun Li's characters find themselves have much to do with the strictures and the simultaneously casual and calculated cruelties of an authoritarian regime, the feelings these men and women must endure -- longing, regret, loneliness, the desperate desire to bridge the gap that divides them from others -- will be familiar, perhaps all too familiar, to everyone, everywhere. Indeed, the damage inflicted on these hapless souls by their political history -- a professor is made to clean toilets, a girl enamored of English literature is drafted into the army -- begins to seem emblematic of the misfortunes and unjust turns of fate that are beyond human control, regardless of the economic system under which one happens to live.
What's distinctive about Yiyun Li's work is the contrast between its emotional intensity and its calm, measured tone, a literary voice that brings to mind Nabokov's description of Chekhov's narrative style: ''The story is told in the most natural way possible . . . the way one person relates to another the most important things in his life, slowly and yet without a break, in a slightly subdued voice.'' As in reading Chekhov, one is struck by how profoundly important the lives of ordinary people are made to seem, and by what a sizable chunk of existence -- an entire life or several lives -- has been compressed into a few pages.
So, in ''Kindness,'' an unmarried woman in her 40s looks back on her closest relationships: a wary friendship with a sympathetic teacher, an even more guarded alliance with a female army officer, a brief crush on a man who lived in her neighborhood and moved away when she was a teenager. The heroine of ''Sweeping Past'' recalls how, decades earlier, she and two other girls resolved to become ''sworn sisters,'' an innocent decision with catastrophic repercussions. ''A Man Like Him'' follows Teacher Fei, whose fascination with a case of harsh justice posted on the Internet inspires him to reveal how his career was ruined by ''a few moments of gazing'' at one of his young students.
In Yiyun Li's stories, destiny -- zealously assisted by the punitive state, the ill will of one's neighbors, the secret agendas of those we imagine we know best and the flaws in our own nature -- continually subverts our plans for happiness. In ''Prison,'' a couple who have emigrated to the United States return to China in search of a surrogate mother to bear their child and learn a harrowing lesson about the consequences of suffering and the ferocity of maternal affection. Though Mrs. Jin, the protagonist of ''The Proprietress,'' has been so fortunate that she can dedicate herself to good works, she can't escape the memory of a crime her father committed against the husband of one of the beneficiaries of her charity.
In several of these narratives, the middle-aged come to acknowledge the comfort and consolation of lowering their expectations, resigning themselves to the heartbreakingly modest portion of contentment they have been allotted. So in the title story, when a mother pressures her grown son into an unlikely match with one of her former students, these two discover they aren't nearly as incompatible as they might have thought. The widowed dancing enthusiast at the center of ''Number Three, Garden Road'' is pursued and captured by the one partner he would never have chosen willingly.
Yet while these stories are steeped in disappointment and regret, they never seem grim or depressing. On the contrary, Yiyun Li's tenderness toward her characters, her respect for the richness of their lives, and the subtlety and gentle humor with which she portrays them make the experience of reading ''Gold Boy, Emerald Girl'' consistently heartening.
About a quarter of the way through ''Kindness,'' which is the longest and most complex of the stories, there's a particularly memorable scene. A squad of young army conscripts have taken a break from target practice when one of them, who still looks like a child and who has sung and traveled with a famous children's choir, agrees to serenade her comrades with an impromptu rendition of ''The Last Rose of Summer'':
''Her voice seemed to make breathing hard for those around her; her face, no longer appearing amused, had an ancient, ageless look. I wondered what kind of person Nan was to be able to sing like that -- she seemed too aloof to be touched by life, but how could she sing so hauntingly if she had not felt the pain described in those songs?
''The shooting range was quiet when Nan finished singing. A bumblebee buzzed and was shooed away, and in the distance, perhaps over the hills where a civilian world could not be seen, a loudspeaker was broadcasting midday news, but we could not hear a word.''
This description of how art affects us -- the way it stuns the clamorous world into silence on our behalf -- echoes throughout Yiyun Li's stories, which themselves have the power to create hushed intervals that resonate with emotion. Like Song Dong's ''Waste Not,'' ''Gold Boy, Emerald Girl'' is an example of the treasure an artist can fashion from the raw materials of ordinary existence.

HEADLINE: On the Colombian Coast, Natural Beauty, Gritty Charm

BYLINE: By LIONEL BEEHNER

 BODY:
IT'S not called the Parque de Los Novios -- Park of the Newlyweds -- for nothing. Young couples lock arms as they stroll past rows of freshly planted flowers. A Sinatra love ballad sung in Spanish echoes from a corner dive bar. Aside from a few mustachioed, sombrero-clad men playing a board game, it seemed as if everyone on this breezy August evening was on a romantic sabbatical.
Yet this square in the center of Santa Marta, a port city along the Caribbean coast of Colombia, was not always a streetlamp-lighted refuge of romance. Just a few years back, the park was a tumbledown area trafficked mostly by prostitutes and petty criminals.
Wedged between the sea and the snow-capped Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta peaks, the city may be Colombia's oldest, but it has always been seen as the grittier and more industrial counterpart to nearby Cartagena -- at best, a stopover point for visitors looking to trek through Tayrona National Park or hike to the Lost City, a well-known archaeological site nearby. 
''Until five years ago nobody would come here because of the guerrillas,'' said Michael McMurdo, a New York City-trained chef who recently opened a Mexican restaurant, Agave Azul, in Santa Marta. ''While there is still some sketchy stuff going on, I like it here because it still feels real and Colombian.''
The town's transformation began with a government crackdown on illegal drug and paramilitary activity in the region. The efforts have paid off: tourism has now replaced crime as Santa Marta's claim to fame. The number of international visitors to Colombia in 2009 spiked 17 percent from the previous year, helped along by the emergence of former rebel hideouts like Santa Marta as new tourist destinations.
The Colombian government has also spent plenty of money to revamp the city's parks and convert streets into pedestrian zones. But what the government started, a wave of polyglot businesspeople like Mr. McMurdo -- restaurateurs, hoteliers, real estate developers and night life impresarios -- has continued, helping to resuscitate Santa Marta's colonial center. Shops selling religious iconography and smoky billiards halls are giving way to Tuscan-style hotels and tapas spots that double as jazz bars. Even the once-grimy boardwalk now feels more like a smaller-scale version of Rio's Ipanema.
Perhaps the perfect monument to this city's rebirth is a gleaming new marina that anchors the waterfront; huge and visually spectacular, it wouldn't look out of place in Dubai. The terminal, which opened this month, can handle more than 250 yachts and super-yachts.
On a recent late-summer evening, a stylish crowd of Colombians and expatriates mingled at Ben & Josep's, a new steakhouse run by a Spanish-Belgian duo, down the boardwalk from the marina. The steakhouse is just one of the additions to the city's seaside area, which has been spiffed up in recent years with greenery and dotted with statues of shapely, warrior-like indigenous women (also found in every souvenir shop around town).
Away from the beach, the city abounds with Spanish colonial charm. Among the streets off Parque Simon Bolivar, wanderers will find a whitewashed cathedral that claims to be South America's oldest. It may, in fact, be a 17th-century amalgamation of architectural influences, rather than the original structure, but the chandeliers and marble altar are still worth a peek.
To stay cool, visitors can grab some coconut water, sold just outside the cathedral, or rest in the shade of the patio of the nearby Juan Valdez Cafe, Colombia's go-to coffee chain.
Of course there's more to Santa Marta's culinary offerings than coffee. The jumble of fare here is as multicultural as the city's mix of ethnicities and musical influences; African, Caribbean, European and Latin flavors vie for space on menus. At Gourmet Plaza Bistro, where the decor includes old TVs and typewriters, diners can sample home-cooked pechuga ricotta, a Colombian-Mediterranean hybrid, as well as tasty crepes. For gourmet ceviche, head to Donde Chucho, an upscale restaurant on a corner of Parque de Los Novios.
The city's reputation as an up-and-coming party spot is also growing, with bars and clubs of all stripes seeming to open weekly. On a late-night jaunt through downtown, one is as likely to hear European techno as the native rhythms of cumbia or vallenato music.
That Latin flavor is evident at La Puerta (the Door), a chic dive bar with retro iconography plastered across its walls of red, yellow and blue (the national colors), where the floor fills with dancers gyrating to the sounds of Colombian rap and reggaeton.
Santa Marta also benefits from the bounty of virgin tropical forests just miles from the city center. For a relaxing getaway, grab a taxi or mini-bus to Taganga, a laid-back oceanside hamlet ringed by a horseshoe-shaped canopy of lush green hills. The strip of sand in town feels more like a dirt driveway than a tropical beach. But the sunsets are breathtaking, especially from the rooftop bar of the Mirador de Taganga Hotel along the town's southern fringe. The Caribbean waters there are also perfect for scuba diving.
On the other side of Santa Marta lies El Rodadero, a Cancun-like strip of stylish restaurants, open-air markets and high-rise hotels along beaches that fill with well-to-do locals on weekends.
But aside from the protected shores of Tayrona National Park, the beaches around Santa Marta are not always the best places to relax. There is the occasional whiff of sewage, and vendors who can bombard tourists with offers of chairs, massages and -- yes -- drugs.
Though Santa Marta is no longer plagued by the kidnappings and killings that kept tourists away for decades, petty crime remains a problem. It's not unusual to hear stories of police officers planting drugs on tourists to exact bribes, or of pickpockets roaming the boardwalk. But the city has made great strides toward putting its bloody, drug-riddled past behind it. Evan Dore, a shaggy-haired native of San Francisco, remembers driving through this part of Colombia four years ago with his brother, Ryan, in a 1981 VW bus. The pair left unimpressed. But two years later they decided to return and restore an 85-year-old mansion, now La Brisa Loca, a hostel and bar aimed at backpackers. They were attracted by Santa Marta's authenticity, which it has maintained despite the recent development.
''The city is full of people going about their daily lives, going to work or selling things on the street with almost no interest in a foreigner walking around,'' Mr. Dore said. ''Santa Marta is the real South America I was searching for.''
IF YOU GO
GETTING THERE
Colombia-based Avianca offers flights directly from Fort Lauderdale to Barranquilla, which is about an hour to Santa Marta by bus or taxi. A recent Web search found round-trip flights in October starting at around $400. Another option is to fly directly to Bogota, from which there are several direct flights to Santa Marta daily; they take just over an hour. Round-trip flights start at about $200.
WHERE TO STAY
Many of the hotels in Santa Marta feel musty and dated, but there are plenty of upscale hotels in the works. For now, try La Casa (Calle 18, 3-52; 57-311-390-4091), a gorgeous three-unit hotel with high ceilings, antiques and original marble floors. Doubles from 237,000 pesos, about $135 at 1,752 Colombian pesos to the dollar.
For backpackers, La Brisa Loca (Calle 14, 3-58; 57-3183-030-666; labrisaloca.com) is a friendly hostel with a festive bar, courtyard pool and rooftop patio, though be sure to book a private room (70,000 pesos).
WHERE TO EAT
Gourmet Plaza Bistro (Calle 18, 3-103; 57-317-453-93 55).
Donde Chucho (Calle 19, 2-17; 57-5-421-4663).

HEADLINE: Big Banking, Southern Style

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
AMONG the more unlikely developments in American finance over the past decade was that Charlotte, N.C., became the headquarters city of two of the nation's biggest banks. But these banks' aggressive growth also produced some dire results, both for their shareholders and for the city, during the 2008 economic crisis.
''Through decades of bold acquisitions, the banks that became Bank of America and Wachovia broke free of the bonds of North Carolina and the South to achieve the status of major financial players -- just in time to become icons of the nation's banking meltdown,'' writes Rick Rothacker in ''Banktown: The Rise and Struggles of Charlotte's Big Banks'' (John F. Blair, $26.95). 
Mr. Rothacker brings a wealth of local knowledge to his subject. A reporter for The Charlotte Observer, he has covered the city's banking scene since 2001. ''Banktown'' is based on court documents and securities filings as well as e-mails unearthed by Congressional investigators.
Interestingly, ''Banktown'' traces some of the underlying motivations for Charlotte's rise to the Civil War. As Hugh L. McColl Jr., who led the growth of NCNB into NationsBank and, later, Bank of America, says: ''After the war, the South was really a hugely defeated nation that was depleted of capital. And unlike Germany and Japan after the Second World War there was no Marshall Plan for the South. None. So we had to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, as I see it.'' When the bank surpassed Wachovia in assets, he says, ''we transferred our aggressive enmity to the New Yorkers.''
Mr. Rothacker attributes the initial successes of Charlotte's banks in part to leaders like Mr. McColl, who ''pushed regulatory envelopes, jockeyed for acquisitions, and pursued an eat-or-be-eaten vision for the financial services industry.''
The banks were also empowered by a United States Supreme Court ruling in 1985, allowing the formation of regional bank compacts. Over the next decade and a half, Mr. McColl's NCNB (formerly known as North Carolina National Bank) gobbled up other institutions, and, after its name change to NationsBank, merged with BankAmerica of San Francisco, transforming itself into Bank of America.
Not to be outdone, Bank of America's crosstown rival First Union Bank swallowed Wachovia, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., assuming its regionally prestigious name. In 2006, Wachovia spent $25.5 billion to buy Golden West Financial of California.
Golden West marketed ''pick a payment'' loans, a form of adjustable-rate home mortgages that would play a major role in the bursting of the housing bubble. At the time, G. Kennedy Thompson, the Wachovia chief, declared that the Golden West portfolio could survive any reversals short of ''huge unemployment and a huge downdraft in home values.'' In fact, that is exactly what happened, leading to Mr. Thompson's ouster and Wachovia's eventual absorption by Wells Fargo.
Presciently, Bank of America started to exit subprime mortgage lending in 2001 under the leadership of its chairman, Kenneth D. Lewis. But Mr. Lewis still had a voracious appetite for growth. In October 2003, he spent $47 billion to acquire FleetBoston. The deal made Bank of America the nation's second-largest bank (behind Citigroup), with assets of $933 billion.
In January 2008, in a policy reversal, Mr. Lewis invested in the mortgage business by acquiring Countrywide Financial of California for $4 billion, contending that it was a bargain despite the industry's already apparent ''near-term challenges.''
The best sections of ''Banktown'' are its accounts of Bank of America's subsequent acquisition of Merrill Lynch amid the economic crisis in the fall of 2008. Mr. Rothacker writes that ''there wasn't a more symbolic victory of a Southern bank over the New York establishment.''
BUT Bank of America's triumph was short-lived. Merrill's losses for 2008 were much greater than expected, and it paid out more than $3 billion in executive bonuses before the Bank of America deal was set to close on Jan. 1, 2009. Mr. Lewis wanted to pull out, Mr. Rothacker says, but was persuaded to stay the course by Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary, and Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, who feared that the deal's collapse might prompt another financial crisis.
Although Mr. Lewis's admirers hailed him for doing his patriotic duty, the bank was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which contended that the Merrill losses were not disclosed in a timely fashion. That case was settled, while similar suits filed by investors and the New York attorney general continue to move forward.
In May 2009, government ''stress tests'' revealed that Bank of America, which had already received $45 billion in government bailout funds, was weighed down with troubled credit cards and home mortgage loans in addition to the Merrill losses. In September of that year, Mr. Lewis announced plans to retire. By that time, Charlotte's upheavals had cost more than 10,000 local finance and insurance jobs, contributing to a 12.8 percent unemployment rate this past January.
''Bank of America and Wells Fargo remain formidable corporate players in the city,'' Mr. Rothacker says, and Charlotte also possesses a range of other financial firms. But it remains to be seen, he says, ''whether or not the city can replace the salaries of high-paying bank jobs'' that it has lost.
The ''Banktown'' saga has all the elements of a compelling tale of high finance. Unfortunately, the writing fails to rise to the drama of the occasion. The book repeatedly quotes from prepared statements and droning transcripts, and digresses to detail boring episodes like a tribute to Mr. Bernanke by the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce.
Even so, ''Banktown'' offers a valuable repository of facts about the star-crossed effort of a proud Southern city to become a major banking capital.

HEADLINE: Cleaner for the Environment, But the Dishes? Not So Shiny

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Some longtime users were furious.
''My dishes were dirtier than before they were washed,'' one wrote last week in the review section of the Web site for the Cascade line of dishwasher detergents. ''It was horrible, and I won't buy it again.''
''This is the worst product ever made for use as a dishwashing detergent!'' another consumer wrote.
Like every other major detergent for automatic dishwashers, Procter & Gamble's Cascade line recently underwent a makeover. Responding to laws that went into effect in 17 states in July, the nation's detergent makers reformulated their products to reduce what had been the crucial ingredient, phosphates, to just a trace. 
While phosphates help prevent dishes from spotting in the wash cycle, they have long ended up in lakes and reservoirs, stimulating algae growth that deprives other plants and fish of oxygen.
Yet now, with the content reduced, many consumers are finding the new formulas as appealing as low-flow showers, underscoring the tradeoffs that people often face today in a more environmentally conscious marketplace. From hybrid cars to solar panels, environmentally friendly alternatives can cost more. They can be less convenient, like toting cloth sacks or canteens rather than plastic bags or bottled water. And they can prove less effective, like some of the new cleaning products.
''Most Americans want to do things that are good for the environment, but not everyone wants to pay the price,'' said Elke U. Weber, director of the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions at Columbia University.
In the world of cleaning agents, where chemicals and fragrances can pose respiratory and allergy problems as well as pollute waterways, the environmental benefits of the switch are clear. Yet the new products can run up against longtime habits and even cultural concepts of cleanliness.
Phosphorus in the form of phosphates suspends particles so they do not stick to dishes and softens water to allow suds to form.
Now that the content in dishwasher detergent has plummeted to 0.5 percent from as high as 8.7 percent, many consumers are just noticing the change in the wash cycle as they run out of the old product.
''Low-phosphate dish detergents are a waste of my money,'' said Thena Reynolds, a 55-year-old homemaker from Van Zandt County, Tex., who said she ran her dishwasher twice a day for a family of five. Now she has to do a quick wash of the dishes before she puts them in the dishwasher to make sure they come out clean, she said. ''If I'm using more water and detergent, is that saving anything?'' Ms. Reynolds said. ''There has to be a happy medium somewhere.''
Similarly, a nonprofit group in Oakland, Calif., that helps women form environmentally minded cooperatives and trains house cleaners, says their employers have often resisted switching to the new cleaning products.
''There's the myth that to be clean it has to shine or smell or make a lot of bubbles,'' said Ivette Melendez, one of the trainers for the group, Women's Action to Gain Economic Security. She says products like vinegar, baking soda or the newer cleansers work just as well as traditional items if applied in the proper mix and quantities.
But Jessica Fischburg, a commerce manager in Norwich, Conn., for CleaningProductsWorld.com, which sells janitorial supplies in bulk, said she was not surprised that many of her clients rejected products marketed as environmentally friendly.
''The reality of any green product is that they generally don't work as well,'' she said. ''Our customers really don't like them.''
But some users attest to quantifiable benefits. Reports of burns, rashes, dizziness and scratchy throats among housekeeping employees have plummeted at North Central Bronx Hospital and Jacobi Medical Center since the staff switched to new cleaning products in 2004, said Peter Lucey, an associate executive director for support services at the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. The number of lost days linked to injuries from the products declined from 54 in 2004 to zero last year, he said. ''It's the switch and the training,'' Mr. Lucey said.
In the case of the new dishwasher detergents, the main benefit is viewed as the protection of bodies of freshwater.
Once they go down the drain and into the environment through discharge at sewage treatment plants, phosphates end up in lakes, streams and drinking-water reservoirs.
Phosphorus pollution comes from multiple sources, including fertilizer and manure that enter the water through runoff. Dishwasher detergents contribute just a fraction, but environmental campaigners say any reduction can result in a tangible improvements. (Laundry detergents and hand soaps are already free of phosphates.)
The first significant regulatory rumblings came in Washington State in 2006. As more and more states followed suit, manufacturers faced the prospect of uneven laws that could disrupt retail distribution nationwide, said Dennis Griesing, vice president for government affairs at the American Cleaning Institute, which represents the cleaning product industry. The nationwide product rollover began late last year.
Industry officials generally insist that most customers have not noticed a change. But in its September issue, Consumer Reports reported that of 24 low- or phosphate-free dishwasher detergents it tested, including those from environmentally friendly product lines that have been on the market for years, none matched the performance of products with phosphates.
The magazine did note that the formulas were improving, and it rated seven detergents ''very good,'' including two of six Cascade products it tested. Susan Baba, a spokeswoman for Cascade, said that while most Cascade customers had not noticed any change, Procter & Gamble was modifying the formulas of some products in response to complaints.
''As we learn more, we're finding out that there's a lot more variation than we saw in the labs,'' she said.
Ms. Baba added that the conversion to low-phosphate content had been complex, with three or four ingredients needed to match what the phosphates accomplished alone.
Elise Jones, a 32-year-old mother of two in Chatham, N.J., and a blog editor for Babybites, a group for new and expectant mothers, said she noticed ''a white dusty film'' on her dishes and children's cups starting about a month ago. ''I thought it was the dishwasher,'' she said, before she heard of the change in formulas.
All the same, she agrees with the restrictions on phosphates because ''we all worry about our water supply.''
Washing the dishes entirely by hand is not necessarily better for the environment, experts say, because people tend to let the tap run even when they are not rinsing. So Mrs. Jones now rinses them all by hand after the wash cycle, trying to economize on water so that her rinsing can match the dishwasher's efficiency.
''You try to do things as consciously as you can,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Aren't We Clever?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Tianjin, China
What a contrast. In a year that's on track to be our planet's hottest on record, America turned ''climate change'' into a four-letter word that many U.S. politicians won't even dare utter in public. If this were just some parlor game, it wouldn't matter. But the totally bogus ''discrediting'' of climate science has had serious implications. For starters, it helped scuttle Senate passage of the energy-climate bill needed to scale U.S.-made clean technologies, leaving America at a distinct disadvantage in the next great global industry. And that brings me to the contrast: While American Republicans were turning climate change into a wedge issue, the Chinese Communists were turning it into a work issue. 
''There is really no debate about climate change in China,'' said Peggy Liu, chairwoman of the Joint U.S.-China Collaboration on Clean Energy, a nonprofit group working to accelerate the greening of China. ''China's leaders are mostly engineers and scientists, so they don't waste time questioning scientific data.'' The push for green in China, she added, ''is a practical discussion on health and wealth. There is no need to emphasize future consequences when people already see, eat and breathe pollution every day.''
And because runaway pollution in China means wasted lives, air, water, ecosystems and money -- and wasted money means fewer jobs and more political instability -- China's leaders would never go a year (like we will) without energy legislation mandating new ways to do more with less. It's a three-for-one shot for them. By becoming more energy efficient per unit of G.D.P., China saves money, takes the lead in the next great global industry and earns credit with the world for mitigating climate change.
So while America's Republicans turned ''climate change'' into a four-letter word -- J-O-K-E -- China's Communists also turned it into a four-letter word -- J-O-B-S.
''China is changing from the factory of the world to the clean-tech laboratory of the world,'' said Liu. ''It has the unique ability to pit low-cost capital with large-scale experiments to find models that work.'' China has designated and invested in pilot cities for electric vehicles, smart grids, LED lighting, rural biomass and low-carbon communities. ''They're able to quickly throw spaghetti on the wall to see what clean-tech models stick, and then have the political will to scale them quickly across the country,'' Liu added. ''This allows China to create jobs and learn quickly.''
But China's capability limitations require that it reach out for partners. This is a great opportunity for U.S. clean-tech firms -- if we nurture them. ''While the U.S. is known for radical innovation, China is better at tweak-ovation.'' said Liu. Chinese companies are good at making a billion widgets at a penny each but not good at complex system integration or customer service.
We (sort of) have those capabilities. At the World Economic Forum meeting here, I met Mike Biddle, founder of MBA Polymers, which has invented processes for separating plastic from piles of junked computers, appliances and cars and then recycling it into pellets to make new plastic using less than 10 percent of the energy required to make virgin plastic from crude oil. Biddle calls it ''above-ground mining.'' In the last three years, his company has mined 100 million pounds of new plastic from old plastic.
Biddle's seed money was provided mostly by U.S. taxpayers through federal research grants, yet today only his tiny headquarters are in the U.S. His factories are in Austria, China and Britain. ''I employ 25 people in California and 250 overseas,'' he says. His dream is to have a factory in America that would repay all those research grants, but that would require a smart U.S. energy bill. Why?
Americans recycle about 25 percent of their plastic bottles. Most of the rest ends up in landfills or gets shipped to China to be recycled here. Getting people to recycle regularly is a hassle. To overcome that, the European Union, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea -- and next year, China -- have enacted producer-responsibility laws requiring that anything with a cord or battery -- from an electric toothbrush to a laptop to a washing machine -- has to be collected and recycled at the manufacturers' cost. That gives Biddle the assured source of raw material he needs at a reasonable price. (Because recyclers now compete in these countries for junk, the cost to the manufacturers for collecting it is steadily falling.)
''I am in the E.U. and China because the above-ground plastic mines are there or are being created there,'' said Biddle, who just won The Economist magazine's 2010 Innovation Award for energy/environment. ''I am not in the U.S. because there aren't sufficient mines.''
Biddle had enough money to hire one lobbyist to try to persuade the U.S. Congress to copy the recycling regulations of Europe, Japan and China in our energy bill, but, in the end, there was no bill. So we educated him, we paid for his tech breakthroughs -- and now Chinese and European workers will harvest his fruit. Aren't we clever?

HEADLINE: Myth And Madness

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Christine O'Donnell is in a fantasy world. Literally.
The pretty Palin Mini-Me identifies with the women of Middle Earth, comparing herself to the female characters in the ''Lord of the Rings'' novels by J. R. R. Tolkien.
''Look at the significance that he gives to Eowyn, the Lady of Rohan,'' O'Donnell said on C-Span in 2003. ''She was a warrior spirit and, to me, that's who I love. I mean, I aspire to be soft and gentle like Arwen, but realistically, I'm a fighter, like Eowyn.'' 
O'Donnell said she liked Tolkien's outlook on gender: ''On the one hand, there's the attitude that's normally on the conservative side -- as a conservative woman, I feel I can say this -- that stifles women. There's almost the stereotypical attitude of, to be a true woman, you have to stay at home. And I've actually had people say to me, 'Why do you choose a career over marriage?' Honestly, I've had only a few significant relationships, and they've broken up with me. And one of the things I've been told is, 'If you weren't so strong, you'd be married by now.' ''
This anti-abortion, anti-masturbation, anti-premarital-sex, anti-stem-cells, anti-gay-marriage, dubious-about-evolution Christian conservative has rocked politics by snatching the Delaware Republican nomination for the Senate away from the seemingly sure-thing moderate Mike Castle.
At the Values Voter Summit here on Friday, the 41-year-old O'Donnell cited another fantasy world to conjure up a Christlike image for the Tea Party.
''We're rowdy, we're passionate,'' she told the enraptured crowd. ''It reminds me of the C. S. Lewis Narnia books, where the little girl asks someone about Aslan the lion, who represents God, and she says with a little concern over such a fearsome lion, 'Is he safe?' And her friend says, 'Safe? Who said anything about safe? Of course he isn't safe. But he's good.' ''
She's right that there's an untamed beast rampaging through American politics. But this beast does not seem blessed; rather it has loosed a kind of ugliness and wildness in the land.
Speaking to Sean Hannity on Fox, Karl Rove dismissed O'Donnell as an absurd choice with a sketchy background and dubious character. He alluded to facts in The Weekly Standard that chronicled her lawsuit against her former employer, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, a conservative nonprofit based in Delaware.
Although O'Donnell said in 1998 that wives should ''graciously submit'' to their husbands, her 2005 suit charged that she suffered ''mental anguish'' after being demoted and fired because the institute's conservative philosophy deemed that women must be subordinate.
We the People in the Ruling Class Elites do think O'Donnell comes across as alarmingly loopy. But maybe she's smart as a fox in doing a Single-White-Female, Fox anchor makeover to look more like her queen-maker, Sarah Palin.
She's also smart to think of politics in terms of passion and myth -- two elements Barack Obama was able to summon during his campaign that are sorely missing from his presidency.
She might have gone a broom too far, though, when she once told Bill Maher that she had ''dabbled into witchcraft'' and went on a date with a witch that included ''a midnight picnic on a satanic altar.''
Obama's bloodless rationality has helped spawn the right's bloodletting of irrationality. His ivory tower approach to the nation's fears and anxieties about the economy gave rise to a tower of angry babble. Tea Party is basically a big tent for anger.
The president's struggle to connect and inspire passion is a dispiriting contrast to, as Yeats said, the worst, full of passionate intensity.
The first African-American president, who wrote in his memoir that he trained himself as a young man not to let his anger show in a suspicious white society, now faces anger on an unprecedented scale from a mostly white movement.
He seems weary of crisis management, conveying the attitude of the hero in ''The Incredibles'' who has to keep saving the world: ''Sometimes I just want it to stay saved!''
The president seems put upon and impatient with reality while his foes seem happy to embrace fantasy.
Obama can connect with policy. He just can't connect with the objects of policy. Empathy seems more like an abstract concept than something to practice.
He has never shaken off that slight patronizing attitude toward the working-class voters he is losing now, the ones he dubbed ''bitter'' during his campaign. There is no premium in trying to save people's jobs and lift them up and give them health care if they feel that you can't relate to them. That's how Mayor Adrian Fenty lost his job, despite D.C.'s progress on schools and crime.
The insane have achieved political respectability while the sane act too good for it all. The irrational celebrate while the rational act bored and above-it-all.
When Rahm Emanuel leaves to go run for mayor in Chicago, all the blood will drain out of the White House. And Obama can go to Ben's Chili Bowl for lunch every day and it won't matter.

HEADLINE: Looks Like a Condo, Acts Like a Hotel

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
ROOM service on demand from a celebrity chef. A maid to make the bed with fresh linens every day and leave a chocolate on your pillow at night. An 11,000-square-foot spa an elevator ride away. All yours with the purchase of a luxury condo.
Nearly a dozen projects in and around New York City that offer perks like these have recently opened or are nearing completion. For developers from Hoboken to Harlem, Williamsburg to SoHo, a condominium with a hotel attached is one more weapon in the reignited amenities arms race.
For buyers, the concept of a home with all the comforts of a hotel may seem like paradise. But hotel services don't come cheap: the developers of condo-hotels plan to charge as much as 20 percent more per square foot than high-end competitors that don't have hotel partners.
And along with room service can come hotel-like bills, not to mention higher monthly maintenance fees. Financing can also be more difficult to secure; banks are leery of lending money for what could appear to be strictly investment property. 
Dolly Lenz, the vice chairman of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that at the same time they fantasize about dialing up club sandwiches at midnight, prospective buyers should take into account the possibility that the price of the amenities could go up over time. ''It might be included for a year or two years,'' she said. ''Three years from now the kicker hits them.''
Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, said, ''The key factor to remember is that these properties were conceived in a different market.
''There was a lot of creativity because there was essentially free capital,'' he added. ''Developers needed to be aggressive to get higher and higher prices per square foot. The question now is if the math still works.''
That is an open question, and one that hinges as much on the hotel business as the broader real estate market. Hotel occupancy has been steadily increasing in recent months, with 89 percent occupancy in August and an average room rate of $227, according to NYC & Company, the city's official marketing, tourism and partnership organization.
But that is far from the more than the $300 a night commanded by hotels before the economy faltered. There is also more competition now. In 2010, 21 hotels have opened, or will, across the city; that adds more than 6,700 rooms.
Of these projects, at least 10 include condominiums.
It is too early to draw any conclusions about their viability. Some have sold below initial expectations, while others have increased their prices since coming on the market. Prices for units in condo-hotels range from $300,000 to more than $18 million -- $680 per square foot to nearly $4,000 -- with yet more properties in the pipeline. The various projects are aimed at a wide range of consumers, from Manhattanites who are downsizing in cost but not comfort, to foreigners for whom New York is a good buy right now.
But in their scale and ambition, which real estate experts say is unlikely to be matched in coming years now that financing is so hard to shake loose, the condo-hotels are already having an impact. Brokers and developers say some strictly condominium projects are stepping up amenities partly in response to the condo-hotel phenomenon.
The Edge, a new condo in Williamsburg, devotes 40,000 square feet to perks like yoga studios, a spa and basketball courts. On the Upper East Side, developers collaborated with Miraval, a resort and spa in Arizona, to create a 41-story complex that offers ''sanctuary-esque'' homes, and amenities like a pool and a rock-climbing wall.
The newer condo-hotels are not to be confused with condotel projects like the 1997 Trump International Hotel and Tower. A condotel customarily allows its condo owners to rent out their units as income-producing hotel rooms, an arrangement that often attracted investors.
But with banks now wary of lending to buyers of investment properties, some real estate analysts and brokers have declared the condotel dead, although the developers of the Trump SoHo on Spring Street and Varick would disagree. The condos of the condo-hotel combinations are being marketed to buyers as homes to be lived in and the hotel amenities that come with them as lifestyle.
The Residences at the Williamsburg in Brooklyn divided its project into three buildings, two of which are made up of condos and one of which is the hotel, so that buyers would have an easier time getting mortgages.
''My understanding is that it has been harder for buyers to get financing in mixed-use properties,'' said David Maundrell, the president of apartmentsandlofts.com, which is marketing the property.
So far, he said, with construction proceeding, 20 of the 57 condos are in contract, ranging in price from $455,000, for a one-bedroom, to $1.56 million for a three-bedroom -- about $780 per square foot, the upper end of the Williamsburg market.
''We wanted to make it clear that we are not a 'condotel,' but a hotel with condominiums,'' Mr. Maundrell said. Owners at the Williamsburg have access to housekeeping services, a rooftop bar with views of Manhattan, discount hotel rates for friends and family and, for an extra $30,000, private cabanas on the condo's rooftops, ''like in South Beach.''
While Williamsburg has plenty of luxury condos, it is lacking in hotel space, so the developers hope to get top dollar -- $300 a night.
''We believe there is value here because it is the first property of its kind in Brooklyn,'' Mr. Maundrell said.
The condo-hotel concept is also coming to Harlem, with the opening of Apex at the Starwood Aloft Hotel at 2300 Frederick Douglass Boulevard, at the corner of 124th Street. The 44 Apex condos, above the 124 hotel rooms, range from 476-square-foot studios, for $300,000, to 1,767 square-foot three bedrooms for just over $1 million -- an average of $600 per square foot. Sales are expected to begin next week.
''We have been very cognizant of setting it up so whatever amenities the hotel has, we can offer to our residents,'' said Richard Gorsky, who is leading RCG Longview, the development team. Unlike many of the other properties, this one will not have room service for condo owners, because there is no restaurant. Owners will, however, have access to the hotel's gym, parking and rooftop deck.
Developers of the Apex are still negotiating with the Federal Housing Administration so buyers can secure cheaper F.H.A. loans. Condo-hotel properties elsewhere in New York City are usually too expensive to qualify for such loans.
Developers have been encouraged by the sales at the W Hoboken. Since the condo-hotel opened in 2009, 38 of the 40 condos have sold, with prices ranging from just under $1 million to $2.5 million, records for the neighborhood, according to Michael Barry, the developer and owner of the property through his company, Ironstate.
From the beginning, he said, buyers were encouraged ''not to look at this as an income-producing investment.'' The condos were not marketed to people who wanted to be a ''mini-hotelier,'' he added.
While projects in Harlem, Hoboken and Williamsburg are testing new markets, most of the projects are in pricier Manhattan neighborhoods, where the investment is greater, the competition stiffer and the sale prices higher.
The 57-story Setai Fifth Avenue, a condo-hotel between 36th and 37th Streets, has faceted windows and a lighted steel crown designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates, and is asking nearly $4,000 per square foot. The developer, Bizzi & Partners, would not divulge sales figures.
The Setai's condos come with access to a host of amenities, including what the building's Web site refers to as ''the blissful experience of exceptional service.'' Then there is the ''aquatic area'' in the 11,500-square-foot spa: ''two experiential showers, a vitality pool, sauna, steam, an ice cave and a social hammam,'' an elaborate saunalike room.
Solly Assa, the owner of Assa Properties, which developed the Cassa Hotel and Residences in Midtown, said that although the mainly foreign buyers at his property were willing to pay $950,000 to $18 million for the condos, they were looking to save money on carrying costs. So the Cassa will offer many of hotel amenities ''a la carte'' instead of including them in the common charge. The lower monthly fees, starting at about $1,200, are one reason the apartments have sold quickly, allowing him to raise prices three times already, he said.
Of the 57 residences for sale, 40 are in the process of closing, he said.
''We understand that it is a new era,'' Mr. Assa said.
Another Combo
THE Trump SoHo stands apart from the current crop of condo-hotels because it more closely adheres to the ''condotel'' model.
Donald J. Trump helped create that model in the 1990s with the Trump International Hotel and Tower and it is his company that is managing the new Trump SoHo; the developer is the Bayrock/Sapir Organization.
At the Trump SoHo, zoning restrictions limit buyers to stays in their units of no more than 120 days a year. The hotel treats the units like ordinary guest rooms when the owners are not in residence.
Rodrigo Nino, the president of Prodigy International, the sales and marketing company for Trump SoHo, said that all 391 hotel suites are for sale.
''Over the past three months, we have closed on 23 units, with gross sales of $30 million, averaging $10 million in closings a month,'' Mr. Nino said. ''The average price per square foot is $2,516.''
The amenities include an 11,000-square-foot spa with a hammam, an outdoor pool and a nightclub where owners are waved through the velvet ropes.
With the Trump name has come Trump-sized attention. The real estate blog curbed.com has written more than 100 posts on the property, chronicling rebates for aggrieved investors, controversy over sales figures, and a $20 million infusion of capital to offset slow sales.
The SoHo Alliance, a neighborhood group led by Sean Sweeney, challenged the project from the beginning. ''We told him we were going to slap him in the face,'' Mr. Sweeney said of Mr. Trump, ''and he got his face slapped.'' Mr. Sweeney believes his group helped scare off investors.
Mr. Trump dismisses Mr. Sweeney out of hand.
''I don't know who he is,'' he said, ''but the alliance's sole function was to try and stop the project from being built, and they failed. The building is open and operating and doing a fantastic business.

HEADLINE: Achieving Techno-Literacy

BYLINE: By KEVIN KELLY

 BODY:
This past year my wife and I home-schooled our eighth-grade son. One school day, he and I decided we would make fire the old way -- out of nothing but plant materials and our own hustle. Our son watched a seemingly endless series of instructional survival videos on YouTube as part of his research. He chose the bow method based on our physics class about friction. He then constructed a bow from a branch in the woods, carved a stick for the spindle and added a fiber string. It was mighty tough going. We spent hours refining the apparatus. He was surprised by the enormous amount of bodily energy required to focus onto a very small spot, and how a minuscule, nearly invisible bit of fuel, once sparked, can quickly amplify into a flame and then a fire. Chemistry, physics, history and gym all in one lesson. And, man, when you are 13 years old and Prometheus, it's exhilarating! 
One day our student would dissect and diagram the inside organs of flowers; the next he'd write short stories or poems and then revise them; and the next day we'd solve logic problems with algebra, then he'd work on plans for a chicken coop and maybe we'd do a field trip to a car factory. He also went through eighth-grade textbooks in history, grammar, geometry and the like. This type of home-schooling is really nothing special. Our son was merely one of more than a million students home-schooled in the United States last year. Our reasons for home-schooling were not uncommon, either. We wanted to create an ideal learning environment. For the previous seven years, our son was enrolled in challenging schools. His grades were excellent, but the amount of homework was grinding him down. The intense high school he was planning to attend promised even more work. He asked if he could be home-schooled for his last year before high school, and by a quirk of life, this was a year our schedules would permit our role as home-school teachers.
Now that the year is done, I am struck that the fancy technology supposedly crucial to an up-to-the-minute education was not a major factor in its success. Of course, technology in the broadest sense was everywhere in our classroom. There was an inexpensive microscope on the kitchen table and an old digital camera to record experiments. There was a PC always on for research. Our son was also a big user of online tutorials. Of particular note is Khan Academy, which offers nearly 1,600 short high-quality tutorials on algebra, chemistry, history, economics and other subjects -- all created by one guy, and all free. The Internet was also essential for my wife and me as we researched the best textbooks, the best projects, the best approaches.
But the computer was only one tool of many. Technology helped us learn, but it was not the medium of learning. It was summoned when needed. Technology is strange that way. Education, at least in the K-12 range, is more about child rearing than knowledge acquisition. And since child rearing is primarily about forming character, instilling values and cultivating habits, it may be the last area to be directly augmented by technology.
Even so, as technology floods the rest of our lives, one of the chief habits a student needs to acquire is technological literacy -- and we made sure it was part of our curriculum. By technological literacy, I mean the latest in a series of proficiencies children should accumulate in school. Students begin with mastering the alphabet and numbers, then transition into critical thinking, logic and absorption of the scientific method. Technological literacy is something different: proficiency with the larger system of our invented world. It is close to an intuitive sense of how you add up, or parse, the manufactured realm. We don't need expertise with every invention; that is not only impossible, it's not very useful. Rather, we need to be literate in the complexities of technology in general, as if it were a second nature.
Technology will change faster than we can teach it. My son studied the popular programming language C++ in his home-school year; that knowledge could be economically useless soon. The accelerating pace of technology means his eventual adult career does not exist yet. Of course it won't be taught in school. But technological smartness can be. Here is the kind of literacy that we tried to impart:
Every new technology will bite back. The more powerful its gifts, the more powerfully it can be abused. Look for its costs.
Technologies improve so fast you should postpone getting anything you need until the last second. Get comfortable with the fact that anything you buy is already obsolete.
Before you can master a device, program or invention, it will be superseded; you will always be a beginner. Get good at it.
Be suspicious of any technology that requires walls. If you can fix it, modify it or hack it yourself, that is a good sign.
The proper response to a stupid technology is to make a better one, just as the proper response to a stupid idea is not to outlaw it but to replace it with a better idea.
Every technology is biased by its embedded defaults: what does it assume?
Nobody has any idea of what a new invention will really be good for. The crucial question is, what happens when everyone has one?
The older the technology, the more likely it will continue to be useful.
Find the minimum amount of technology that will maximize your options.
I don't think my son mastered all those principles in one year, but he got a start. For the most part, learning at home is more demanding than learning in a classroom because it requires more self-direction. On one particularly long day, with books piled up and papers spread out, my son was slumped in his chair.
''Is everything O.K.?'' I asked.
''It's hard,'' he said. ''I not only have to be the student, I also have to be the teacher.''
''Yes! So what have you learned about being a teacher?''
''You have to teach the student -- that's me -- not only to learn stuff but to learn how to learn.''
''And have you?''
''I think I am doing better as the student than the teacher. I'm learning how to learn, but I can't wait till next year when I have some real good teachers -- better than me.''
He had learned the most critical thing: how to keep learning. A month ago he entered high school eager to be taught -- not facts, or even skills, but a lifelong process that would keep pace with technology's rapid, ceaseless teaching.
If we listen to technology, and learn to be proficient in its ways, then we'll be able to harness this most powerful force in the world. If not, we'll be stuck at the bottom of the class.

HEADLINE: A Health Care Plan for Colleges

BYLINE: By PETER ORSZAG. 
Peter Orszag, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget from 2009 to 2010 and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, is a contributing columnist for The Times.

 BODY:
Over the past few weeks, millions of parents sent their children off to college. But amid the packing and unpacking (and in some cases, the tears), most probably didn't realize how increasing health care costs are harming their kids' education.
Consider this: In 1980, a new associate professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a leading public school, earned about the same amount as one at the University of Chicago, a nearby leading private school; ditto for the University of Texas at Austin and Rice University. 
By 2000, new associate professors at the University of Illinois and the University of Texas were earning about 15 percent less than their counterparts at Chicago and Rice. And by this year, the differential had widened to 20 percent.
Money may not be the only thing motivating professors, but over time this growing salary gap will undoubtedly pull the talented ones away from public higher education -- the colleges and universities that three-quarters of our students attend.
What does health care have to do with any of this? Research I've done with Tom Kane of Harvard and the Gates Foundation finds a surprisingly strong connection: over recent decades, as state governments have devoted a larger share of resources to rising costs of Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, they have cut support for higher education.
Governments' general support for higher education 25 years ago was nearly 50 percent greater than state spending on Medicaid. That relationship has now flipped: Medicaid spending is about 50 percent greater than support for higher education. If higher education's share of state budgets had remained constant instead of being crowded out by rising Medicaid costs, it would be getting some $30 billion more than it receives today, or more than $2,000 per student.
These Medicaid cost increases have closely tracked cost increases in the rest of the health care system over the past three decades. So the problem is not Medicaid per se; the fundamental problem is rising health care costs as a whole.
Our research suggests that states tend to rob education to pay for Medicaid during economic downturns. And when the economy recovers, the money for education usually doesn't get restored. Today, as in other business cycles, states are cutting back. Georgia reduced higher education financing by 7 percent for fiscal 2011; Washington reduced spending for the University of Washington by 26 percent over this year and next. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, since 2008 at least 43 states have made cuts to financing for public colleges and universities or have increased tuition.
Tuitions have risen significantly and now account for 37 percent of total public higher education budgets, up from 25 percent in 1985. Yet this has not been enough to offset state government cutbacks. That's because, just 30 years ago, state appropriations generally accounted for about four times the revenue of tuition -- so offsetting a 20 percent reduction in state support would require raising tuition by 80 percent. This is simply not politically feasible.
The result, as we've seen, is that public colleges haven't been able to stay competitive with private universities on salaries and spending on students. It might be possible to trim some more fat, but ultimately quality is going to suffer.
The evidence suggests that may already be happening. The U.S. News and World Report college rankings are hardly perfect, but they do provide some perspective. In the 1987 survey, there were eight public schools among the top 25; this year there were only three, and none in the top 20. In 1987, the top-ranked public university (the University of California at Berkeley) came in fifth. By 2010, Berkeley was still the top-rated of the public universities, but it had fallen to 22nd overall.
How can we reverse this trend? One step is to provide more federal support for Medicaid when downturns hit, because that is when states tend to put the squeeze on higher education. So the temporary Medicaid help provided by Congress and the Obama administration over the past two years may have not only helped avoid cutbacks in Medicaid while bolstering the economy, but also improved your child's college education.
The more fundamental response, however, is to get a better handle on rising health care costs, something I'll focus on in my next few columns. Containing health care costs is not just an abstraction central to addressing our long-term fiscal gap. It is also central to raising workers' take-home pay, because increasing costs for health care are holding down wages.
And perhaps most unexpectedly, slowing the growth of health costs may be among the best things we can do to help the next generation attend a high-quality public college.

HEADLINE: Better Health, With a Little Help From Our Friends

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
IS your social network making you fat? Are your friends and family influencing you to smoke and drink more, or to sleep less?
And if our relationships contribute to behaviors that erode our health, can social networks be harnessed to improve it?
These are seminal questions in ''network science'' -- an emerging field that examines how behavioral changes spread through social networks. By social networks, I don't mean virtual, will-you-''friend''-me? simulations, but old-fashioned, flesh-and-blood relationships. You know, people you actually see in person regularly -- friends, relatives, co-workers, neighbors. 
''It's a very old thing that we do, like ants, arranging ourselves to live in social structures,'' says Dr. Nicholas A. Christakis, a Harvard professor who studies health and social networks. ''Really, humans have arranged themselves into networks for hundreds and thousands of years.''
Dr. Christakis and his research partner, James H. Fowler, an associate professor at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, created an international uproar in 2007 when they published a study on obesity. In it, they reported that fat could be catching -- spreading through social ties. One of the study's findings was that a person's chance of becoming obese increased 57 percent if the person had a friend who became obese. Another surprising finding of the study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, was that one's chance of becoming obese was influenced not only by the weight gain of friends but also by friends of friends who gained weight.
Since then, the researchers have examined how other health-related behaviors and conditions -- drug use and sleeplessness among teenagers, smoking and happiness -- spread through social networks. And they have published a book explaining their work, titled ''Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives.''
Now Dr. Christakis and Professor Fowler, as well as other scientists, are turning their attention to a new research area: how to harness social networks to promote public health.
Of course, we already know that people can and do change their health habits when they seek out and participate in new social groupings. Weight Watchers, anyone?
But how do we extract information from existing social networks to improve public health?
One method is to identify social connectors, people who spend time with more friends than average -- and are thus exposed to more germs and are more likely to be among the first to contract contagious diseases like the flu. If health officials could find and track those social butterflies, they could tap into an early-detection system for epidemics and figure out whom to vaccinate first in order to slow the spread of disease.
Last winter, Dr. Christakis and Professor Fowler tried just such a strategy -- monitoring people's friends -- to track the spread of H1N1 flu at Harvard. They monitored 744 undergraduates who were either selected at random or were named as friends by the randomly selected students. Then they followed the undergrads, using their electronic medical records, to identify which students went to the university health service complaining of flu symptoms.
The method is based on ''the friendship paradox'' -- the counterintuitive idea that your friends have more friends than you do. In other words, you're more likely to be friends with popular people than with loners. And those popular people tend to be closer to the core of a social network.
In the Harvard study, published Wednesday in the scientific journal PLoS One, the flu developed about two weeks earlier in the friend group than in the randomly selected group. The results, the study leaders say, indicate that public health officials could use friend monitoring like sentinel nodes in the human body, as an early-detection system for disease.
Friend monitoring systems could also be used to identify flu trends faster than methods now used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- or on Google, for that matter -- because the friend system pinpoints signs of an epidemic before it peaks in the general population, Professor Fowler says.
''This method, although we have studied H1N1, could be applied to anything that spreads -- smoking, weight gain,'' he says.
Some researchers are also studying how a social network's structure affects the speed at which people adopt and stick to health habits.
To that end, Damon Centola, an assistant professor of economic sociology at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., conducted an experiment with more than 1,500 people. He created a Web-based health forum where they had access to and could rate health information sites.
Professor Centola then randomly assigned participants to one of two social network designs: one was set up like a residential neighborhood, with clusters of overlapping ties among neighbors; the other was a casual network where people did not share social ties.
Each participant was matched with other members, called ''health buddies.'' Although people could not contact their buddies directly, they received e-mail from the system about their buddies' activities on the site.
The neighborhood structure turned out to be much better than the random social network at prompting people in the study to join and participate in the health forum, according to Professor Centola's report, published this month in the journal Science. More important, Professor Centola says, the more e-mails that people received about the activities of their health buddies, the more often they returned to the forum.
IN the real world, he says, this means the amount of social reinforcement you give to people to improve their health habits may be more important than who is encouraging them to do so. In other words, a local community network of friends and neighbors may be more important than a remote celebrity spokesman in stopping the spread of, say, sexually transmitted diseases among teenagers.
''It makes a bigger difference how you connect people than who is there in influencing desirable behaviors,'' Professor Centola says.
It also tells us that while weight gain among our friends and friends' friends can make us fatter, our close connections may also lead us to better health choices, like going to the gym more often or stir-frying more vegetables.
But if we are to make lasting changes in our health habits, Dr. Fowler says, we may need social reinforcement in which our friends, not to mention our friends' friends, change their habits with us.
And that's no small order for a social network.

HEADLINE: Strategies to Stretch Your Dollar

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
THE first time I traveled to South America, in 1992, my mother told me, ''We had to move the credenza at the office to see where you were on the bottom of the map!'' I was in Ushuaia, at the southern tip of Argentina -- a country that wasn't exactly on most travelers' must-see list.
But now travel agents will tell you Argentina is ''hot,'' as Americans flock to Buenos Aires for its European flair mixed with local steak, tango music and wine.
While Argentina and other South American countries are considered a bargain -- at least compared with Europe -- that common perception can be misleading, in part because the airfare to get there can cost more than $1,000, depending on where and when you fly. 
Even so, things like meals, cabs and coffee tend to be relatively affordable once you arrive, and places that aren't quite as cosmopolitan as Buenos Aires can be more of a deal. Here's how to get the most for your money, in the air and on the ground.
Don't Follow the Crowd
I lived in Buenos Aires for two years and would definitely recommend a visit, but there are less expensive places to consider if you are on a budget.
''Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia are a lot cheaper than Argentina, Brazil or even Venezuela,'' said Robert Reid, the Americas editor for the Lonely Planet guidebooks. He recommended Cuenca, Ecuador, as an economical option for anyone interested in Spanish-language programs, many of which are under $500 a week.
''You stay with a family, you get all your meals and you have something to do every day,'' he said. ''It's a wonderful travel experience, it's cheap and you're learning something.''
How much you can expect to spend also depends on where within each country you decide to go. Big cities like Rio de Janeiro tend to be pricier than smaller ones like Recife, on Brazil's northeastern coast. And transportation costs can make the cost of traveling to places like the Amazon expensive. Still, there are ways to economize if you have your heart set on going somewhere remote.
Go With a Group
The firm Southwind Adventures (southwindadventures.com), which specializes in booking adventure trips to South America, offers an eight-day trip to Lima and into the Amazon from Puerto Maldonado, Peru, for $2,195 a person, not including airfare -- if four to six people are traveling together.
''The key is you have to be willing to go with other people,'' said Tom Damon, Southwind's president. The more people in your group, the more you'll save since you'll be splitting the cost of things like a boat into the jungle. If you don't want to round up your own friends or family, you can join a group traveling on dates the company has set.
Other ways to save on adventure tours are to book more than four months in advance to get an early booking discount -- which can be as much as 10 percent off, Mr. Damon said. Or you can shift your itinerary so you spend less time in a place like Machu Picchu, where lodging can be expensive, and more time in places like the Sacred Valley of the Incas in Peru.
Even in the Galapagos Islands, there are affordable ships. Robert Becker, an adventure travel and diving specialist with Protravel International (protravelinc.com) said he has booked clients on the Floreana, a small yacht that can cost less than $2,500 a person for an eight-day trip, not including airfare.
Rent an Apartment
One of the reasons cities can cause sticker shock is that hotels tend to cost more than some travelers expect -- an average of $134 a night in Buenos Aires, according to Smith Travel Research Global, a hospitality research firm, and $155 in Rio de Janeiro.
Seth Kugel, who writes the Frugal Traveler column, recommends asking for a discount when you call to book a hotel, or negotiating in person when you arrive.
Another way to save is to rent an apartment instead, but stick with sites someone you trust recommends, since the Internet has become fertile ground for vacation rental scams.
A friend who used to live in Buenos Aires booked an apartment at BuenosAiresHabitat.com when he went back for a visit last year; he paid about $1,000 for a three-week stay.
A fellow travel writer has used ApartmentsBA.com, which is run by an American, Michael Koh.
Although the average one-bedroom listed on the site costs $125 to $150 a night, that includes Internet and local calls -- and the 21 percent tax that would normally be added to your hotel bill.
Buenos Aires seems to be the main place where such apartment rentals are common, though Mr. Koh also recommended Apartmentsrio.com for travelers headed to Rio. And Mr. Kugel said he has used rentflat.com.br to rent apartments in Rio, reporting all good experiences at great prices.
A Free (or Cheap) Stopover
If you're planning to visit more than one city, you may get a better deal by working with a company like Exito Travel, which specializes in booking tickets to South America that involve multiple stops.
''Anybody who is going to a single destination can price search the lowest airfare,'' said Todd Jones, president of Exito Travel. ''Our key focus is to help somebody who wants to do more than fly to one city and return.''
For instance, for a trip from Miami to Lima, Mr. Jones suggested adding a free stopover in Cartagena, Colombia, quoting $560 for a round-trip ticket on Avianca, including taxes. Flying from New York to Buenos Aires, he quoted $1,074 for a ticket on LAN Airlines with a free stopover in Lima.
Another money-saving strategy is booking an ''open jaw'' ticket, so you can fly to one city, like Lima, continue on with a flight to Cuzco (the jumping off point for visits to Machu Picchu), then fly home from Cuzco. That way, you can avoid buying an expensive domestic ticket, or what can be a grueling bus trip from Lima to Cuzco.
''It's a scary ride up and down some of those mountain passes,'' Mr. Jones said.
Shopping for Savings
I didn't do much shopping during my time in South America -- and the wool sweaters I brought back from Chile were deemed ''itchy'' by those who received them as gifts.
But savvier shoppers report finding deals on high-end leather goods in Argentina, blankets in Bolivia, silver jewelry in Chile and bathing suits in Brazil, and even things like your favorite drugstore products may be a bargain in places like Buenos Aires.
Then there are the tempting but unwieldy finds you might remember years after leaving them behind -- like all the furniture Mr. Reid spotted while working on Lonely Planet's guide for Colombia.
''They have a bunch of great vintage furniture shops, and it was ridiculously cheap,'' he said. ''But there are probably easier things you can buy than sending furniture home.''

HEADLINE: A Market Flirts With Stability

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

 BODY:
THE story of the national housing market -- and the somewhat less tumultuous New York City subplot -- has been one of great extremes: bubbles, booms and busts, crashes and comebacks, misery and euphoria.
So what to make of it now? After weeks of gloomy national news fanning fears of a double dip in the market, New York City's largest brokerage firms are reporting something of a rebound and, with a sense of relief, even a possible state of stability.
''It is too soon to tell about a return to normalcy,'' said Noah Rosenblatt, an independent broker who publishes real estate data on his Web site, UrbanDigs, and has been analyzing recent property listings, new contracts and sales. ''It looks to me that we hit the bottom'' in the sales slump that drove home prices down, he said, and that ''activity is starting to really pick up.'' 
The major brokerages agree: prices, while low, are holding steady; inventory over all appears to be at a relatively healthy level; and sales have risen substantially over the last six months. The exception was a slightly slower-than-normal summer, but it came after a slightly better bonus season earlier in the year, and there are now reports of a more typical post-Labor Day upswing.
The prospect of a return to seasons in real estate -- a busy spring and fall, slow summer months and a sleepy market during the holidays, followed by bonus-driven sales from the start of the year to spring -- is itself cause for some muted celebration.
Dorothy Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said: ''It's going to be a good year for us; people may actually move this year. In 2009 they were afraid to do anything. They would look but wait for prices to drop. People actually pulled the trigger in 2010.''
Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property, said that things were also looking a little less grim for sellers. ''When you open the newspaper and you read what's going on nationally, then people get very anxious,'' she said. But, she said, she is seeing something unfamiliar in the recent market: an apartment ''you may have loved yesterday'' was sold to someone else, and perhaps buyers will have to move faster.
While no one is doing cartwheels, analysts cautiously agree with this sunnier picture. They do, however, emphasize some caveats, including the stubbornly high unemployment rate (New York City's rate is marginally lower than the national average, and it has been on a steady decline), tight credit and an overall economy that is not exactly poised to fuel an imminent housing comeback.
''Things are stabilizing, and everybody's thinking, 'Hey, we're back, the worst is behind us,' '' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the Miller Samuel appraisal firm, who also prepares the quarterly market reports for Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''A year has passed and people haven't felt like they were standing right on the abyss.''
He added, though, ''We're in a far better place than we were, but we still have a ways to go.''
While it is still clearly a buyer's market, supply and demand may be starting to come into equilibrium, Mr. Rosenblatt said.
Many apartments, however, are still selling below list prices. Ms. Ramirez said the gap between asking price and accepted offers continued to be widest in the luxury market, which she defined as apartments listed for at least $3 million. For less expensive one- and two-bedrooms, she said, sellers are receiving 92 to 98 percent of the asking price; for the high-end units, the offers are at least 8 percent lower, with much more negotiating.
Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, shared the views of her colleagues, saying, ''we're at this new normal market.''
She noted that she had seen a significant turnaround in the troubled new-construction market, with new units now selling.
Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said that his company was seeing many more renters who had been priced out of the market looking to take advantage of low sales prices and buy.
He and other brokers said that although real estate investment from foreign buyers had fallen off, it was now beginning to pick up again, driven largely by Russian, European and Chinese buyers.
''I'm very encouraged,'' Mr. Willkie said. ''I don't think we're back to the heydays, but it's a healthier market in many ways. But we're cautious. We will follow the general economy, and if that falters a great deal, we're going to feel it.''
Chris Phoenix and Mary S. Park, a couple in their early 40s, have been looking for a Manhattan apartment in the $1 million price range for the last three years.
They are taking a view on the market that Mr. Miller says is the smartest: the long one. And they sound mostly impervious to the manic-depressive swings in real estate, expressing the kind of consumer confidence that brokers hope will be contagious.
''Regardless of whether it's a seller's or a buyer's market,'' Ms. Park said, she is confident that ''there is somebody who wants to sell something to us at a price point we are happy with, and we can sell it in the future at a good price.''

HEADLINE: Games Theory

BYLINE: By SARA CORBETT. 
Sara Corbett is a contributing writer for the magazine. She wrote about the publication of Carl Jung's ''Red Book'' last year.

 BODY:
One morning last winter I watched a middle-school teacher named Al Doyle give a lesson, though not your typical lesson. This was New York City, a noncharter public school in an old building on a nondescript street near Gramercy Park, inside an ordinary room that looked a lot like all the other rooms around it, with fluorescent lights and linoleum floors and steam-driven radiators that hissed and clanked endlessly.
Doyle was, at 54, a veteran teacher and had logged 32 years in schools all over Manhattan, where he primarily taught art and computer graphics. In the school, which was called Quest to Learn, he was teaching a class, Sports for the Mind, which every student attended three times a week. It was described in a jargony flourish on the school's Web site as ''a primary space of practice attuned to new media literacies, which are multimodal and multicultural, operating as they do within specific contexts for specific purposes.'' What it was, really, was a class in technology and game design. 
The lesson that day was on enemy movement, and the enemy was a dastardly collection of spiky-headed robots roving inside a computer game. The students -- a pack of about 20 boisterous sixth graders -- were meant to observe how the robots moved, then chart any patterns they saw on pieces of graph paper. Later in the class period, working on laptops, they would design their own games. For the moment, though, they were spectators.
Doyle, who is thin and gray-haired with a neatly trimmed goatee, sat at a desk in the center of the room, his eyeglasses perched low on his nose, his fingers frenetically tapping the keyboard of a MacBook. The laptop was connected to a wall-mounted interactive whiteboard, giving the students who were sprawled on the floor in front of it an excellent view of his computer screen. Which was a good thing, because at least as they saw it, Doyle was going to die an embarrassing death without their help. Doyle had 60 seconds to steer a little bubble-shaped sprite -- a toddling avatar dressed in a royal blue cape and matching helmet -- through a two-dimensional maze without bumping into the proliferating robots. In order to win, he would need to gobble up some number of yellow reward points, Pac-Man style.
''Go right! Go right! Go right!'' the students were shouting. ''Now down, down, down, downdowndown!'' A few had lifted themselves onto their knees and were pounding invisible keyboards in front of them. ''Whoa!'' they yelled in unison, some of them instinctively ducking as Doyle's sprite narrowly avoided a patrolling enemy.
Beauchamp, a round-faced boy wearing a dark sweatshirt, watched Doyle backtrack to snap up more points and calmly offered a piece of advice. ''That extra movement cost you some precious time, Al,'' he said, sounding almost professorial. ''There are more points up there than what you need to finish.''
''How much time do I have?'' Doyle asked.
''Nineteen seconds.''
''Thanks,'' said Doyle, his eyes not leaving the screen. He added, ''See, us older people, we don't have the peripheral vision to check the time because we didn't grow up with these games.''
For a few seconds, it was quiet. Doyle pinged through a row of reward points and then, hitting a little cul-de-sac in the maze, he paused. His avatar's tiny yellow feet pedaled uselessly against a wall. The students began to yowl. A girl named Shianne pressed her hand to her forehead in faux anguish.
''Go! Go! Turn around. Don't slow down. What are you waitingfor?'' someone called out.
''How much time do I have left?''
''Thirteen seconds!''
Doyle smiled. ''All the time in the world,'' he said, before taking his sprite on a deliberate detour to get even more reward points. The move, like a premature touchdown dance, put his students in agony.
''To the goal! To the goal! Al, run to the goal!''
And as the clock wound down and the students hollered and the steam radiator in the corner let out another long hiss, Doyle's little blue self rounded a final corner, waited out a passing robot and charged into the goal at the end of the maze with less than two seconds to spare. This caused a microriot in the classroom. Cheers erupted. Fists pumped. A few kids lay back on the floor as if knocked out by the drama. Several made notes on their graph paper. Doyle leaned back in his chair. Had he taught anything? Had they learned anything? It depended, really, on how you wanted to think about teaching and learning.
WHAT IF TEACHERS GAVE UP the vestiges of their educational past, threw away the worksheets, burned the canon and reconfigured the foundation upon which a century of learning has been built? What if we blurred the lines between academic subjects and reimagined the typical American classroom so that, at least in theory, it came to resemble a typical American living room or a child's bedroom or even a child's pocket, circa 2010 -- if, in other words, the slipstream of broadband and always-on technology that fuels our world became the source and organizing principle of our children's learning? What if, instead of seeing school the way we've known it, we saw it for what our children dreamed it might be: a big, delicious video game?
It is a radical proposition, sure. But during an era in which just about everything is downloadable and remixable, when children are frequently more digitally savvy than the adults around them, it's perhaps not so crazy to think that schools -- or at least one school, anyway -- might try to remix our assumptions about how to reach and educate those children. What makes Quest to Learn unique is not so much that it has been loaded with laptops or even that it bills itself expressly as a home for ''digital kids,'' but rather that it is the brainchild of a professional game designer named Katie Salen. Salen, like many people interested in education, has spent a lot of time thinking about whether there is a way to make learning feel simultaneously more relevant to students and more connected to the world beyond school. And the answer, as she sees it, lies in games.
Quest to Learn is organized specifically around the idea that digital games are central to the lives of today's children and also increasingly, as their speed and capability grow, powerful tools for intellectual exploration. Salen, a professor of design and technology at Parsons the New School for Design, also directs a research-based organization called Institute of Play, which examines the connections between games and learning. Working with Robert Torres, a learning scientist who is a former school principal, and a small team of curriculum and game designers, Salen spent two years planning Quest to Learn in conjunction with the education-reform group New Visions for Public Schools. Her work was financed by a research grant from the MacArthur Foundation, which is pouring $50 million into exploring the possibilities of digital media and learning in a variety of settings nationwide. The school was approved by New York City's schools chancellor, Joel Klein, as one of a handful of ''demonstration sites'' for innovative technology-based instructional methods and is part of a larger effort on the city's part to create and experiment with new models for schools.
Quest to Learn is now beginning its second year, with about 145 sixth and seventh graders, all of whom were admitted by a districtwide lottery. (The intention is to add a grade level each year until it is a 6th-through-12th-grade school; Quest to Learn recently relocated to a larger but equally unmodern building in Chelsea.) Operating on a public-school budget but powered by additional grants from the MacArthur Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, among others, it is a well-financed and carefully watched educational experiment concerning children, video games and the thrumming, largely unexplored force field between them.
Salen and Torres are at the forefront of a small but increasingly influential group of education specialists who believe that going to school can and should be more like playing a game, which is to say it could be made more participatory, more immersive and also, well, fun. Nearly every aspect of life at Quest to Learn is thus designed to be gamelike, even when it doesn't involve using a computer. Students don't receive grades but rather achieve levels of expertise, denoted on their report cards as ''pre-novice,'' ''novice,'' ''apprentice,'' ''senior'' and ''master.'' They are enlisted to do things like defeat villains and lend a hand to struggling aliens, mostly by working in groups to overcome multifaceted challenges, all created by a collection of behind-the-scenes game designers. The principles are similar to those used in problem-based learning, a more established educational method in which students collaborate to tackle broad, open-ended problems, with a teacher providing guidance though not necessarily a lot of instruction. But at Quest to Learn, the problems have been expertly aerated with fantasy.
Once it has been worked over by game designers, a lesson doesn't look like a lesson anymore. It is now a quest. And while students at the school are put through the usual rigors of studying pre-algebra, basic physics, ancient civilizations and writing, they do it inside interdisciplinary classes with names like Codeworlds -- a hybrid of math and English class -- where the quests blend skills from different subject areas. Students have been called upon to balance the budget and brainstorm business ideas for an imaginary community called Creepytown, for example, and to design architectural blueprints for a village of bumbling little creatures called the Troggles. There are elements of the school's curriculum that look familiar -- nightly independent reading assignments, weekly reading-comprehension packets and plenty of work with pencils and paper -- and others that don't. Quest to Learn students record podcasts, film and edit videos, play video games, blog avidly and occasionally receive video messages from aliens.
They also spend significant time building their own games. Sometimes they design board games using cardboard and markers and ungodly amounts of tape. Most of the time, though, they invent games for the computer. Salen's theory goes like this: building a game -- even the kind of simple game a sixth grader might build -- is equivalent to building a miniworld, a dynamic system governed by a set of rules, complete with challenges, obstacles and goals. At its best, game design can be an interdisciplinary exercise involving math, writing, art, computer programming, deductive reasoning and critical thinking skills. If children can build, play and understand games that work, it's possible that someday they will understand and design systems that work. And the world is full of complicated systems.
Does this educational approach actually work? And is it something that can, or should, find its way into schools in other parts of the country? As we fret about the perils of multitasking and digital distraction in adult life, the question arises: should a school provide practice with or relief from those things? It is still too early to say. But the introduction of Quest to Learn is tied to a continuing and sometimes heated national dialogue about what skills today's learners most need to prepare them for success in a rapidly evolving, digitally mediated world. There is, at least, growing support for experimentation: in March, Arne Duncan, the secretary of education, released a draft National Educational Technology Plan that reads a bit like a manifesto for change, proposing among other things that the full force of technology be leveraged to meet ''aggressive goals'' and ''grand'' challenges, including increasing the percentage of the population that graduates from college to 60 percent from 39 percent in the next 10 years. What it takes to get there, the report suggests, is a ''new kind of R.& D. for education'' that encourages bold ideas and ''high risk/high gain'' endeavors -- possibly even a school built around aliens, villains and video games.
SALEN IS 43, reddish-haired, hyperorganized and a quirky dresser. Some would consider her an unlikely prophet when it comes to education. Among Quest to Learn students, she is clearly beloved. Unlike most authority figures they know, she is a gifted player of Guitar Hero and has been spotted playing her Nintendo DSi on the subway. Until a few years ago she knew little about educational pedagogy and was instead immersed in doing things like converting an ice-cream truck into a mobile karaoke unit that traveled around San Jose, Calif., with a man dressed as a squirrel dispensing free frozen treats and encouraging city residents to pick up a microphone and belt out tunes. This was a community-building sort of game -- or as Salen describes it, ''an interactive play-based experience'' -- as was the race she helped design in Minneapolis and St. Paul, in which randomly organized groups of people carried 25-foot-high inflatable playing pieces modeled after those used in the board game Sorry through the streets of the cities.
A game, as Salen sees it, is really just a ''designed experience,'' in which a participant is motivated to achieve a goal while operating inside a prescribed system of boundaries and rules. In this way, school itself is one giant designed experience. It could be viewed, in fact, as the biggest and most important game any child will ever play. To this end, Quest to Learn has three full-time game designers supporting the work of the school's 11 teachers -- a ratio that reflects a trend more familiar to the business world, where designers and design-thinking have ascended to new and voguish heights.
Salen, like many designers, views things in terms of their ideal potential and also the physical space they occupy. She is thus less apt to refer to a school as ''school'' but rather as a ''learning space'' or a ''discovery space'' or sometimes as a ''possibility space.'' She and her colleagues are wrapped up in the idea that technology is doing for learning what it has done for pretty much every other aspect of living, which is to say that it has dismantled the walls between spaces. As anyone who has ever checked e-mail from a bathroom stall or browsed eBay from a chairlift can attest, what once occurred in just one space now happens in practically every space. This has revolutionized design, media, most workplaces and especially the lives of children, who routinely tap into vast social and information pools outside school. Yet, generally speaking, it has hardly touched public education.
The traditional school structure strikes Salen as ''weird.'' ''You go to a math class, and that is the only place math is happening, and you are supposed to learn math just in that one space,'' she told me one day, sitting in the small room at the school that served as Quest to Learn's operational headquarters. She was dressed in a purple skirt with a hot pink scarf knotted around her neck. ''There's been this assumption that school is the only place that learning is happening, that everything a kid is supposed to know is delivered between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., and it happens in the confines of a building,'' she said. ''But the fact is that kids are doing a lot of interesting learning outside of school. We acknowledge that, and we are trying to bring that into their learning here.''
WAITING IN THE HALLWAY LINE to go into Sports for the Mind class one day last winter, I met a boy named Kai Goree. He was dressed in a red T-shirt, jeans and sneakers. He had a puckish mouth, vivid brown eyes and short dark hair, pieces of which had been dyed in vibrant shingles of blue and green, not unlike what you might expect to find on the roof of a fairy-tale house.
Kai was 11. He sometimes got into trouble with teachers for talking too much. In the next 10 minutes, as we wandered into class and found seats and waited for everybody else to settle in, plus a few minutes beyond that, Kai relayed the following bits of information: he lived with his parents and older brother in an apartment on East 56th Street. He was a huge fan of professional wrestling. At home he sometimes filmed and edited his own wrestling-news commentaries or demonstrated wrestling moves on a giant plush gorilla he had named Green Gangsta. Then he put them on YouTube, where he had several personal channels. At home, his family had a ''very awesome big computer.'' He also had an Android phone, but at that point was lusting after a Flip camera and a MacBook as well. He preferred OS X, but his dad, alas, was ''a die-hard Windows fan,'' so the prospects for a Mac were unclear. If I was interested, I could follow him on Twitter. (Sample post from Kai: ''I AM SO ANGRY. My mom is not letting me get a coolatta from dunkin donuts'') He used to have a blog, but it took too much time so he dropped it.
What he cared about most was games. ''Games and games and games,'' he said. He had been playing games since he was about 18 months old, when his mother, who is a college professor, introduced him to a computer game called Reader Rabbit, intended to teach literacy skills. Like many of his friends, as he grew, he migrated from educational computer games to hand-held games to the Xbox 360.
At the start of middle school, Kai was almost a full decade into his digital life. This might have put him slightly ahead of his peers, but also, arguably, it made him more like the sixth grader of the near future. Research shows that, on average, children who have access to computers have mastered pointing and clicking with a mouse by the time they are 31/2. They are also, thanks in part to mobile-phone apps, playing more games earlier in life. According to research by the Joan Ganz Cooney Center, an arm of the Sesame Workshop that explores the educational potential of interactive media, 60 percent of the top-selling iPhone apps on the education store are made for toddlers and preschoolers.
In the evenings, once he met the requirements for parental face time and homework, Kai could be found riding an armored dune buggy around a post-apocalyptic African landscape, blasting his machine gun at squads of alien jackals (Halo 3) or catching and juking for a touchdown (Madden NFL 09) or maybe adding wikki wikki scratches to a Jay-Z tune (DJ Hero). Sometimes he fired up the family Wii and did virtually assisted yoga. I came to learn that Kai could dissect, analyze and recommend video games with the acuity of a French sommelier. He was waiting anxiously, he said, to hear back from ''some people at Lucas'' who may or may not use him to beta test a multiplayer Star Wars game that wasn't yet on the market.
Kai's passion for games was unusual, but only a little. Earlier this year, the Kaiser Family Foundation released the results of a national survey in which 60 percent of children 8 to 18 reported that a typical day included playing games on hand-held or console devices. Their average daily investment was about two hours. According to Kaiser's data, the percentage of children playing digital games has increased by more than 50 percent in the last 10 years, and the amount of time they spend playing games has almost doubled. This follows research showing that the more time children spend playing video games, the less time they spend on homework. For educators, it's a sorry equation and one that mirrors a larger paradox when it comes to the divergent and often competing paths of children and their schools.
Even as technology spending in K-12 public education has risen steadily in the last 20 years, student performance -- as measured by test results -- has improved only incrementally. Meanwhile, children are proving to be wildly adaptive when it comes to using media outside school. They are fervently making YouTube videos, piloting avatars through complex game scenarios, sampling music, lighting up social networks and inventing or retooling (or purists would say, bludgeoning) language so that it better suits the text-messaging pay plan on their cellphones, only to show up to school to find cellphones outlawed, Internet access filtered and computers partitioned off from the rest of the classroom -- at least in many cases. Michael H. Levine, who directs the Joan Ganz Cooney Center, acknowledges the conundrum. While there may be sound reasons behind limiting things like Internet browsing and social networking at school, he says, it does little to teach students how to live in the 21st century. It also may contribute to a broader relevancy issue. A 2006 study financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation set out to examine the reasons that almost a third of American public-high-school students fail to graduate with their class. Researchers surveyed high-school dropouts in 25 cities, suburbs and small towns across the country, where they were told again and again that school was boring. The final report recommended, among other things, that educators take steps to ''make school more relevant and engaging.''
One way to do this, according to Levine, would be to stop looking so critically at the way children use media and to start exploring how that energy might best be harnessed to help drive them academically. ''Kids are literally wearing digital media,'' he says. ''It's present everywhere in their lives, except for in the learning environment.'' A game-based approach like that used at Quest to Learn shows a lot of promise, he says, in part because it capitalizes on something kids already love. He is careful to note that there will be ''huge challenges'' in bringing the idea to schools nationally. Clearly, not every community is going to have the money for interactive whiteboards, laptops and PlayStation consoles. Someone will also need to figure out how to train teachers, develop curriculums, establish assessment measures and decide to what extent the focus on systems thinking and design skills used in game-based learning should be tied to common standards -- and win over parents. ''Odds are it will take a long time,'' Levine says. ''But I don't know what the alternative is. My view of it is that we will never get to the holy land in terms of educational performance unless we do something about the engagement factor.''
Often, watching the students and teachers at Quest to Learn, I was struck by how enviably resource-rich the school was, with its game designers and curriculum specialists and a full-time technologist wheeling carts of netbooks up and down the hallway. Salen recently told me that she is hoping to find a corner of the school where she can set up Rock Band -- a video game in which users play drums, guitar and bass -- ''for teachers to unwind around.'' The school functioned with the intensity of a high-stakes start-up. It was clear the staff members worked long hours. Still, if Quest to Learn was a ''possibility space'' -- a sort of laboratory for the future of learning -- you could also see how those possibilities might feel entirely out of reach to an educator working in a more typically cash-strapped, understaffed school.
Yet with the federal government focusing more on innovation, and given the deep pockets of similarly focused corporate foundations, it may be feasible to implement game-based learning, even modestly, into more schools. But not before it has been proved to work. Quest to Learn students who took federally mandated standardized tests last spring scored on average no better and no worse than other sixth graders in their district, according to Elisa Aragon, the school's executive director. Valerie Shute, an assessment specialist in the educational psychology and learning systems department at Florida State University, is working on a MacArthur-financed effort to develop and test new assessment measures for Quest to Learn, which are meant to look at progress in areas like systems thinking, teamwork and time management. The federal government is likewise sponsoring an overhaul of standardized tests to be introduced in the 2014-2015 school year, with added emphasis on ''higher order'' thinking and problem-solving skills.
Quest to Learn's most innovative piece of technology was set up in a corner of one classroom, looking something like an extremely wired stage set. This was the school's $18,000 Smallab, which stands for ''situated multimedia art learning lab,'' a system now being used in a handful of schools and museums around the country. Created by a team led by David Birchfield, a media artist at Arizona State University, it is a 3-D learning environment, or in designspeak, a ''hybrid physical-digital space.''
In Smallab sessions, students hold wands and Sputnik-like orbs whose movements are picked up by 12 scaffold-mounted motion-capture cameras and have an immediate effect inside the game space, which is beamed from a nearby computer onto the floor via overhead projector. It is a little bit like playing a multiplayer Wii game while standing inside the game instead of in front of it. Students can thus learn chemical titration by pushing king-size molecules around the virtual space. They can study geology by building and shifting digital layers of sediment and fossils on the classroom floor or explore complementary and supplementary angles by racing the clock to move a giant virtual protractor around the floor.
As new as the Smallab concept is, it is already showing promise when it comes to improving learning results: Birchfield and his colleagues say that in a small 2009 study, they found that at-risk ninth graders in earth sciences scored consistently and significantly higher on content-area tests when they had also done Smallab exercises. A second study compared the Smallab approach with traditional hands-on lab experimentation, with the group that used mixed-reality again showing greater retention and mastery. As it is more generally with games, the cognitive elements at work are not entirely understood, but they are of great interest to a growing number of learning scientists. Did the students learn more using digital mixed-reality because the process was more physical than hearing a classroom lecture or performing a lab experiment? Because it was more collaborative or more visual? Or was it simply because it seemed novel and more fun?
HERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES between Kai and me: Kai hates Justin Bieber whereas I only dislike him. Kai sends and receives about 50 text messages a day. My average is about 4. My idea of leisure involves wandering aimlessly and anonymously through the local bookstore whereas Kai -- ''not a fan of books'' -- can be found hanging around the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue, where he is on a first-name basis with employees. When I am sick with a cold, I sit at home flipping through magazines and not really wanting to be seen by anyone. When Kai is sick with a cold, he sits at home and makes YouTube videos. (''If I sneeze during this video,'' he tells the camera, ''don't yell at me.'') We also feel very differently, it turns out, about the game Halo. Kai sees it as having amazing graphics and a great story line and violence, ''but only against aliens,'' he says. I see it mostly as violent.
One night at Kai's apartment, we turned on the Xbox and played Halo 3 as teammates. He played the role of Master Chief, the ultimate superwarrior, and I was a friendly alien who liked to fight. It started like this: I sat on the couch, and Kai sat on the floor in front of the TV. He said, ''You get the machine gun, and I'll drive the car.'' I'm not really sure what happened after that. I would call it a nine-minute-long, jackhammering bloodbath, in which we (me poorly, Kai deftly) killed a lot of bad aliens until my lack of experience almost cost our team the game, and -- a little sweaty and yes, totally excited -- I handed my controller off to Kai's 14-year-old brother, Sam.
It was, for me, a reminder of how confusing it can be to think about video games and schools in the same frame. Not only has excessive gaming -- much like excessive TV watching -- been associated with obesity and depression, but playing violent games has been linked in some studies to an increase in aggressive behavior. Advocates of game-based learning concede that these games can be spectacularly gory, amoral and loud, even when they are artful and complicated. They like to point out that the majority of games sold commercially are not particularly violent and are rated ''E'' -- for ''everyone.''
And then this: Brain researchers have found that playing first-person shooter games like Call of Duty does seem to have some neurological benefits, including improving peripheral vision and the ability to focus attention. The playing of shooter games has also been shown to enhance something called visual-spatial thinking -- for example, the ability to rotate objects in one's mind -- which, it turns out, is a cognitive building block for understanding concepts in science and engineering. Women, who tend to score lower when tested for visual-spatial skills, apparently gain more from virtual machine-gun outings than men: a 2007 study done at the University of Toronto showed that women who played just 10 hours of an action-oriented video game (Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault) not only improved their spatial attention and mental-rotation abilities more significantly than their male counterparts, but the game-play also appeared to substantially reduce any sex-related gaps in visual-spatial thinking abilities. Five months later, the effects still held. (Bad news for pacifists: a control group that played a stimulating but nonviolent 3-D video puzzle game showed no measurable improvement.)
Unsurprisingly, no one I spoke with who works in the field of games and learning says that first-person shooter games are the key to building future scientists and engineers. One topic under discussion is the broader question of ''transfer,'' whether a skill developed by playing a game actually translates to improved abilities in other areas. They also note that we are only just beginning to tease apart the mechanisms that make game play so powerful. And inside those mechanisms, there is at least potential to advance our country's educational aims -- if only we can sort out how we feel about games. Even the first family has sent mixed messages: President Obama has criticized video games for displacing family time and physical activity -- urging parents, for example, to ''turn off the TV, put away the video games and read to your child'' -- but he has also encouraged the development of new games to bolster the all-important science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills in young Americans. In March, Michelle Obama helped introduce a government-sponsored design contest to reward those who create mobile-phone games and apps to combat obesity, lamenting at a national Parent Teacher Association conference that ''we know our kids spend way too much time with these games,'' but that at least the time could be spent more productively. The cognitive dissonance is likely familiar to any parent: she has also admitted, cheerfully, to owning a Wii.
WHEN IT COMES TO CAPTURING and keeping the attention of children, game designers appear to be getting something right that schools, in many cases, are getting wrong. James Paul Gee, a professor of literacy studies at Arizona State University who grew interested in video games when his son began playing them years ago, has written several seminal books on the power of video games to inspire learning. He says that in working through the levels of a complex game, a person is decoding its ''internal design grammar'' and that this is a form of critical thinking. ''A game is nothing but a set of problems to solve,'' Gee says. Its design often pushes players to explore, take risks, role-play and strategize -- in other words putting a game's informational content to use. Gee has advocated for years that our definition of ''literacy'' needs to be widened to better suit the times. Where a book provides knowledge, Gee says, a good game can provide a learner with knowledge and also experience solving problems using that knowledge.
Slowly, this idea has won some unlikely converts. The retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor recently introduced a Web site called iCivics, which features a series of interactive games meant to animate and revive the lost art of learning civics. ''She was relatively hostile toward games,'' says Gee, who collaborated with her on the project, ''and now she's a fan.'' E. O. Wilson, the renowned Harvard evolutionary biologist, has lauded digital games for their ability to immerse and challenge players in vivid, virtual environments. ''I think games are the future in education,'' Wilson said in an interview with the game designer Will Wright last year. ''We're going through a rapid transition now. We're about to leave print and textbooks behind.''
In a speech given the day before the start of the 2009 G-20 economic summit, Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google, offered his own tacit approval, suggesting that playing video games, especially online multiplayer games, fosters collaboration, and that collaboration, in turn, fosters innovation -- making it good training for a career in technology. ''Everything in the future online is going to look like a multiplayer game,'' Schmidt said. ''If I were 15 years old, that's what I'd be doing right now.''
All this goes back to the debate over what constitutes ''21st-century skills.'' How do schools manage to teach new media without letting go of old media? Is it possible to teach game design and still find time for ''The Catcher in the Rye''? One afternoon at Quest to Learn, I sat with Al Doyle in an empty office. Doyle had been teaching Sports for the Mind for only a few months -- and at the end of the school year, he would end up leaving Quest to Learn to teach game design at a private school elsewhere in Manhattan -- but the experience was causing him to think differently about what schools should be teaching. His students were building 3-D computer games and had also just finished a unit on podcasting. ''Ten years ago, it would have taken a week to get kids to learn the difference between 'save' and 'save as,' '' he said. ''Now I show them GarageBand'' -- a digital audio sequencer produced by Apple -- ''and five minutes later they're recording and editing sound.'' Doyle made a point that others had also made: whatever digital fluidity his students possessed, it hadn't been taught to them, at least not by adults.
Here, perhaps, was a paradigm shift. As Doyle saw it, his role was moving from teaching toward facilitating, building upon learning being done outside school. He talked about all the wasted energy that goes into teaching things that students don't need so much anymore, thanks to the tools now available to them. Why memorize the 50 states and their capitals? Why, in the age of Google and pocket computers, memorize anything? ''Handwriting?'' Doyle said. ''That's a 20th-century skill.'' Realizing this sounded radical, he amended his thought, saying that students should learn to write, but that keyboarding was far more important. He took aim at spelling, calling it ''outmoded.'' Then he went back to podcasting, saying that after a student has written, revised, scripted and recorded a podcast, ''it's just as valid as writing an essay.''
I must have been wearing the shocked expression of an old-guard English major, because Doyle tried to put a finer point on it. ''We feel like we're preparing these kids to be producers of media -- whether they become graphic designers, video designers, journalists, publishers, communicators, bloggers, whatever,'' he said. ''The goal is that they're comfortable expressing themselves in any media, whether it's video, audio, podcast, the written word, the spoken word or the animated feature.'' He added: ''Game design is the platform that we can hook them into because this is where they live. Video games are more important to them than film, than broadcast television, than journalism. This is their medium. Games are this generation's rock and roll.''
SPEND TIME AT a middle school -- even a hyperinnovative one like Quest to Learn -- and one thing becomes immediately apparent: Being a sixth grader is a timeless art. Kids chew gum when they're not supposed to. They ask for hugs from teachers when they need them. They get rowdy in gym class, dip Oreos in their chocolate-milk cartons at lunch, pick bits of food out of their braces and shout things like, ''Hey, your epidermis is showing!'' There is little they like to do quietly.
''I am really sorry it is taking you so long to sit in your chairs today,'' an aggrieved Doyle was calling over the din one morning at the start of class. In the brief quiet that followed, he announced that, connected to work they were doing on ancient architecture, each student was to design a game that took place inside either a labyrinth, a pyramid or a cave. This would happen using an online game-making platform called Gamestar Mechanic, which was developed by Katie Salen and a team and is soon to be sold commercially. The platform allows users to learn game-making skills without being versed in programming language.
A hand shot up. It was Ellisa, a diminutive girl who wore her hair in a giant ponytailed puff on one side of her head. ''Al, can I do a game with a cave, a pyramid and a labyrinth?''
''Sorry, you may not.''
Another hand. ''What about a pyramid with a labyrinth inside of it?''
Doyle shook his head. ''Just one,'' he said.
Sitting in front of laptops, the students started in on their game-building, each one beginning with a blank screen. They created borders, paths and obstacles by dragging and dropping small cubes from a menu. They chose an animated sprite to serve as a game's protagonist. They picked enemy sprites and set them marching in various patterns around the screen. They wrote the text that introduced the game and the text that flashed when a player reaches a new level. (''If the entrance to your cave is being guarded by a bear or a woolly mammoth,'' said Doyle, sounding teacherly, ''you have to tell us it's a bear or a woolly mammoth.'') They added a variety of rewards and punishments. If the game seemed too easy, they made it harder. If the game seemed too hard, they made it easier. Earlier that day, I watched a girl named Maya make a game. She created a labyrinth, changed all the colors, swapped enemies in and out, changed the background, changed the music and finally set the game's timer to 90 seconds. Then she played her game and finished it in 75. She adjusted the timer to 75 seconds and played again, this time losing. Finally, she set the timer at 80 and beat the game, but only just barely, at which point she declared the whole thing perfect.
The work appeared simple, but the challenge was evident. Twenty minutes in, the Sports for the Mind classroom was hushed but for the sound of keyboards being pounded and a faint arcadelike cacophony of poinging and bleeping over the syncopated pulse of game music. That night for homework, they would play one another's games and write up constructive critiques.
The gold standard in class, I was told by nearly every student I spoke with, was to create a game that was hard to beat but harder still to quit. Kai was sitting in one corner working on a game he named What the Cave. It was teeming with robot enemies. ''The whole point,'' Kai said, ''is you want your game to be hard, but you want it to be good.'' He studied his screen for a moment. Then using his mouse, he deftly deleted a row of enemies. ''What you want,'' he said finally, ''is good-hard.''
The language of gamers is, when you begin to decipher it, the language of strivers. People who play video games speak enthusiastically about ''leveling up'' and are always shooting for the epic win. Getting to the end of even a supposedly simple video game can take 15 or more hours of play time, and it almost always involves failure -- lots and lots of failure.
This concept is something that Will Wright, who is best known for designing the Sims game franchise and the 2008 evolution-related game Spore, refers to as ''failure-based learning,'' in which failure is brief, surmountable, often exciting and therefore not scary. A well-built game is, in essence, a series of short-term feedback loops, delivering assessment in small, frequent doses. This in the end may be both more palatable and also more instructive to someone trying to learn. According to Ntiedo Etuk, the chief executive of Tabula Digita, which designs computer games that are now being used in roughly 1,200 schools around the country, children who persist in playing a game are demonstrating a valuable educational ideal. ''They play for five minutes and they lose,'' he says. ''They play for 10 minutes and they lose. They'll go back and do it a hundred times. They'll fail until they win.'' He adds: ''Failure in an academic environment is depressing. Failure in a video game is pleasant. It's completely aspirational.''
It is also, says James Paul Gee, antithetical to the governing reality of today's public schools. ''If you think about kids in school -- especially in our testing regime -- both the teacher and the student think that failure will lead to disaster,'' he says. ''That's pretty much a guarantee that you'll never get to truly deep learning.'' Gee and others in the games-and-learning field have suggested that someday, if we choose to channel our resources into developing more and better games for use in classrooms, the games themselves could feasibly replace tests altogether. Students, by virtue of making it through the escalating levels of a game that teaches, say, the principles of quantum physics, will demonstrate their mastery simply by finishing the game. Or, as Gee says: ''Think about it: if I make it through every level of Halo, do you really need to give me a test to see if I know everything it takes to get through every level of Halo?''
One day last spring, Jan Plass, a professor of educational communication and technology at New York University, and I were sitting in a classroom at the Urban Assembly Institute of Math and Science for Young Women, a girls-only public middle school in Brooklyn, where he and several graduate students were conducting research. Plass works at an organization called the Games for Learning Institute, directed by Ken Perlin, an N.Y.U. computer-science professor, that is dedicated to exploring the granular details of what makes games so mesmerizing and effective for learning.
We were watching a small group of sixth-to-eighth-grade girls play a relatively low-tech math game on a series of laptops. The girls played in pairs, solving equations to score points. All the while, the laptops' built-in cameras recorded their voices and faces, while an imbedded piece of software tracked their movements inside the game. What Plass and his research team were hoping to find inside this data -- which was being collected at 12 New York schools -- were answers about whether children learn more when playing individually or collaboratively. (In order to measure progress, researchers gave the students tests before and after the game playing.)
Two of the girls were talking and pointing at the screen. ''They're spending time discussing how to solve the problem,'' Plass said in a low voice. ''They might not solve as many problems. But the question for us is whether the conversation adds to the learning, versus if they spent their time on more practice. Does discourse result in deeper processing?''
A question like this is, of course, as old as Socrates and not at all limited to game-oriented learning. But given that digital games like those designed by Plass and his colleagues allow researchers to capture and examine a student's second-by-second decision-making, they offer what seem to be uniquely refined opportunities to peer into the cognitive process. What they are studying, Plass said, is the science behind focused engagement -- a psychological phenomenon known as ''flow.''
Much of this work is still in its infancy. Neuroscientists have connected game play to the production of dopamine, a powerful neurotransmitter central to the brain's reward-seeking system and thought to drive motivation and memory processing (and more negatively, addictive behaviors) -- all of which could have implications for how, when and what type of games should be used to advance children's learning. But as it is with just about everything involving teaching and learning, there are no simple answers. Games, for example, appear to trigger greater dopamine releases in men than women, which could mean that game-based learning is more effective with boys than girls. Or, says Plass, it could be a matter of design: ideally, games can be built in such a way that they adapt to the individual learning styles of their players.
Paul Howard-Jones, a neuroscientist who teaches in the graduate school of education at the University of Bristol in Britain and coordinates the NeuroEducational Research Network, says that dopamine sends a ''ready to learn'' signal to the brain, essentially priming it to receive new information pleasurably. His research has shown that children's engagement levels are higher when they are anticipating a reward but cannot predict whether they will get it -- or, as Howard-Jones put it to me, ''when you move from a conventional educational atmosphere to something that more resembles sport.'' He is careful to add that games are not meant to supplant teachers nor undermine the value of more traditional learning. ''Children need to learn how to read a book,'' he says. ''They need to learn how to ask questions.'' But as our understanding of both cognitive science and game design continues to advance, he says that game play will find a central place inside schools. ''I think in 30 years' time,'' he says, ''we will marvel that we ever tried to deliver a curriculum without gaming.''
One day last winter, I watched students at Quest to Learn playing with a different sort of technological tool -- a newly introduced online social network for the school that had been built by Salen and her team of designers and was open to students, staff members and parents. The network, called Being Me, looked like a starter Facebook. In the coming weeks, mostly through the school's wellness class, students would work on learning things like how to tag photos, update their status, credit the work of others, comment meaningfully on blog posts and navigate the complex politics of ''friending.'' It was another effort on the school's part to look at the things kids are already doing -- social networking, playing video games, tinkering with digital media -- and try to help them do it with more thought and purpose, to recognize both their role and their influence inside a larger system.
Being Me had been online for just one day, but it was already zinging with activity, as most of the students seemed to have logged on overnight. Isabel posted a video of herself riding a horse. Clyde put up a survey querying everyone on whether PlayStation 3 was better than Xbox 360. Charles blogged about a new restaurant he tried. (''I had the Caprese pizza. The tomato had a lot of flavor.'') Kai posted a video -- now being watched by practically everyone in the class -- of himself dressed in a pink wig and a red raincoat, pretending to be a girl he called ''Heather.'' Comments began to pile up. ''Cool beans,'' a girl sitting nearby wrote. Then another from a boy named Nuridin: ''Dude, stop making me die over here. LOL.''
Seeing this as learning required a kind of leap -- the same way it required a leap to watch students build digital mazes and load them with plinking cartoon sprites and imagine it might make them more successful as future adults -- that it would possibly help them untangle and rebuild whatever broken systems we will have left for them. The electric pencil sharpener buzzed from a corner.
I watched a long-haired kid named Akahr pull up his profile on Being Me and spend a moment pondering what he would do for his first official status update. By design of the network, every status update began with the words ''I am . . .'' after which students could choose from an array of designated verbs and objects listed on drop-down menus. Most of the sixth graders were mixing and matching with a kind of frenzied abandon, playfully testing every last variation, posting their updates and waiting for a peal of laughter from somewhere in the classroom -- a sign their status had been read. There was, ''I am dancing Godzilla'' and ''I am hugging my bed.'' Akhar clicked on his menu and pondered his options. Around the classroom, there were students respecting eggs and creating soy sauce and reading glitter and looking for Paris. Was this learning or a distraction from learning? Serious or not serious? Or was it possible, somehow, that it was both? Word by word, Akahr made his choices: ''I am . . . imagining . . . the future.''

HEADLINE: Fibbing With Numbers

PROOFINESS
The Dark Arts of Mathematical Deception
By Charles Seife
295 pp. Viking. $25.95
Charles Seife is steaming mad about all the ways that numbers are being twisted to erode our democracy. We're used to being lied to with words (''I am not a crook''; ''I did not have sexual relations with that woman''). But numbers? They're supposed to be cold, hard and objective. Numbers don't lie, and they brook no argument. They're the best kind of facts we have.
And that's precisely why they can be so powerfully, persuasively misleading, as Seife argues in his passionate new book, ''Proofiness.'' Seife, a veteran science writer who teaches journalism at New York University, examines the many ways that people fudge with numbers, sometimes just to sell more moisturizer but also to ruin our economy, rig our elections, convict the innocent and undercount the needy. Many of his stories would be darkly funny if they weren't so infuriating. 
Although Seife never says so explicitly, the book's title alludes to ''truthiness'' -- the Word of the Year in 2005, according to the American Dialect Society, which defined it as ''the quality of preferring concepts or facts one wishes to be true, rather than concepts or facts known to be true.'' The term was popularized by Stephen Colbert in the first episode of ''The Colbert Report.'' The numerical cousin of truthiness is proofiness: ''the art of using bogus mathematical arguments to prove something that you know in your heart is true -- even when it's not.''
Seife emphasizes that numbers impress us. They carry authority. Joe McCarthy, for example, didn't simply allege that the government was infested with Communists; he held up a sheaf of papers and claimed it contained the names of 205 members of the Communist Party working in the State Department. The specificity of the accusation made it seem more believable. So what if the number soon went up to 207, then shrank to 57 a day later when McCarthy wrote to President Truman? What mattered is that the numbers intimidated McCarthy's critics. As it turned out, he never had any list and couldn't identify a single Communist working in the State Department. None of that stopped him from rising to national prominence on the back of his numerical lies.
Falsifying numbers is the crudest form of proofiness. Seife lays out a rogues' gallery of more subtle deceptions. ''Potemkin numbers'' are phony statistics based on erroneous or nonexistent calculations. Justice Antonin Scalia's assertion that only 0.027 percent of convicted felons are wrongly imprisoned was a Potemkin number derived from a prosecutor's back-of-the-envelope estimate; more careful studies suggest the rate might be between 3 and 5 percent.
''Disestimation'' involves ascribing too much meaning to a measurement, relative to the uncertainties and errors inherent in it. In the most provocative and detailed part of the book, Seife analyzes the recounting process in the astonishingly close 2008 Minnesota Senate race between Norm Coleman and Al Franken. The winner, he claims, should have been decided by a coin flip; anything else is disestimation, considering that the observed errors in counting the votes were always much larger than the number of votes (roughly 200 to 300) separating the two candidates.
''Comparing apples and oranges'' is another perennial favorite. The conservative Blue Dog Democrats indulged in it when they accused the Bush administration of borrowing more money from foreign governments in four years than had all the previous administrations in our nation's history, combined. True enough, but only if one conveniently forgets to correct for inflation.
Seife is evenhanded about exposing the proofiness on both sides of the political aisle, though we all know who's responsible for a vast majority of it: the other side.
He calls Al Gore to task for ''cherry-picking'' data about global warming. Although Seife doesn't dispute that the warming is real and that human activities are to blame for a sizable portion of it, he chastises Gore for showing terrifying simulations of what would happen to Florida and Louisiana if sea levels were to rise by 20 feet, as could occur if the ice sheets in Greenland or West Antarctica were to melt almost completely. That possibility, while not out of the question, is generally considered an unlikely ''very-worst-case'' scenario, Seife writes.
Meanwhile, the Bush administration committed a more insidious form of proofiness when it crowed, in 2004, that its tax cuts would save the average family $1,586. This is technically correct, but deliberately misleading -- a trick that Seife calls ''apple polishing.'' (Again with the fruit!) The average is the wrong measure to use when a set of numbers contains extreme outliers -- in this case, the whopping refunds received by a very few, very wealthy families. In such situations, the average is far from typical. That's why, paradoxical as it might seem, most families received less than $650.
In one of the book's lighter moments, Seife even looks askance at the wholesome folks at Quaker Oats, who in addition to selling a ''bland and relatively unappetizing product'' once presented a graph that gave the visual impression that their ''barely digestible oat fiber'' was a ''medicinal vacuum cleaner'' that would reduce your cholesterol far more than it actually does. For the most part, though, he is deadly serious. A few other recent books have explored how easily we can be deceived -- or deceive ourselves -- with numbers. But ''Proofiness'' reveals the truly corrosive effects on a society awash in numerical mendacity. This is more than a math book; it's an eye-opening civics lesson.

HEADLINE: Touching Off Debate, Missouri Tells Judges Cost of Sentences

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Emma Graves Fitzsimmons contributed reporting from Chicago.

 BODY:
ST. LOUIS -- When judges here sentence convicted criminals, a new and unusual variable is available for them to consider: what a given punishment will cost the State of Missouri.
For someone convicted of endangering the welfare of a child, for instance, a judge might now learn that a three-year prison sentence would run more than $37,000 while probation would cost $6,770. A second-degree robber, a judge could be told, would carry a price tag of less than $9,000 for five years of intensive probation, but more than $50,000 for a comparable prison sentence and parole afterward. The bill for a murderer's 30-year prison term: $504,690.
Legal experts say no other state systematically provides such information to judges, a practice put into effect here last month by the state's sentencing advisory commission, an appointed board that offers guidance on criminal sentencing.
The practice has touched off a sharp debate. It has been lauded nationally by a disparate group of defense lawyers and fiscal conservatives, who consider it an overdue tool that will force judges to ponder alternatives to prison more seriously. 
But critics -- prosecutors especially -- dismiss the idea as unseemly. They say that the cost of punishment is an irrelevant consideration when deciding a criminal's fate and that there is a risk of overlooking the larger social costs of crime.
''Justice isn't subject to a mathematical formula,'' said Robert P. McCulloch, the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County.
The intent behind the cost estimates, he said, is transparent: to pressure judges, in the face of big bills, into sending fewer people to prison.
''There is no average case,'' Mr. McCulloch said. ''Every case is an individual case, and every victim has the right to have each case viewed individually, and every defendant has that right.''
Supporters, however, say judges would never focus exclusively on the cost of a sentence or turn their responsibilities of judgment into a numerical equation.
''This is one of a thousand things we look at -- about the tip of a dog's tail, it's such a small thing,'' said Judge Gary Oxenhandler, presiding judge in the 13th Judicial Circuit Court and a member of the sentencing commission. ''But it is almost foolish not to look at it. We live in a what's-it-going-to-cost? society now.''
The shift here comes at a dire time for criminal justice budgets around the country, as states try to navigate conflicting, politically charged demands: to keep people safe and also cut costs. Michigan has closed prisons. Arizona considered putting its prison system under private control. California has searched for ways to shrink its incarcerated population.
Legal scholars predict that policies similar to the one in Missouri -- which, unlike some other measures, might encourage cutting costs before inmates are already in prison -- may soon emerge elsewhere.
Months ago, members of the Missouri Sentencing Advisory Commission, a group of lawyers, judges and others established by state lawmakers years ago, voted to begin providing judges with cost information on individual cases.
Judge Michael A. Wolff of the State Supreme Court, chairman of the sentencing commission, said judges had been asking for such data. By last month, Judge Wolff said, the computer algorithm was up and running, and the commission made note of it to the legal community in its August newsletter, ''Smart Sentencing.''
The concept is simple: fill in an offender's conviction code, criminal history and other background, and the program spits out a range of recommended sentences, new statistical information about the likelihood that Missouri criminals with similar profiles (and the sentences they received) might commit more crimes, and the various options' price tags.
Judge Wolff said that some judges might never look at the price tags (though they are available to anyone, and some defense lawyers have begun mentioning them) and that judges ultimately did whatever they wished (within statutory limits) on sentences. Missouri's sentencing commission makes recommendations only. And as Judge Wolff sees it, sentencing costs would never be a consideration in the most violent cases, just in circumstances where prison is not the only obvious answer.
''This is just more information,'' Judge Wolff said.
Fewer than half the states have sentencing commissions like Missouri's. In many cases, the commissions grew out of concerns, starting in the late 1970s, about racial and geographic disparities in sentences.
Now, however, the groups find themselves also weighing fiscal issues, like everyone else. Consider the theme of a meeting of the national association of sentencing commissions in August: ''Sound Sentencing Policy: Balancing Justice and Dollars.''
Leaders of several commissions in other states said they had yet to consider a plan like Missouri's. Some voiced concern about the ramifications, the methodology -- even the price tag of calculating sentencing price tags.
Lots of states measure the costs of imprisonment and of new criminal laws, but on a generic scale. Many states, for instance, calculate the average cost of housing a prisoner, but that is rarely mentioned with down-to-the-dollar figures for a specific person as a judge picks a sentence.
To some, the concept sounds crass, and carries the prospect of unwanted consequences. Might a decision between life in prison and a death sentence be decided some day by price comparison? (Absolutely not, Missouri officials say, and besides, the computer model does not attempt to compute the cost of capital punishment.) Could the costs of various sentences become so widely known as to affect the decisions of jurors?
Numerous legal experts on sentencing issues said Missouri's new policy made sense. Economic considerations play roles in all sorts of legal decisions, Rachel E. Barkow, a law professor at New York University, said, so why not let judges understand the cost of their choices?
Douglas A. Berman, a law professor at The Ohio State University, said: ''One of the flaws in the operation of our criminal justice system is not only the failure to be attentive to cost but an arrogance that somehow you can never put a price on justice. Long missing has been a sober realization that even if we get significant benefits from incarceration, that comes at a significant cost.''
Others, like Paul Cassell, a law professor at the University of Utah, argue that Missouri's plan counts certain costs but fails to measure others -- the societal price, for instance, if someone not incarcerated commits another crime.
''No one can put a price tag on being a victim,'' said Scott Burns, executive director of the National District Attorneys Association.
Still, money worries loom. This year, in an annual address, even the chief justice of Missouri's Supreme Court, William Ray Price Jr., warned that the system would be threatened if budget cuts persisted.
''Perhaps the biggest waste of resources in all of state government is the over-incarceration of nonviolent offenders and our mishandling of drug and alcohol offenders,'' he said.
Mr. McCulloch, the prosecutor, said the state's prisons were filled with anything but harmless people. ''You show me the college kid with a perfect record and a dime bag of weed who has been sent to prison, and I'll get him out,'' he said. ''Find me him.''
When Missouri lawmakers meet next year, Mr. McCulloch says that he expects he and others may push to abolish the sentencing commission.

HEADLINE: Tea, Anyone?: Enlist, but Avoid Talking About the Constitution

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE. 
Kate Zernike is the author of ''Boiling Mad: Inside Tea Party America.''

 BODY:
So you're a Republican candidate and you want to take advantage of the Tea Party energy that jolted once-sleepy primaries. But you aren't sure whether that means you have to take a stand against masturbation or urge your supporters to gather their bayonets -- tactics that seem to have worked for a few Tea Party candidates so far. You're not certain most Americans share the Tea Party enthusiasm for repealing the 17th Amendment (or even know that it established direct election of United States senators by popular vote). You don't have Sarah Palin's phone number.
Not to worry. There's no doubt that the Tea Party is a double-edged sword: a New York Times/CBS poll last week found that while most Americans had not formed a view of the Tea Party, the percentage of independent voters who view it negatively had increased. 
But the Tea Party has brought a swell of new participants to the political process, and historical and economic trends are working in favor of the party out of power -- that would be you, G.O.P. The trick is to take advantage of the Tea Party passion and stay away from its extremes. Celebrate the genius of the Constitution, but don't get into the particulars. Tea Party activists, Republican moderates and independent handicappers all agree that the road for Republican candidates is to talk about the debt and concerns about the new health care legislation -- areas where Tea Party sentiment is more aligned with the views of most Americans.
''The Tea Party and the 9/12 groups, their overall agenda is fiscal in nature, and I think that's consistent with the majority of Colorado voters and the majority of Americans,'' said Dick Wadhams, the chairman of the Republican Party in Colorado, who has tussled with the groups, particularly in the race for Senate and governor, where Tea Party candidates beat those backed by the establishment.
The Republican brand is damaged -- maybe even more so than the Democrats'. An overwhelming 72 percent of respondents to the New York Times/CBS poll said they did not think Republicans in Congress had a clear plan for solving the nation's problems.
But one place where the Republicans hold the advantage in polls is in their potential to reduce the federal budget deficit -- 42 percent of voters polled said they trusted Republicans to do so, compared with 34 percent who said they trusted Democrats.
Thirty-four percent of respondents -- a plurality -- ''strongly disapprove'' of the health care law that was enacted in March, and 15 percent somewhat disapprove, according to the Times poll, compared with 15 percent who strongly approve (and 22 percent who ''somewhat'' approve.)
Tea Party activists -- and their candidates -- pose a problem when they move the discussion into a broader one about the role of government.
''You see these rallies and the signs are all about the Constitution,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of a nonpartisan political report. ''They want it to be about these big ideological ideas, when I don't think most voters think that way. It's very clear that what's best for the election is to make it about Obama, Pelosi, health care, the deficit.''
Rand Paul, for instance, the Republican Senate candidate in Kentucky, has enraged local law enforcement officials -- and provided advertising fodder for his Democratic opponent, Jack Conway -- by opposing federal funding for drug enforcement in a state plagued by methamphetamines. (Mr. Paul might have learned, given the controversy after he went on national television the day after his primary and said that he disagreed on principle with the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that required businesses to serve blacks.)
The best thing you can do to make the Tea Party work for you is to literally make it work for you. Tea Party supporters may not admire President Obama's policies, but they do admire the community-organizing operation that got him elected in 2008, and they are out knocking on doors and making phone calls in the hopes of repeating his success.
It was without irony that Christine O'Donnell's Tea Party supporters were chanting ''Yes we can! Yes we can!'' when she stunned the political world by winning the Republican Senate primary in Delaware last week.
''Give them a title and get them involved,'' said Brendan Steinhauser, the director of campaigns for FreedomWorks, which has helped train Tea Party groups in getting voters to the polls.
In Colorado, Mr. Wadhams credits Tea Party organizing with creating record turnout at the state's precinct caucuses and getting more Republicans than Democrats to show up to vote on primary day. In a Wisconsin Republican Senate primary last week, Ron Johnson won with 500,821 votes -- in 2006, the last midterm primary, only 195,163 Republicans came out to vote.
Endorsements, on the other hand, have not mattered much. Not all of Sarah Palin's or Senator Jim DeMint's conservative candidates have won (some, like Chuck DeVore, a Republican Senate candidate in California, lost badly). (On the other hand, if you could get on ''Glenn Beck,'' Tea Partiers are huge fans. Be prepared to discuss Friedrich Hayek's ''The Road to Serfdom.'')
Whatever you do, do not take the Tea Party for granted. In Indiana, former Senator Dan Coats beat several Tea Party candidates for the Republican nomination for Senate. And he impressed Tea Party groups by meeting with them.
But now some activists are feeling ignored, and say they may simply stay home on Election Day.
''I sat next to him on a stage and he said, 'I want to talk to you,' but there's no phone call,'' said Greg Fettig, a local Tea Party leader. ''I hope he doesn't think he's got us in the bag.''

HEADLINE: A Cool Summer for Housing

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
THE fall real estate season is under way, and the school of hard realities is in session.
''The sales data is telling us nothing good,'' said the market analyst Jeffrey G. Otteau. ''Going into the end of the year, the trends are overwhelmingly negative in New Jersey: lagging home sales, declining prices, an inventory buildup -- and everything in place to indicate the foreclosure rate will continue to rise.''
Mr. Otteau is the president of the Otteau Valuation Group, which collects contract sales data in 21 counties. 
The August report showed a severe three-month-long dip in sales pace over the previous year, occurring in what has traditionally been the strong spring-to-summer period. ''Now we are in the throes of fall,'' he said, ''when sales are always slower, and the general doldrums just grow more intense.''
Mr. Otteau said he remained loyal to the real estate maxim that local market situations differed.
But based on the ''truths inherent in the data,'' he predicted, no county, community or neighborhood in New Jersey would be unaffected by the overall market's downward slump heading into 2011.
''Sales will remain sluggish, and home prices will go through a second round of declines, across the board in the state,'' he said. ''What will vary by market is the degree, the magnitude and depth of the weakening.''
In the August report, Mr. Otteau described the May-June-July period after the expiration of the federal home-buyer tax-credit program as ''the weakest in six years -- making it clear that the housing market is unable to sustain itself without additional stimulus.''
He had previously spoken hopefully about the potential impact of a legislative plan to set aside $100 million in state tax credits for home buyers. The plan was in any case vetoed by Gov. Christopher J. Christie in July, in the midst of a budgetary crisis.
Asked for her view on fall market trends, Judy Appleby, the president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors, who is the broker/owner of Appleby Realty in the Ocean County community of Seaside Heights, said she liked to ''stay positive.''
''I don't have a crystal ball,'' Ms. Appleby said. ''I just know what the market has always been, and that the phone is ringing. We've had two new listings in the last two days. The signs go up, and the phones start ringing.''
Also, she noted, ''For anyone financially capable of buying a house, it is a good time to buy, because prices have already fallen, and interest rates are so low.''
Mr. Otteau agreed on that point. ''There is the opportunity to make up ground on a trade-up purchase,'' he said. ''If the market in your area has fallen by the average 20 percent over the last five years, your $400,000 home has lost $80,000 in value. But the $600,000 home you might have your eye on has lost $120,000 in value. Assuming you still have equity in your home -- and can come up with a down payment -- it is the best of times to trade up.''
Even if home prices continue to decline as Mr. Otteau predicts, he said a buyer trading up would still reap the long-term benefit of a low-interest-rate mortgage (currently about 4.35 percent).
But, he added, ''What is so troubling about the picture here in New Jersey is that housing trends tend to be a leading indicator of what will happen in the overall economy.''
Because ''this recent relapse in the housing market follows 11 consecutive months of rising home sales,'' which had the effect of helping stimulate other economic activity and employment, Mr. Otteau predicted that ''going forward, if the housing market continues to lag, the reverse pattern can be expected.''
''Due to the close relationship between unemployment, home prices and mortgage delinquency,'' he said, ''foreclosure rates would rise further later this year.''
New Jersey is ranked 14th among the states in its rate of mortgage foreclosure, according to data published by RealtyTrac, he said.
Noting that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government housing finance agencies, recently ordered mortgage lenders to move faster on foreclosure actions, Mr. Otteau said greater speed would also probably contribute to price declines.
''In New Jersey,'' he said, ''the foreclosure process has been drawn out exceptionally long, often more than a year. The likely effect of speeding that up will be to have a sudden increase in houses on the market as short sales.'' He predicted that would increase already bloated inventory levels.
In the summer months, it was the lowest- and highest-priced categories of home -- under $400,000, and over $2.5 million -- that had the biggest increases in inventory. There were about 50 percent more homes sitting on the market in both categories than in the previous year.
He said that the inventory bloat would most likely spread to the midpriced home category if the market continued to stagnate.
At the end of August, rural Salem County in southern New Jersey had the highest inventory rate: a 45.9-month supply of homes to sell, according to Mr. Otteau's statistics. Middlesex, Union and Essex Counties had the lowest inventories: 9.5, 9.5 and 10.2 months, respectively.
Market specialists say a six-month inventory indicates a healthy market, in which buyers and sellers have relatively equal bargaining power. Inventory in Hudson County swelled to 15.7 months by the start of September; that is virtually the level it reached in January 2009, when sales froze.
Fort Lee in Bergen County had 17.4 months' supply.
Millburn, which includes the wealthy Short Hills section, had a 4.9-month inventory, much lower than surrounding towns in Essex County. Other towns doing better than average were Livingston, with 4.2 months, and tiny Glen Ridge, with only 3.3 months.

HEADLINE: When One 'I Do' Is Not Enough

BYLINE: By ANNA JANE GROSSMAN

 BODY:
UP until recently, the wedding industry would have you believe that you had only one chance at the perfect day. So spare no expense, be a princess for a day, invite 200 friends, and let it all pass by in a blur.
Rare are the newlyweds who imagine becoming a repeat customer when it comes to tulle or letter-pressed R.S.V.P. cards. But is that really any way to run a business? Does Apple make a product that you don't want to buy twice? 
The vow renewal option might require you to be publicly adored while also taking the opportunity to graciously adore your adorer. You might have to wear something really great and hire a photographer. Also, you might need a hankie.
''Everyone cried,'' said Ramona Singer, one of the housewives whose lives are chronicled in the Boswellian ''The Real Housewives New York City'' on Bravo. ''That is really important to mention. Every person cried. Every man and woman.'' Last December, Ms. Singer, a New York jewelry designer, and her jewelry-businessman husband of 17 years, Mario Singer, renewed their vows in front of 70 friends and family members at a ceremony at the Pierre hotel in Manhattan. Ms. Singer, wearing a custom-made white satin gown trimmed with crystals and ostrich feathers, told Mr. Singer that she loved him more now than the first time she married him. He compared her to a ray of sunshine and to a rock.
Afterward, everyone retired to the antipasto and lamb stations and Ms. Singer posed for photographers from Life & Style magazine along with her daughter and dog, who wore matching dresses. ''You know, it wasn't done as a fluff thing,'' she said. ''When someone does something for real, you feel it. You feel the vibrations. You could feel the love between my husband and I.'' Both posted their vows on Bravo.com blogs and fielded comments.
Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon did it earlier this year at their Beverly Hills Estate. This was the second vow renewal for the couple in as many years of marriage. To mark the occasion, he presented her with a diamond-and-sapphire-encrusted Ring Pop-shaped ring. Heidi Klum and Seal, who wed five years ago, give a vow-renewal celebration each year of their marriage; the events have become a kind of springtime version of the Ms. Klum's yearly Halloween parties. Last year, she had a ''white trash'' theme. Guests, dressed in their trailer park finest, gathered while a cornrowed Ms. Klum and a mullet-wearing Seal were joined in matrimony again. An Elvis impersonator officiated. This year the vow renewal was done in Mexico and had a wedding theme: all the guests wore tuxedos and white dresses.
Jennifer Lopez and her husband, Marc Anthony, renewed theirs this year as well. This was a second vow-renewal ceremony for Mr. Anthony. His first one was to the former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres in 2002. The two separated the next year.
It seems that restating vows is not a panacea for the evils of divorce, and may even bring into question the sturdiness of the original utterances. The first time, you mean it, but if there's the chance that down the line you'll really really mean it, then does that change the way you might have felt the first time?
Then again, perhaps the desire to reaffirm commitment is a healthy reaction to the changing state of marriage.
The path to divorce is increasingly well trod and holds less stigma than it did a generation ago. What's more, we live longer than many of our married ancestors, which can mean more years and opportunity for failure. The result is, arguably, an increasingly delicate kind of union that perhaps needs a certain degree of coddling.
''It's an institution that might now need renewing,'' said W. Bradford Wilcox of the National Marriage Project. ''People have these blowout weddings, but that doesn't necessarily correlate with having a long marriage and maintaining it. A vow renewal can be a signifier to oneself and to the larger community that something has endured and that there is a commitment to keep it going.''
Indeed, modern marriage also requires more communication than in unions dictated by gender roles. ''What keeps a marriage going today is so different than in the past,'' said Stephanie Coontz, author of ''Marriage: A History'' and the director of research and public education for the Council on Contemporary Families. ''In other times, couples didn't need to renew their vows unless they were quite exceptional in the way they saw their relationship.
''Women were dependent on men,'' she continued. ''He had economic leverage, and she had to keep the marriage working by either changing her husband or changing herself. Today, we come to marriage expecting it to be truly fair and even and to negotiate in a way that didn't happen before.''
And what better reason to have a party. Sites like BnBFinder.com have begun offering a ''vow renewal packages'' search option organized by state. On Royal Caribbean cruises, couples who renew their vows onboard are issued a special vow renewal certificate. The Celebrant Foundation and Institute, a nonprofit organization that provides officiants and creates ceremonies ''from the womb to the tomb'' has found a niche: it provides people who will conduct catered ceremonies for the non-legally binding events. They've sent ''celebrants'' to officiate more than 200 vow-renewal ceremonies in the last year, up from an average of 25 in past years.
Eric Seaberg, assistant general manager of the event space Grand Prospect Hall in Brooklyn routinely sells vow-renewal packages priced the same as wedding packages. ''People come in because they had such a wonderful experience getting married the first time that they want to do it all over,'' he said. ''Why let go of the good times?'' The hall has roughly one vow-renewal ceremony each week, with an increasing number of them held by couples married under 10 years.
''Usually they do pretty much whatever they did the first time, but this time they can have people who couldn't come and can make it bigger and better than before,'' he said. ''Your wedding is one of the most special days in your life but there's no reason you can't experience that every year.''

HEADLINE: Cuba Resets the Revolution

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
For first-time visitors, one of the most striking things about Cuba is the lack of advertising on the landscape. The Socialist government has billboards bearing Fidel Castro's likeness and his most quotable quotations. But one does not see roadside signs pitching much else.
That could change with the Cuban government's eye-popping announcement last week that it will cut the government work force by 10 percent and expects the hundreds of thousands of laid-off workers to find places in a new system that has a resemblance to free enterprise.
Could the Cuba of the not-too-distant future feature signs touting ''Joel's Moving Company,'' ''Dayana's Furniture Repair,'' ''Julio's Boutique''?
Probably. And there will be other changes, bigger and more wrenching, if harder to see. On a scale not known for half a century, Cubans will be hiring other Cubans for small-scale enterprises, creating boss-employee relationships without the direct involvement of the Communist Party. The idea of receiving a paycheck whether one loafs, sleeps or shows up at all will be under a new challenge. And it is possible that creating a cadre of quasi-capitalists could unleash forces that the Castros or their successors will prove unable to control. 
But is Cuba approaching a transformation of the kind that swept Russia and China? It is tempting to imagine so, if only because the news about a move to private employment seems so startling.
Nevertheless, experts on Cuba warn against reading any such far-reaching expectations into last week's announcement, no matter how ambitious a task it seems to recondition Cubans for a system that will require some to sink or swim.
Yes, the Castro government is acknowledging a deep problem. But it has also always linked its core ideology to its fear and disdain of the United States and the American economic system. So its ferocious pursuit of independence from American economic influence -- even as it denounces Washington's embargo on trade -- would make a radical shift to joining the global free-trade system that the United States dominates particularly difficult to explain.
A Cuban sociologist, Haroldo Dilla, predicts that in the end the new system will not enable Cubans to rise too far out of poverty, and that the government will resist a true economic opening with the world.
Which is not to say that the leadership wants no change at all. Over the two decades since Communism collapsed in the Soviet Union, Cuban officials have visited Russia, Vietnam and China and undoubtedly have taken some lessons from each. President Raul Castro has made it plain that he views Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to reinvigorate the Soviet political system, which led to Communism's collapse, as a cautionary tale. The mix of consumerism and authoritarianism that one finds in Vietnam and China is presumably a more palatable model -- privatization, but with the state in firm control.
Still, the plan announced so far is much more modest than what the Asian countries have done. Instead, it seems designed simply to boost Cuba's economic productivity in small-scale enterprises and thus loosen up a state-run economy and work force that have been sputtering for more than a decade. That goal is in line with what Raul Castro himself said last month: ''We have to erase forever the notion that Cuba is the only country in the world where one can live without working.''
The announcement of layoffs also does not represent the first time that Cuba has experimented with privatization. A host of small-scale occupations is already allowed on the island, including pizza deliverymen and party clowns. And Cubans can, if they jump through enough bureaucratic hoops, open restaurants in their homes or house guests in spare bedrooms.
It would be far more difficult for either Fidel or Raul Castro to emulate their neighbors in the Caribbean, without challenging the basic precepts of the Cuban revolution. For decades now, many of those countries have been taking advantage of their ties to the West and the United States to diversify their economies. Cuba, instead, continued to rely on one export commodity -- sugar -- which the Soviet Union bought at subsidized prices. Only relatively recently has it invited some European partners for joint ventures; for example, in tourism.
But a broad opening to new manufacturing, for example, would be different. That would presumably mean welcoming an influx of private capital from abroad to produce export goods on Cuban soil. It would also probably require normalizing trade and diplomatic relations with the world's biggest consumer market, the United States. And it might even invite efforts to return to Cuba by exiles who still have claims on industrial enterprises they left -- or were forced to leave -- as enemies of the revolution.
What's more, in China and Vietnam the path toward a modern economy was carefully coordinated with a series of steps toward normalization of relations with the United States. Could Cuba's new economic strategy be a signal of readiness for such a package? That would be difficult to say this early. Some Cuba-watchers suggest that a mass release of political prisoners from Cuban jails in recent months is such a signal. But the history of Cuban-American communication since 1958 is rife with the misreading of oblique signals, even if the prisoner release qualifies as one.
Of course, Cuba and the United States are more linked than government officials in both capitals like to admit -- through family bonds, for example.
''If fully carried out, a major expansion of Cuba's private sector will benefit many thousands of Cuban families and give Cuban-Americans opportunities through remittances to help relatives in Cuba who will be working on their own,'' Philip Peters, who follows economic matters in Cuba for the security- and free-market-oriented Lexington Institute in Arlington, Va., wrote in a post on his blog, the Cuban Triangle, on Thursday.
Ted Henken, a professor at Baruch College who studies private enterprise in Cuba, epitomizes the ambivalence with which prudent Cuba-watchers are assessing the latest news. He said he was thrilled by it, but was hedging his bets on how transformative the change would be.
''This is the beginning of what we've all been waiting for,'' he said. ''It's a major change in the way the Cuban economic system will work. It will be felt by every Cuban.'' But, he added, ''they still want to maintain state control. We'll see how this plays out.''
The real test of Cuba's latest experiment will be in how it is implemented and whether work will have a correlation with wealth, Professor Henken and other experts said. Under previous privatization campaigns, he said, ''people were so hobbled by regulations that self-employment was rife with illegality and corruption because that's the only way people could make their businesses float.''
They also had to keep wary, as all Cubans do, of the secret police, given the regime's attitude toward private property and enterprise in general. Yoani Sanchez, a dissident Cuban blogger, cited this when she wrote the other day: ''Under the strict canons of the socialist economy -- planned, centralized and subsidized -- self-employment has always been seen as an undesirable species of pest that periodically needs to be abated and occasionally even exterminated.''
The result has been the development of a singularly Cuban style of being enterprising -- somewhere between furtive and legitimate, with the real object being to simply get along. Ms. Sanchez described one man who runs a restaurant in his house and had outlawed items on his menu. He tried to persuade his daughter to marry a top chef, the blogger wrote, to get around a rule that employees must be family members.
Earlier this month, when Jeffrey Goldberg interviewed Fidel Castro for The Atlantic magazine, one comment -- hinting that the Cuban system wasn't working for Cubans any more -- drew the most attention. The former president later said that he had been misinterpreted, but within days came the announcement of the layoffs and the opening toward private employment.
Still, none of the power brokers in Cuba were calling this capitalism, and most close observers don't expect them to use that word, whatever other changes unfold. ''Overhauling their model does not necessarily mean they are importing ours,'' was the way Julia Sweig, a Cuba expert at the Council on Foreign Relations who was at the interview, interpreted Mr. Castro's comments.
Which brings us back to the matter of public relations, and those billboards: Even their presence could raise issues that Cuba's economic planners probably have not fully thought through: Is a billboard company legal in the new Cuba? Would residents living along highways be able to rent out the land alongside their home for such advertising?
And, above all, could a privately run restaurant advertise that its rice and beans were better than those offered down the street by the state-run competition?

HEADLINE: BLOOMBERG VOWS TO HELP BOLSTER POLITICAL CENTER

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- In an election year when anger and mistrust have upended races across the country, toppling moderates and elevating white-hot partisans, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is trying to pull politics back to the middle, injecting himself into marquee contests and helping candidates fend off the Tea Party.
New York's billionaire mayor, whose flurry of activity is stirring a new round of speculation about his presidential ambitions, is supporting Republicans, Democrats and independents who he says are not bound by rigid ideology and are capable of compromise, qualities he says he fears have become alarmingly rare in American politics.
Next month, Mr. Bloomberg will travel to California to campaign for Meg Whitman, the eBay entrepreneur and Republican running for governor on a platform of corporate-style accountability and fiscal prudence. He visited Rhode Island on Thursday to champion Lincoln D. Chafee, a Republican turned independent who is locked in a three-way battle for the governor's office. 
And, in perhaps the mayor's most direct confrontation with a Tea Party candidacy, he will host a fund-raiser at his Manhattan town house for Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader facing an unexpectedly forceful challenge from Sharron E. Angle, a political neophyte backed by Sarah Palin.
In his first extensive interview with a newspaper in several years, Mr. Bloomberg outlined his plans, which will include raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for candidates and represent his greatest involvement in a national election since he entered public life a decade ago.
Mr. Bloomberg described the Tea Party movement as a fad, comparing it to the short-lived burst of support for Ross Perot in 1992. The mayor suggested that the fury it had unleashed was not a foundation for leadership.
''Look, people are angry,'' he said. ''Their anger is understandable. Washington isn't working. Government seems to be paralyzed and unable to solve all of our problems.''
''Anger, however, is not a government strategy,'' he said. ''It's not a way to govern.''
Mr. Bloomberg said he wanted to see more of the cooperation once displayed by Senators Orrin G. Hatch and Edward M. Kennedy.
He said that he would not have voted for either of them (''one because he's too liberal for me, one because he's too conservative for me''), but added, ''These two guys who went into the Senate together and were the closest of personal friends for 40 years, they were everything that democracy says a senator should be.''
In the last election, Mr. Bloomberg, the nation's most prominent and wealthiest independent elected official, explored the possibility of a presidential run but concluded that the moment was not right for a third-party candidacy. But his plunge back into national politics suggests he is once again seeking to elevate his profile and test the viability of running as a centrist problem solver.
Mike Murphy, a Republican political strategist who is advising Ms. Whitman's campaign, called Mr. Bloomberg ''a very special breed.''
''People see him not through a Democratic or Republican prism, but through a results, grown-up, get-it-fixed, make-it-work prism, which is very attractive,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''He has a very wide appeal.''
Asked about a White House bid, the mayor forcefully dismissed the idea that he would run but sounded restless, acknowledging he was casting about for a new career after City Hall. But he said the presidency was the only job he would want in Washington.
''I don't know what the next thing is,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, stressing that he would not be interested in serving as Treasury secretary or anything else in an Obama cabinet. ''I am not an adviser; I am not an analyst,'' he said. ''You know, I am a doer.''
President Obama has been publicly courting Mr. Bloomberg recently, inviting him to play golf on Martha's Vineyard and dispatching Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to Gracie Mansion to seek the mayor's views on the economy.
Still, asked whether he would endorse Mr. Obama for re-election now, Mr. Bloomberg declined to do so, and said his friends in business felt ''vilified'' by the federal government.
But during a week in which the Republican Party experienced searing defeats at the hands of Tea Party activists, it was Mr. Bloomberg's remarks about the movement that were especially striking.
''I think these boomlets come along when the public is dissatisfied,'' he said. ''There was a Ross Perot boomlet, there was a John McCain boomlet, there's the Tea Party boomlet.''
Mr. Bloomberg added, ''It isn't like people are going to gravitate towards one of these boomlet -- splinter might not be quite the right word, since it might have other connotations -- but the small nouveau parties.''
Eventually, the mayor said, ''people go back to the major parties.''
His endorsements hinge on several factors -- a person's level of independence and record on immigration and guns -- but that approach has aligned him with at least five candidates facing Tea Party-favored opponents.
Mr. Bloomberg has endorsed a Democrat, John Hickenlooper, for governor of Colorado, whose rival, Dan Maes, has called for the deportation of illegal immigrants and decried a bicycle-sharing program as a threat to personal freedom. The mayor supports Senator Michael F. Bennet, another Colorado Democrat, who is running against the Tea Party-backed Republican Ken Buck.
The mayor has endorsed Mark S. Kirk, an Illinois Republican running for the Senate who beat back a Tea Party primary candidate, and he is supporting Joe Sestak, a Pennsylvania Democrat, for the Senate. Mr. Sestak faces an uphill fight against Pat Toomey, a Tea Party challenger. In Nevada, Mr. Bloomberg has embraced Mr. Reid, whose challenger, Ms. Angle, wants to phase out Social Security.
But a blessing from the mayor could create a backlash. In Nevada, where Republicans are seeking to portray Mr. Reid as too cozy with Wall Street, Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the state party, said that a fund-raiser at the mayor's home ''will only remind Nevadans of how well he's represented New York's interests in Washington.''
Levi Russell, a spokesman for the Tea Party Express, which helped defeat Michael N. Castle, a Republican whom Mr. Bloomberg backed in Tuesday's Delaware primary, said the mayor was ''doing everything possible to maintain the status quo -- to keep old names in power.'' He added that Mr. Bloomberg was ''out of touch with the zeitgeist.''
But those seeking Mr. Bloomberg's endorsement say that voters are not simply angry; they want solutions to problems, and that the mayor represents a government that, by all accounts, works well. Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, a Democrat who won the mayor's backing for re-election this year, said voters were ''sick of partisanship and they want us to deliver.''
''Mayor Bloomberg speaks to that desire in a powerful way,'' he said.
Mr. Sestak said he hoped the support of a mayor who values an apolitical style would prompt Pennsylvania voters to question the Tea Party's brand of elbows-out conservatism. ''It's a way of saying, 'Let's think this through,' '' he said, adding, ''There is too much extremism right now.''
Candidates across the country are pursuing the mayor. In Connecticut, both nominees for governor have sought his assistance. One Congressional candidate offered to fly to New York to be photographed with him.
In the interview, Mr. Bloomberg radiated enthusiasm about his chance to have an impact on national politics and reveled in his own status as a rare popular incumbent. (A recent New York Times poll showed that nearly 60 percent of city voters approve of the job he is doing.)
In Providence a few days ago, Mr. Chafee's campaign treated Mr. Bloomberg's endorsement like a visit from a head of state. A ballroom at the Biltmore Hotel was booked for the event, and the mayor was given a police escort.
Even if Mr. Bloomberg never runs for president, an ill-fated quest for several New York mayors, he remains enough of a force -- especially in the business world -- that senior White House officials seem determined to co-opt him, through flattery and attention.
Asked about the wooing by the White House, Mr. Bloomberg suggested that the Obama administration, in publicly reaching out to him, was trying to telegraph its understanding of voter unrest and disgust with party bickering.
The mayor, who started out as a Democrat, then became a Republican and later an independent, said Mr. Obama was seeking ''to be seen to be, if not reaching across the aisle, at least reaching out for an independent view.''
''It was a good time to be a Democrat at one point, and it was a good time to be a Republican at one point,'' he said. ''Today, it's a good time to be an independent.''
Relishing his access to Mr. Obama and the status it has bestowed on him, Mr. Bloomberg added, ''He doesn't invite very many people to play golf.''
Asked to grade Mr. Obama's leadership and his record in office, the mayor was careful to not criticize the president directly. ''He's had a tough row to hoe, in all fairness,'' he said. But he hinted at the resentment of his fellow corporate chieftains toward government officials like Mr. Obama, who have questioned Wall Street compensation.
''I feel very strongly we should not be -- success should not be frowned on, and I have lots of friends, wealthy people, made a lot of money, were big Obama supporters, gave him money, raised money for him, who are not happy now,'' he said.
''They all say the same thing: 'I knew I was going to have to pay more taxes. Somebody's got to do it, and I've got the money,' '' he said. '' 'But I didn't expect to be vilified.' ''

HEADLINE: Can the Fed Offer A Reason to Cheer?

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
REMEMBER the song ''Put On a Happy Face''? Just smile, it says, and you'll ''spread sunshine all over the place,'' even if you don't start out feeling very happy yourself.
In many ways, this is fine advice. But if you've ever tried to act on it, you know that it's not always easy to wish optimism into existence. 
Optimism, or lack thereof, may seem the province of psychology, not macroeconomics. But the issue is very relevant to the difficulties that policy makers face: a deficit of optimism has much to do with why the United States economy remains stalled today.
The Federal Reserve, pondering what to do to stimulate the economy, has a number of tools at its disposal. But if it could just convince Americans that it was committed to monetary expansion and economic growth, it would help the economy pick up speed.
Yet that is easier said than done. Here's the problem: The economy needs help, but monetary policy, which is the Fed's responsibility, has not been very expansionary. This is true even though the Fed has increased the monetary base enormously since the onset of the financial crisis.
How can this be? Supplying more money did not actually result in enough additional spending. The debilitating financial shock of the last few years convinced many consumers and businesses that they needed to save more. So they are holding on to much of the new money.
Given this problem, there is a logical and seemingly simple move available to the Fed: just make people believe that it is seriously committed to increasing the rate of inflation. Traditionally, the Fed has focused on restraining inflation, not stoking it. But these are unusual times.
If the Fed promises to keep increasing the money supply until prices rise by, say, 3 percent a year, people should eventually start spending. Otherwise, if they just held the money, it would be worth 3 percent less each year.
In a self-fulfilling prophecy, the Fed could stimulate spending and the economy, and at no cost to the Treasury. Of course, if no one believes the Fed's commitment to price inflation, spending and employment will not go up. The plan will fail, and people will view their skepticism as vindicated.
In other words, one of our economic problems can be solved, but only if we are willing to believe it can. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, wrote about this conundrum before he accepted his current job. In 1999, when discussing what the Japanese central bank could do about the country's deep recession, Mr. Bernanke suggested ''a target in the 3 to 4 percent range for inflation, to be maintained for a number of years,'' saying that it would show the bank's credible commitment to reflate the economy.
Sadly, although Mr. Bernanke clearly understands the problem, the Fed hasn't been acting with much conviction. This is understandable, because if the Fed announces a commitment to a higher inflation target but fails to establish its credibility, it will have shown impotence. It would be a long time before the Fed was trusted again, and the Fed might even lose its (partial) political independence. All of a sudden, the Fed would end up ''owning'' the recession.
Part of the credibility problem stems from the political environment, especially in Congress. Imagine the day after the announcement of a plan for 3 percent inflation. Older people, creditors and workers on fixed incomes -- all connected to powerful lobbies -- would start to complain. Republicans would wonder whether they had found a new issue on which to campaign, namely, opposition to inflation. And Democrats would worry about what position to take. Presidents of some regional Fed banks would probably oppose the policy publicly.
Although the unemployed might prefer such a policy, they are not well-mobilized politically. And President Obama is himself politically weak at the moment, so he cannot offer the Fed much cover.
Can the Fed walk down this path without blinking? Perhaps not.
The Fed lost some of its political independence during the financial crisis. It undertook major rescue operations in conjunction with the Treasury, and these bailouts proved extremely unpopular. Congress has taken a closer look at Fed operating procedures and will engage in a one-time audit of the Fed's emergency lending. When it comes to inflation, the Fed cannot easily turn to Congress and simply ask to be trusted.
THIS is the sad side story of our financial crisis: especially when it comes to financial matters, a great deal of trust has been lost. There is the prospect of a free lunch right before us, yet it is unclear that we will be able to grab it.
The Federal Open Market Committee, which votes on monetary policy, has three open seats -- a situation that may be hindering the taking of decisive action. The Senate has not been willing to hold a confirmation vote on Mr. Obama's nominations. But filling the seats is not enough; somehow, Fed officials have to believe that Congress is firmly on their side.
In failing to push harder for monetary expansion, is Mr. Bernanke a wise and prudent guardian of the limited discretionary powers of the Fed? Or is he acting like a too-hesitant bureaucrat, afraid to fail and take the blame when he should be gunning for success?
We still don't know which narrative is more accurate, but the Fed is not receiving enough signals of support from Congress.
As high unemployment continues, more and more people, including top economists, are asking the Fed to promise a credible commitment to a more expansionary monetary policy. This approach will work only if the Fed finds a way to be bold -- and if we find a way to believe in it.

 BODY:
As a New York City public-school teacher, I found David Leonhardt's discussion of the role of value-added analysis in teacher accountability to be evenhanded and refreshing. A system that measures students' educational gains based solely on numbers ignores certain uncomfortable realities: faster learners, who already get high scores on tests, may also be capable of greater incremental gains than their slower peers -- and in classes groupedby ability level, teachers working with struggling students are unfairly penalized.
Furthermore, teachers are not only torn between teaching creatively and teaching to an exam; in many cases, teachers are caught between a state-mandated curriculum and a state-mandated test that are completely disconnected. Yes, teachers should be evaluated and held accountable, just as any professionals should -- but these measurements must be based on a variety of sources, including peer and principal observations, creativity and content of written unit plans and even samples of students' class work. 
ILANA GARON New York
The ''value added'' criterion of good teaching takes the easy road of focusing on teachers rather than on more fundamental causes. A society with enormous social inequalities will, of course, have enormous differences in school achievement. For the Los Angeles area, for example, it's not in Pacoima or Watts -- but rather in Beverly Hills, Malibu, Pacific Palisades or Palos Verdes -- that you will find the highest scores on California's Academic Performance Index, regardless of teacher ''value added'' scores in these high-performance schools. Poverty-stricken, high-unemployment, crime- and drug-plagued neighborhoods will unavoidably produce substandard school achievement. It's vastly easier to focus on and blame inept teachers than to have a decent society with enough social justice to prevent the enormous differences in wealth, which predictably impact school performance.
ROGER CARASSO Los Angeles
All tests are not equal. Few realize that a test can yield various types of data depending on the intention of its designer. Two possibilities for testing a group are: one, to assess its mastery of content, and two, to sort it according to ability levels. Nowhere does Leonhardt address these significant differences. Decision-making about teacher accountability using broadly administered tests is inappropriate. Such tests may be used only for general surveys of specific goals and achievements and for identifying extremely high or extremely low scorers. That standardized test scores would be used to measure students' progress and also the effectiveness of teaching assumes unwarranted degrees of validity and precision.
PHYLLIS KAVETT, ED.D. Professor Emerita, Mathematics Education Kean University Union, N.J.
As a national board-certified teacher, I was saddened by the implication of Kati Haycock's statement in Leonhardt's otherwise fair and reasonable piece that you must choose between benefits for kids or for teachers. Education is not a zero-sum game. Teachers are professionals who actually want to help children, they make personal sacrifices to stay in the classroom and they could use good data to help them plan. We can make a system that aids both teachers and children, but we have to let go of our societal animosity toward teachers and our misguided view that one group can only be assisted to the detriment of another.
JOHN J. D'ALESSANDRO Physics Teacher Cincinnati
If standardized test scores become the basis for judgment, then curriculum and instruction will be driven not only by the content of a test but by the performative mode of test-taking. This negates the underlying truth that actual thinking sometimes does not manifest itself through Scantron bubbles and that the measure of learning also has to do with the ability to learn from mistakes and adapt. A teacher's numbers can reflect only a student's demonstration of mastery over a specific canon of facts and his skill at taking a standardized test. While there may be no other way currently to evaluate teachers, emphasizing the results of any standardized test shortchanges true learning in a classroom by rewarding a teacher for instructing test-taking, not leading toward actual education.
RABBI DANIEL ROSEN Director of General Studies The Frisch School Paramus, N.J.
As David Leonhardt's article indicates, there is a tremendous amount of force behind the push to hold teachers accountable for student performance on state tests. However, it is important to note that there is one critical piece of information that seldom reaches teachers: a comprehensive analysis of the test results. California (unlike New York) is one of the many states that does not allow teachers to view the test questions after the tests are completed. Teachers do not receive data on student performance on individual test questions, only aggregated results. So although teachers may be aware that their students performed poorly on the tests, they do not have access to useful analyses that indicate what specific skills need improvement. Across the country, many districts have elaborate systems in place to help teachers prepare students for the tests, but a detailed analysis of the test results is often a glaring omission. I think all will benefit greatly when this oversight is addressed.
JOE QUIGLEY San Francisco
Student test scores (including a thorough analysis of the data) should be utilized to measure pupil progress and teacher competence. As stated, however, this is just part of the answer to improving teachers' abilities and, most important, providing a rich, full education for each child. I advocate that a strong emphasis be placed on the training of principals so that they can properly supervise and evaluate the educational faculty. Awarding tenure is a sacred trust, which one must always contemplate through the prism of how it will affect each child, each class and the hundreds of pupils throughout the years. Excellence must be our goal. If a teacher is not capable, he should be let go. The same stands for administrators. These decisions should not be based on political reasons or personal biases but on professional judgment.
MICHAEL WOLK South Huntington, N.Y.

HEADLINE: Blacks Debate What Is Next in the Wide-Open Mayoral Race

BYLINE: By MICK DUMKE and DON TERRY

 BODY:
The last time anyone not named Daley had a legitimate shot at being elected mayor of Chicago, the city was an emotional tinderbox. Residents and politicians were still reeling from the sudden death two years earlier of Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, and the racially charged ''council wars'' that raged during his administration.
It was 1989, and blacks in Chicago were locked in a bitter civil war, sharply divided between two black mayoral hopefuls. But when the fighting was over and the votes were counted, the last man standing was Richard M. Daley, who benefited from the division to win the first of his six terms as mayor.
Much has changed in Chicago since then. But Mr. Daley's Sept. 7 announcement that he will not run for re-election caught the city by surprise and set off discussions throughout Chicago's Balkanized neighborhoods about who and what should come next. Among many black elected officials, ministers, political organizers and callers to talk radio shows, the debate is also framed by memories of how Mr. Daley came to power and the question of whether black Chicagoans should try to come together 21 years later to support a single candidate. 
''Today, the black community is totally disunified,'' said Conrad W. Worrill, a veteran of black independent politics and director of the Jacob Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies at Northeastern Illinois University. ''We are still suffering from what happened in 1989. But this could and should serve as an opportunity to unify the community again.''
Some wonder if that is possible -- or if it would be advantageous.
''The black community in Chicago is a diverse one,'' said State Representative William D. Burns, Democrat of Chicago. ''The black community hasn't gone through this exercise successfully in 30 years, and the community has changed a lot since those days.
''I think there will be a debate about whether we're looking for a candidate who articulates the issues within the community or one who can appeal to the community and beyond.''
Black elected officials and grass-roots organizers tried repeatedly in the 1990s to rally behind a single mayoral candidate in municipal elections, but Mr. Daley triumphed each time, in part by capturing an increasing share of the vote in black wards. In 2007, he beat two long-shot black challengers by winning a majority in 49 of the city's 50 wards.
Mr. Daley was helped over the years by a declining voter turnout. About 934,000 people voted in the first round of mayoral balloting in 1989, compared with 457,000 in 2007.
By then, even some of Mr. Daley's longtime critics had become supporters. Among them was Representative Bobby L. Rush, Democrat of Illinois, who in 1999 was the last consensus black candidate to challenge Mr. Daley. He lost 69 percent to 27 percent.
Mr. Rush said it was now time for blacks to come together to ensure that their issues were addressed. ''We want to learn from our mistakes of the past,'' he said.
Black business leaders have been circulating names, and on Friday 111 ministers voted for their preferred candidates. Finishing first was State Senator James T. Meeks, followed by Representatives Danny K Davis and Jesse Jackson Jr. and the former United States Senator Carol Moseley Braun. And the City Council's black caucus is putting together a questionnaire to circulate among potential contenders, said Alderman Howard Brookins Jr. (22nd Ward).''We would like to see an African-American as mayor,'' Mr. Brookins said. ''We certainly want someone who is going to pay attention to issues in the African-American community.''
Others expressed doubt that blacks would arrive at a consensus candidate.
''We are divided,'' said Bamani Obadele, who directs a youth violence-prevention program in the Roseland area. ''The black clergy is divided. The black activists are divided. Absolutely no one has been groomed for such a time like this.''
A common complaint that many blacks had about Mr. Daley is that while he lavished his love and attention on downtown and surrounding gentrified areas, he treated the largely black South and West Sides like unwanted stepchildren.
They point out that predominately black neighborhoods suffer from poor-performing schools, shuttered buildings and empty lots, high crime, and a lack of economic development, including grocery stores, restaurants and places to work.
But the city is strapped for cash and has a looming budget deficit of more than $650 million. Hermene Hartman, publisher of N'Digo, a weekly newspaper that caters to the black middle and upper class, said: ''The city is in serious trouble. We're on the brink.''
What the city needs most, Ms. Hartman said, is ''a business person, a Mayor Bloomberg type'' -- referring to the mayor of New York City.
State Senator Kwame Raoul, who represents the same district that Barack Obama once did, said that what appeared to be a division among blacks was actually a sign of a robust democratic process.
''I think this whole notion of even asking the question, 'Who is the black leader?' is off the mark,'' Mr. Raoul said. ''You don't ever hear the question, 'Who is the white leader?'
''The notion that there's no standout -- I don't necessarily think that's a negative thing.''
Two black mayoral hopefuls, State Senator Rickey R. Hendon of the West Side, and William Walls, a former aide to Mr. Washington, have announced their candidacies. State Senator James T. Meeks, a South Side pastor of one of the largest churches in Illinois, is gathering the signatures needed to get on the ballot
The list of aspirants is ''as long as the Dan Ryan Expressway,'' observed Mr. Obadele, the youth violence program director.
Mr. Walls said he would not withdraw from the mayoral race, regardless of whether the black political establishment came up with a preferred candidate other than him. Mr. Walls ran for mayor in 2007, finishing third with about 9 percent of the vote. He said he had been circulating nominating petitions since Aug. 24.
''For a small group of select people to believe they have the authority to anoint someone to be the candidate is ridiculous,'' Mr. Walls said.
Mr. Davis's name frequently comes up as a mayoral candidate, but he has not said what his intentions are. ''It may take a long time before the stage is actually set,'' he said.
Mr. Davis added that the only way for a candidate to win and then to govern was by following in the footsteps of Mayor Washington, Alderman Toni Preckwinkle (4th Ward), President Obama and other black politicians who built winning coalitions across racial and ethnic lines.
''The race card will not work the same way that it did before,'' he said.
Black voters have long shown a willingness to support white candidates far more often than whites have voted for blacks. And a number of black elected officials and neighborhood advocates said they were not limiting themselves to supporting black mayoral candidates.
Richard Barnett, who was one of Mr. Washington's key organizers and a critic of Mr. Daley, said he had yet to see a black mayoral contender who could raise enough money fast enough to be viable.
''But I don't need a black candidate,'' Mr. Barnett said. ''I just want a good mayor, someone who can deliver us from what we've been dealt all these years.''

HEADLINE: The Terror Translators

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
INSPIRE magazine, an English-language journal published by Al Qaeda, included in its summer edition what amounted to a ''Friends and Foes'' list. There, on Page 4, following the letter from the editor (''We survive through jihad and perish without it''), were pictures of, and quotations from, kindred spirits like Faisal Shahzad, who pleaded guilty in a plot to detonate a car bomb in Times Square, and, perhaps surprisingly, David Letterman, who was praised for recent criticism of former President George W. Bush.
Among the magazine's ''foes'' were Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates; Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France; and King Abdullah II of Jordan. Then there was Mitchell D. Silber, a studious and mild-mannered former financier who grew up in Atlantic Beach, N.Y.
Mr. Silber (''I guess I was flattered in a strange way'') may seem an unlikely choice to occupy that space with a terrorist, a television star, a cabinet secretary, a European head of state and an Arab potentate. He is not, after all, a boldface name. Rather, he is a 40-year-old father with a master's degree in international affairs from Columbia University who says his main hobby is reading deeply on the Middle East. 
What landed Mr. Silber on that list was his leadership of a little-known counterterrorism team deep within the crime-fighting structure of the New York Police Department.
Formally known as the Analytic Unit of the department's Intelligence Division, the team was created in 2002 as part of the city's response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It stands as a unique experiment in breaking traditional law-enforcement boundaries, comprising two dozen civilian experts -- lawyers, academics, corporate consultants, investment bankers, alumni of the World Bank and the Council on Foreign Relations and even a former employee of the Foreign Ministry of Azerbaijan.
The team serves as the Police Department's terrorism reference arm: available on demand to explain Islamic law or Pakistani politics to detectives in the field.
''We have found that conducting terrorism investigations is more art than science and requires a breadth of complementary skill sets,'' Mr. Silber said during one of several interviews this summer. ''Our detectives tend to have a very narrow focus. But the analysts have 360-degree visibility. They focus on the bigger picture, and they sometimes see things detectives don't see.''
To bolster counterterrorism operations after 9/11, the Police Department expanded its Intelligence Division -- run by David Cohen, a 30-year veteran of the C.I.A. -- with detectives who had mainly spent their careers chasing street gangs, drug lords and violent Mafiosi. Such trained investigators brought with them specific skills the department thought would translate into the fight against terror: the ability to read a suspect's manner and the talent for managing secret informants.
What they needed, in turn, were people to help them translate their skills to new terrain, people with a firm cultural grasp of the suspects they were meant to be pursuing. Over the years, a gang detective in the Bronx will probably have developed a radar able to determine at a glance the meaning of a hand gesture or a prison tattoo. But, as one former intelligence detective said of potential Islamic extremists, ''when we first started, we didn't even know they prayed on Fridays.''
Enter the Analytic Unit, which Samuel J. Rascoff, who ran it from 2006 to 2008 and is now a law professor at New York University, described as an attempt to bring ''the culturally exotic world of the ivory tower to bear on the gritty problems of counterterrorism as experienced by beat cops and seasoned detectives.''
Consider the time a detective was investigating an Afghan immigrant suspected of involvement in terror activities. The detective found it helpful when an analyst informed him that the United States military had attacked the man's hometown three months earlier with a drone strike. Sometimes, analysts walk detectives through Google Earth images of Pakistani villages -- the mosque is here, the bazaar is there -- so the detectives sound more informed and enhance their credibility when dealing with potential covert sources.
''Say a detective is doing surveillance on a cabdriver and he pulls over and goes into a mosque,'' Mr. Silber said. ''Is this a secret meeting or is it Ramadan and the driver is simply going to pray? The detective is just unlikely to be familiar with that kind of thing, but the analyst can put it in context.''
Mr. Silber's analysts earn $55,000 to $95,000 a year working daily shifts at their offices in Manhattan and at the Brooklyn Army Terminal, but are available to put things into context around the clock, at the ring of a cellphone. Their assistance can be as complicated as explaining the interlocking network of Afghan tribes or the nuances of the Koran, or as simple as keeping current with New York's foreign-language newspapers.
As one detective from the Intelligence Division's Priority Targeting Unit, which focuses on the highest-profile cases, said: ''I'm not reading that stuff. I'm reading Sports Illustrated.''
LESS than an hour after a Nissan Pathfinder was found spewing smoke and rigged with a car bomb on West 45th Street on May 1, several members of the Analytic Unit had gathered at their secret office on the West Side of Manhattan trying to assess what, by all accounts, was the most severe terror threat to face the city in years.
For the next 24 hours, as detectives in the field scoured the car for clues, pulled apart the bomb and began tracking down witnesses, their civilian counterparts helped them, by brainstorming leads to be pursued. In which stores, they asked themselves, could the fireworks and propane tanks that had made up the bomb be obtained? And what did that Arab-language sticker on its timing device -- a cheap alarm clock -- say?
The unit's linguists monitored jihadist Web sites for useful hints or boastful chatter. Others searched the Internet -- sometimes using methods as basic as typing ''Times Square car bomb'' into Google, but filtering the results through eyes trained to see obscure tidbits. Eventually, they came across a YouTube video posted by the Pakistani Taliban, claiming responsibility for the plot.
Cyber specialists were able to determine that the YouTube account had been set up less than 24 hours before the attack occurred. The video was analyzed by the unit's Pakistan expert, who knew, for instance, that a leader of the group, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or T.T.P., had posted videos during the previous month, announcing that commandoes had ''penetrated'' the United States and were poised to strike.
By 9 p.m. on May 2, a Sunday, the Analytic Unit had prepared an eight-page report for Mr. Cohen, the Police Department's deputy commissioner for intelligence, suggesting that an ''evolving, highly dynamic'' terrorist group, T.T.P., was probably behind the failed attack. Officials in Washington announced the same conclusion days later. (Mr. Shahzad eventually acknowledged that the group had trained him for the operation.)
No other municipal police force in the country has a team similar in scope and sophistication to the Analytic Unit. Its specialists speak Urdu, Farsi, Russian, Arabic and Hebrew, and ''cover'' subjects including South Asia, Somalia, Yemen, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Iran and homegrown terrorist groups.
The unit began with five analysts working for a police captain. When Mr. Rascoff, its first civilian leader, was tapped four years ago to enhance the team -- quadrupling its size to 20 -- he described his mission as finding people who ''combined very solid analytic and cultural skills with the ability to make it in a world of cops where the coin of the realm is not whether your degree came from Harvard or Columbia.''
As an Ivy Leaguer himself who once clerked for a Supreme Court justice, Mr. Rascoff understood it would be difficult having ''pointy-headed youngsters'' interacting with veteran cops and wanted analysts with what he called ''a low jerk quotient.''
Mr. Silber, who was hired to run the team in 2008 and has further expanded it to 24 analysts, spent nine years in the financial world with the Carson Group and Evolution Capital, but left because, as he put it, 9/11 made him want ''to get into the fight.'' At Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs, he specialized in Saudi Arabia's laws regulating the flow of terrorist money. ''I went from corporate finance to terrorist finance,'' he said.
The analysts he has brought in are mostly in their 20s and 30s and have worked at the United Nations, the State Department, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the New America Foundation, a research group in Washington.
''We come into this with a couple of years' experience in a region, or with a law degree or master's degree,'' said one analyst, Jennifer, who, like most, spoke on the condition that her last name not be used, for security reasons. ''We're not like the street cops. But it's the blending of those worlds that's the best part of the job.''
Mr. Rascoff said this ''blending'' was his goal. Analysts sometimes accompany detectives into the field, where they offer what Sgt. Steven Hines called ''another set of eyes.'' Those eyes are often attuned to what police eyes may not see: a poster in Pashto for a local demonstration against drone strikes; or a collection box on a deli counter seeking spare change for a charity suspected of having terrorist ties.
Mr. Rascoff said the working relationship between the civilian and sworn counterterrorism officials in New York was better than the parallel relationships in the Federal Bureau of Investigation because federal agents, unlike the local detectives, were often as highly educated as the analysts they work with.
''F.B.I. agents sometimes look at their analysts and say, 'So, basically, we do the same job, but I carry a gun and kick down doors while you sit at your desk all day,' '' said Mr. Rascoff, who has been working in intelligence since 2003, when he was a consultant to L. Paul Bremer, the special envoy to Iraq.
In the C.I.A., Mr. Rascoff added, the relationship between operatives and analysts is often the chilly one between ''an author of cables and a reader of cables.''
In the Police Department, he said, there is an ''educational, experiential but not intellectual'' gulf that can, paradoxically, bring the sides together.
''While it's sometimes hard to harness those conflicting energies,'' Mr. Rascoff said, ''when it succeeds, it succeeds wildly.''
The police officers agree, noting that academics versed in the culture of the region are able to seize upon investigative subtleties that they themselves might miss.
''An analyst once pointed out an individual on the street I thought was Afghan, but was actually Pakistani,'' said the detective from the Priority Targeting Unit. ''She knew because of the henna in his beard, the lack of a mustache and the pants length.
''They're from a different world,'' he added. ''They're educated; I'm not. My education is locking up bad guys.''
Another detective, sounding a bit like a Woody Allen character, put it this way: ''Whenever I have problems, I call my analyst.''
THE history of domestic intelligence in the United States has, to say the least, a checkered record. From Cointelpro, a series of F.B.I. counterintelligence programs, to the New York Police Department's own spying at the Republican National Convention in 2004, there are enough instances of the authorities' inappropriately surveilling their own citizens to make even the firmest law-and-order advocate wince.
Christopher Dunn, a lawyer for the New York Civil Liberties Union who has criticized the Police Department's surveillance of political groups, expressed some concern about the arrangement.
''This is yet another step toward the N.Y.P.D. being able to operate entirely outside of the larger law-enforcement community,'' he said. ''This type of lone-wolf approach, which we saw during the convention, is a recipe for abuse, or worse.''
But if civilian analysts help bring intellectual rigor to terrorism investigations, if the police ''are more sophisticated and less stereotypical in their work,'' Mr. Dunn added, ''that's all to the good.''
Investigations undertaken by the Analytic Unit, like those of the Intelligence Division over all, are governed by legal controls put in place in 1985 as a result of a 1971 class-action lawsuit, Handschu v. Special Services Division, that concerned harassment of political groups by the department's so-called Red Squad.
Mr. Silber argued that, by nature, a team of academics trained in Islamic law and mores mitigated abuse. ''The unit helps detectives dealing with sources and suspects to be more sophisticated,'' he said, ''and to develop a nuanced understanding of doctrines, ideology and historical and cultural references.''
NEW YORK seems an ideal place to practice this theory of intellectual investigation, and the unit has managed over the years to attract people who have worked in the Washington bureaucracy and seem to prefer the city.
''We had people leaving jobs with the C.I.A. and military intelligence to come work for us,'' Mr. Rascoff said. ''Why were they doing that? Part of it was the noir quality of being within the confines of an institution like the N.Y.P.D. There is an emotional, even an aesthetic, immediacy in being in New York rather than sitting in a cubicle in some fluorescent-lit office in Langley.''
To Mr. Silber, the attraction is the opportunity to work at street level on terrorism cases.
This year, analysts used their knowledge of cultural and political trends in Somalia to help prepare an undercover officer in his dealings with two New Jersey men, Mohamed Mahmood Alessa and Carlos Eduardo Almonte, arrested in June just before they traveled to Somalia to join Al Shabab, a group that claims kinship with Al Qaeda. Last year, an analyst provided unique advice to detectives investigating Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan immigrant who has pleaded guilty in a plot to detonate a bomb on the subway. The analyst, who served in Afghanistan with the elite Army Rangers, drew upon his knowledge of local tribes in Waziristan to create a flow chart of the numerous suspects in the Zazi case, highlighting those that shared hometowns and family affiliations.
The Zazi case, Mr. Silber said, was the largest surveillance effort the Police Department ever mounted in a terrorism investigation, and the unit's analysts worked around the clock at covert locations, debriefing detectives as they came in off the street, then analyzing and sharing the information with the next shift before it went into the field.
''We're very much in the weeds of investigations,'' Mr. Silber said. ''We're looking at the threat to New York, in New York, so there's a feeling of grittiness in a sense.''
He said that working in Washington, where the focus is often on events and people thousands of miles away, can feel ''a little antiseptic.''
''Here we're all in the same domain -- the suspects and the analysts,'' he said. ''You might hear that yesterday, at 3 o'clock, people gathered at this street corner or in this cafe. We're all in the same fishbowl together. It makes for an odd, exciting dynamic.''

HEADLINE: The Natty Professors

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Christopher Shea's essay (''The End of Tenure?'' Sept. 5) reveals that Andrew Hacker and Claudia C. Dreifus, the authors of ''Higher Education?,'' don't know their Marc Jacobs from their Manolos. 
I love Marc Jacobs as much as the next tenured radical. But as anyone interested in fashion knows, you can get Jacobs at numerous discount stores, including Loehmann's and Century 21. So to use ''Marc Jacobs'' as a symbol of the loucheness and corruption of academia reveals that Hacker and Dreifus are even more at sea in the world of haute couture than they are in trying to write about universities.
RACHEL SHTEIR Chicago The writer is an associate professor in the B.F.A. program in criticism and dramaturgy at the Theatre School at DePaul University.
To the Editor:
The indictments in ''Higher Education?'' and ''Crisis on Campus,'' the two books analyzed by Christopher Shea, really concern a small number of research universities and liberal arts colleges rather than higher education in general. A vast majority of public and private institutions have long been on the path the rest of the American economy now seems to be traveling: increasing productivity with fewer resources. In most, teaching loads are higher and research funding lower; student-faculty ratios have increased; and, as a lamentable consequence of belt-tightening, more adjuncts and non-tenure-track faculty (who, not incidentally, do not have the protection of academic freedom) are hired. Yet the anti-elite, anti-academic jeremiads continue.
It is instructive that while costs have also increased and financial stringency has become the norm for most European institutions of higher education, criticisms of the academy there have been fewer and far more moderate. One reason may be that, with the partial exception of Great Britain, there is less difference across institutions in prestige and effectiveness than here; there is less competition for rankings (whether in Nobelists on the faculty or in football and basketball polls); and in most places faculty salaries are largely based on a civil-service scale. Whatever the merits of capitalism in general, it may not be an ideal ethos for higher education.

HEADLINE: For the Auto X Prize, A Race to the Finish

BYLINE: By RONALD AHRENS

 BODY:
THE $10 million Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize, the competition to create fuel-efficient vehicles that ended last week with three winners, would have appeared to favor all the technology and finesse that goes with electric vehicles.
But Oliver Kuttner succeeded by using the same nitty-gritty approach that once led him to rebuild a Corvette engine in his college dorm room.
Mr. Kuttner's team, Edison2, created the Very Light Car that achieved a combined 102.5 miles per gallon through a series of tests at the Michigan International Speedway and Argonne National Laboratory. It was a team with extensive experience in auto racing, including at the 24 Hours of Daytona and Indianapolis 500. In fact, the other winning teams were also salted with racing veterans, and although students and idiosyncratic inventors submitted entries, it was teams backed by specialty companies or big money that took the prizes. 
Mr. Kuttner, a commercial real estate developer, said he had invested millions of dollars of his own money into his entries, even filling up his wife's credit cards. He won the competition's top prize of $5 million in the four-seat vehicle category, a purse that was provided by the Progressive Group of Insurance Companies.
The other winners of $2.5 million each for two-seat vehicles were the Li-Ion Motors Wave II, a battery-electric vehicle, which posted the energy equivalent of 187 m.p.g., and the enclosed battery-electric motorcycle E-Tracer from X-Tracer Team Switzerland, which achieved the equivalent of 187.6 m.p.g.
That team was formed by Peraves, a Swiss company that sells the Monotracer, a gasoline-powered version of the E-Tracer. And although the Li-Ion team worked in a shop once used by Chip Ganassi Racing in Mooresville, N.C., the center of Nascar country, the Li-Ion Motors Corporation of Las Vegas has been developing electric vehicles since 2000.
The winners survived multiple stages of competition that began with the X Prize Foundation's April 2007 release of a design proposal. One hundred and eleven teams entered, but when testing started at the speedway in April, only 24 teams showed up. The subsequent rounds raised the performance standards again and again.
Edison2 exemplified the type of innovation that the X Prize Foundation intended to foster while striving to force the automotive industry to leap forward, said Peter Diamandis, foundation chairman and chief executive.
''You get what you incentivize, and our goal was to incentivize 100 miles per gallon or the energy equivalent, or better,'' he said. ''We really are hoping to give birth to a new industry. That process is critical. That happened with the Ansari X Prize, and we really are looking to make that happen here.''
The X Prize Foundation sponsored the Ansari X Prize for repeatable space flight, which in 2004 awarded $10 million to Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites company.
To win the Automotive X Prize, Mr. Kuttner, 49, let his penchant for unconventionality extend to the car he created, and to Edison2, his company in Lynchburg, Va. Born in Munich in 1961, Mr. Kuttner said he came to the United States with his family in 1975. After they settled in Scarsdale, N.Y., the 14-year-old, who excelled in mathematics, wound up in the Scarsdale High School auto shop class. His first project, installing a Chevrolet V-8 engine in a Jaguar E-Type, initiated Mr. Kuttner into the unconventionality that often attends an auto project.
''The thing that kept me out of trouble in high school was shop class and working on cars,'' he said, adding that his hobby needed money. So he cut grass and shoveled snow.
After graduating from Boston University, he settled in Virginia, buying a BMW/Porsche/Audi dealership and also selling more than 700 Italian exotic cars. ''It started with my knowledge of junkyards and project cars and my enjoyment of doing that, so I got really good at scavenging the country for cars,'' he said.
News of the X Prize in 2007 rekindled his desire for auto adventure
''Initially, I was just looking to earn a prize,'' said Mr. Kuttner. Starting last November, the team built several copies of the Very Light Car, which weighs 830 pounds and operates with a rear-mounted, 250 cc single-cylinder engine. Two were built to compete in the four-seater class, while two more vehicles were built for both divisions of the two-seater class. However, the two-seaters dropped out because of mechanical failures.
While he would not say how much money the development process cost, Mr. Kuttner said he spent ''millions, absolutely.'' (In a visit in May to a machine shop, he was overheard telling the owner he'd have ''10 or 20'' for him that week, saying later that he owed the shop about $50,000. The shop has since been partially paid.)
Simon Hauger, director of the West Philadelphia high school team that had entered two cars, was impressed by Mr. Kuttner's approach.
''His claim is that the drivetrain is not as important as the platform,'' Mr. Hauger said of Mr. Kuttner. ''The route that he chose to go is that when you cut weight significantly, and you have significantly improved aerodynamics, you achieve the high fuel economy that, as we've seen, is really difficult to achieve. I think that makes him stand out from the rest of us because we all felt that the drivetrain was significant.
''And he treated it like a professional race: you enter more than one vehicle,'' Mr. Hauger said.
Mr. Kuttner said Edison2 was developing a new generation of the Very Light Car, using lessons learned from the X Prize. He said three patents were obtained during the development process, including one for the hub-mounted, in-wheel suspension. ''We are quite convinced that we can take 400 pounds out of the average car,'' he said.
Over the last three years, Mr. Kuttner said he found himself thinking about energy resources and the state of the environment. ''Today I believe in this with my heart and soul,'' he said. ''I got other people with money to believe in it, and we're going to change the way cars are done.''

HEADLINE: Bias Against Italian-Americans

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Unlikely Group Accuses CUNY of Ethnic Bias'' (front page, Sept. 15): 
Is an affirmative action lawsuit against the City University of New York unwarranted if the aggrieved party belongs to a politically incorrect ethnicity?
Though a judge will ultimately decide the CUNY case on the merits, the court of public opinion has already found the notion of anti-Italian discrimination to be as bizarre as it is risible.
Despite the prevailing Equal Employment Opportunity laws -- and the concept of federally protected classes -- Italian-Americans are not usually accorded the same legal or societal safeguards as other minorities. Anti-Semitism, racism, misogyny and homophobia are clearly repugnant -- and unlawful in the workplace. But Italophobia is much ado about Guido, the oafish Other of ''The Sopranos'' and ''Jersey Shore'' fame.
America has prospered exponentially thanks to the talents and abilities of the astronaut Michael Massimino, the Nobel prize-winning physicist Riccardo Giacconi, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, the planetary scientist Carolyn Porco and Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito of the Supreme Court.
Human capital is a most precious commodity. And in times of economic duress, ethnic discrimination diminishes the gross domestic product, stifles innovation and erodes our national character.
Rosario A. Iaconis Mineola, N.Y., Sept. 15, 2010

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths HOLT, PHILETUS ("PHIL")

 BODY:
HOLT--Philetus ("Phil"), of New Haven, died at age 74 on September 11, 2010 after a brief illness. Phil was raised in Summit, New Jersey, educated at Phillips Exeter Academy, and graduated Yale College and Yale Law School. 
He spent his career as a consultant in housing and urban redevelopment, first at the New Haven Redevelopment Agency and later at Holt, Wexler and Farnam and Yale New Haven Medical Center, Inc. He also gave much of his time to a variety of New Haven charitable organizations, as president of Schooner, Inc., treasurer of the Schubert Theater, and as a member of the board of Long Wharf Theater, among many others. He enjoyed a long retirement, traveling widely, scuba diving, fly fishing in Montana, horseback riding and rounding up cattle on a cousin's ranch. He was known for his warmth, intellect, sense of humor and distinctive laugh, and kinship with people from all walks of life. He was a generous host with considerable culinary skill, an avid sailor, a lover of jazz and an energetic supporter of liberal politics. He is survived by daughter Elizabeth of New Haven, son Stephen, daughter-in-law Laura, and beloved grandsons Philetus and Tattnall all of Manhattan, sister Frances Covert of Athens, Georgia, as well as a wide circle of dear friends. A memorial service and burial in Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven are planned at a later date. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to Schooner, Inc. and the Schubert Theater.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths WAY, ALVA O

 BODY:
WAY--Alva O. International business leader and beloved husband of Eleonore Way and father of Cynthia, Karin, and Peter, died on September 15 at the age of 81. A native of Schenectady, New York, Al Way served two years in the army and graduated from Brown University with a B.A. in economics in 1951. Al Way's career took him to the pinnacle of some of America's major corporations. He began his career at General Electric Corporation, working in various financial positions in the U.S., Latin America, and Europe. In 1970, he became Vice President of Honeywell Information Systems. 
Three years later, he rejoined General Electric as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, serving also on G.E.'s Corporate Policy Committee. He was pivotal in establishing GE Capital. In 1979, he accepted the position of Vice Chairman of the American Express Company and in 1981 was named President of American Express, serving also as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of American Express International Banking Corporation. He went on to become President, Director, and Chairman of the Travelers Corporation in 1983 and also served as Chairman of its Investment Committee. In 1985, he was named Chairman of the Board of IBJ Schroder Bank & Trust Company in New York and was also a consultant to and director of Schroders plc in London. Well-known for his sound judgment and insight, he served as Director of Dayton Hudson, Eli Lilly, Gould, The Guidant Corporation, the Fireman's Fund, McGraw Hill, Ryder System, and Warner Amex Cable Communications. He was a Trustee of Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, the Committee for Economic Development, and the Conference Board. Al Way was especially passionate about education and deeply grateful for the opportunities that his education at Brown University provided him. He expressed his deep commitment to Brown by serving for 31 years on Brown's corporation--as Chancellor for nine years, Fellow for 11 years, and Trustee for 11 years. As Chancellor, he presided over the Campaign for the Rising Generation, which raised over $527 million, at the time the largest fundraising effort in the university's history. In 1991, he received an Honorary Doctorate in Law from Brown and in 1992 the Independent Award, which acknowledged his self-reliance, integrity, and vision. In 1997, the university established the Alva Way Professorship in his honor. He generously supported numerous charities in education, medicine, and the arts. He is survived by his wife Eleonore; sister Ruth Senior (widow of Bruce Senior); brother Paul Way (husband of Terri Way); former sister-in-law Carol Way; his children Peter Way (husband of Frances Way), Karin LaPann (wife of David LaPann), and Cynthia Way; and his grandchildren Brian LaPann, Kathryn LaPann, Monica Way, Daniel Way, and Julia Way. Swan Funeral Home in Old Saybrook, CT will be handling the service. A memorial will be held at Brown University. In lieu of flowers, donations may be offered to the Margaret S. Way Scholarship at Brown University (Box 1877, Providence, RI, 02912) or Middlesex Hospital and Weiss Hospice Unit (28 Crescent St, Middletown, CT, 06457 Attn: Office of Philanthropy).

HEADLINE: The Exchange Rate Squeeze

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Say there was a way to create a half-million American jobs over the next two years without adding a dime to the debt or deficit. And say it would also revive moribund Rust Belt factories, reduce the country's gaping trade deficit and help stabilize the international economic system.
All of this would occur, some economists say, if only China would stop manipulating its currency, keeping it artificially undervalued as a means of boosting its exports and fueling its tremendous economic growth. 
Anger over China's exchange-rate policy nearly boiled over in Congressional hearings last week. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner accused China of violating international norms. President Obama plans to press the currency issue, along with complaints about China's policies on trade and intellectual property, at the Group of 20 summit meeting in South Korea in November.
That China has undervalued its currency, the renminbi, for much of the past decade to boost its surging export-driven economy is not seriously doubted; China intervenes in the markets by buying an estimated $1 billion a day using renminbi. For the lay observer, it's befuddling. Why does this situation persist?
Would China benefit by letting the renminbi rise?
Yes, most experts agree that China would probably be better off if the renminbi's value rose. Doing so would give Chinese consumers more purchasing power, lessen the risk of inflation and asset bubbles, and potentially reduce stark inequalities that have contributed to social unrest.
What's stopping China, then?
Exporters, concentrated along the southern coast, wield enormous clout in Beijing and benefit from an undervalued currency, said Minxin Pei, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif. So do state-owned enterprises, which have excess capacity and need to be able to sell goods cheaply abroad. China's importers are unhappy with the undervalued renminbi -- as are officials at the central bank -- but both groups are relatively weak.
In the United States, there must be someone against a stronger Chinese currency, right?
Large multinational corporations, and Wall Street, are comfortable with a weak renminbi. Many of the biggest American conglomerates make goods in China (or sell them in the United States) and benefit from the undervalued currency. Financial services companies find deal-making easier with a strong dollar and want to help invest the capital sloshing around China.
But aren't the forces on the other side just as strong?
A high dollar places tremendous competitive pressure on American agricultural producers and domestic manufacturers, and thereby hampers job creation.
So, it's not surprising that Midwest politicians and labor unions have been among China's fiercest critics. High unemployment has also prompted the White House and most Congressional Democrats (and a substantial number of Republicans) to side with the critics.
How have previous problems with a strong dollar been handled?
In the late 1960s, rising federal spending during the Vietnam War and the Great Society pushed inflation upward. The United States had a trade deficit for the first time in the postwar era. Manufacturers were furious. President Richard M. Nixon responded by taking the country off the gold standard in 1971, which caused the dollar to fall by about 20 percent.
From 1981 to 1985, the dollar soared again, as the Federal Reserve boosted interest rates to combat inflation and the Reagan administration borrowed to finance big budget deficits. In September 1985, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III met Japanese and German officials at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. Faced with threats of protectionist action by Congress, the two countries agreed on a plan to devalue the dollar.
So, could such an agreement happen again?
A rapid devaluation of the dollar is unlikely anytime soon. No country, even an ally, wants to see its currency suddenly rise in value (and its exports become more expensive) amid a fragile global recovery. The international monetary system has also gotten more complex, with the creation of the euro and the rise of large emerging economies like Brazil, India and Russia.
Though China allowed its currency to rise by more than 20 percent against the dollar from 2005 to 2008, the financial crisis (which led investors to flock to the dollar) led to a return to old ways. In June, Beijing promised greater exchange-rate flexibility, but since then the renminbi has risen by only about 1 percent. Too little, too late, Mr. Geithner testified last week.
Ultimately, says Jeffrey A. Frieden, a Harvard political scientist, exchange rates reflect broader macroeconomic forces. For the dollar to get back in sync, Americans must save and invest more and consume and borrow less, and the Chinese, Germans and Japanese have to recognize that excessive reliance on exports is not to their long-run advantage.
''It's conceivable that the Chinese might conclude it's in their own self-interest to let the currency rise,'' Professor Frieden said, ''but it's not going to come from browbeating and it's not even going to come from well-meaning attempts at cooperation.''

HEADLINE: A Georgian Mansion With Its Own Skeletons

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW. 
E-mail: bigdeal@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE name of a classic Georgian mansion in New Canaan, Conn., that sold this month for $7 million -- Wisteria Hill -- evokes a David Lynch plot or the backdrop for a creepy mystery. 
And while Wisteria Hill may not have a haunted past -- unless accounting fraud sends shivers up your spine, which it well could in these economic times -- the 11,000-square-foot, 23-room fortress on 8.6 acres does have some intriguing history.
It belonged to Walter A. Forbes, the former chairman of the Cendant Corporation, who was convicted of orchestrating the largest securities fraud scheme of the 1990s, and his former wife, Caren.
Mr. Forbes was sentenced in 2007 to 12 years and 7 months in federal prison and ordered to pay Cendant and its investors more than $3 billion in restitution.
Well before that, in 1998, the couple began a 10-year renovation of the seven-bedroom six-bath estate, built in 1910. They added 30 percent more living space to a mansion with cathedral ceilings, a tennis court, a guesthouse, multiple balconies and marble baths. The lavish landscaping included terraced gardens and ''a sea of lemony daffodils,'' visible from the gravel drive up to the circular motor court, according to a description on the property's former Web site.
Ms. Forbes had the house on the market for four and a half years, with an original asking price of $14.9 million, according to Rita Kirby, a broker on the listing with Carol Hollyday at William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty in New Canaan. The brokerage had the listing for two years and put the final asking price at $7.9 million. Selling the house took a long time because of market conditions, not the mansion's connection to Mr. Forbes, Ms. Kirby said.
Federal prosecutors expressed great suspicion when Ms. Forbes filed in 2009 for divorce, saying it was a ploy to put several multimillion-dollar properties in Caren Forbes's name so the government could not seize the couple's assets.
Prosecutors said that in 1999, Mr. Forbes sold the Connecticut mansion to Ms. Forbes for $10. A judge who intervened in the divorce ordered Ms. Forbes to transfer ownership of the mansion and a chalet in Rhode Island back to her ex-husband, so the government could take control of those assets. She was allowed to keep condos in Florida and New Canaan.
Ms. Kirby said a New York City couple with young children bought the estate. And so begins a new era at Wisteria Hill.

HEADLINE: The Greater Terror

BYLINE: By RICHARD LOURIE. 
Richard Lourie, a columnist for The Moscow Times, is the author of the novel ''The Autobiography of Joseph Stalin.''

 BODY:
THE HOLY THIEF
By William Ryan
345 pp. Minotaur Books. $24.99
Fiction can do whatever it pleases; it's just got to bring it off, that's all.
William Ryan sets his first novel, a detective thriller called ''The Holy Thief,'' in Stalin's Russia. It's 1936, the time of the Great Terror, when no one was safe, from the man in the street to the head of the secret police. The recent commercial success of another Stalin-era thriller, Tom Rob Smith's ''Child 44,'' may have been one of this book's inspirations, along with the Martin Cruz Smith series whose seventh entry, ''Three Stations,'' was published last month. Traditionally, aspiring novelists are advised to write what they know. But this seems not to have been conveyed to Ryan, a lawyer who has a master's degree in creative writing (do they give Ph.D.'s in it?). 
It would be all too easy for an old Russia hand like myself to nitpick the author's portrayal of Russia and Russians, to point out the details he's gotten laughably wrong. Even major writers make that sort of mistake. (The great Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, in his paean to modern America, ''Brooklyn Bridge,'' has jobless men leaping off the bridge into the Hudson River, not the East River, which it actually spans. Russians still snicker over that one.) The problem here is not with the author's depiction of Russia. Ultimately, the book's failings are literary -- matters of pacing, dialogue, composition.
Ryan does some things well. The obligatory opening grabber is very grabby indeed. Suddenly we are inside the head of a twisted killer even though it is the victim who steals the scene. That killer is tracked by Capt. Alexei Korolev of the Moscow Militia's Criminal Investigation Division, who works in an office that ''smelled of men and cigarettes'' and who says of himself, ''I find bad people who have done bad things and I put them in a bad place.'' Still secretly a religious man, Korolev hides his Bible under the floorboards of his room. Thinking of how awful Muscovites smell in the summer heat, he ends his morning prayers with ''a plea for the advancement of soap to full production as soon as possible, feeling it his duty, both as a Believer and as a loyal Soviet citizen.''
Ryan is surprisingly adept at comprehending the Soviet mentality, the naivete of the information-starved: ''Everything was no doubt different in America. Capitalists probably had little need for politeness and refinement -- they were unlikely to be as cultured as Soviet citizens.''
Korolev's faith is a nice touch, but there's no payoff to it. His belief never puts him in danger, and he doesn't suffer overmuch from the inner conflict it causes him. In fact, that's the tale's central problem. The reader never feels the anxiety and suspense that make you want to turn the page, but at the same time almost stay your hand.
Just when the narrative tension is beginning to mount, the author breaks it by involving Korolev in a fistfight that has nothing to do with the story per se and puts the hero out of commission just when he's needed most.
That scene encapsulates most of the book's shortcomings. Korolev has gone to the racetrack to meet with none other than the grand master of Russian prose, Isaac Babel, who has underworld connections. The use of Babel as a character is one of the book's pretensions, as is the scattering of Russian words like papirosa, without any explanation of what they mean (a papirosa, for the record,is a type of Russian cigarette with an inch of strong dark tobacco at the end of a cardboard tube). We know that Ryan's Babel is a genius because he makes piercing comments: ''Eyes can be very expressive, you know.'' A worker picks a fight with Korolev by pushing the Jewish Babel aside and saying: ''Leave the Moishe be, do you hear me? We'll see what his business is later. Right now, I'm talking to you, you dirty terrier.'' No man worth his salt ever allows himself to be called a ''dirty terrier,'' and fists go flying. The scene is as awkward as the dialogue that accompanies it, the author having apparently realized only belatedly that two-thirds through his novel, his hero had yet to perform any acts of derring-do. (At critical moments, Korolev tends to be rescued by others, rather than doing the rescuing himself.)
''The Holy Thief'' does not thrill or chill, except when the killer is killing. For all the gore and gloom, this is lightweight stuff.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 17, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A review on Sept. 19 about William Ryan's ''Holy Thief,'' a detective thriller set in Stalinist Russia, described its hero's drinking habits incorrectly. He is often depicted drinking throughout the book; it does not take ''283 pages for us to witness the detective having a drink.''

A GATE AT THE STAIRS, by Lorrie Moore (Vintage Contemporaries, $15.) The heroine of Moore's powerful novel is a Wisconsin college student coming of age in 2001. She yearns for experience and finds it when she takes a job as a nanny for a yuppie couple who are in the process of adopting a mixed-race child, but neither they nor her exotic boyfriend are who they seem to be. Moore may be ''the most irresistible contemporary American writer: brainy, humane, unpretentious and warm,'' our reviewer, Jonathan Lethem, said. The novel was one of the Book Review's 10 Best Books of 2009.
AMERICAN ORIGINAL: The Life and Constitution of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, by Joan Biskupic (Sarah Crichton/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $16.) Scalia is a polarizing figure, but Biskupic, also the author of a biography of Sandra Day O'Connor, presents an impressively balanced and well-reported portrait. She frequently lets Scalia describe himself in his own words, and he sometimes appears smug and self-satisfied. 
GIRL IN A BLUE DRESS: A Novel Inspired by the Life and Marriage of Charles Dickens, by Gaynor Arnold. (Three Rivers, $15.) A prolific writer and mercurial family man with a weakness for young women in blue frocks -- just like Charles Dickens -- is at the center of Arnold's novel. The story is narrated by the writer's unhappy but pathologically devoted wife. A fictionalized Dickens also appears, under his own name, in Richard Flanagan's WANTING(Grove, $14), a novel about the evils of colonialism and the costs of disowning love. Here, Dickens is enlisted by the wife of the polar explorer Sir John Franklin to salvage her husband's reputation. In this novel, Dickens's deepest emotions are at odds with his investment in his upright public image. ''He continued with his marriage. He continued to believe that, like everything else in his life, it would be righted by the sheer force of his will.''
THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH: The Evidence for Evolution, by Richard Dawkins (Free Press, $16.99.) Evolution is ''a fact in the same sense as it is a fact that Paris is in the Northern Hemisphere,'' Dawkins asserts. He demonstrates the explanatory power of evolutionary ideas while demolishing creationists' arguments.
CRUDE WORLD: The Violent Twilight of Oil, by Peter Maass. (Vintage, $15.95.) In this forcefully written book, Maass argues that although oil was critical to the growth of modern economies, this ''violence-inducing intoxicant'' has also made possible the most destructive wars in history. With few exceptions, it has not even benefited the people of the countries where it is found. We must move beyond an oil-based global economy, Maass insists; a resonant demand in the aftermath of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
THE TRUTH ABOUT LOVE, by Josephine Hart (Vintage, $14.95.) An Irish actress and a German scholar, both of whom have suffered losses, become uneasy confidants in this ''sophisticated literary work,'' as Tom LeClair called it in the Book Review. ''Hart shows how love of family and love of country can feed from each other,'' LeClair said.
SEND: Why People Email So Badly and How to Do It Better, by David Shipley and Will Schwalbe (Vintage, $14.95.) Shipley, the deputy editorial page editor of The New York Times, and Schwalbe, a former publishing executive, want to help readers avoid the personal, legal and financial problems that can arise from vague or carelessly worded (or misdirected) messages. Their advice: ''Think before you send'' and ''Send e-mail you would like to receive.'' They ''present this advice concisely and often amusingly,'' our reviewer, Dave Barry, said. ''I wish I'd read this book long ago.''
A BOOK OF SILENCE, by Sara Maitland (Counterpoint, $15.95.) Turning 50, with her marriage ended and her youngest child leaving home, Maitland found herself alone to do as she pleased. What she wanted ''was to forge a life with silence at the very center of it,'' she writes. To explore her belief that silence is ''a positive presence,'' she began by spending 40 days and 40 nights alone on the Isle of Skye.
''WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU UP TO, MR. PRESIDENT?'': Jimmy Carter, America's ''Malaise,'' and the Speech That Should Have Changed the Country, by Kevin Mattson (Bloomsbury, $16.) Mattson situates Carter's speech about a ''crisis of the American spirit'' in July 1979 by evoking gas lines and the best-selling ''Culture of Narcissism.'' His account of Carter's unsuccessful attempt to recapture public attention and address the energy crisis is ''incisive, fast-paced and fun to read,'' Matt Bai said in the Book Review.
ARCTIC CHILL, by Arnaldur Indridason. Translated by Bernard Scudder and Victoria Cribb (Picador, $15.) The murder of a 10-year-old schoolboy and the disappearance of his teenage brother alert Inspector Erlendur Sveinsson to the racial prejudice in Reykjavik against its growing Asian population.

HEADLINE: An Old Aircraft Carrier Needs a Final Resting Place, but Not Everyone Wants It

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Me. -- Apparently it is not so easy to find a permanent home for a resident that weighs tens of thousands of tons and is more than 1,000 feet long.
The John F. Kennedy, an aircraft carrier christened by a 9-year-old Caroline Kennedy in 1967 and decommissioned three years ago, needs a place to retire. The Navy wants to donate it. If no viable host can be found, the carrier that aided United States military operations in Beirut and Operation Desert Storm will be turned into scrap.
The Navy accepted proposals from Portland and Rhode Island, but not everyone here wants the battle-tested carrier parked in the harbor. 
''It's not a good fit,'' said David Marshall, a City Council member. ''It would block a good portion of our view corridors, and it ends up being a potential liability for the city.''
But Richard Fitzgerald, who is leading a nonprofit group's effort to bring the John F. Kennedy to Portland, said the carrier would set this harbor filled with barges, ferries and fishing boats apart from others in New England.
''It would be the best thing that ever happened to the state of Maine,'' Mr. Fizgerald said.
Last year the City Council gave the group permission to apply for the ship. The last of three selection rounds begins in February.
Last week, after the Portland group presented plans at a workshop on the project, some said an aircraft carrier just would not blend in amid a backdrop of lobster boats and repurposed warehouses and could block views of harbor islands. Half of the counselors present at the workshop expressed concern about the project. The group would have to agree to the ship's location.
A hearing and vote on the carrier has not been scheduled.
Mr. Fitzgerald, a sports referee and retired accountant, said he was not surprised by the opposition given the economic climate and was confident that he could persuade the council to support the project.
Mr. Fitzgerald sees the John F. Kennedy as a museum in the style of New York's Intrepid or San Diego's Midway, as well as a function space. The ship would be a fitting tribute to Maine's rich maritime and military past and would attract ample tourist traffic, he said.
Many of the visitors, Mr. Fitzgerald said, will come from cruise ships that dock in a terminal directly next to where he hopes the carrier will be berthed. The 1,052-foot-long aircraft carrier is not much larger than the cruise ships that the city is courting or the barges that move cargo into the port, Mr. Fitzgerald said.
''The Kennedy has a very sleek silhouette compared to cruise ships that have several upper decks,'' he said. ''Some of them are longer than the carrier and side by side overwhelm the carrier.''
But Mr. Marshall does not want to see a ship that large become a permanent resident.
''The difference between the cruise ships and the J.F.K. is that the cruise ships are temporary guests,'' Mr. Marshall said. ''The J.F.K. would basically be an aircraft carrier sitting on our waterfront forever.''
Mr. Marshall also worries about how the museum will be financed. Mr. Fizgerald said the project would cost $71 million over 10 years, which would be raised through a combination of donations, grants and loans. No city money will be used, he said.
Based on models from other museums, he expects the Kennedy to pull in about $36 million in five years from visitors.
The ship, nicknamed Big John, was the last non-nuclear-powered aircraft carrier built by the Navy, and it received so many modifications during construction that it became its own class.
The Rhode Island Aviation Hall of Fame has been marshaling support from Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, President Kennedy's nephew, and other public figures. They plan to turn the ship into a museum, job-training center and disaster-relief staging ground, and have identified $10 million in commitments after a previous attempt to get an aircraft carrier fell through.
''I think they're grasping at straws,'' Frank Lennon, president of the hall of fame, said of the Portland effort. ''Here you have J.F.K. PT boat training in Melville, you have his marriage to Jackie at St. Mary's in Newport, and Hammersmith Farm was the summer White House. You have all sorts of Kennedy connections here.''
But Mr. Fitzgerald, who fills with emotion when he speaks about the carrier, is determined.
''It will happen in Portland,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Less Government Under Republicans? Look Again

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Day After Tomorrow'' (column, Sept. 14):
David Brooks is spot on in his analysis of the Republican Party's current rejection of over two centuries of ''limited but energetic governments that used aggressive federal power to promote growth and social mobility.'' 
To Mr. Brooks's list of presidents in this mold, I would add three more, all Republicans: Theodore Roosevelt, who promoted federal regulations protecting public health and worker safety; Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose proudest domestic achievement was a huge transportation infrastructure project, the Interstate highway system; and Richard M. Nixon, whose moderate but substantive environmental policies guided American industry to greatly reduce pollution while maintaining American economic productivity.
Neal M. Rosendorf Santa Fe, N.M., Sept. 14, 2010
The writer is a United States and international relations historian.
To the Editor:
David Brooks states that Republicans worry that the forces of centralized power and expanded government ''are more powerful than ever in the age of Obama.'' He says that some Americans are ''alarmed by the Democrats' lavish spending.''
For the record, Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush presided over huge expansions of federal spending. Our nation emerged from the Clinton presidency with a budget surplus. No Republican president of the last 30 years can make that claim.
Also, the marginal income tax rate was higher under President Reagan than it would be if we allow the ''Bush tax cuts'' for the wealthy to expire, as currently favored by Democrats.
It is hypocritical for any Republican to claim concern about government spending or expansion just because Democrats are in control.

HEADLINE: Democrats' Wrong Turn

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Paying the Price,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Sept. 11): 
I agree that President Obama and Congressional Democrats are in deep trouble because they did not assign foremost priority to the problem that concerns most Americans -- a weak economy and lack of decent jobs. Instead, they spent more than a year wrangling over a health care reform law that has further divided the polity.
Such a decision can be attributed in part to a weak, inexperienced president who confuses eloquent speechifying with leadership. It is also a result of the ''conceit of liberalism'': liberal-left Democrats don't understand that they stand to the left of the majority of Americans on issues like the role of government in the economy and society.
Focusing on health care was a huge strategic error akin to the Bush administration's hubris in going to war in Iraq with the goal of remaking the Middle East. That effort led instead to great losses in lives and treasure, and to the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan.
The Democrats' error has led to the emergence of the Tea Party and a re-energized G.O.P., and the probable loss of the House and possibly the Senate in November.

HEADLINE: Gas Explosion Prompts Scrutiny of PG&E's Profits

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH LESLY STEVENS and KATHARINE MIESZKOWSKI. 
estevens@baycitizen.org ; kmieszkowski@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Pacific Gas & Electric enjoys a near monopoly over 70,000 square miles of Northern and Central California, with 15 million customers.
The California Public Utilities Commission allows the company to charge rates 30 percent higher than the national average. As a regulated utility, the publicly traded company's shareholders benefit from a guaranteed 11.35 percent return on equity, which is also above the industry average of about 10.5 percent.
Yet, when PG&E stumbles, the customers largely foot the bill.
PG&E's guaranteed profits have come under scrutiny following the Sept. 9 explosion of a company gas pipeline in San Bruno. As investigators examine why the rupture occurred, PG&E's ratepayers -- including those returning to the badly damaged neighborhood -- are most likely to bear much of the cost, according to state regulators and utilities analysts. 
''They get their cake and eat it, too,'' said Cheryl Cox, policy adviser at the Division of Ratepayer Advocates at the utilities commission. ''The ratepayer is responsible at any cost to make sure the utility remains financially healthy and keeps the lights on. We watched the financial debacle with the banks, and that is basically what we have here.''
PG&E is ''too big to fail,'' she said.
Consumers were already paying for repairs that were to have been performed on a segment of the pipeline a few miles from the section that exploded, documents show. PG&E told the state utilities commission in 2007 that the section had an unacceptably high risk of failure. Those repairs have not been made.
Customers, who already bear the cost of the company's $17 million insurance premium, will also most likely bear a good portion of its $10 million insurance deductible arising from the San Bruno explosion, according to a state utilities commission attorney.
Peter A. Darbee, the company's chief executive and a former Goldman Sachs investment banker, said in an interview that he was not prepared to discuss the explosion's financial impact on PG&E.
''This has been a tragic and horrific experience for the residents of San Bruno,'' Mr. Darbee said. ''I have been focused on that tragedy, how we can help the people of San Bruno, how to ensure the safety of our pipeline and how best to respond to the authorities involved.'' He added that the company has reviewed the overall system and not found anything to cause concern.
Last Monday, Mr. Darbee and other PG&E executives appeared at a San Bruno firehouse to announce the establishment of a $100 million fund to help those affected by the explosion. That sum will not be billed to ratepayers. ''We are demonstrating accountability,'' Mr. Darbee said.
PG&E was formed in 1905 as a consolidation of smaller power companies that had sprung up in the settlement boom after the gold rush. Under the regulatory compact that applies to all publicly regulated but privately owned utilities, PG&E has been granted a practical monopoly to provide a public service to any customer who wants it. In exchange, it agrees to rate regulation that includes a guaranteed rate of return.
The relationship between the utility, its regulator and customers is complex.
The arrangement essentially allows PG&E to ''privatize profits and socialize costs,'' said Todd L. Rydstrom, chief financial officer of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, a public, nonprofit utility that provides water to 2.5 million customers.
That gives PG&E a guaranteed stream of profits while the company bears almost no financial risk, Mr. Rydstrom said.
PG&E has lost $1.2 billion in market value since the explosion. Hugh Wynne, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research, said he believed that the market had overreacted and that the stock would recover. He said he believed that the actual cost of the disaster would be closer to $500 million.
C. Lee Cox, PG&E's chairman, concurred that the financial impact on the company would not be severe. In an interview, Mr. Cox expressed confidence that the utilities commission, which is participating in the investigation, would not punish the company in future rate negotiations.
''I haven't ever seen this regulatory commission not do something in the long-range best interests of customers,'' Mr. Cox said. To punish the utility ''just out of anger, it is hard for me to envision that,'' he added.
The next multiyear rate agreement, now being negotiated, will take effect in 2011. PG&E has requested a $1.1 billion revenue hike. In 2009, its revenues were $13.4 billion.
The company's ability to pass on its operating costs is ''just kind of how the system is,'' said Julie Fitch, director of the state regulatory commission's energy division. If the regulated utility is not guaranteed an attractive-enough return, then there is a risk that it will not invest enough capital to maintain and grow the system, which is central to the health of the area's economy.
However, ''if PG&E knowingly did something improper,'' Ms. Fitch said, the commission could fine the company. In the absence of that, she added, ratepayers pay for the company's costs now, and presumably in the future.
Since the explosion, much of the attention has been on the 54-year-old pipeline that ruptured beneath San Bruno. Consumer-safety advocates have raised questions about whether the pipeline's age may have played a role in its failure.
Pipeline safety has not been a primary focus for state regulators. ''During the entire six years I was at the P.U.C., we talked about a lot of things, but we didn't talk, to my memory, to any extent about pipeline safety,'' said Geoffrey Brown, who served as a public utilities commissioner from 2001 to 2007.
Mr. Brown is a first cousin of Jerry Brown, California's attorney general and the Democratic candidate for governor.
''The type of inspections that are going to be required are going to be beyond what PG&E or any of these utilities have done in the past. The ratepayers would have to pay for that,'' Geoffrey Brown said, adding that ratepayers would also have to pay for accelerating replacement of pipes.
Mr. Darbee said that given PG&E's size, with assets of $45 billion, any additional infrastructure spending precipitated by the San Bruno explosion would most likely be difficult to see. ''I don't think it will be discernible to a customer in the bill that they receive,'' he said.
The company was already having a rough year.
It spent almost $50 million in support of Proposition 16, a June ballot measure that would have made it difficult for local governments to start or join a public power agency. Publicly owned power companies compete with PG&E for customers.
Although opponents of Proposition 16 spent barely $100,000, the measure was nonetheless defeated amid criticism that PG&E was using the ballot box to restrict competition.
''I think that mistrust of PG&E is at an all-time high,'' said Mindy Spatt, spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network, an advocacy group.
State Senator Mark Leno, a Bay Area Democrat, said he planned to introduce legislation that would prevent a utility from seeking a rate increase to cover expenses incurred from a catastrophic event caused by improper maintenance.
Mr. Leno said the utility had little incentive to keep infrastructure in good repair.
''There will only be an incentive to maintain the system properly when the utility knows it may face the wrath of its shareholders if there is system failure,'' he said, ''because shareholders rightfully expect that the rates consumers are paying are sufficient to keep the infrastructure intact.''

HEADLINE: The Heart That Beats, Heats, Chills And Whips

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
Sometimes a kitchen is just a kitchen, but not often. If a house is a machine for living, as Le Corbusier said, then the kitchen is its engine. If that machine is seen as a living organism -- a house that is a home -- then the kitchen is its heart and brain.
The many-splendored thing that is the modern kitchen -- as a coherent workspace, object of study and model of efficiency -- began to take shape sometime around 1900. It has been a leading indicator of the state of design ever since. It has also been a battlefield of conflicting belief systems, not least regarding the role of women in society. As the use of servants declined, housewives became at once early adopters of new products meant to free them from drudgery and targets of corporate advertising that relentlessly defined them as household fixtures themselves.
Which is to say, kitchens were heavily symbolic sites long before any of us became involved with the ones that bless or blight our individual lives. This is elaborately demonstrated by ''Counter Space: Design and the Modern Kitchen'' at the Museum of Modern Art. 
Using a tantalizing sprawl of design objects, artifacts and artworks, this exhibition places the modern kitchen in a broad historical context. It is bound to invite personal memories: I rediscovered the Ekco vegetable peeler, Chemex coffeemaker and copper-bottomed Revere Ware saucepan of my mother's kitchen; the Terraillon plastic food scale and timer from my first New York apartment; and the old domed Magnalite tea kettle that an ex-boyfriend cherished.
But in the main, ''Counter Space'' sprints with dazzling speed and pinpoint precision across an amazing amount of social and aesthetic history, and shows how these histories are connected. The kitchen's design evolution meshed with the new availability of gas and electricity; with the rise of cities, the middle class and health consciousness; with early stabs at prefab housing; with the growing independence of women; and of course with the emergence of modern design itself, as a self-consciously forward-looking, socially minded discipline whose brief was to improve everyday life for all.
Two world wars fed innovation by making efficiency and conservation pressing matters, creating food and housing shortages and luring women into the work force. As cities grew, the kitchen's need for regular infusions of fresh foodstuffs, heating and cooling energy, and waste disposal connected it to urban networks that were themselves still taking shape. The kitchen was something like Rome, with nearly all a city's infrastructure leading to it or away from it.
''Counter Space'' confirms that few museums can muster a show of this kind as effectively as the Modern. It been assembled by Juliet Kinchin, curator in the department of architecture and design, and Aidan O'Connor, a curatorial assistant, who have drawn entirely from the museum's collections. In addition to some 300 design objects clustered according to era, material or designer, it includes posters, paintings, films and film stills, prints and photographs -- something from every department.
The museum's vision of and faith in modernism are a major subtext. MoMA's historic determination to encompass all that is emblematic of modern life is so breathtaking as to be almost self-congratulatory. ''See?'' the museum seems to say. ''We have this, that and the other, and they're all relevant and they all fit together in this story.''
But the Modern has the goods. Peter Behren's 1909 electric tea kettle is here, nickel-plated to resemble parlor-worthy silver, along with a poster he designed two years earlier encouraging the use of electricity. An American poster from 1917 encourages Americans to eat less meat and fat, more grains and vegetables, not for their health, but to save food for Allied troops.
The objects range chronologically from the brown paper bag that Charles Stillwell designed for the Union Paper Bag Machine Company of Philadelphia in 1883 through a Levittown kitchen's worth of pastel-colored Tupperware from the mid-1950s to Philippe Starck's overly sculptural Juicy Salif Lemon Squeezer of 1988 (a countertop Louise Bourgeois spider) and Smart Design's far more user-friendly Good Grips peeler of 1989.
The show's centerpiece is a stupendous recent acquisition: one of the last surviving examples of a relatively complete Frankfurt Kitchen designed in 1926-27 by Margarete Schutte-Lihotzky (1897-2000), Austria's first female architect. It was mass produced for housing blocks built in Frankfurt to meet housing shortages caused by the devastation of World War I, and remains a model of cockpitlike clarity and purpose. Including a grid of small metal bins (for storing rice and the like) that resembles a hardware store, it was one of several determinedly modern kitchens designed mostly in Germany in the late 1920s. But it is probably alone in being the subject of a recent music video tribute by the Austrian musician Robert Rotifer, which is also in the show.
''Counter Space'' proceeds in three sections. ''The New Kitchen'' centers on design up through World War II, when the kitchen was conceived of as a kind of no-nonsense laboratory. Form follows function here, as do metal and glass and a tensile sense of geometry. The mid-1930s brought such classics as Wilhelm Wagenfeld's Kubus stacking storage containers, made of textured glass; Sherman Kelly's cast aluminum ice-cream scoop, upon which Brancusi could not have improved; and a handy-looking one-shot cake cutter by an unknown designer that could be a Duchamp readymade. Also here are posters from wartime Britain: those by Frederick H. K. Henrion expound on the economies of raising rabbits for food; several more by Herbert Tomlinson single out the destructiveness of mice.
''Visions of Plenty,'' the second section, covers the explosion of new materials, especially colorful plastics, and expanding markets and growing residential footprints that followed the war, when one German designer presciently noted that ''America has fat kitchens, Europe has thin ones.'' In 1968, when the Italian designer Virgilio Forchiassin designed a mobile kitchen unit that folded up into something like a Minimalist cube, American kitchens were in the process of absorbing dining rooms, living rooms and the den.
Clever forms and pretty colors often superseded function. I, for one, can't imagine putting anything but decorative pieces of fruit in the bright transparent plastic serving dishes that Kenneth Brozen designed in 1963. But this was also the heyday of Braun's svelte appliances that made plastic seem as refined as porcelain, and signaled a Germany design resurgence; Kaj Franck's handsomely basic Kilta tableware for Arabia; and works of genius like the wasp-waisted Kikkoman soy sauce dispenser designed by the renowned Kenji Ekuan in 1961.
The final section, ''Kitchen Sink Dramas,'' centers on the kitchen as grist for the artistic mill starting with Pop Art -- Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes, paintings by James Rosenquist and Tom Wesselmann -- and continuing nearly to the present. In a way it is too bad not to devote all the gallery space to design itself, especially since some objects are displayed on high shelves and are difficult to see. But the tradeoff is a sharpened sense of the organic relationship between art and its social context.
An especially vivid example of this relationship is provided by the veritable mother lode of short promotional films and television commercials from the Modern's holdings in which the presumption of female docility and devotion could not be clearer. Titles like ''The Home Electric,'' a 1915 silent, and ''A Word to the Wives,'' from 1955, barely require description. Along with other clips, they supply visual evidence of the stereotypes that artists like Martha Rosler, Cindy Sherman and Laurie Simmons began to dismantle in the 1970s as the women's movement got underway. Their works are seen in the show's final section.
The connection is of course boilerplate art history, but to see it made with real-life art and artifacts against the rich backdrop of this exhibition is something else. Art may not be the best revenge, but it certainly helps.
''Counter Space: Design and the Modern Kitchen'' continues through March 14 at the Museum of Modern Art; (212) 708-9400, moma.org.

HEADLINE: Citing Pull on State Finances, Paterson's No. 2 Seeks Medicaid Overhaul

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Describing Medicaid as a ''massive program'' whose growth threatens the state's finances, Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch is calling for significant changes in New York's health care benefits for the poor and disabled, lobbing a volatile issue in the midst of the campaign for a new governor.
In a report to be released on Monday, Mr. Ravitch says the state should remove control of the rate-setting process for Medicaid, the joint state and federal health insurance program for the poor, from the Legislature to reduce the influence of politics.
He also calls for limits on medical malpractice awards and for the re-examination of rules that allow middle-class families to shelter assets so they can qualify for coverage. 
Although the report does not suggest a cut in benefits, it notes that New York has among the most liberal definitions of eligibility.
While Medicaid began as a program mainly for people on welfare, the report says, the state program now covers many of the working poor, including childless adults, as well as long-term care for the disabled that includes visiting nurses, and help with bathing, cooking and housekeeping.
Almost one in four New Yorkers now receive Medicaid, the report said, making it the largest purchaser of health care in the state and consuming a third of all the money the state spends every year.
''We have been extremely generous in expanding the eligibility of care, and we have a long-term care program that nobody else does,'' Mr. Ravitch said in an interview on Sunday. ''The rate of growth is critical to trying to deal with the enormous deficit the state faces.''
Mr. Ravitch is seeking to address a crisis that many states have been grappling with. In a report released in June, the National Governors Association said that starting in 2014, the federal health care overhaul will add 16 million people to the 60 million already enrolled in Medicaid, and warned that changes in the way the benefits are delivered ''will be crucial to contain program spending.''
New York State has wrestled for years with the growth of Medicaid, which now costs more than $50 billion a year, more than double the spending in 1995. With stimulus spending, the federal government covers about $30 billion, more than the 50 percent share it has historically covered in New York.
But when that extra money runs out in June, New York and other states will ''fall off a cliff,'' Mr. Ravitch said, just as they are trying to claw out of deficits and recession.
''The assumption was that by 2011 the economy would have recovered, and in the meantime the federal government was helping the states through a difficult period,'' Mr. Ravitch said. ''But we're not out of the recession, poverty's increased in the U.S., we're still at roughly the same level of unemployment, and the states aren't out of the woods.''
It is unclear how much weight Mr. Ravitch's recommendations will carry, since he is not running for re-election and the State Legislature is notoriously protective of its own power. But in releasing his report now, he is putting a sensitive issue out for public consideration in the middle of a governor's campaign, one of many national races in which the role and the responsibility of government are being debated.
Michael Caputo, the campaign manager for Carl P. Paladino, the Republican candidate for governor, said that the Paladino campaign had not seen Mr. Ravitch's report, but that Mr. Paladino believed that ''gold-plated Medicaid options'' were debilitating the state's economy.
''Since $20 billion of savings that he's counting on removing from state government are dependent on Medicaid,'' Mr. Caputo said of Mr. Paladino, ''my guess is that Mr. Ravitch is running down the same track Carl Paladino is.''
Mr. Caputo said Mr. Paladino believed that up to 60 percent of the cost of long-term care could be reduced by training and paying family members to take care of patients. He said Andrew M. Cuomo, the Democratic nominee for governor, had offered only vague cost-cutting proposals, adding, ''This will be a major issue in the governor's campaign, I can promise you, because Andrew refuses to answer how he's going to cut Medicaid.''
Marissa Shorenstein, a spokeswoman for the Cuomo campaign, pointed to part of Mr. Cuomo's campaign policy document that appeared to echo Mr. Ravitch's report. It calls for shifting authority for setting Medicaid reimbursement rates ''from the current politicized system, in which the Legislature micromanages rate changes, to a nonpolitical administrative system managed by the Department of Health.''
The Ravitch report contains a number of suggestions on how the bureaucracy of Medicaid could be streamlined. It says the power to set rate formulas and reimbursement policies should be removed from the Legislature and given to the Medicaid director in the State Health Department. The director would be advised by an independent rate-setting panel similar to one the federal government has for Medicare.
The report also calls for replacing the current Medicaid administration, which the state shares with New York City and 57 counties, with a centralized system. Planning for such a reorganization has already begun under a new state law.
Mr. Ravitch said the current fragmented system lent itself to abuse and corruption, particularly in long-term care. ''If your Aunt Tillie needs home care and you want 24-hour care and you know the local county executive, Aunt Tillie will get it,'' Mr. Ravitch said. ''The lower the level of government, the more political the decision-making matrix is.''
Mr. Ravitch said he proposed changes to Medicaid because of its increasing gravitational pull on the state budget. The report was not commissioned by Gov. David A. Paterson.
Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, chairman of the Assembly Health Committee, said that ''anything Richard Ravitch puts on the table deserves and will receive a lot of careful attention.'' But he said that even though some legislators might agree that New York was spending too much money on long-term care, ''they will revolt against any proposal to cut it back.'' He added, ''In my memory, we have never cut back on eligibility for Medicaid, and I would not expect that to be a viable concept.''
Mr. Gottfried also said the Legislature would be unwilling to give up control over the rules that determine rate-setting for hospitals, nursing homes and home care. ''I think the Legislature would be very reluctant to hand over policy-making of this importance to appointed officials,'' he said.
In the report's most far-reaching recommendations, Mr. Ravitch takes on programs and constituencies with strong public or legislative support. He is not, for example, the first person to call for caps on medical malpractice awards, which drive up health costs.
Since it was founded in the mid-1960s, Medicaid has evolved from a program for the very poor to one that has aspects of a politically untouchable ''entitlement'' program for the working poor and the middle class, covering more categories of people than virtually any other state, the report says.
But Mr. Ravitch does not spare the blame. ''The increase of Medicaid in New York has been gubernatorial, legislative and bipartisan,'' he said.
''California and Illinois, the two other states that get the lowest share of federal aid and which have a substantial number of poor people, spend dramatically less than New York spends on Medicaid,'' he said.
Many New Yorkers receive both Medicare, which is for the elderly and disabled and is covered wholly by the federal government, and Medicaid. Those so-called dual eligibles account for 40 percent of Medicaid spending, the report said. It suggested saving money by moving those people into managed-care programs rather than letting them choose their doctors. But this would require a change in federal law, Mr. Ravitch said.
The report also took aim at a policy called ''spousal refusal,'' which permits families that meet the standards to afford long-term care for an ailing spouse to shift assets so that Medicaid will pay the cost.
The doctrine of spousal refusal, the report says, is ''vulnerable to abuses that divert resources from Medicaid's legitimate purpose -- serving as a safety net for the needy -- and turn the program into an entitlement for the less needy.''
Mr. Ravitch said that by pointing out how large the program had become, ''I'm not trying to suggest we should cut people off the rolls.''
He said he favored addressing underlying costs with better preventive medicine and by lobbying the federal government to pick up a greater share of New York's Medicaid burden. But he said, ''I'm begging the question of whether eligibility requirements should be changed.''

HEADLINE: With Revelations of Debt, Georgia Governor's Race Evens Up

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. -- At a paper-plate luncheon for lawyers and judges on Friday, Nathan Deal, the Republican nominee for governor of Georgia, searched for a metaphor that would resonate. He wanted to describe how it feels to run a major campaign, especially amid revelations last week that he is facing more than $5 million of debt and may need to sell his house to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure.
''What's it like?'' he asked rhetorically, standing in a century-old courtroom in this Atlanta suburb. ''It's like being in a trial that is contentious, doesn't have weekends off and lasts for over a year and a half.'' 
In his analogy, the jurors determining his fate would be Georgia voters, who must decide in November whether to stand by Mr. Deal, a former nine-term congressman, despite revelations about his worsening financial situation.
On Wednesday, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Mr. Deal, 68, owed $2.3 million to a bank, after having invested in his daughter's sporting goods store, which went out of business last year. On Thursday, The Associated Press added to the campaign's troubles, reporting that Mr. Deal also owed $2.85 million on loans for an automobile salvage business he co-owns.
None of the debts were included in filings that the Deal campaign released before the Republican primary runoff in August, which Mr. Deal won by less than 1 percent of the vote.
The back-to-back disclosures have upended an election that had been considered reasonably easy for Republicans. Georgia is so reliably conservative -- with a Republican governor, two Republican senators and Republican control of the state legislature -- that Mr. Deal's Democratic opponent, former Gov. Roy E. Barnes, declined even to meet President Obama when he visited the state last month.
Gov. Sonny Perdue is prevented by term limits from seeking re-election. Now, national experts are declaring the Georgia race a tossup, offering a glimmer of hope to Democratic leaders expecting landslide defeats elsewhere, especially in the South.
''This is great for Democrats,'' said Larry J. Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. ''Georgia is as politically red as its clay, and I would still rate Deal a slight favorite, but not any more than that.''
The $2.3 million debt is the result of Mr. Deal's investment in Wilder Outdoors, a sporting goods store that his daughter, Carrie Wilder, and her husband, Clint, opened in 2006. Over the next few years, Mr. Deal agreed to take responsibility for a series of loans should the Wilders go bankrupt. They did in July 2009, after the store went out of business. Full payment on those loans is due Feb. 1, less than a month after Mr. Deal hopes to take office.
Other loans, for $2.85 million, are related to Mr. Deal's automobile salvage business. His campaign says that those debts are ordinary business liabilities and that his business is profitable and secured by $5 million in assets.
Mr. Deal acknowledges that his financial situation is dire but says he has the money to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure. He has listed one of his two houses for sale for its market value of $985,000.
''Obviously, this is going to be painful,'' he said in an interview. ''But I do have resources.''
He has tried to frame the story as the kind of financial hardship many Georgians are enduring.
''Nobody foresaw the current course of the economy several years ago,'' he said. ''My wife and I did what responsible parents do -- we supported our daughter. The situation that's happening to our daughter is not unlike what's happening to other Georgians.''
The Deal campaign has updated its disclosures to include the debt but contends that it was not required by state law to do so.
Mr. Deal's predicament has parallels to financial problems experienced by another Republican politician, Christine O'Donnell, the Tea Party-endorsed Senate candidate in Delaware who won in an upset in Tuesday's primary election. Ms. O'Donnell explained revelations that she had owed tens of thousands of dollars in campaign expenses, college tuition and unpaid taxes by saying, ''I think the fact that I have struggled financially is what makes me so sympathetic.''
But political experts say it will be harder for Mr. Deal to make lemonade of his lemons, primarily because of the scale of his debt.
''My parents might have given me a $10,000 loan,'' said Charles S. Bullock III, a political science professor at the University of Georgia. ''But $2 million?''
Voters have been divided in their reactions, with some empathetic and others upset.
''I want to know why he left it off his disclosure statement,'' said Gerald Davidson, 61, a lawyer and Democrat who attended the luncheon in Lawrenceville. ''It's hard to overlook that much money.''
But Emory Morsberger, a real estate developer and Republican, said Mr. Deal's struggles make him more sympathetic to business owners and entrepreneurs experiencing the recession.
''In American business, people take risks,'' Mr. Morsberger said. ''Most businesses are going through tough times these days.''
Even before the debt problems, Mr. Deal faced charges of ethical impropriety. In March, a week after he resigned from the House to run for governor, the Office of Congressional Ethics released a report concluding that Mr. Deal appeared to have improperly used his staff to pressure Georgia officials to continue a state vehicle inspection program that generated hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for his automobile salvage company.
He denied any wrongdoing, calling the accusations a ''politically motivated witch hunt.''
The Barnes campaign has been mostly silent on the debt issue. But in a sign that Democrats believe that the scandal has made the election winnable, the Democratic Governors Association last week donated $1 million to Mr. Barnes's campaign.
A spokesman for the group told The Journal-Constitution that Mr. Deal's ''personal finances are in no shape for him to run the state's finances.''

HEADLINE: Can You Steal a Whole Building? Thieves Cart Off St. Louis Bricks

BYLINE: By MALCOLM GAY

 BODY:
ST. LOUIS -- By the time Raymond Feemster awoke to the pounding of firefighters at his door, flames were already licking his shotgun-style home. The vacant house next door, which neighbors said was frequented by squatters, had burst into flames and was now threatening to engulf houses on each side.
Mr. Feemster, who gets around on an electric scooter, had to be carried out of the burning building, but today he considers himself lucky that the damage was contained to just two rooms. 
''My neighbor's house was completely destroyed,'' said Mr. Feemster, 58. ''I guess it was one of the crackheads in that vacant house.''
Perhaps. But the blaze, one of 391 fires at vacant buildings in the city over the past two years, may have had a more sinister cause. Law enforcement officials, politicians and historic preservationists here have concluded that brick thieves are often to blame, deliberately torching buildings to quicken their harvest of St. Louis brick, prized by developers throughout the South for its distinctive character.
''The firemen come and hose them down and shoot all that mortar off with the high-pressure hose,'' said Alderman Samuel Moore, whose predominantly black Fourth Ward has been hit particularly hard by brick thieves. When a thief goes to pick up the bricks after a fire, ''They're just laying there nice and clean.''
It is a crime that has increased with the recession. Where thieves in many cities harvest copper, aluminum and other materials from vacant buildings, brick rustling has emerged more recently as a sort of scrapper's endgame, exploited once the rest of a building's architectural elements have been exhausted. ''Cleveland is suffering from this,'' said Royce Yeater, Midwest director for the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ''I've also heard of it happening in Detroit.''
After the fire that devastated much of St. Louis in 1849, city leaders passed an ordinance requiring all new buildings to be made of noncombustible material. That law, along with the rich clays of eastern Missouri, led to a flourishing brick industry here. Historians say that at the industry's height, around 1900, the city had more than 100 manufacturing plants, and St. Louis became known for the quality, craftsmanship and abundance of its brick.
''They love it in New Orleans and the South -- wherever they're rebuilding, they want it because it's beautiful brick,'' said Barbara Buck, who owns Century Used Brick. ''It really gives the building a dimension, a fingerprint.''
Mr. Moore, who is drafting a bill that would increase the penalties for brick theft, said that while many thieves still used cables and picks to collapse a wall, arson had become the tool of choice. Thieves even set fire to wood-frame homes to create a diversion. Firefighters often knock down walls, making it easier for thieves to harvest the bricks.
''The whole block is gone -- they stole the whole block,'' Mr. Moore marveled as he drove his white Dodge Magnum through his ward's motley collection of dilapidated homes and vacant lots. ''They're stealing entire buildings, buildings that belong to the city. Where else in the world do you steal an entire city building?''
There are more than 8,000 vacant buildings in St. Louis, and more than 11,000 vacant lots.
The maximum penalty for brick theft here is a $500 fine or 90 days in jail or both. The city police said there were 34 brick-related thefts in the last year.
''You see these guys with mortar dust all over them, and they're stacking on a palette, and they'll say, 'I'm just a day laborer working for that guy over there -- whoa, where did he go?' '' said Maribeth McMahon, a lawyer with the city counselor's office. ''So this poor stiff, who's just trying to earn an hourly wage, gets a summons.''
Ms. Buck, who said thieves often arrived at her brickyard with ''bricks in the trunk of a Lexus,'' said she followed city ordinance and required brick vendors to produce a demolition permit to sell their bricks. A palette of 500 goes for roughly $100, she said, but other less scrupulous buyers do not require permits.
Ms. Buck estimates that as many as eight tractor-trailer loads of stolen bricks leave the city each week for Florida, Louisiana or Texas, because ''St. Louis brick is in such high demand.''
The toll on the city's struggling north side has been particularly heavy. During a hard-luck tour of his ward last week, Mr. Moore pointed out several piles of rubble where houses once stood.
Mature trees grew from the foundations of some, while others were missing entire walls, laying bare unsupported second floors, dangling electrical outlets and the remnants of those who once lived there -- their wallpaper, posters, toilets, clothing and curtains.
Rounding one fallen-down building, Mr. Moore encountered a lone thief as he piled bricks into the back of an S.U.V. Pushing the rear seats forward, the man had nearly filled his vehicle when Mr. Moore approached on foot.
''Put them all back, and I won't lock you up,'' Mr. Moore yelled as the man, dressed in a filthy T-shirt and ragged pajama bottoms, stopped in his tracks.
Apologizing, the man, who declined to give his name, said that he had been ''messing with bricks'' for only a week, and that he had never been asked for identification when selling his harvest.
''I don't even know the man,'' he said. ''You just pull up there and sell him your bricks.''
As the man drove off, Mr. Moore turned to head back to his office.
''He been doing bricks longer than a week,'' Mr. Moore groused. ''Those bricks will be gone tomorrow.''

HEADLINE: Providing Fresh Vegetables to a Community Where Fast Food Reigns

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ROOSEVELT, N.Y.
At 10:30 a.m. on Sunday, Kevin Freeland drives a white Ford van into the parking lot at the Freeport-Roosevelt Health Center in one of Long Island's poorest communities. Lettered on the side are the words Vets Transportation, and the van's 14 seats have been removed. Inside are 63 boxes of fresh produce he picked up from four farms on Long Island's East End that morning, after beginning his day at the shelter for homeless veterans where he's staying in Yaphank.
People, mostly women with small children and the elderly, begin to filter into the lot about the same time. They form a line of about 40 people and wait patiently for 10 minutes or so until one of the workers ushers them forward and the Roosevelt Community Farmers' Market opens at 11. 
This is not the new omnivore's playland of the Union Square Greenmarket or the ambitious farmers' markets you can find in Port Washington, Huntington or other affluent Long Island communities. There are no artisanal cheeses, heirloom tomatoes, $8 organic breads, grass-fed beef, spinach/goat cheese quiches or local musicians singing James Taylor songs. Instead it is just three tables full of fresh produce: corn, broccoli, eggplant, collard greens, lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, cilantro and the rest, neatly arrayed on tables under white Quik Shade canopy tents.
Still, if the bustling farmers' market is today's most coveted suburban amenity, this is one for those pretty much left out of the game. In a world where the slow-food, eat-local, simple-beats-processed gospel of Michael Pollan et al. tends to be the playbook only for those with a little (or a lot) extra to spend, Roosevelt's new market seems to be prospering, a small bit of food equity in a world where eating can be pretty Darwinian, too.
''Honestly, this is a blessing,'' said Mr. Freeland, a 45-year-old Navy veteran, who does two janitorial jobs, formerly owned a janitorial business in Atlanta and has been homeless since his apartment was flooded out this year. ''You get the food direct from the farm -- they're still cleaning it off when I get there. You can't get more fresh than that.''
The Roosevelt market is one of two on Long Island -- the other is in North Bellport -- organized by Sustainable Long Island, which works on sustainable agriculture and development projects, and the Long Island Farm Bureau in conjunction with other organizations and local groups, particularly in this case the Roosevelt Community Revitalization Group. The idea is to provide fresh food to communities where obesity, diabetes and high-cholesterol problems are epidemic and where local food options tend more to fast food than healthful ones. In addition to the produce, the market has featured nutritionists and health information.
''There seems to be this perception that low-income communities don't have the same needs and interests when it comes to food, and we do,'' said Clara Gillens-Eromosele, one of the leaders of the Roosevelt revitalization group. ''We're not looking to have more fast food in our community. We're looking to educate people about alternatives.''
In its first year, the market has succeeded beyond expectations. Total sales have increased from $260 in the first week to about $1,400 now. Still, the most popular currency is $24 in federal vouchers ($20 for eligible older people) that can be used only at farmers' markets. Whether people will participate after they've used the vouchers -- from WIC, the federal nutrition program -- isn't entirely clear.
On Sunday, people show up early, having heard that the market sells out each week well before the scheduled 4 p.m. closing time. A few take public transportation, like Constantine Mangos, 61, who took the bus from Hempstead. ''The corn last week was so fresh, I couldn't stop eating it,'' he said. ''I come religiously -- I should be in church.'' Most drive, from Roosevelt, Freeport, Uniondale and other nearby towns.
The broccoli, available for the first time, sells out first. Then the tomatoes; then almost everything but the first pumpkins of the season. The market closes down at 3, with whatever is left over given to local food pantries.
It may be a stretch to believe a once-a-week farmers' market will have a huge impact on eating patterns. Tavis Nembhard drove his grandmother, Avril Powell, still in her church dress, who bought three dozen ears of corn for herself and various family members. ''The kids want that big M,'' he said, referring to McDonald's. Still, in the warm sun, everyone happily lugging home burlap bags of corn and boxes of squash, eggplant, lettuce, peppers and the rest, it felt, at the least, like a step in the right direction.

HEADLINE: Hudson Tunnel Review Raises Fear for Project

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Few elected officials have ever inherited a public works project that promised as many benefits as the proposed Hudson River commuter train tunnel is supposed to deliver to the constituents of Gov. Chris Christie.
Advocates for the project, which would add a second pair of tracks between New Jersey and Manhattan, say it will reduce traffic congestion and pollution, shorten commuting times, increase suburban property values and create 6,000 construction jobs. Before Mr. Christie became New Jersey's governor in January, the state's elected officials had already lined up $6 billion for the project from agencies outside the state.
Despite everything that the project appeared to have going for it, Mr. Christie ordered a review this month of the tunnel's cost, a move that many supporters of the project worry could signal its undoing. 
During the 30-day review, digging will continue on the New Jersey side of the river, but no new work will begin. ''If I can't pay for it, we'll have to consider other options,'' Mr. Christie said last week.
On Friday, New Jersey's two senators, Frank R. Lautenberg and Robert Menendez, and several other Democratic officials appeared at the site where digging began last year and urged the governor to reconsider. ''Don't throw away $6 billion; don't throw away thousands of jobs,'' Mr. Lautenberg said.
If state officials conclude that the project will cost significantly more than the latest estimate, $8.7 billion, advocates fear that Mr. Christie will withdraw some or all of the state's share of that total and redirect it to highway repairs and other transportation projects, putting the tunnel at risk of being delayed or even scrapped.
Giant public works projects are infamous for costing far more than projected -- the ''Big Dig'' highway tunnel in Boston cost more than twice what was initially estimated -- but the Hudson tunnel project, which broke ground last summer, has not run over budget. Still, even some ardent supporters expect that it will.
''It's obvious there's going to be a couple billion dollars' shortfall,'' said Raymond J. Lesniak, a Democrat who is chairman of the Economic Growth Committee of the New Jersey State Senate. But Mr. Lesniak said the state should find a way to come up with the additional money rather than ''let that kill this project.'' He said Mr. Christie's decision to halt the project and review its cost was irresponsible because it could set back the schedule by several months.
Mr. Lesniak suggested covering the excess costs by charging $2 per ticket to commuters who use the new tunnel. But that money would not be collected for at least eight years because the project is scheduled to be completed in 2018.
On Thursday, the governor discussed the project with Ray LaHood, the federal transportation secretary. ''Given that this project represents the single largest transit investment ever made by the Federal Transit Administration, the secretary and governor agreed to have staff work together to further refine the estimated cost of the entire project,'' said Brian Farber, a spokesman for the transit administration.
The federal government has agreed to match the $3 billion that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey pledged to spend on the tunnel. But that carefully constructed financing plan could still unravel because the project's planners have not yet awarded contracts to dig under the river and through the bedrock of Manhattan to create a station deep below 34th Street.
Zoe Baldwin, the New Jersey advocate for the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, described the review as ''a very, very bad sign for the project.'' She said she would be ''shocked'' if the governor's move did not at least stretch out the timetable for completing the work.
Ms. Baldwin said the prospect of passing up the $3 billion that the federal government had offered reminded her of the New York Legislature's rejection of a congestion pricing system in Manhattan. That decision cost New York State $365 million in federal funding, Ms. Baldwin said. Scrapping the Hudson tunnel would be much costlier for New Jersey and the region's economy, she said.
''Killing this project would be an incredible loss for generations,'' Ms. Baldwin said. ''We can't do a single heavy-rail expansion in New Jersey without this project.''
But some commuter-rail advocates greeted the governor's review as an opportunity reborn. Jeff Tittel, the director of the Sierra Club in New Jersey, said state and federal officials should use the ''time out'' to reconsider the configuration of the project.
As proposed, the new tunnel would take trains from throughout northern New Jersey to a station more than 100 feet below street level at the foot of Macy's flagship store on 34th Street. Those tracks would not connect to Pennsylvania Station, a block away.
Mr. Tittel is part of the vocal camp that has argued that the new tunnel should connect to Penn Station, as it was originally designed to do. The National Association of Railroad Passengers last week urged commuters to tell their elected officials that the tunnel project was vital to the region, but that it must connect to the station.
Mr. Tittel pointed out that Amtrak, which owns Penn Station, had drawn up a long-term capital plan that called for a separate new tunnel under the Hudson River, at an estimated cost of $11 billion. That plan assumed that the New Jersey Transit tunnel would be built first. But Mr. Tittel argues that there must be a way to build one set of tunnels that would meet the needs of both railroads.
''I just can't believe that the federal government is going to pay for two separate sets of tunnels to the same area,'' Mr. Tittel said. ''I just don't see that happening.''
Despite the continuing swirl of opinions about how and whether to provide commuters another way into the city, there is one point on which almost all supporters and detractors agree: Unless Mr. Christie expresses strong support for the project after the review is over, the tunnel known as the Trans-Hudson Express is not going anywhere anytime soon.

HEADLINE: Arrest in Disputed Seas Riles China and Japan

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER and IAN JOHNSON; Martin Fackler reported from Tokyo, and Ian Johnson from Beijing.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- What started nearly two weeks ago with the Japanese Coast Guard's arrest of a Chinese trawler captain in disputed waters has snowballed into a heated diplomatic standoff between China and Japan, highlighting anxieties in Asia about China's rising power and assertiveness.
The standoff over the arrest, which took place in waters near uninhabited islands claimed by both countries, escalated Sunday as China announced that it had suspended high-level exchanges with Japan, and threatened additional ''strong countermeasures,'' after Tokyo said it would extend its detention of the captain. 
The captain, Zhan Qixiong, 41, was arrested on Sept. 8 after his fishing boat collided with two Japanese Coast Guard vessels near the islands.
The arrest, for obstructing officers on duty, quickly grew from a seemingly minor incident into a highly emotional issue in both countries, where it has become a top news item and has begun to spill over into other aspects of the two nations' extensive economic and political ties.
Since the arrest, there have been mass cancellations of trips to Japan by Chinese tourists and protests in front of Japanese diplomatic missions and schools in China, as well as tensions over the possibility of drilling for natural gas in contested waters in the East China Sea.
In a statement on Sunday, China's Foreign Ministry said Japan had ''seriously damaged Sino-Japan bilateral relations.'' Beijing suspended all relations between provincial and central government officials and their Japanese counterparts, including talks aimed at expanding aviation routes and cooperation on coal.
''We demand the Japanese side immediately release the Chinese captain unconditionally,'' said a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ma Zhaoxu. ''If the Japanese side clings obstinately to its course, making mistake upon mistake, then China will take strong countermeasures and Japan will bear all the consequences.''
The situation has also become a test of wills between Japan, the region's established power and now-fading economic giant, and China, a rising force that feels its time has come to take what it regards as its rightful place in Asia.
For Japan, the episode has fanned growing fears here that an increasingly powerful China will become ever more insistent in pressing territorial claims against its neighbors, and in trying to assert military control of ever-wider swaths of the waters around China. This anxiety has been one reason that Japan's year-old Democratic Party government, now under the newly re-elected prime minister Naoto Kan, toned down its calls for an East Asian community, and instead has sought to strengthen ties with Washington, its longtime protector.
Concern that Chinese pressure on Japan's borders will only grow has led to uncharacteristically strident calls in normally passive Japan to stand up to China's demands. Japanese news media have warned of a broader pattern of China's pushing its territorial claims, including recent disputes with Southeast Asian countries over the South China Sea.
''If China thinks that by taking a strong stance that Japan will just roll over, then it is mistaken,'' said an editorial in the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, Japan's largest daily.
For its part, China tends to see Japan as a proxy for the United States, whose cold-war-era alliances with Japan and other countries in the region now seem aimed at holding it back. Beijing wants to appear firm in defending its territorial claims, which Chinese people overwhelmingly believe are legitimate.
The angry emotions in China also reflect a thinly veiled animosity toward Japan that is rooted in Japan's brutal military occupation during World War II.
China's anti-Japan sentiment from the war has surfaced repeatedly despite the deep economic relations that have developed between the two countries. Revisions to Japanese textbooks that played down or ignored Japan's wartime atrocities in China and other colonized Asian countries have always been a sore point. Relations were aggravated, too, by repeated visits to a Japanese war shrine by Junichiro Koizumi, a former prime minister, during his 2001-6 term.
Indeed, the current dispute seems to have sent tensions to their highest point since Mr. Koizumi left office. It involves several uninhabited islands -- known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China -- in the East China Sea off Taiwan. Activists in many Chinese-speaking regions, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, have challenged Japan's claims to the islands, making it a test for Beijing and Tokyo.
The competing claims have been a source of tension before, most recently five years ago, when anti-Japanese protests erupted in some Chinese cities.
However, in a possible sign of the region's shifting power balance, China's demands seem a bit stronger, and Japan's response a bit more defensive. Since the arrest, the Chinese government has summoned the Japanese ambassador six times to protest, including one time in the early morning that was interpreted in Tokyo as a diplomatic slap in the face.
The most recent call came on Sunday, when the Foreign Ministry summoned the ambassador to make ''solemn representations'' to him about the detention of the captain, China's state-run Xinhua news agency said.
In addition, Chinese companies have canceled tours to Japan by 10,000 tourists.
Japan has complained about signs that China could begin drilling for natural gas in another contested area of the East China Sea, which would violate an agreement between the two nations to develop the area jointly. ''If we can find proof, our country will take appropriate measures,'' said Japan's foreign minister, Seiji Maehara.
Besides the captain, the Japanese Coast Guard detained the crew members, though they were later released along with their boat. On Sunday, a Japanese court approved a request by prosecutors to extend the captain's pretrial detention for 10 days.
China has repeatedly called for the captain's release, all the while trying to play down nationalist sentiment at home. On Saturday, groups of Chinese commemorated the 79th anniversary of Japan's invasion of northeast China with small protests in front of Japanese diplomatic missions.
Mr. Maehara said Friday that it was appropriate for the trawler captain's case to be handled in Japanese courts because the disputed islands are an ''integral part of Japanese territory''
''Territorial issues do not exist in this region,'' he said.
Chinese analysts said that China's leaders have concluded that Japan is trying to set an example. ''Japan is trying to get China to eat the bitter fruit'' of its sovereignty over the islands, said Wang Xiangsui, director of the Center for Security Strategy at the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. ''They want China to accept the fact that they control the islands.''

HEADLINE: THE NEW POOR; For the Unemployed Over 50, Fears of Never Working Again

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
VASHON ISLAND, Wash. -- Patricia Reid is not in her 70s, an age when many Americans continue to work. She is not even in her 60s. She is just 57.
But four years after losing her job she cannot, in her darkest moments, escape a nagging thought: she may never work again.
College educated, with a degree in business administration, she is experienced, having worked for two decades as an internal auditor and analyst at Boeing before losing that job.
But that does not seem to matter, not for her and not for a growing number of people in their 50s and 60s who desperately want or need to work to pay for retirement and who are starting to worry that they may be discarded from the work force -- forever. 
Since the economic collapse, there are not enough jobs being created for the population as a whole, much less for those in the twilight of their careers.
Of the 14.9 million unemployed, more than 2.2 million are 55 or older. Nearly half of them have been unemployed six months or longer, according to the Labor Department. The unemployment rate in the group -- 7.3 percent -- is at a record, more than double what it was at the beginning of the latest recession.
After other recent downturns, older people who lost jobs fretted about how long it would take to return to the work force and worried that they might never recover their former incomes. But today, because it will take years to absorb the giant pool of unemployed at the economy's recent pace, many of these older people may simply age out of the labor force before their luck changes.
For Ms. Reid, it has been four years of hunting -- without a single job offer. She buzzes energetically as she describes the countless applications she has lobbed through the Internet, as well as the online courses she is taking to burnish her software skills.
Still, when she is pressed, her can-do spirit falters.
''There are these fears in the background, and they are suppressed,'' said Ms. Reid, who is now selling some of her jewelry and clothes online and is late on some credit card payments. ''I have had nightmares about becoming a bag lady,'' she said. ''It could happen to anyone. So many people are so close to it, and they don't even realize it.''
Being unemployed at any age can be crushing. But older workers suspect their resumes often get shoved aside in favor of those from younger workers. Others discover that their job-seeking skills -- as well as some technical skills sought by employers -- are rusty after years of working for the same company.
Many had in fact anticipated working past conventional retirement ages to gird themselves financially for longer life spans, expensive health care and reduced pension guarantees.
The most recent recession has increased the need to extend working life. Home values, often a family's most important asset, have been battered. Stock portfolios are only now starting to recover. According to a Gallup poll in April, more than a third of people not yet retired plan to work beyond age 65, compared with just 12 percent in 1995.
Older workers who lose their jobs could pose a policy problem if they lose their ability to be self-sufficient. ''That's what we should be worrying about,'' said Carl E. Van Horn, professor of public policy and director of the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, ''what it means to this class of the new unemployables, people who have been cast adrift at a very vulnerable part of their career and their life.''
Forced early retirement imposes an intense financial strain, particularly for those at lower incomes. The recession and its aftermath have already pushed down some older workers. In figures released last week by the Census Bureau, the poverty rate among those 55 to 64 increased to 9.4 percent in 2009, from 8.6 percent in 2007.
But even middle-class people who might skate by on savings or a spouse's income are jarred by an abrupt end to working life and to a secure retirement.
''That's what I spent my whole life in pursuit of, was security,'' Ms. Reid said. ''Until the last few years, I felt very secure in my job.''
As an auditor, Ms. Reid loved figuring out the kinks in a manufacturing or parts delivery process. But after more than 20 years of commuting across Puget Sound to Boeing, Ms. Reid was exhausted when she was let go from her $80,000-a-year job.
Stunned and depressed, she sent out resumes, but figured she had a little time to recover. So she took vacations to Turkey and Thailand with her husband, who is a home repairman. She sought chiropractic treatments for a neck injury and helped nurse a priest dying of cancer.
Most of her days now are spent in front of a laptop, holed up in a lighthouse garret atop the house that her husband, Denny Mielock, built in the 1990s on a breathtaking piece of property overlooking the sound.
As she browses the job listings that clog her e-mail in-box, she refuses to give in to her fears. ''If I let myself think like that all the time,'' she said, ''I could not even bear getting out of bed in the morning.''
With her husband's home repair business pummeled by the housing downturn, the bills are mounting. Although the couple do not have a mortgage on their 3,000-square-foot house, they pay close to $7,000 a year in property taxes. The roof is leaking. Their utility bills can be $300 a month in the winter, even though they often keep the thermostat turned down to 50 degrees.
They could try to sell their home, but given the depressed housing market, they are reluctant.
''We are circling the drain here, and I am bailing like hell,'' said Ms. Reid, emitting an incongruous cackle, as if laughter is the only response to her plight. ''But the boat is still sinking.''
It is not just the finances that have destabilized her life.
Her husband worries that she isolates herself and that she does not socialize enough. ''We've both been hard workers our whole lives,'' said Mr. Mielock, 59. Ms. Reid sometimes rose just after 3 a.m. to make the hourlong commute to Boeing's data center in Bellevue and attended night school to earn a master's in management information systems.
''A job is more than a job, you know,'' Mr. Mielock said. ''It's where you fit in society.''
Here in the greater Seattle area, a fifth of those claiming extended unemployment benefits are 55 and older.
To help seniors polish their job-seeking skills, WorkSource, a local consortium of government and nonprofit groups, recently began offering seminars. On a recent morning, 14 people gathered in a windowless conference room at a local community college to get tips on how to age-proof their resumes and deflect questions about being overqualified.
Motivational posters hung on one wall, bearing slogans like ''Failure is the path of least persistence.''
Using PowerPoint slides, Liz Howland, the chipper but no-nonsense session leader, projected some common myths about older job-seekers on a screen: ''Older workers are less capable of evaluating information, making decisions and problem-solving'' or ''Older workers are rigid and inflexible and have trouble adapting to change.''
Ms. Howland, 61, ticked off the reasons those statements were inaccurate. But a clear undercurrent of anxiety ran through the room. ''Is it really true that if you have the energy and the passion that they will overlook the age factor?'' asked a 61-year-old man who had been laid off from a furniture maker last October.
Gallows humor reigned. As Ms. Howland -- who suggested that applicants remove any dates older than 15 years from their resume -- advised the group on how to finesse interview questions like ''When did you have the job that helped you develop that skill?'' one out-of-work journalist deadpanned: ''How about 'during the 20th century?' ''
During a break, Anne Richard, who declined to give her age, confessed she was afraid she would not be able to work again after losing her contract as a house director at a University of Washington sorority in June. Although she had 20 years of experience as an office clerk in Chattanooga, Tenn., she feared her technology skills had fallen behind.
''I don't feel like I can compete with kids who have been on computers all their lives,'' said Ms. Richard, who was sleeping on the couch of a couple she had met at church and contemplating imminent homelessness.
Older people who lose their jobs take longer to find work. In August, the average time unemployed for those 55 and older was slightly more than 39 weeks, according to the Labor Department, the longest of any age group. That is much worse than in August 1983, also after a deep recession, when someone unemployed in that age group spent an average of 27.5 weeks finding work.
At this year's pace of an average of 82,000 new jobs a month, it will take at least eight more years to create the 8 million positions lost during the recession. And that does not even allow for population growth.
Advocates for the elderly worry that younger people are more likely to fill the new jobs as well.
''I do think the longer someone is out of work, the more employers are going to question why it is that someone hasn't been able to find work,'' said Sara Rix, senior strategic policy adviser at AARP, the lobbying group for seniors. ''Their skills have atrophied for one thing, and technology changes so rapidly that even if nothing happened to the skills that you have, they may become increasingly less relevant to the jobs that are becoming available.''
In four years of job hunting, Ms. Reid has discovered that she is no longer technologically proficient. In one of a handful of interviews she has secured, for an auditing position at the Port of Seattle, she learned that the job required skills in PeopleSoft, financial software she had never used. She assumes that deficiency cost her the job.
Ms. Reid is still five years away from being eligible for Social Security. But even then, she would be drawing early, which reduces monthly payments. Taking Social Security at 62 means a retiree would receive a 25 percent lower monthly payout than if she worked until 66.
Ms. Reid is in some ways luckier than others. Boeing paid her a six-month severance, and she has health care benefits that cover her and her husband for $40 a month.
And she admits some regrets: she had a $180,000 balance in her 401(k) account, and paid $80,000 in penalties and taxes when she cashed it out early. She did not rein in her expenses right away. And now, her $500-a-week unemployment benefits have been exhausted.
She has since cut back, forgoing Nordstrom shopping sprees and theater subscriptions, but also cutting out red meat at home and putting off home repairs.
In order to qualify for accounting posts, she is taking an online training course in QuickBooks, a popular accounting software used by small businesses. She recently signed up for a tax course at an H&R Block tax preparation office in Seattle.
And she is plugging ahead with her current plan: to send out 600 applications to accounting firms in the area, offering her services for the next tax season. Eventually, she wants to open her own business.
With odd jobs and her husband's -- albeit shriveled -- earnings, she could stagger along. For now, she stitches together an income by gardening for neighbors, helping fellow church members with their computers, and participating in Internet surveys for as little as $5 apiece.
''You don't necessarily have to go through the door,'' Ms. Reid said. ''You can go around it and go under it. I can be very creative. I think that I will eventually manage to pull this together.''
THE NEW POOR: Articles in this series are examining the struggle to recover from the widespread strains of the Great Recession.

HEADLINE: Fed Is Expected to Discuss More Ways to Revive Economy

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With tax rates at the center of the debate over how to revive the stalled recovery, the Federal Reserve is likely to spend its policy meeting on Tuesday weighing the merits of additional steps to stimulate the economy, while deferring some major decisions until later this year.
The meeting will be the Federal Open Market Committee's last scheduled gathering before the midterm elections. And given that the central bank studiously tries to stay outside the fray, the politically delicate moment and the mixed economic indicators of recent weeks suggest that the Fed will hold off for now on a pivotal decision: whether to try to further stimulate the economy by resuming large-scale purchases of Treasury securities to push record-low interest rates even lower. 
The central bank took a crucial step toward renewed stimulus last month when it voted to use money the Fed receives from its huge portfolio of mortgage-backed securities to buy long-term Treasury debt. Though fairly modest in scope, the action raised the possibility that the Fed might resume the asset purchases, a strategy known as quantitative easing.
The Fed concluded a major program of such easing in March. The idea behind easing is to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates. Short-term rates, over which the Fed has more direct influence, have already been at nearly zero since the end of 2008.
At the Fed's annual policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., late last month, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, made clear he was prepared to take additional action to forestall the danger that the American economy might fall into deflation, a sustained period of falling prices like the one that has afflicted Japan since the early 1990s.
Although the Fed considers that danger remote, it is worried because inflation is running at only about half the desired level of about 2 percent, while unemployment stands at 9.6 percent.
The committee's Aug. 10 meeting was dominated by a vigorous discussion over the decision to reinvest the mortgage-related bond proceeds -- an approach Mr. Bernanke favored. The meeting on Tuesday will probably be used to assess actions the committee might take at its meetings on Nov. 2 and 3 and Dec. 14.
''Officials are likely to spend much of the session debating the pros and cons of the various stimulus options so that they can be ready to act should future data prove disappointing,'' Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report last week.
Continued ''fiscal gridlock'' -- an inability to reach agreement on how to handle the impending expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts -- would put pressure on the Fed to act, Mr. Berner added. A second round of quantitative easing could lower the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to 2 percent, from its current level of about 2.75 percent, he estimated.
Laurence H. Meyer, an economic forecaster and former Fed governor, said additional quantitative easing would have a meaningful effect on the economy but would not be a ''game changer.''
The Fed could announce that it was buying an additional $2 trillion in securities -- nearly doubling its $2.3 trillion balance sheet, which is already two and a half times where it stood before the financial crisis in 2008. Or it could take a more incremental approach, by buying a modest amount of securities and leaving the door open for more.
Mr. Meyer estimated that the ''shock-and-awe option'' would raise economic growth 0.3 percentage point in 2011 and 0.4 percentage point in 2012, but that unemployment would remain high: 9.2 percent at the end of 2011 and 7.7 percent by the end of 2012.
Even if the effects are modest, many economists are expecting eventual Fed action. ''Given the likelihood that unemployment will remain unacceptably high for the foreseeable future, more quantitative easing is looking more and more like an agenda item for the Fed, whether it actually works to stimulate job growth or not,'' Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse, wrote in a report last week.
Fed officials have made few public comments in recent weeks, making an evaluation of committee sentiment harder than usual.
Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said in a Sept. 1 speech in Houston that uncertainty over taxes and regulation had caused companies to sit on cash and banks to hold reserves at the Fed rather than make loans.
Mr. Fisher said he would be reluctant to resume large-scale asset purchases, which he said ''might be pushing on a string,'' and possibly set off future inflation.
''For me, the ball is in the fiscal court for now,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''Any further action by the Fed must be subject to the kind of rigorous cost-benefit analysis that Ben Bernanke cited in Jackson Hole.''
Mr. Fisher said that officials had been crafting and enforcing tax and regulatory policy ''in a capricious manner that makes long-term planning, including expanding payrolls, difficult, if not impossible.'' He added: ''The Fed is not the end-all for curing every economic pathology.''
In a Sept. 8 speech in Missoula, Mont., Narayana R. Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis Fed, cited statistics about job openings to argue that the high unemployment rate was being fed not so much by a lack of positions per se but by a mismatch of locations and skills.
''The mismatch problems in the labor market do not strike me as readily amenable to the kinds of monetary policy tools currently available to the Fed,'' he said. ''But they may well be amenable to other types of policy tools, like job retraining programs or foreclosure mitigation strategies.''
Mr. Kocherlakota also responded to recent reports about Fed dissension.
''We are unabashed technocrats, seeking to solve an unabashedly technical problem: how do we manage monetary policy so as to ensure lower unemployment and maintain inflation at an appropriate rate?'' he said. Disagreements, he added, ''ultimately stem from different assessments of the complicated economic situation and not from political differences.''

HEADLINE: As Obama Faces Issues, Domestic and Foreign, An Election Day Test

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
For Democratic candidates, the last two weeks have been a welcome break from a summer of distraction.
Debates about a mosque near ground zero have faded, and the cable-news-fueled saga about comments by an Agriculture Department official is over. The threat by a Florida pastor to burn the Koran has passed, and President Obama has sharpened his rhetorical attacks on Republicans.
But as the first full week of the 2010 general election season opens across the country on Monday, Washington is scheduled once again to debate immigration and gay men, lesbians and bisexuals in the military, two deeply divisive social issues that threaten to polarize the conversation on the campaign trail. 
And with only six weeks until Election Day, Mr. Obama will end the week with a two-day United Nations summit in New York, temporarily setting aside domestic concerns about the economy to focus on Middle East peace, Iran and North Korea.
Taken together, the events of the week ahead promise to make it tougher for Democratic candidates who are struggling to reassure voters that improving the economy and generating jobs are their highest priorities.
Both social issues are embedded in military spending legislation scheduled for debate on the floor of the Senate by the middle of the week.
In the first, senators will debate the Dream Act, a measure that would provide a path to citizenship for students who are illegal immigrants but who have lived in the United States for five years and have completed either two years of college or served for two years in the military.
Efforts to move forward on the Dream Act could help the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, whose re-election bid depends in part on turnout of Hispanic voters in his state. But other Democratic candidates fear the issue will energize anti-immigration activists, much like the controversial Arizona law authorizing police action did this summer.
The annual military bill is also the vehicle for a repeal of the military's ''don't ask, don't tell'' ban on gay men, lesbians and bisexuals serving openly in the armed forces.
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, backed the repeal this year and said the making of new rules would be guided by a Pentagon study due at the end of the year.
But some opponents in Congress - notably Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona - have objected to a vote on the policy's repeal before the study is completed. In fiery comments on the floor of the Senate last week, Mr. McCain accused Mr. Reid and Democrats of pandering to a election-year constituency.
''I regret that the Armed Services Committee has evolved into a forum for the social agenda of the liberal left,'' Mr. McCain said.
His opposition has already generated reaction outside of Congress, too. In a Twitter message, the pop music star Lady Gaga wrote, ''Senator John McCain is attempting to stop the don't ask don't tell repeal vote this Tuesday, with a filibuster.''
Mr. Obama will try to keep the focus on the economy at the beginning of the week by participating in a jobs-focused town-hall-style meeting to be broadcast live on CNBC. And on Wednesday, he is scheduled to highlight the benefits of the patient's bill of rights included in his health care legislation this year.
But the attention will shift to foreign policy when Mr. Obama addresses the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, meets with foreign leaders and hosts a gathering of leaders from Southeast Asia.
The timing of the gathering is largely out of the control of the White House. But for Democratic candidates hoping to stay on message, it is not ideal.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

PERSON: William Coblenz 

HEADLINE: William Coblentz, California Power Broker, Dies at 88

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
William Coblentz, who helped shape California's postwar history -- battling Gov. Ronald Reagan as a liberal university regent, representing Patricia Hearst and the Jefferson Airplane as a lawyer, shepherding major building projects as a power broker -- died on Sept. 13 in San Francisco. He was 88.
His daughter, Wendy, confirmed the death. 
Mr. Coblentz (pronounced KAHB-lenz) was a fixture of the California establishment, with political roots in the administration of Gov. Pat Brown and membership in San Francisco's prestigious Bohemian Club. He was one of the bigwigs who met in the St. Francis Hotel in 1967 to choose a lawyer named Joseph Alioto to run for mayor. Mr. Alioto went on to serve two terms.
Not only did Mr. Coblentz pop up in the must-read newspaper columns of Herb Caen (once for being sprayed by a skunk), he also negotiated Mr. Caen's contracts with The San Francisco Chronicle.
But it was after Reagan used attacks against the University of California to be elected governor in 1966 that Mr. Coblentz gained fame. He had been appointed a regent of the state's university system by Governor Brown in 1964.
Reagan denounced the university's ''spirit of permissiveness'' as he quelled student disturbances and imposed tuition. Mr. Coblentz defended professors and lecturers, including the African-American radicals Angela Davis and Eldridge Cleaver.
Mr. Coblentz himself was at home in a tie and was shocked when the Jefferson Airplane invited him to a dinner where each guest had two joints by his plate.
In an oral history interview in 2002, Mr. Coblentz, who oversaw the group's bank account at the time, told of the Airplane's Grace Slick wanting to buy a Mercedes. Ms. Slick refused a cashier's check and asked for cash, which she stuffed in her bra. Two days later, she wrecked the car. She had no insurance.
Mr. Coblentz came to represent the Airplane and other groups, including the Grateful Dead, through his association with the rock impresario Bill Graham. They met when local complaints threatened to keep Mr. Graham's Fillmore Auditorium from opening.
To show the Fillmore was not a blight on a fine neighborhood, Mr. Coblentz had a friend stake out a hotel across the street known to be a house of ill repute. The friend photographed policemen entering. After Mr. Coblentz shared the photos with the Board of Permit Appeals, the Fillmore was approved.
Mr. Coblentz knew Catherine Hearst as a fellow regent, and when her daughter Patricia was kidnapped by a group of radicals calling themselves the Symbionese Liberation Army in 1974, she and her husband, Randolph, hired Mr. Coblentz. He spoke with the S.L.A. for the Hearsts.
One job was arranging the donation of $2 million in food to the poor demanded by the S.L.A. Another was representing two members of the group charged with murder. Mr. Hearst had reasoned that the kidnappers might appreciate free high-priced legal help for their comrades. The members nonetheless soon switched to public defenders.
''They didn't like us, we didn't like them, but they were entitled, as we say, to their day in court,'' Mr. Coblentz said.
William Kraemer Coblentz was born in Santa Maria, Calif., on July 28, 1922. A doctor's son, he worked at a drugstore as a teenager; graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with an economics degree; and served in the Army Corps of Engineers in the American South during World War II. He graduated from Yale Law School in 1947.
Mr. Coblentz practiced law in California and became involved with Democratic Party politics. That led to working as an assistant to Mr. Brown, when he was state attorney general and then when he was governor.
The governor offered Mr. Coblentz a judgeship, but he asked to be a university regent. Terms were 16 years, and for the last two years, from 1978 to 1980, Mr. Coblentz was chairman.
As a member and chairman, Mr. Coblentz was the force behind the regents' decision to appeal the Bakke case to the United States Supreme Court.
The case involved Allan Bakke, a white applicant to the medical school of the University of California, Davis, who claimed he was the victim of reverse discrimination and had been passed over in favor of less-qualified blacks. Lower courts had ruled in his favor.
The high court, in a fractured ruling with six different opinions, outlawed racial quotas but left consideration of race as a possibility. It also ordered Mr. Bakke's admission to the medical school.
Interpretations of the ruling have varied, but Mr. Coblentz contended that the case indisputably helped the California university system by showing that it cared for minorities and that it would defend itself vigorously.
Mr. Coblentz later developed a reputation as one of San Francisco's most adroit land-use lawyers, helping steer major projects like AT&T Park, the San Francisco Giants' baseball stadium, through the regulatory labyrinth. As a member of the San Francisco Airport Commission for 16 years, he successfully pushed for free luggage carts like those in foreign airports. A boarding area is to be named for him.
In addition to his daughter, Mr. Coblentz is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Jean Berlin; his son, Andy; his sister, Lolita Erlanger; and four grandchildren.
Mr. Coblentz, who had a habit of taking the Christmas Day janitorial shift in his office, once called Mr. Reagan ''a menopausal Cary Grant'' and never apologized. When he retired as a regent in 1980, he was startled when Mr. Reagan appeared in a video tribute.
''Bill, you and I have had our differences,'' the future president said. ''But let bygones be bygones. If you support me, I may make you the next ambassador to Afghanistan.''

HEADLINE: Tech Firms Fight European Limits on Cloud Computing

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
BERLIN -- In the world of ideas, cloud computing has the potential to revolutionize the way people work.
By bundling the processing power of thousands of computer servers, a company, for example, could allow two employees from different countries who speak different languages to communicate directly by phone, using voice recognition software to process what is being said and translation programs to interpret it into another language.
The result, ideally, would be a seamless conversation, without struggle and without the limitations of speaking a foreign language.
''We're not quite there yet, but it's coming,'' Eric E. Schmidt, the chief executive of Google, a promoter of the technology, said at a gathering of cellphone industry executives after evoking the image at a convention in Barcelona in February. 
Such cloud-based breakthroughs face a formidable obstacle in Europe, however: strict privacy laws that place rigid limits on the movement of information beyond the borders of the 27-country European Union.
European governments fear that personal information could fall prey to aggressive marketers and cybercriminals once it leaves the jurisdictions of individual members, a concern that may protect consumers but one that hinders the free flow of data essential to cloud computing
''There are restrictions on cloud computing in Europe,'' said Bob Lindsay, privacy director in Europe for Hewlett-Packard, which makes servers and other equipment for cloud data centers. ''This isn't killing the business, but it is slowing its evolution, compared with what is taking place in the United States.''
Cloud computing, which allows companies to tap enormous computing power via the Internet without having to invest in the infrastructure themselves, has grown rapidly in the United States under a legal system that permits the sale and transfer of many forms of private data.
For its clients, the lure of cloud computing is the savings made possible by cutting in-house corporate information technology departments and hardware and software purchases.
According to the research firm Gartner, global sales of cloud services will rise 17 percent this year, to $68.3 billion from $58.6 billion in 2009.
About half of what Gartner defines to be cloud services are, in fact, the computing power involved in the display and tracking of Internet ads. The rest is sales of computing services, mostly to large businesses.
Global sales of cloud services are poised nearly to double by 2012, to $102.1 billion, Gartner estimates. But Europe is expected to remain a relatively modest user of cloud services, accounting for only $18 billion this year, or about 26 percent of the global total. By 2012, Gartner estimates, Europe's proportion of global cloud sales will rise to 29 percent, even though the bloc's economy is larger than that of the United States.
Facing legal obstacles in Europe, the U.S. businesses with the greatest stake in cloud computing -- primarily Microsoft, Google, H.P. and Oracle -- are lobbying lawmakers to loosen restrictions on cross-border data transfers. Alternatively, some are developing new methods to make cloud computing work within Europe's complicated legal landscape.
At the H.P. Labs in Bristol, England, researchers are devising ways to encrypt data before it is sent into a cloud computing center and then decrypt it after it leaves the cloud, thus addressing the privacy concerns of many European governments.
Another solution being studied is to give individuals the ability in advance to set the degree of privacy control on each part of their personal information in the cloud by digitally tagging bits of the data. Under this model, a person could make an e-mail address available to marketers, while shielding a phone number and street address from unwanted solicitations.
In that aim, H.P. plans to begin testing new software that complies with European privacy laws this year. Called H.P. Privacy Advisor, the software will handle the transfer of data between H.P. offices within Europe as well as to those outside of the Union.
''The benefits and impact of the cloud are so great, and the legislative and technical issues are what they are at the moment,'' said Siani Pearson, one of H.P.'s lead researchers on cloud computing technologies at its laboratory in Bristol. ''But we can make sure that the benefits of the cloud come even within the existing framework.''
In Europe, the legal definition of what constitutes personal data is much broader than it is in the United States, extending to information like names, addresses and phone numbers in phone books.
Another obstacle is the European Data Privacy Directive, the main body of European law governing international data transfers, which generally prohibits the movement of E.U. data outside the external borders of the European Union.
The European Commission has approved only a handful of other countries to provide cloud computing services -- the United States, Argentina and Canada. Israel and Andorra have applied for approval to be designated as computing centers.
Companies that want to process E.U. data in countries that have not been approved-- India and Malaysia are growing hubs for cloud computing data centers -- must negotiate and enter into binding legal agreements with data processors called service level agreements, which ensure that the personal information of E.U. citizens will be handled in accordance with E.U. regulations.
But such agreements, while increasingly common, are costly, time-consuming to prepare and difficult to enforce, said Mr. Lindsay, H.P.'s privacy director, who is based in Milton Keynes, England. Backers of cloud computing technology are hoping the European Commission will loosen the rules applying to international data transfers during the review of its data protection directive, which was drafted in 1995, in the early days of the Internet.
During the review, which began last year and is not expected to be completed before mid-2011, companies like Microsoft have urged the commission to streamline existing laws on international data transfers.
The laws require companies to get the approval of several national data protection regulators for a single data transfer flowing through their jurisdictions.
Under this framework, a Microsoft affiliate in Bulgaria, for example, seeking to send Bulgarian consumer data to a cloud center in the United States, might have to apply for and receive approval from regulators in a series of countries along the transmission route, which in this case could include Romania, Hungary, Austria, Germany and the Netherlands.
In a letter sent in December 2009, John Vassallo, Microsoft's associate general counsel in Brussels, asked the commission to change the E.U.'s data protection directive to assign varying levels of privacy restrictions to different kinds of data, which could ease the transfer of some personal information, like names and addresses, for commercial marketing purposes if consumers gave their consent.
''As the patchwork of worldwide data protection laws has become increasingly difficult to navigate,'' Mr. Vassallo wrote to the commissioners, ''Microsoft has repeatedly called for a comprehensive, workable global privacy framework that is consistent, flexible, transparent and principles-based.''
Should the commission loosen the bloc's restrictive privacy controls, which is not guaranteed, European businesses, with their own multimillion-euro investments in in-house computer systems, employees and procedures, still might not rush to cloud computing.
That is because European businesses, in general, are more reluctant than their U.S. counterparts to abandon their own costly investments in computing infrastructure and experiment with emerging technologies like cloud computing, said Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the Computer Lab at Cambridge University in England.
''European industry is an awful lot sleepier than industry in the United States,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''The tech industry has its center of gravity in the U.S.A. You will tend to find that it is high-tech firms there that are the keenest adopters of new technology.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Angry Rich

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Anger is sweeping America. True, this white-hot rage is a minority phenomenon, not something that characterizes most of our fellow citizens. But the angry minority is angry indeed, consisting of people who feel that things to which they are entitled are being taken away. And they're out for revenge.
No, I'm not talking about the Tea Partiers. I'm talking about the rich. 
These are terrible times for many people in this country. Poverty, especially acute poverty, has soared in the economic slump; millions of people have lost their homes. Young people can't find jobs; laid-off 50-somethings fear that they'll never work again.
Yet if you want to find real political rage -- the kind of rage that makes people compare President Obama to Hitler, or accuse him of treason -- you won't find it among these suffering Americans. You'll find it instead among the very privileged, people who don't have to worry about losing their jobs, their homes, or their health insurance, but who are outraged, outraged, at the thought of paying modestly higher taxes.
The rage of the rich has been building ever since Mr. Obama took office. At first, however, it was largely confined to Wall Street. Thus when New York magazine published an article titled ''The Wail Of the 1%,'' it was talking about financial wheeler-dealers whose firms had been bailed out with taxpayer funds, but were furious at suggestions that the price of these bailouts should include temporary limits on bonuses. When the billionaire Stephen Schwarzman compared an Obama proposal to the Nazi invasion of Poland, the proposal in question would have closed a tax loophole that specifically benefits fund managers like him.
Now, however, as decision time looms for the fate of the Bush tax cuts -- will top tax rates go back to Clinton-era levels? -- the rage of the rich has broadened, and also in some ways changed its character.
For one thing, craziness has gone mainstream. It's one thing when a billionaire rants at a dinner event. It's another when Forbes magazine runs a cover story alleging that the president of the United States is deliberately trying to bring America down as part of his Kenyan, ''anticolonialist'' agenda, that ''the U.S. is being ruled according to the dreams of a Luo tribesman of the 1950s.'' When it comes to defending the interests of the rich, it seems, the normal rules of civilized (and rational) discourse no longer apply.
At the same time, self-pity among the privileged has become acceptable, even fashionable.
Tax-cut advocates used to pretend that they were mainly concerned about helping typical American families. Even tax breaks for the rich were justified in terms of trickle-down economics, the claim that lower taxes at the top would make the economy stronger for everyone.
These days, however, tax-cutters are hardly even trying to make the trickle-down case. Yes, Republicans are pushing the line that raising taxes at the top would hurt small businesses, but their hearts don't really seem in it. Instead, it has become common to hear vehement denials that people making $400,000 or $500,000 a year are rich. I mean, look at the expenses of people in that income class -- the property taxes they have to pay on their expensive houses, the cost of sending their kids to elite private schools, and so on. Why, they can barely make ends meet.
And among the undeniably rich, a belligerent sense of entitlement has taken hold: it's their money, and they have the right to keep it. ''Taxes are what we pay for civilized society,'' said Oliver Wendell Holmes -- but that was a long time ago.
The spectacle of high-income Americans, the world's luckiest people, wallowing in self-pity and self-righteousness would be funny, except for one thing: they may well get their way. Never mind the $700 billion price tag for extending the high-end tax breaks: virtually all Republicans and some Democrats are rushing to the aid of the oppressed affluent.
You see, the rich are different from you and me: they have more influence. It's partly a matter of campaign contributions, but it's also a matter of social pressure, since politicians spend a lot of time hanging out with the wealthy. So when the rich face the prospect of paying an extra 3 or 4 percent of their income in taxes, politicians feel their pain -- feel it much more acutely, it's clear, than they feel the pain of families who are losing their jobs, their houses, and their hopes.
And when the tax fight is over, one way or another, you can be sure that the people currently defending the incomes of the elite will go back to demanding cuts in Social Security and aid to the unemployed. America must make hard choices, they'll say; we all have to be willing to make sacrifices.
But when they say ''we,'' they mean ''you.'' Sacrifice is for the little people.

HEADLINE: Tea Party Victory Opens Rift Between Moderate and Conservative Republicans

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The few remaining Republican centrists in the Senate were eagerly awaiting the arrival of Michael N. Castle of Delaware, a longtime and reliable moderate voice who could provide some counterbalance to the wave of conservatives poised to enter Congress and the steadily rightward shift of party leaders.
But Mr. Castle was defeated in his party primary on Tuesday by Christine O'Donnell, a Tea Party insurgent. And while the conservative wing rejoiced, the surprise outcome raised serious questions about the future place in the party of lawmakers like Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine and other Republicans in the Senate and House who are not lock-step conservatives. 
Senator Jim DeMint, the South Carolina Republican who has seen his stature rise through his support of conservative candidates, made it clear in the aftermath of the Delaware upset that he would prefer losing a seat to Democrats than having Republican colleagues who stray from the conservative line and erode party unity and image by voting for policies supported by the Obama administration.
The ascendancy of the right is forcing even some of the most loyal Republicans, like Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the No. 3 Senate Republican, to defend their conservative bona fides. And it seems to be dashing the hopes among moderates that the prospect of winning a majority in the House, and a pursuit of independent voters, would push Republican leaders to the middle.
''We can't be a majority party if we can't appeal across the spectrum, if we have an exclusionary approach in general,'' said Ms. Snowe, who considers Mr. Castle a personal friend and was crestfallen by his defeat.
''A 100 percent ideological purity test -- I don't live in that utopian world; it's not reflective of the real world,'' she added. ''I hope that's not the approach.''
Ms. Snowe, in an interview, expressed surprise at the decision by Delaware Republicans. ''He has just been the highest caliber, an outstanding public servant for the people of Delaware and the country,'' she said.
In 2008, Maine defied the national wave that lifted Democrats to big majorities in the House and Senate and re-elected Ms. Collins even as Republican incumbents fell in more conservative states like Alaska and North Carolina. At the time, she emphasized her independence and her willingness to work across the aisle and compromise, dispatching her opponent with ease.
In the spring, Ms. Collins said that she hoped what appeared to be the virtually certain arrival of Mr. Castle from Delaware, on the heels of the election of Scott P. Brown in Massachusetts in January, would make the Senate a less lonely place for moderates and that Northeastern Republicans seemed to be ''leading our party back out of the wilderness.''
Ms. Collins, who provided a key vote in support of President Obama's economic stimulus plan and backed the Wall Street regulatory overhaul, said Mr. Castle's defeat had come as a shock. She attributed the rise of the conservatives to a backlash against Obama administration policies.
''It is stunning that he could be defeated in a primary, and it is very troubling to me,'' Ms. Collins said in the recent interview. ''I believe it is a reaction of the overreaching of the Obama administration and people's fear and worry about the economy.''
But some Maine Republicans now say Ms. Snowe should be replaced with a more conservative candidate when she is up for re-election in 2012.
And while other Republicans with moderate credentials, including Representative Mark Steven Kirk of Illinois, still have a good chance of winning in November, none would arrive in the Senate with the moderate stamp and stature of Mr. Castle, who has served in the House for 18 years, and is both well-known and respected in both parties.
Though the number of moderates may be small, with the partisan margins certain to be much tighter in the Senate next year no matter which party is in control, centrists will still be able to wield influence given the importance of every individual vote.
Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who is retiring after this year, said that he, too, believed the primary voters were driven largely by frustration over federal spending and the economy.
Mr. Gregg said that Republicans should focus on fiscal responsibility, which unites their party. ''If we go on some tangent that has nothing to do with spending and debt,'' he said, ''that will be overplaying our hand.''
While the two Maine senators are usually viewed as the Republicans most likely to cross the aisle, others have been known to break from the party's generally conservative stance, including Senators Robert F. Bennett of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom were ousted by challengers from the right.
Given the rising influence of the Tea Party, the votes of all Republicans are likely to be scrutinized and come under Tea Party fire if lawmakers stray.
If Republican leaders in Congress are privately bemoaning the Tea Party insurrection that is toppling such established lawmakers, they are being careful not to show it.
Virtually the entire Senate Republican leadership attended a fund-raiser on Capitol Hill last Thursday for Sharron Angle, the Tea Party candidate who won the Republican nomination to run against the majority leader, Harry Reid, in Nevada.
Still, the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has stressed a ''big tent'' approach, saying the party welcomes and represents a broad range of views.
But Mr. McConnell himself ended up on the losing side of the Senate primary in his home state, when he backed Trey Grayson, the state treasurer, over the Tea Party candidate and eventual winner, Rand Paul.
Senate Republicans do not deny that Mr. DeMint has opened a rift. ''It is a new and shocking development to have a member of our conference opposing incumbent Republicans,'' Ms. Collins said, adding that she doubted voters in her state could be ''influenced by the actions of a senator from South Carolina.''

HEADLINE: Moynihan in His Own Words

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
He sniffed at Hillary Rodham Clinton's smugness, denounced Spiro T. Agnew as a demagogue, opposed Pamela Harriman's application to a prestigious Manhattan club and called the Peace Corps elitist. He presciently raised the specter of global warming, advocated for safer cars and championed equal rights and recognition for women, especially his wife.
He huffed about the defense establishment that produced over-reaching military advice about Vietnam, fretted about making enough money, objected to being branded a neoconservative, never recovered from being misunderstood or misrepresented for suggesting that the rhetoric of race would benefit from ''benign neglect'' and, after Watergate, expressed profound misgivings about having gone to work for President Richard M. Nixon. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, adviser to three presidents, a four-term United States senator from New York and a prolific author, posthumously reveals his insights into personalities and public policy in thousands of pages of intimate and candid correspondence that has been culled from the Library of Congress to produce ''Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Portrait in Letters of an American Visionary,'' which PublicAffairs is to publish next month.
Excerpts from the book, edited by Steven R. Weisman, a former reporter for The New York Times who is the editorial director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, appear this week in New York magazine.
The letters range from recollections about growing up (his neighborhood in Manhattan, Hell's Kitchen, was so completely Irish, he said, that ''I didn't really learn I was Irish until I joined the Navy'') to a request to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery. He was buried there after his death in 2003.
Nothing escaped his attention. He complained to Brooks Brothers about the holes in his socks, urged Mr. Nixon to reverse a Johnson administration austerity measure and use floodlights to illuminate the White House exterior. He described the Peace Corps as: ''a rip-off by the upper middle classes. Fortunes spent to send Amherst boys for an interesting learning experience in Venezuela,'' paid for by ''men equally young pumping gas on the New Jersey Turnpike.''
In 1965, W. Willard Wirtz, President Lyndon B. Johnson's labor secretary, described Mr. Moynihan's report on threats to the black nuclear family as ''nine pages of dynamite about the Negro situation.'' Mr. Moynihan wrote to Mr. Johnson, perhaps invoking their shared upbringing: ''You were born poor. You were brought up poor. Yet you came of age full of ambition, energy and ability. Because your mother and father gave it to you. The richest inheritance any child can have is a stable, loving, disciplined family life.''
He would later describe Mr. Johnson as ''the first American president to be toppled by a mob. No matter that it was a mob of college professors, millionaires, flower children and Radcliffe girls.''
Fully a year before his 1970 memo to Mr. Nixon recommending that the acrimonious issue of race ''could benefit from a period of benign neglect,'' he explained that to ''de-escalate the rhetoric of crisis'' ''does not mean reducing efforts. Not at all. But it does mean trying to create some equivalence between what government can do about certain problems and how much attention it draws to them.''
When a Georgia man sent Mr. Moynihan $5 to get a haircut and complained that Mr. Nixon was destroying ''the white people of the South,'' he replied, ''It would not be appropriate for me to use the money for personal adornment or otherwise, but I do mean to add it to my annual contribution to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.''
He recounted a conversation between Mrs. Clinton and a health-care policy expert: ''He had studied the subject all his life, she had studied the subject three weeks and already knows more than he.'' (Mrs. Clinton wrote Mr. Moynihan in 2000: ''If I had listened to you about health care in 1994, I would be far better off today -- but more importantly -- so would the nation's health care system.'')
In 1989, he wrote the Century Association, the Stanford White clubhouse for New York's cultural, political and professional elite, regarding an application from Mrs. Harriman, widow of the former governor for whom Mr. Moynihan once worked. During his 1976 Senate campaign, she supported a rival and claimed that Mr. Moynihan drank too much.
''I am asked to support the nomination of Pamela Harriman. I regret that I write with the opposite purpose,'' he began. He said she had slandered him ''in the most vicious and hurtful terms.'' He had never entered her Washington home, he said, and ''it is depressing to say this, but I would find it difficult to enter the Century were there any prospect of this person being there.'' (She was nonetheless admitted the following year.)
He could be as judgmental about himself as about others. In 1973, he pondered whether Watergate reflected ''some basic moral and political failing both of Nixon and those of us who saw him in the mainstream of American politics, rather than as some cunning aberration.'' He asked: ''Have I been a fool or a whore or both? Or perhaps something quite different; something perhaps to be forgiven.''

And on ''Two and a Half Men,'' at 9, Jake (Angus T. Jones) finds out whom Alan (Jon Cryer) has been dating, while Charlie (Charlie Sheen) chooses to ease up on his drinking.
11 a.m. (Fox Business) TAXED TO DEATH WEEKAs the Bush tax cuts are scheduled to expire, potential alternatives, including a sliding scale and a flat tax, are explored all week. 
Noon (CNBC) INVESTING IN AMERICA President Barack Obama and John Harwood, a CNBC correspondent who also reports for The New York Times, will be at the Newseum in Washington for an hourlong town-hall meeting to discuss the economy and other issues. This program repeats at 8 p.m.
8 P.M. (ABC) DANCING WITH THE STARS While Brandy, David Hasselhoff, Florence Henderson, Kurt Warner, Kyle Massey, Margaret Cho, Michael Bolton, Bristol Palin, Mike Sorrentino, a k a the Situation, and Rick Fox all want to prove they know their right feet from their left, Jennifer Grey (above, with Derek Hough) must also compete against the legend of her screen performance as Frances Houseman, a k a Baby, in ''Dirty Dancing.''
8 P.M. (NBC) CHUCK Dolph Lundgren guest-stars as a Russian operative tracked by Sarah (Yvonne Strahovski) and Casey (Adam Baldwin), and on another mission, Chuck (Zachary Levi) and Morgan (Joshua Gomez) search for Chuck's mother while trying to bring their efforts to the C.I.A.'s attention. Linda Hamilton, Harry Dean Stanton and Olivia Munn also make appearances.
8 P.M. (Fox) HOUSE When Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) and House (Hugh Laurie) stay home from work to sort out their feelings for one another, confessed during last season's finale, the rest of the team at Princeton Plainsboro is left to figure out how to help a sick neurosurgeon maintain the hospital's Level 1 trauma center accreditation.
8:30 P.M. (FOOD) UNWRAPPED Dagwood Bumstead might be delighted with this episode devoted to all things that can be put between two slices of bread -- and then some. Take a bite of Manwich Sloppy Joe products, Nature's Pride breads and Turkey Hill ice-cream sandwiches. If you have room, there's the Grilled Cheese Invitational, an annual event devoted to the many variations of this sandwich. For burgers and pizza, it's ''America's Best Comfort Food'' at 9, featuring Alton Brown hitting 10 locations across the country. And at 10, Guy Fieri rolls up to a drive-in and a breakfast spot that has been operating for 60 years, in ''Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.''
9:15 P.M. (IFC) BENNY & JOON (1993) Benny (Aidan Quinn), a small-town auto mechanic, looks after his sister, Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), who behaves erratically but displays artistic talent. Benny is forced to take in Sam (Johnny Depp), an eccentric given to doing physical-comedy routines in the style of silent-film stars, after a turn of events during a poker game. Sam and Joon fall for each other, causing problems with the siblings. Assessing Mr. Depp's performance in The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote: ''The film's greatest asset is the obvious conviction of its actors, who never condescend to their roles. Mr. Depp may look nothing like Buster Keaton, but there are times when he genuinely seems to become the Great Stone Face, bringing Keaton's mannerisms sweetly and magically to life.''
10 P.M. (Bravo) THINTERVENTION WITH JACKIE WARNER The personal trainer pushes her clients to new fitness and weight goals. Temperatures rise on this episode, ''The Fat and the Furious,'' and Ms. Warner puts together a dinner to deal with everyone's issues.
10 P.M.

HEADLINE: Playing a New Game: Catch-Up

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
CHIBA, Japan -- A supersonic hedgehog and a plumber named Mario may have been unlikely heroes, but they once dominated video games. Only the Japanese could make innovative games like those, developers here used to boast. The West just didn't get it.
Warp ahead 20 years, though, and much of Japan's game industry is in a rut.
Sonic the Hedgehog and Mario still sell games. But more recent Japanese attempts to establish franchises, like White Knight Chronicles from Sony or Monster Hunter from Capcom, have not made a mark in the United States and Europe. Instead, the blockbuster hits now come from the West: Call of Duty and Guitar Hero from Activision Blizzard, for example, and Grand Theft Auto from Take-Two Interactive.
That is why a growing group of Japanese game developers are asking a once-unthinkable question: can they learn from the West to get back on top of the $60 billion global video game business? 
''I look around Tokyo Games Show, and everyone's making awful games; Japan is at least five years behind,'' said Keiji Inafune, 45, head of global research and development at Capcom and one of Japan's most prominent game designers.
''Capcom is barely keeping up,'' he said in an interview at the show, which ended Sunday. ''I want to study how Westerners live, and make games that appeal to them.''
From the mid-1980s through the 1990s, most big console-game franchises were born in Japan, including Nintendo's Mario and Pokemon, Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega and Gran Turismo from Sony.
But the biggest new game franchises of the last decade have been from outside Japan, including Halo by Microsoft, and the hits from Activision Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive.
Last year, the world's best-selling game by far was Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which sold 11.86 million copies in the United States, Japan and Britain, according to NPD Group, the market research company.
Global sales numbers for the entire industry are hard to come by. But Japan's share of the world's video game market, both hardware and software, has fallen to slightly more than 10 percent in 2009, from estimates as high as 50 percent in 2002, based on figures from the Entertainment Software Association, the Japan External Trade Organization, and the research companies DFC Intelligence and Enterbrain.
The West's dominance was evident here at the Tokyo Game Show, which has lost much of its global clout in recent years. Despite excitement at the 2010 show over coming titles from Japanese publishers, like Ni no Kuni from Level 5 and The Last Guardian from Sony, Japan's game developers were mainly wringing their hands.
Nintendo has been the major exception, a Japanese game company that has remained dominant. The company, based in Kyoto, reinvented the industry with its Wii home console and wandlike remote, which was introduced in 2006, luring new casual players into the market while setting an industry standard in motion control.
The Wii Sports Resort game was the world's second-biggest game in 2009, selling 7.57 million copies. Its soon-to-be-released Nintendo 3DS, a portable console with a 3-D display that does not require special glasses, is the industry's most anticipated hardware release in years.
But because the best-selling games on Nintendo consoles are largely made by Nintendo, the rest of the Japanese game industry has been excluded from that action.
Meanwhile, Japan's domestic game market is shrinking, down by 20 percent since 2007, to 549 billion yen ($6.4 billion) in 2009, according to Enterbrain.
During that time, the market in the United States surged to a record $21.4 billion in 2008 before a recession-driven decline to $19.7 billion in 2009. But that was still a total increase of 10 percent over two years for the American market, according to NPD.
As Japanese development studios struggle with declining sales, analysts say they are falling behind their American rivals in sheer investment power. A budget for a blockbuster game in the United States can approach $50 million, a figure few Japanese developers can now match.
''Japan used to define gaming,'' said Jake Kazdal, a longtime developer who has worked at Sega in Tokyo and the American game publisher Electronic Arts. ''But now many developers just do the same thing over and over again.''
Part of Japan's problem, Mr. Kazdal said, is a growing gap in tastes between players there and overseas. The most popular games in Japan are linear, with little leeway for players to wander off a defined path. In the United States, he said, video games have become more open, virtual experiences.
''Smarter developers in Japan are trying to reach out to the West,'' Mr. Kazdal said. ''They're collaborating and trying to make games that have more global appeal.''
But Japanese developers have sometimes hit snags trying to tailor games to Westerners. Take Shadow of Rome, the 2005 action game Capcom made for European and American markets.
Shadow of Rome sought to recreate the domestic success Capcom had found with Onimusha, which is set in medieval Japan. But instead of samurai swordsmen, Shadow of Rome featured hulking, oversize gladiators.
Shadow flopped. And Capcom concluded that Westernizing a game took more than ''turning eyes blue and changing the hair color,'' Mr. Inafune said.
The company has had more success with its 2006 horror action game Dead Rising, which it tailored specifically to the West. Set in a zombie-infested mall in small-town America, the game gives players more freedom to improvise. Everything in the mall is at the players' disposal. They can whack zombies with salmon, run them over with shopping carts, even pour cooking oil on the floor to make zombies slip.
Capcom is also tapping foreign talent. On Wednesday, it said it was buying Blue Castle Games of Vancouver, British Columbia. Capcom and Blue Castle Games collaborated on the sequel to Dead Rising. No financial terms of the deal have been disclosed.
Other Japanese companies are also trying overseas collaboration, but not without hiccups. Grasshopper Manufacture -- the cult game developer behind critically acclaimed, if financially unrewarding, titles like Killer7 and No More Heroes -- recently worked with Electronic Arts on a psychological action thriller due in stores next summer.
Unveiling the game, Shadows of the Damned, at the Tokyo Game Show, Goichi Suda, Grasshopper's chief executive, said the title was designed ''to appeal to a global audience.''
But the creative director of the game, Shinji Mikami, who was also behind Capcom's Resident Evil games, cited a culture clash between the Japanese design house and its partners at Electronic Arts.
''Japanese developers tend to work on inspiration, not so much on a set time schedule like the Americans,'' Mr. Mikami said in an interview. ''So when EA asked about the game month after month, we felt like loan sharks were coming after us.''
But there are no hard feelings, evidently. ''We're grateful to EA for being so understanding,'' Mr. Mikami said.
Meanwhile, some Japanese game developers are paying more attention to how games are localized for overseas markets, going beyond facile translations to a more in-depth recasting of games for different markets.
Gone are the days, they say, of awkward lines like ''All your base are belong to us,'' a notorious mistranslation from the 1991 game Zero Wing that spawned an Internet meme.
Brian Gray, a Tokyo-based freelance game translator who previously worked at the Japanese game developer, Square Enix, said he recently started working with clients to write scripts from scratch in English, rather than translating Japanese.
''Developers are saying this isn't about translation anymore,'' Mr. Gray said. ''They're asking, how can we work together to create something that works globally?''
Others are drawing from various facets of Japanese culture. The developer Level 5, for example, is collaborating on Ni no Kuni with Studio Ghibli, the film studio behind critically acclaimed animated movies like ''My Neighbor Totoro.''
All the while, Japan is also racing to tap emerging game markets in China and South Korea, and a boom in casual, downloadable games on a host of new devices like iPhones.
Yoichi Wada, president of the Japanese game developer Square Enix, spoke of the challenge at the game show.
''How do you truly globalize?'' Mr. Wada asked. ''I think you have to work with people who grew up overseas, who grew up breathing the culture. It's impossible otherwise.''
''The game industry is constantly changing,'' he said. ''Everybody's joining the market. You just don't know what's coming next.''

HEADLINE: OBAMA ADVISERS WEIGH OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's political advisers, looking for ways to help Democrats and alter the course of the midterm elections in the final weeks, are considering a range of ideas, including national advertisements, to cast the Republican Party as all but taken over by Tea Party extremists, people involved in the discussion said.
White House and Congressional Democratic strategists are trying to energize dispirited Democratic voters over the coming six weeks, in hopes of limiting the party's losses and keeping control of the House and Senate. The strategists see openings to exploit after a string of Tea Party successes split Republicans in a number of states, culminating last week with developments that scrambled Senate races in Delaware and Alaska.
''We need to get out the message that it's now really dangerous to re-empower the Republican Party,'' said one Democratic strategist who has spoken with White House advisers but requested anonymity to discuss private strategy talks. 
Democrats are divided. The party's House and Senate campaign committees are resistant, not wanting to do anything that smacks of nationalizing the midterm elections when high unemployment and the drop in Mr. Obama's popularity have made the climate so hostile to Democrats. Endangered Congressional candidates want any available money to go to their localized campaigns.
Late Sunday night, White House advisers denied that a national ad campaign was being planned. ''There's been no discussion of such a thing at the White House'' or the Democratic National Committee, said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser.
Proponents say a national ad campaign, most likely on cable television, would complement those individual campaigns and give Democrats a chance to redefine the stakes. The Democratic strategist said voters did not now see much threat to them from a Republican takeover of Congress, even though some Tea Party-backed candidates and other Republicans have taken positions that many voters consider extreme, like shutting down the government to get their way, privatizing Social Security and Medicare and ending unemployment insurance.
So far, Mr. Obama has largely limited his campaigning to fundraisers and small events. That will change soon as he plays a bigger role to rally the flagging faithful, officials said.
To mobilize younger voters who supported him in 2008, Mr. Obama will hold four big campaign-style rallies, the first Sept. 28 at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, with satellite transmission to campuses in other states. The later rallies will be in Ohio, Philadelphia and Las Vegas. He also will send e-mail and record robocalls to spur voters, and conduct a national ''town hall'' Webcast in October.
''These events are about activating the Obama grass roots to help organizationally in terms of volunteers'' for get-out-the-vote efforts, said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director. ''We're not going to get all the 2008 Obama voters out. We may not get most of them. But in close races, it can be decisive.''
Mr. Obama will also step up his efforts to draw contrasts between the parties, in particular by pounding away on his call for extending the expiring Bush-era tax cuts, except for ''millionaires and billionaires.'' Republicans want the tax cuts extended for people of all income levels, not just incomes below $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for families, as the president has proposed.
Republican strategists remain confident of the party's prospects for big gains in November, even as they acknowledge that they are unlikely to win the Senate race in Delaware after the victory in the Republican primary there of Christine O'Donnell, a Tea Party-backed candidate with a long record of controversial statements, over Representative Michael N. Castle, a moderate and popular former two-term governor.
Also last week, Alaska's Senate race was upended when Senator Lisa Murkowski, who lost the Republican nomination to a Tea Party adherent, Joe Miller, mounted a write-in candidacy against him, saying, ''Alaska is not fair game for outside extremists.''
''While we may have a handful of nominees out of the mainstream, the American people have come to the conclusion this administration and this Congress are out of the mainstream,'' said John Weaver, a Republican consultant.
In 1994, Democrats were in power and similarly took hope when Republican primaries yielded candidates deemed too far right for the general election. Yet the wave against Democrats that year was strong enough to carry those newcomers into office and put Republicans in control of Congress for the first time in 40 years.
Except for Ms. O'Donnell in Delaware, Republican nominees that Democrats like to showcase as extremists -- including in Senate races in Nevada, Colorado, Kentucky and even blue-state Connecticut -- are even with their Democratic rivals in polls or ahead.
And even as the White House maps the final campaign push, advisers are distracted by the expected exit of the chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, to run for mayor of Chicago. Mr. Emanuel, who as a member of Congress helped engineer the Democratic takeover of the House in 2006, is among his party's foremost strategists when it comes to Congressional elections.
Peter M. Rouse, one of Mr. Obama's closest advisers, has assumed additional responsibilities. But Mr. Rouse, who is intensely private, does not want the high-profile job of chief of staff; instead he is helping Mr. Obama vet names. Leading candidates are said to be Thomas E. Donilon, the deputy national security adviser, and Robert Bauer, the White House counsel.
On top of the personnel distractions at the White House, the strategy discussions with Congressional Democrats come after 21 months of legislative and political battles that have strained relations between the two camps.
Democrats on Capitol Hill say that Obama aides, including Mr. Axelrod, and Jim Messina, the deputy chief of staff, do not consult with them enough and are more concerned with positioning Mr. Obama for his 2012 reelection race than with re-electing Democrats now.
At the Democratic National Committee, aides already have started work on a database to link the most controversial statements of the Tea Party-backed candidates to possible Republican presidential aspirants.
The database will point out, for example, that Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney are supporting the Republican candidate for Senate in Nevada, Sharron Angle, who once said that victims of rape should make ''what was really a lemon situation into lemonade,'' and Ms. O'Donnell, who has said that having women in the service academies ''cripples the readiness of our defense.''
The tactic of linking potential Republican rivals to such statements was already in evidence last week. After Ms. O'Donnell's victory, a party spokesman told reporters, ''The fact that Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin would put their name behind a candidate that believes women who serve our country 'cripple the readiness of our defense' make them unfit to be commander-in-chief.''

HEADLINE: Ahmadinejad Wants Release of Iranians Held in U.S.

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER; M. Amedeo Tumolillo contributed reporting.

 BODY:
One of the three American hikers held in Iran for 13 months on spying charges arrived in the United States on Sunday as the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said that the United States, as ''a humanitarian gesture,'' should now release eight Iranians whom he said were illegally arrested.
The released hiker, Sarah Shourd, 32, along with her mother, Nora, and an uncle, arrived at dawn at Dulles International Airport near Washington. 
At a news conference later Sunday in New York, Ms. Shourd said that she and her two companions, who are still being held in Iran, ''in no way intended any harm to the Iranian government or its people and believe a huge misunderstanding led to our detention and prolonged imprisonment.''
The three were trekking in the mountainous Kurdish area of northern Iraq in the summer of 2009 when they were arrested by Iranian border guards on charges of wandering into Iranian territory. They were soon accused of espionage, a charge dismissed by American officials as absurd. Ms. Shourd's two companions -- her fiance, Shane M. Bauer, and Joshua F. Fatall, both 28 -- remain under arrest on what Iranian officials call a ''pretrial detention'' that has been extended for two months.
''Shane and Josh do not deserve to be in prison one day longer than I was,'' Ms. Shourd said at the news conference. ''We committed no crime and we are not spies.''
In an interview broadcast Sunday morning with Christiane Amanpour on ABC's ''This Week,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said that the Iranian government ''took a humanitarian measure and released one of the three individuals who entered our borders,'' so ''I believe it would not be misplaced to ask that the U.S. government should make a humanitarian gesture and release the Iranians who were illegally arrested and detained here in the United States.''
When Ms. Amanpour suggested that he was holding the two remaining hikers as hostages for eight Iranians held for various crimes, including violating international sanctions against Iran, the Iranian president replied: ''How would you know those Iranians are criminals? Are you a judge?''
''We want people to be free and not to suffer,'' he added, ''but at the end of the day there's a law that determines who stays in prison and who does not.''
Mr. Ahmadinejad also commented on another case that has become something of a cause celebre, the sentence to death by stoning of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, a woman convicted of adultery in 2006 and accused in recent weeks of playing a role in murdering her husband. The sentence, which provoked an international outcry, was halted almost two weeks ago.
Mr. Ahmadinejad contended that the woman was never sentenced to stoning and that her case was ''news that was made up'' as propaganda by American politicians and the media. He also wondered why the case of ''one lady in a village in Iran should suddenly become such a big issue for American officials.''
''The propaganda behind it was big, and then those same murderers of people become supporters of human rights,'' he said sardonically.
Mr. Ahmadinejad was in New York to attend the annual General Assembly of the United Nations this week. The United States has led an international effort to place sanctions on Iran for its unwillingness to cooperate with international inspections of its uranium enrichment program. The United States believes that enrichment is intended to produce nuclear weapons.
In a separate interview with Ms. Amanpour, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said from Jerusalem that the economic and financial sanctions against Iran were ''biting'' and that their impact was corroborated by many reports from the region. Mr. Ahmadinejad dismissed the sanctions as ''pathetic.''
''The information we're getting is that the Iranian regime is quite worried about the impact on their banking system, on their economic growth, because they've already encountered tough economic times, and this is making it more costly,'' Ms. Clinton said.
She said that she would like to see Iran return to negotiations with a forum that includes the United States, Britain, France, Russia China and Germany to discuss its nuclear ambitions. Mr. Ahmadinejad said his country had ''always been ready to discuss issues as long as they're within the legal framework and based on principles of justice and respect.''
Ms. Clinton also said that the United States is concerned about the ''increasing power exercised by the military'' and the Revolutionary Guards in Iranian political life. While the Iranian revolution promised Iran would be a republic, elected officials now increasingly ''turn to the military to enforce their power,'' she said.
''I can only hope that that there will be some effort inside Iran by responsible civil and religious leaders to take hold of the apparatus of the state,'' she said.

HEADLINE: A 10-Year Checkup on Global Goals

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Leaders grade themselves on global development targets set 10 years ago. 

 BODY:
Ten years after the world's nations pledged to cut deeply into the problems afflicting the world's poor by 2015, a Millennium Development Goals Summit is being held at the United Nations today through Wednesday to assess progress. The event overlaps with a batch of related meetings in New York City, including Climate Week and the Clinton Global Initiative. 
[Sept. 22, 10:24 p.m. | Updated The United Nations issued a summary of the summiton Wednesday night (pdf file).]
To mark the occasion, Olav Kjorven, assistant secretary general of the United Nations for development policy, submitted a comment on my recent post asking if the world's wealthiest people need new goals even as rich countries work to foster human and environmental progress elsewhere.
I'm featuring it below as a "Your Dot" contribution. Also, I encourage you to read Bono's Op-Ed contribution from the weekend with his three-point list, which includes a riff on the vital role of "governance as an effect multiplier." He alludes to an earlier column in which he described how some Africans he's met see "corruption as more deadly than the deadliest of diseases."
Here's Kjorven's reaction to my question about the need for new goals for the top billion: 
Andrew, this is a great question. On the eve of the largest gathering of world leaders ever, in New York next week, it is also most timely.
If you're reading this, there's a good chance you're part of the world's top billion people -- those whose incomes (and opportunities) seem worlds apart from those of the bottom billion, who earn less than $1.25 a day. The eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were established as globally shared commitments back in the year 2000, in order to improve opportunities and livelihoods for essentially the bottom billion, and with a target date of 2015. In fact, much and impressive progress has been made over the last ten years, but the fact remains that countries both north and south must do more than they're doing to ensure that the Goals are met by 2015. The MDG Summit this week in New York is about strengthening will and commitments exactly for this. Achieving the eight MDG goals within the next five years - targeting poverty, gender inequality, lack of education and health services, and a deteriorating environment in poor countries - must be a global top priority. It's a moral issue, and at the end of the day it is in everybody's best interest.
However, looking beyond the next five years, wouldn't it be interesting if the rich world - or the top billion if you wish - would commit to its own eight goals to strive towards, goals that could help us secure livable conditions for a growing world population for decades to come? Here's a very rough first cut of what eight such goals for the world's top billion for the coming 20 years could look like. It would be great to get some help in improving and refining them-if they get compelling enough they would get traction!
Goal 1: Cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent. This means transformation of economies, but it is clearly within reach if there's political will. A reduction of this order in the rich world is necessary to stave off the risk of serious climate disruption with dramatic implications worldwide. It is also necessary for improved energy security and enhanced global stability.
Goal No. 2: Convert at least 40 percent of agricultural lands to ecologically sustainable production, with minimized use of agro-chemicals, and expanded use of techniques that reduce soil erosion and run-off and that maintain high levels of biodiversity.
Goal No. 3: Transition 13 of the 22 million boats fishing into alternate activity in order to save and replenish depleted global fish and seafood stocks and ensure sustainability of global fisheries. Today, one billion people depend on the oceans for their daily protein intake - a reliance that will grow dramatically by 2030. If a corresponding increase in fish stocks doesn't happen, the population that relies on seafood will be forced to seek other means of survival, putting even more pressure on other sources of food and the ecosystems supporting them.
Goal No. 4: Reduce average animal protein intake among the top billion by 20 percent. By getting this intake instead from vegetables, grains and fruits, we will reduce the environmental strain of meat, poultry and fishing industries.
Goal No. 5: Shift the tax burden from work to consumption, depletion and contamination of natural capital. Develop additional policies and incentives that can facilitate pursuit of happiness without cost or destruction to the natural world and to peoples and societies elsewhere.
Goal No. 6: Make the rules and support systems around intellectual property rights more supportive of research and development overall and of lowering the barriers to participation in innovation for the common good. Enhance opportunities for all to participate in innovation.
Goal No. 7: Strengthen transparency rules and anti-corruption measures around resource extraction, control predatory currency speculation through a responsibly regulated financial sector, and make macro/monetary policy consistent with needs for global financial balance.
Goal No. 8: Fully meet existing MDG8 commitments and go beyond them in order to accelerate the global fight against poverty. Meeting commitments on aid, trade, debt relief and technology is as important as ever.
These eight goals - or something like them - would safeguard prosperity and opportunities for our children and our children's children. It's a responsibility that we can't afford to pass up.
The United Nations has a blog seeking ideas for meeting the 2015 deadline. Weigh in there, and here of course.

HEADLINE: As a Clock Ticks, Mothers' Lives End, Here and Around the World

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
For years, New York City has had a National Debt Clock, an electronic billboard perched on West 44th Street, with numbers spinning every second to reflect the explosive growth in what this country owes.
On Monday, the debt clock got a death clock as a neighbor.
In Times Square, just north of 44th Street, a digital sign began carrying a message quite different from what one usually sees on a billboard operated by MTV and flanked by images of Kanye West and Usher. 
The ''maternal death clock,'' as it was called, ticked off 90 seconds, then started the count all over again. Then again. And again. And again.
Every 90 seconds, on average, a woman dies in childbirth somewhere in the world. That is nearly 1,000 women a day. It adds up to 358,000 women a year, according to the most recent estimates made by United Nations agencies and the World Bank.
That is a lot of death, considering that much of it could be prevented with better medical care.
The death clock, a creation of Amnesty International, will be in place for three days, to coincide with a gathering across town. World leaders are getting together at the United Nations this week to recommit themselves to the Millennium Development Goals, a batch of targets agreed to 10 years ago for reducing abject poverty around the globe by 2015.
The concerns are many: hunger, unsafe drinking water, environmental ruination, infant mortality, to name a few. Also on that sad list is the rate at which women die while trying to give life.
Amnesty International's adoption of this issue might seem unusual for a human rights organization. Isn't it essentially a public health matter?
On one level, yes, said Larry Cox, the executive director of Amnesty International USA. But, Mr. Cox added, ''it's such a clear example of people dying who don't need to.''
''That's the ultimate definition of a human rights issue -- steps that can be taken, and aren't,'' he added.
The situation is not entirely bleak. There is hope for improvement. Those 358,000 deaths, an estimate for 2008, were well below the 546,000 believed to have occurred in 1990. Even so, the rate of decline has been substantially slower than hoped for when those development goals were set.
Not everyone is impressed by the depth of the world leaders' commitment. No sanctions, for example, are imposed if a country doesn't measure up. ''The cost is being paid by these women who are dying every 90 seconds,'' said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International's secretary general.
It might seem that maternal mortality is a distant worry for most of us, given that nearly 90 percent of the deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. But the United States has no reason to feel good in this regard. Nor does New York City.
When it comes to mortality rates -- measured as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births -- the United States ranked 50th on a United Nations list of countries, behind nearly all other industrialized nations and even behind not-so-prosperous ones like Serbia and Slovakia. In some respects, the American situation has worsened in the last two decades, said Nan Strauss, an Amnesty researcher.
As for New York, a recent report prepared by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and by the New York Academy of Medicine put the death rate here at twice the national average. Not that the actual number of deaths is huge. This analysis was based on 161 deaths from 2001 to 2005. Still, the assumption is that many of the deaths could have been avoided with better nutrition and prenatal care.
Half of these women were obese. More than half had chronic health problems like hypertension and asthma. Blacks were seven times as likely to die in pregnancy as whites. Poor women were more likely to die than wealthier women. In many women, these various factors overlapped.
As it is throughout the country, the death rate is a small fraction of what it was a century ago. But progress has stalled over the last 20 years, and ''this is of great concern to the department,'' said Deborah Kaplan, an assistant health commissioner. Officials are doing ''enhanced surveillance'' of maternal deaths, she said, to learn what might be done to keep the grim numbers down.
This is, obviously, no simple matter. Even in the time it took many of you to read this far, two more women, somewhere, died bringing life into the world.

HEADLINE: Internet Service Upgrade Coming to Poor and Rural Schools

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission is expected on Thursday to approve an overhaul of the $2.25 billion E-Rate program, which subsidizes Internet service for schools and public libraries, to give schools more options for faster Internet service, allow for community Internet service and to begin pilot programs for digital textbooks. 
The proposed E-Rate order would allow schools and libraries to use federal funds to lease unused local communication lines -- known as dark fiber -- to connect to the Internet, a potentially faster and lower-cost connection than currently offered through many local telecommunications companies.
Some schools still do not have broadband connections, the F.C.C. noted in its National Broadband Plan, released this year. The company that administers E-Rate received at least 200 requests in the 2009 fiscal year for money to pay for dial-up Internet connections. The program mostly serves schools in poor and rural communities. At its monthly meeting on Thursday, the F.C.C. also will consider allowing schools to open the use of Internet resources paid for with E-Rate funds to the local community after school hours and when school is not in session, which is currently not allowed under E-Rate regulations.
''For the good of our economy, we need all of our kids to be digitally literate,'' Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman, said in an interview. Job postings are increasingly available online only, he said, while a growing percentage of jobs require basic digital skills as a prerequisite.
The commission also is expected to approve a pilot program that supports off-campus wireless Internet connections for use with mobile learning devices, like digital textbooks. That would allow schools to update their textbooks more frequently and save students from having to carry back-breaking loads of textbooks home each night.
The E-Rate program, which is financed by a fee collected from all telephone users, came under fire from Congress in 2004 for wasteful spending. Changes in accounting regulations and program rules led to a temporary suspension of new grants that year.

HEADLINE: In Harlem, a Hint of a Previous Era As Peddlers Stealthily Quench a Thirst

BYLINE: By TRYMAINE LEE

 BODY:
In Prohibition-era Harlem, bootleggers sold cheap and sometimes toxic liquor and moonshine at rent parties and speakeasies for as little as 25 cents a pop.
Rotgut whiskey was sold in basement barrooms, drugstores and delicatessens on Lenox Avenue. Mom-and-pop operations doled out home brews from bathtubs and backyard stills.
Some semblance of those days are back in Harlem, where potent sweet liquor drinks are being mixed at home and sold illegally off stoops, in apartment hallways and in bodegas and barbershops.
The drinks, a blend of various hard liquors and fruit juices, are called nutcracker, and they are being sold in sealed plastic bottles or Styrofoam cups for $5 throughout Harlem. 
Sales of the drink have been part of the underground economy for years, but with this summer's heat and the economic slump they have become more visible. Visitors to any block party or outdoor event in Harlem this summer could not have missed the chant of ''Nutcrackers! Nutcrackers!''
People in the neighborhood said selling nutcrackers had become more prevalent in the dismal economy, a means some have used to supplement their incomes with quick and easy money. Some who remember the crack boom of the mid-1980s and early 1990s, and the destruction it heaped upon the community, justify the sales, seeing them as akin to marijuana dealing or numbers gambling.
But others in Harlem, including parents and pastors, say they are worried, particularly because of the drink's potency, popularity with teenagers and easy availability.
''I think adults and young adults are being very selfish and using greed to raise money,'' said the Rev. Vernon Williams, an antiviolence activist who sees a correlation between nutcracker sales and youth violence. ''And they are taking this toxic combination of multiple high-level alcohols and selling it indiscriminately to anyone who has the $5.''
Police officials said they were aware of the nutcracker sales and had done what they could to address the issue. They said the department had used both plainclothes and uniformed officers to issue summonses to stores and individuals caught selling it. People found buying the drinks were issued summonses for having an open container of alcohol, the police said.
Sellers include young and older women, blue-collar workers, street hustlers and the underemployed. To give themselves an edge, some sellers even make home deliveries.
Their customers are teenagers, men and women arriving home after a day at work, and young adults who have made it a staple of the party scene. The drinks can also be found in neighborhoods in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens but have been ubiquitous this summer in Harlem and Washington Heights.
''It's definitely a summer drink, and I try to serve them as cold as possible,'' said a regular nutcracker seller, a man in his early 30s who goes by the name of Kool-Aid and asked that his full name not be published. ''It's a fruity drink, so you don't have to sip it with your face all scrunched up; you feel really nice without getting totally bombed out.''
The man said he made six gallons at a time in a big plastic water cooler jug, mixing 160-proof Devil's Springs vodka, 151-proof Bacardi 151 rum, Amaretto, whatever sweet liqueur he had on hand and a variety of juices depending on the desired flavor, including cranberry, mango, pineapple and peach nectar.
The juice and liquor typically cost him about $300, he said. He also spends about $85 on plastic bottles and sealable caps.
For each $200 or $300 he spends, he said, he makes about $700 in profit.
To distinguish their drinks from others, some nutcracker sellers use various colored caps and infuse the drink with fruit or Jolly Ranchers. Kool-Aid said he added liquor-soaked fruit salad.
People in the neighborhood said they had no idea how nutcracker caught on. But local legend has it that the original nutcracker was created 10 or so years ago at a Chinese restaurant on the border of the Upper West Side and Harlem, where bartenders hid their hands below the counter as they mixed the drink. When people asked what was in it, the bartenders refused to say. The story goes that at some point the bartenders started allowing customers to leave with their drinks, and soon people started dissecting the recipe and making their own.
For some the drink's presence in Harlem conjures up an era 80 years in its past, when selling and consuming home-concocted alcohol was an illegal, dangerous pastime.
''As a phenomenon it evokes both the romantic and repugnant concoctions of Jazz Age Harlem, the illicit elixir of bathtub gin on the one hand, the toxic tonic of wood-alcohol-based wild whiskey on the other,'' said Eric K. Washington, a Harlem historian and author of ''Manhattanville: Old Heart of West Harlem.''
Kool-Aid, who has a couple years of college under his belt and lives in the West 140s, says nutcracker helps him pay the bills. He said he had not been able to find full-time work, only occasional maintenance or data entry work through an agency.
But, he said, business had become more risky lately. After a series of articles in The Daily News that raised alarms about sales to minors, police and community leaders began to rein in the sales. A year ago there were as many as six people selling nutcracker on his block, he said, until the police cracked down, emptying bottles on sidewalks and handing out summonses for $250 to $500 to dealers and customers.
He says he abides by a few self-made rules of self-preservation: Don't sell to teenagers. Never sell to strangers. And never sell it openly in the street, always by phone call or text message and always delivered in the kind of black plastic bags that bodegas use.
''It comes with risks,'' he said. ''I don't have a criminal record, so I don't want to get one for selling drinks.''
Most sellers are not checking buyers for an ID. But because of its sweetness, it is liquor candy to teenagers.
''Alcohol is unquestionably the drug that is most abused by kids; there's nothing close,'' said Joseph Califano, president of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. ''We read about marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth. The reality is that alcohol is the entrance of kids into that world, and to sell that stuff to young kids, I think it's child abuse.''
Mr. Califano said that studies had shown that 80 percent of the people in prison had substance abuse issues, and that there was scientific evidence that alcohol could stunt the adolescent brain.
Kool-Aid said most nutcracker sellers were not thinking about the impact on their buyers. ''Hustlers just think it's all about the buck,'' he said. ''They don't care about the families or the parent who's looking for their child at 1 in the morning, and they're passed out drunk on somebody's stoop from too many nutcrackers.''

HEADLINE: Panel Leans in Favor Of Engineered Salmon

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
ROCKVILLE, Md. -- Members of a federal advisory committee on Monday seemed to conclude that genetically engineered super-salmon would be safe to eat and for the environment, but they also found gaps in the studies used to support that conclusion.
The committee met here to advise the Food and Drug Administration on whether to approve what would be the first genetically engineered animal to enter the American food supply. 
The Atlantic salmon, which would be raised on farms, contain an extra growth hormone gene that allows them to grow to marketable size about twice as fast as conventional fish.
Committee members, who were not asked to vote on whether the fish should be approved, did not point out anything about the fish that would seem dangerous, despite one study suggesting a possible increase in the potential to cause allergic reactions. They said the chance the fish would escape into the wild was low.
''They didn't see any glaring holes'' in the data, Gregory A. Jaffe of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, who was the consumer representative on the committee, said after the meeting ended.
Still some panel members did say the studies the F.D.A. relied on to reach its own conclusion that the salmon would be safe were flawed, often using only a few dozen fish or even fewer.
''I do get heartburn when we're going to allow post-market surveillance to finalize our safety evaluation,'' said one committee member, Michael D. Apley, a pharmacology expert at Kansas State University.
The criticisms could add to the time needed to approve the salmon. It could also provide grist for consumer and environmental groups, many of which testified on Monday that the salmon should not be approved.
Approval of the salmon could pave the way for other such biotech animals to enter the food supply, like a pig developed in Canada that has more environmentally friendly manure.
The results could also influence other countries. Eric Hallerman, a fisheries expert at Virginia Tech, told the committee that fast-growing versions had already been developed for 18 different types of fish in various countries.
The salmon contain a growth hormone gene from the Chinook salmon and a genetic switch from the ocean pout that turns on an antifreeze gene. That allows the salmon to make growth hormone in cold weather, whereas salmon usually produce it only in warm weather.
Ronald L. Stotish, the chief executive of AquaBounty Technologies, the company that developed the salmon, told the committee that its AquAdvantage salmon would help the world meet rising demand for seafood without further devastating natural fisheries. He said it would be economical to grow the fish in inland tanks in the United States, saving the cost of flying in the fish from Chile or Norway, from which the United States now gets most of its Atlantic salmon, he said.
For now, though, the company's eggs are being hatched at a company facility in Prince Edward Island, Canada. And the fish would be grown to size in only limited quantities at a company facility in Panama.
The company said that fish would not escape because they are grown inland in facilities with containment mechanisms. If any did escape, it said, the rivers outside the Canadian and Panama facilities would be too salty or warm for the fish to survive. And the fish would all be female and almost all would be sterile, so they would not interbreed with wild salmon.
But some committee members, as well as some environmental groups, said the government's environmental assessment should evaluate what would happen if the salmon were grown widely in many facilities.
''The F.D.A. must consider issues related to realistic production scenarios,'' said Anna Zivian, a senior manager at the group Ocean Conservancy.
One test showed a possible increase in the potential to cause allergic reactions that was almost statistically significant even though only six fish were used in each group in the study.
But several committee members said the meaning of that test's results were open to question since it was not clear what amount of increase was meaningful.
Kevin Wells, an assistant professor at the University of Missouri and a committee member, said he doubted the fish would cause extra allergies.
''The salmon contains nothing that isn't in the human diet,'' he said.
The fish are being regulated under the process used to approve veterinary drugs. The F.D.A. held a half-day session on Sunday to give the committee, made up mostly of veterinarians, a primer on genetic engineering.
Approval, if it comes, is likely to take at least several months. The F.D.A. said it would prepare an environmental assessment that would be open to comment for 30 days. If the agency decides that there could be a significant environmental impact -- something that does not appear likely -- it will have to do a full environmental impact statement, which could take months or years.
The F.D.A. will have a public hearing on Tuesday on whether the salmon, if approved, should be labeled.

HEADLINE: Speeding Up Expense Reports

BYLINE: By MARTHA C. WHITE

 BODY:
The corporate card is changing, not in ways that business travelers will see on the road but that they will notice back home when they fill out expense reports.
Credit network processors like Visa and MasterCard as well as the banks that issue cards have been developing new tools for corporate customers in anticipation of a rebound in business travel. The volume of travel and entertainment charges has increased by 20 to 30 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009, when recession-related declines first began to reverse, according to Kevin Phalen, a commercial card executive at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.
The new tools are largely aimed at helping business travelers and travel managers do a better job of tracking where and how company money is being spent. The idea, Mr. Phalen said, is to offer more ''visibility into cash flow.'' 
The financial crisis in 2008 prompted a call for greater transparency in how public companies spend their money, particularly on travel. The reaction began after reports that the insurance giant the American International Group had run up a bill of about $440,000 on a company retreat in October 2008 at a Southern California resort hotel, shortly after the company accepted an $85 billion federal bailout.
That so-called A.I.G. effect, in turn, led to a demand for programs that monitor both card use and expense reporting.
''Travel managers are getting more and more data around where their cards are used,'' said Hubert J. P. Jolly, a managing director in the global transactions services business at Citigroup. As the tools give managers a more complete picture of their company's spending, ''we're seeing corporations use that data to renegotiate,'' he said.
New imaging technology, for example, lets travel managers look at a hotel bill line by line, rather than just seeing a single charge with a total dollar amount. This way, they can see if the traveler took bottled water from the minibar or paid for Internet service, both charges that can be bundled into a corporate rate when companies bargain with hotels.
Many of the new programs cater to small businesses, traditionally the ones that first experience a rebound in an economic recovery. ''What we find in smaller companies is that current penetration of expense management tools is very low,'' said Jay Cary, a vice president at American Express Global Commercial Card. ''In many cases, they're hand-writing or using an Excel spreadsheet,'' he said.
American Express worked with the travel expense software firm Concur to roll out Concur Breeze, an expense-reporting tool aimed at companies with 100 or fewer employees that the company introduced, in June.
''Expense reportage decoupled from the card is a pain in the neck,'' said Elena Donio, executive vice president and general manager for Concur Breeze. Letting small businesses automate their expense management cuts down on the time that cardholders and their managers need to spend on the process.
Hillel Zafir can attest to this. As chief technology officer for EMI Yoshi, a party goods manufacturing and distribution company in North Brunswick, N.J., Mr. Zafir said that managing the travel expenses of the company's 10 salesmen was time- and labor-intensive.
The reporting was all done in Excel, and salesmen would have to print out and mail hard copies of receipts to headquarters. ''The charges they put in didn't always coincide, and if there was a discrepancy, it became a problem,'' he said.
Now, Mr. Zafir said the hourlong reporting process has been shaved to a few minutes of work. Salesmen like Zevi Mayer are using the program to take photos of receipts for cash transactions using their smartphones and add it to their expense reports.
Other new tools are aimed at travel managers or meeting planners. Banks have begun offering corporate customers the ability to create an account number that is valid only for a single transaction. While some financial institutions have long offered this service to their customers so that, for instance, they do not have to expose their debit card numbers when making an online purchase, this tool gives corporate buyers the ability to control the amount charged.
''That is the product where we're seeing the fastest growth, 90 to 100 percent growth year over year,'' said Eduardo Vergara, a managing director at JPMorgan Chase Businesses.
Companies like this option, he said, because they -- not the vendor -- stipulate the amount charged, and because it simplifies billing by sending it back to an internal cost center. Hotels and other vendors like it because it means they will be paid promptly. Traditionally, vendors would bill the company and often receive a check a month or more after the fact.
Also growing in popularity are meetings cards. ''As we've seen an uptick in corporate travel, we're seeing a lot more demand for the meeting card,'' said Jim McCarthy, global head of product for Visa Inc.
Since big corporate conferences can easily cost $100,000 or more, being able to consolidate all the expenses onto a single account gives companies a more complete picture of the total cost. It also gives meeting managers insight into areas where they can realize savings. And it gives them more clout when they negotiate with a hotel or other location for future business.
For the future, he said, he envisioned an array of services provided by third-party developers in addition to Visa itself, much the way the App Store from Apple operates.

HEADLINE: A Candidate Crisscrosses A Borough He Mocked

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
Carl P. Paladino, the tough-talking Buffalo businessman and Republican nominee for governor, has done little to hide his distaste for Manhattan.
He has disparaged its traffic-clogged streets. He has mocked its liberal-leaning residents. And in a stinging rebuke to the Manhattan-centric, he has expressed a blunt preference for Staten Island and Queens.
But on Monday, Mr. Paladino held his nose long enough to make a brief campaign swing in Manhattan, determined to navigate it with the same rumpled everyman style and resolute anti-elitism with which he has campaigned to be the state's chief executive. 
He succeeded, up to a point. He insisted on sitting in the front seat of a taxi as it whizzed through Midtown (back seats, after all, evoke chauffeurs). He stayed at an unassuming hotel in the garment district. And he devoured an antipower breakfast: eggs, sausage and butter-soaked toast at an out-of-the-way diner.
But he became star-struck in the lobby of the CBS Building on West 57th Street when he stumbled upon a glamorous British actress.
A reporter pointed her out to Mr. Paladino as a star of ''The English Patient.'' The gruff, aggressive candidate gasped, saying he liked the film, and rushed over to introduce himself.
''I'm Carl Paladino,'' he said. ''I loved, what was that movie?'' he asked the reporter. '' 'The English Patient,' '' he said, with a prompt. Shaking the woman's hand up and down, he asked, ''What's your name?''
''Kristin Scott Thomas,'' she replied.
He asked her to repeat herself, leaning in to hear her better. Leaning back, she put a hand to the side of her mouth and called out, ''Kristin Scott Thomas.'' And then she scurried away toward an elevator.
The timing of his visit to Manhattan was deliberate, and highly symbolic: after riding a wave of upstate anger over Albany and the economy to win the Republican primary last Tuesday, Mr. Paladino must now convince downstate voters to rally behind him.
It could prove a daunting challenge. Mr. Paladino, who is backed by the Tea Party, has espoused a deeply conservative agenda. He has proposed severe cuts to familiar programs like Medicaid, called for eliminating entire agencies and suggested using prisons as dormitories to teach welfare recipients hygiene.
But his aides believe that his plain-spoken message of tax cuts and smaller government will resonate as much on the Upper East Side as it does in Erie County, home to Buffalo.
And in an interview, Mr. Paladino vowed to spend most of his time in the New York City area until Election Day, wooing voters in places like Manhattan that he has previously described as filled with ''smug, self-important, pampered liberal elitists.''
On Monday, as he crisscrossed the island to meet with reporters and donors, Mr. Paladino had more charitable things to say about the borough and its denizens -- sort of.
Calling Manhattan a ''fun place,'' he insisted that he enjoyed staying here for ''two or three days'' at a time. ''But then,'' he added, ''you got to go back and get your head adjusted.''
His Manhattan jaunt began early on Monday with an interview at the headquarters of Fox News, where he seemed awed by the hive of activity around him well before 8 a.m. ''Why do you guys get up so early?'' he asked a reporter.
Wherever he went, he insisted on opening doors himself and holding them open for those around him, especially women. (He has criticized his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, for imperiously waiting for aides to open doors for him. ''He wouldn't dirty himself and touch the handle,'' Mr. Paladino said recently.)
For much of the day, Mr. Paladino -- wearing his campaign uniform of gray suit and red tie -- went unrecognized as he walked the streets and milled around office lobbies.
At one point, however, a gaggle of construction workers in Midtown asked to be photographed with him.
Mr. Paladino happily obliged, locking arms with the men and wishing them well.
In between meetings, he ticked off a list of his favorite Manhattan landmarks: the Flatiron Building; Elaine's, the Upper East Side hangout; and Runyon's, a bar on the East Side.
Still, Mr. Paladino sometimes found it hard to suppress complaints.
During a taxi ride, he tore into the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, calling it corrupt and bloated.
His cabby, Shaheen Qanoongo, nodded in agreement. ''You are absolutely right,'' Mr. Qanoongo told Mr. Paladino, even while acknowledging to the candidate, ''I don't know much about you.''
Mr. Paladino apparently made a good impression: Mr. Qanoongo said he was open to voting for him. ''It's not like 'I am a Democrat so I am going to vote for a corrupt Democrat,' '' the driver explained.
Despite his reservations about life in Manhattan, Mr. Paladino at times seemed very much at home. He hailed a taxi like a native: stepping out confidently onto Avenue of the Americas and raising his right hand.
Off to the side, an aide grumbled about the difficulty of spotting a taxi's ''on-duty'' light against the bright morning sun. If Mr. Paladino agreed, he kept it to himself.

HEADLINE: For a Singer's 1940s Alma Mater, a 21st-Century Gift

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
EAST ORANGE, N.J. -- Here is what a bridge over the digital divide looks like.
On Thursday morning, 30 fifth graders in yellow-and-green uniforms tapped on keyboards in their gleaming new technology lab, careful not to pound the keys or touch the shiny screens. The first lesson was about how to take care of the computers.
Jalen Thompson, 10, said he had never seen a computer so fancy or so expensive. He typed on his screen: ''Do not bang on the computer, or keyboard, or mouse.'' 
''When the students came, they were like 'wow,' '' said Sharon Giles, the economics and entrepreneurship teacher at the Dionne Warwick Institute of Economics and Entrepreneurship. ''It's going to open up a whole new world for them.''
While schools across the New York region rolled out iPods, smartphones, video editing labs and even Skype connections to schools overseas, the students at Warwick, a public elementary school here, had been taught about business much the way their parents had learned it: with paper, pen and calculator.
The school, in a district that is more than 95 percent black and is one of the state's poorest, has struggled to give its students modern business skills, largely lacking the hardware and software that would allow them to create the spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations and multimedia displays that have become routine in the business world.
Warwick had a working technology lab cobbled together with secondhand Apple computers from other classrooms that received a handful of newer models every few years. With its outdated equipment, students could not learn the digital skills taught in better-endowed schools, illustrating what some educators have called the newest incarnation of the digital divide, a lack of digital literacy.
But this year, thanks to the singer Dionne Warwick, the school narrowed the digital divide with a state-of-the-art technology lab equipped with 31 new Hewlett-Packard computers with oversize screens, 6 digital camcorders and a printer.
The new lab sits on the second floor of a century-old building that houses 425 students in preschool through fifth grade, nearly all of whom are black or Hispanic. About 90 percent are poor enough to qualify for free or reduced-price lunches.
Once a neighborhood school called Lincoln, it was renamed for Ms. Warwick, a winner of five Grammy awards, in 1996 after becoming a theme school for business. Ms. Warwick attended the school, which now draws students from across the district, in the late 1940s.
For the technology lab, she arranged for Hewlett-Packard to provide about $30,000 worth of equipment, software and online training resources at no cost.
Ms. Warwick, 69, had struck up a relationship with the company after using an HP laptop to write a memoir, ''My Life, as I See It,'' with her business partner, David Freeman Wooley; it is to be published in November.
The new lab has become the showpiece for the school, which will hold an open house on Tuesday to unveil it to the community.
Surrounded by the sleek machines last week, Ms. Giles directed her fifth-grade students to go online to a virtual bank and calculate the interest on a $600 deposit.
Unlike the old computers, the new ones did not freeze. They did not mysteriously shut down. They so captivated the students that no other sound could be heard beside click-click-clicking.
Research has shown that giving students technology can improve their motivation and computer skills, though there have been mixed results as to whether it leads to higher test scores.
Ms. Giles is already planning how students can use the computers for their major projects later in the year: creating and selling their own business products. They will be able to design logos and graphics.
They will also have digital camcorders to make commercials about their products; in the past, ads were limited to printed fliers and announcements over the school's intercom system.
When asked how much she liked her new computer, Angielene Allen, 9, rated it 10 out of 10.
''I didn't think anything was wrong with the old computers, but then I saw these,'' Angielene said. ''I like them much better.''
Cherokee Coleman, also 10, said the old computer screens were so dark they were hard to read, and the keyboards, which were set on top of desks, were so high that she strained her wrists. The new computers come with adjustable keyboard holders.
''I think they're kind of great,'' said Cherokee, who at home uses a Dell computer that is older than she is. ''I'm going to ask my grandmother for one of these.''

HEADLINE: Layoffs Said to Be Near For Bank of America Unit

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Echoing the slowdown in activity that has hit Wall Street's biggest institutions, Bank of America plans to cut several hundred jobs in its investment banking unit this week, according to employees. 
With its acquisition of Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, Bank of America has evolved into one of Wall Street's biggest firms.
But according to interviews with several employees, all of whom insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter, the cuts stem from the weak trading environment as well as a desire to weed out underperforming workers as the year winds down.
''You want to trim your least productive, weakest players to preserve the bonus pool for everyone else,'' said one banker. ''We know things haven't been great in the spring or summer.''
Like many other firms on Wall Street, Bank of America's New York-based investment bank expanded in the first half of the year, hiring more than 1,000 employees amid hopes that the nascent economic recovery would pick up speed.
But as the broader economy has slowed, so has Wall Street. In the current quarter, New York Stock Exchange volume is running roughly 25 percent below the pace in the second quarter of 2010. Nasdaq volume is down 18 percent over the same period.
The layoffs are expected to affect several parts of the investment banking unit, including areas like equity and fixed-income trading as well as investment banking. Another executive added that management intended to periodically review business performance and make cuts.
The job reductions at the investment bank come at the same time as a broader refocusing in Bank of America's retail banking operations, said Richard X. Bove, an analyst with Rochdale Securities. In addition to closing some branches, the bank, based in Charlotte, N.C., is also shifting some workers from full-time status to part time.
''The headcount cuts are only one part of it,'' said Mr. Bove. ''Both on the capital markets side and on the traditional banking side, B. of A. is under pressure.''
Now the nation's biggest bank, the company has grown through many mergers. But at an investor conference last week, the company's chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, said it was time to focus on internal growth rather than more acquisitions.
''Our franchise is complete,'' Mr. Moynihan said. ''We don't need to acquire anything. We don't need to use capital for acquisitions.''

HEADLINE: Value of College Degree Is Growing, Study Says

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Despite rising tuition and student-loan debt levels, the long-term payoff from earning a college degree is growing, according to a report to be issued Tuesday by the College Board.
Workers with a college degree earned much more and were much less likely to be unemployed than those with only a high school diploma, according to the report, ''Education Pays: the Benefits of Higher Education for Individuals and Society.''
According to the report, the median earnings of full-time workers with bachelor's degrees were $55,700 in 2008 -- $21,900 more than those of workers who finished only high school. 
And the pay premium for those with bachelor's degrees has grown substantially in recent years. Among those ages 25 to 34, women with college degrees earned 79 percent more than those with high school diplomas, and men, 74 percent more. A decade ago, women with college degrees had a 60 percent pay premium and men 54 percent.
The report found that after about 11 years of work, college graduates' higher earnings compensated for four years out of the labor force and for student loans, at 6.8 percent interest, to cover the average tuition and fees at a public four-year university.
Even during the recession, a degree offered protection from unemployment. The 2009 unemployment rate of college graduates 25 and older was 4.6 percent, compared with 9.7 percent for high school graduates.
''Consistently over time, unemployment rates are about half for college graduates,'' said Sandy Baum, an author of the report. ''And jobs began recovering for college graduates about a year and half ago. While it's easy to find a college grad who's unemployed, you're statistically much less likely to be in that circumstance if you have a higher level of education.''
The debate over whether college is worthwhile has grown more spirited as tuition spirals higher, faster than inflation.
''For reasons that are not entirely clear, more people are questioning whether it's necessary to go to college,'' Ms. Baum said.
Among economists, though, even those who emphasize alternative approaches to skill development agree that for most people, a college degree pays off.
''In general, college is a good investment, but there is great variability in outcomes,'' said Robert Lerman, an economics professor at American University. ''A significant minority of college graduates don't earn as much as those with less education. And all is not lost if you don't go to college. There are other routes to improving your earnings, for example, credentials that demonstrate mastery of an occupational skill like plumbing.''
The report, first issued in 2004 and updated in 2007, also described social benefits: those with a bachelor's degree, it said, are more likely to volunteer, vote, exercise and have health insurance and pensions. They are also less likely to smoke, be obese or have low-birth-weight babies. It did not assert that a college education, by itself, was responsible for all those differences.
''Correlation is not the same as causation,'' Ms. Baum said. ''But that said, the people who have done careful statistical analyses, controlling for demographic characteristics like income and family background, have overwhelmingly concluded that there's some causation here, that some things that happen to you in college, for example, would make you more likely to adopt healthier behavior.''

HEADLINE: Extreme Heat Bleaches Coral, And Scientists See Global Threat

BYLINE: By JUSTIN GILLIS

 BODY:
This year's extreme heat is putting the world's coral reefs under such severe stress that scientists fear widespread die-offs, endangering not only the richest ecosystems in the ocean but also fisheries that feed millions of people.
From Thailand to Texas, corals are reacting to the heat stress by bleaching, or shedding their color and going into survival mode. Many have already died, and more are expected to do so in coming months. Computer forecasts of water temperature suggest that corals in the Caribbean may undergo drastic bleaching in the next few weeks. 
What is unfolding this year is only the second known global bleaching of coral reefs. Scientists are holding out hope that this year will not be as bad, over all, as 1998, the hottest year in the historical record, when an estimated 16 percent of the world's shallow-water reefs died. But in some places, including Thailand, the situation is looking worse than in 1998.
Scientists say the trouble with the reefs is linked to climate change. For years they have warned that corals, highly sensitive to excess heat, would serve as an early indicator of the ecological distress on the planet caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases.
''I am significantly depressed by the whole situation,'' said Clive Wilkinson, director of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, an organization in Australia that is tracking this year's disaster.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the first eight months of 2010 matched 1998 as the hottest January to August period on record. High ocean temperatures are taxing the organisms most sensitive to them, the shallow-water corals that create some of the world's most vibrant and colorful seascapes.
Coral reefs occupy a tiny fraction of the ocean, but they harbor perhaps a quarter of all marine species, including a profusion of fish. Often called the rain forests of the sea, they are the foundation not only of important fishing industries but also of tourist economies worth billions.
Drastic die-offs of coral were seen for the first time in 1983 in the eastern Pacific and the Caribbean, during a large-scale weather event known as El Nino. During an El Nino, warm waters normally confined to the western Pacific flow to the east; 2010 is also an El Nino year.
Serious regional bleaching has occurred intermittently since the 1983 disaster. It is clear that natural weather variability plays a role in overheating the reefs, but scientists say it cannot, by itself, explain what has become a recurring phenomenon.
''It is a lot easier for oceans to heat up above the corals' thresholds for bleaching when climate change is warming the baseline temperatures,'' said C. Mark Eakin, who runs a program called Coral Reef Watch for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ''If you get an event like El Nino or you just get a hot summer, it's going to be on top of the warmest temperatures we've ever seen.''
Coral reefs are made up of millions of tiny animals, called polyps, that form symbiotic relationships with algae. The polyps essentially act as farmers, supplying the algae with nutrients and a place to live. The algae in turn capture sunlight and carbon dioxide to make sugars that feed the coral polyps.
The captive algae give reefs their brilliant colors. Many reef fish sport fantastical colors and patterns themselves, as though dressing to match their surroundings.
Coral bleaching occurs when high heat and bright sunshine cause the metabolism of the algae to speed out of control, and they start creating toxins. The polyps essentially recoil. ''The algae are spat out,'' Dr. Wilkinson said.
The corals look white afterward, as though they have been bleached. If temperatures drop, the corals' few remaining algae can reproduce and help the polyps recover. But corals are vulnerable to disease in their denuded condition, and if the heat stress continues, the corals starve to death.
Even on dead reefs, new coral polyps will often take hold, though the overall ecology of the reef may be permanently altered. The worst case is that a reef dies and never recovers.
In dozens of small island nations and on some coasts of Indonesia and the Philippines, people rely heavily on reef fish for food. When corals die, the fish are not immediately doomed, but if the coral polyps do not recover, the reef can eventually collapse, scientists say, leaving the fishery far less productive.
Research shows that is already happening in parts of the Caribbean, though people there are not as dependent on fishing as those living on Pacific islands.
It will be months before this year's toll is known for sure. But scientists tracking the fate of corals say they have already seen widespread bleaching in Southeast Asia and the western Pacific, with corals in Thailand, parts of Indonesia and some smaller island nations being hit especially hard earlier this year.
Temperatures have since cooled in the western Pacific, and the immediate crisis has passed there, even as it accelerates in places like the Caribbean, where the waters are still warming. Serious bleaching has been seen recently in the Flower Garden Banks, a marine sanctuary off the Texas-Louisiana border.
In Thailand, ''there some signs of recovery in places,'' said James True, a biologist at Prince of Songkla University. But in other spots, he said, corals were hit so hard that it was not clear young polyps would be available from nearby areas to repopulate dead reefs.
''The concern we have now is that the bleaching is so widespread that potential source reefs upstream have been affected,'' Dr. True said.
Even in a hot year, of course, climate varies considerably from place to place. The water temperatures in the Florida Keys are only slightly above normal this year, and the beloved reefs of that region have so far escaped serious harm.
Parts of the northern Caribbean, including the United States Virgin Islands, saw incipient bleaching this summer, but the tropical storms and hurricanes moving through the Atlantic have cooled the water there and may have saved some corals. Farther south, though, temperatures are still remarkably high, putting many Caribbean reefs at risk.
Summer is only just beginning in the Southern Hemisphere, but water temperatures off Australia are also above normal, and some scientists are worried about the single most impressive reef on earth. The best hope now, Dr. Wilkinson said, is for mild tropical storms that would help to cool Australian waters.
''If we get a poor monsoon season,'' he said, ''I think we're in for a serious bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef.''

HEADLINE: Recession May Be Over, but Joblessness Remains

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
The United States economy has lost more jobs than it has added since the recovery began over a year ago.
Yes, you read that correctly.
The downturn officially ended, and the recovery officially began, in June 2009, according to an announcement Monday by the official arbiter of economic turning points. Since that point, total output -- the amount of goods and services produced by the United States -- has increased, as have many other measures of economic activity.
But nonfarm payrolls are still down 329,000 from their level at the recession's official end 15 months ago, and the slow growth in recent months means that the unemployed still have a long slog ahead. 
''We started from a deep hole,'' said James Poterba, an economics professor at M.I.T. and a member of the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee, which declared the recession's end. ''And clearly the bounce-back has not been immediate after hitting this trough.''
The declaration of the recession's end confirms what many suspected: The 2007-9 recession was not only the longest post-World War II recession, but also the deepest, in terms of both job losses and at least one measure of output declines.
The announcement also implies that any contraction that might lie ahead would be a separate and distinct recession, and one that the Obama administration could not claim to have inherited. While economists generally say such a double-dip recession seems unlikely, new monthly estimates of gross domestic product, released by two committee members, show that output shrank in May and June, the most recent months for which data are available. Output and other factors would have to shrink for a longer period of time before another contraction might be declared.
Even without a full-blown double dip in the economy, the recovery thus far has been so anemic that the job picture seems likely to stagnate, and perhaps even get worse, in the near future.
Many forecasters estimate that output needs to grow over the long run by about 2.5 percent to keep the unemployment rate, now at 9.6 percent, constant. The economy grew at an annual rate of just 1.6 percent in the second quarter of this year, and private forecasts indicate growth will not be much better in the third quarter. (The Business Cycle Dating Committee itself does not engage in forecasting.)
''The amount of unemployment we've already got and the slowness of recovery lead to predictions that we could have 9-plus percent unemployment even through the next presidential election,'' said Robert J. Gordon, an economics professor at Northwestern University and a committee member.
''What's really unique about this recession is the amount of unemployment in combination with the slowness of the recovery,'' he said. ''That's just not happened before. We had a sharp recession followed by a sharp recovery in the 1980s. And in '91 and '01 we had slow recoveries, but those recessions were shallow recessions, so the slowness didn't matter much.''
All three of these most recent recoveries have been known as jobless recoveries, as employment growth has significantly lagged output growth. In this recovery, the job market bottomed six months after economic output bottomed. That is still not nearly as much of a lag as experienced after the 2001 recession, when it took the job market 19 months to turn around after output improved.
This new pattern of jobless recoveries has led to some complaints that employment should play a more prominent role in dating business cycles and to criticism that a jobless recovery is not truly a recovery at all. Business Cycle Dating Committee members have been reluctant to change their criteria too drastically, though, because they want to maintain consistency in the official chronology of contractions and expansions.
While all three recent recoveries have been weak for employment, the job market has to cover the most ground from the latest recession.
From December 2007 to June 2009, the American economy lost more than 5 percent of its nonfarm payroll jobs, the largest decline since World War II. And through December 2009, the month that employment hit bottom, the nation had lost more than 6 percent of its jobs.
The unemployment rate, which comes from a different survey, peaked last October at 10.1 percent. The postwar high was in 1982, at 10.8 percent. But the composition of the work force was very different in the 1980s -- it was younger, and younger people tend to have higher unemployment rates -- and so if adjusted for age, unemployment this time around actually looks much worse.
The broadest measure of unemployment, including people who are reluctantly working part time when they wish to be working full time and those who have given up looking for work altogether, also was at its highest level since World War II.
There is some debate, though, about whether this recession was the worst in terms of output.
Adjusted for inflation, output contracted more than in any other postwar period, according to Robert E. Hall, a Stanford economics professor and committee chairman.
But some economists say that a better measure would be the gap between where output is and where it could have been if growth had been uninterrupted.
''It's definitely not as deep as 1981-82 when measured relative to the economy's potential growth rate,'' Mr. Gordon said.
Besides employment, nearly every indicator that the committee considers simultaneously reached a low point in June 2009, which made that month a relatively easy selection as the official turning point, Mr. Gordon said. The committee previously met in April but had decided that the data were inconclusive.
In its statement on Monday affirming the recession's end, the bureau took care to note that the recession, by definition, meant only the period until the economy reached its low point -- not a return to its previous vigor.
''In declaring the recession over, we're not at all saying the unemployment rate, or anything else, has returned to normal,'' said James H. Stock, an economics professor at Harvard and a member of the business cycle committee.
''We clearly still have a long ways to go.''

HEADLINE: To Save Them, A Plan to Prune Catholic Schools

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
For more than a quarter-century, while Roman Catholic leaders around the country have closed parochial schools by the dozens in the face of rising costs and falling enrollments, the Archdiocese of New York has conducted a more stately retreat. It has shuttered schools a few at a time, in a reluctant if relentless downsizing that has come to be known among some church leaders as ''the melancholy rite.''
Now, Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan is signaling that he will soon mount a more aggressive effort to close or consolidate elementary schools -- perhaps as many as 30 of the 216 in the system, according to some priests -- and ensure the future of those that remain.
In speeches and articles over the last few months, the archbishop has sketched the broad outlines of a plan that includes changing the way parochial schools are financed and, for the first time in the archdiocese's 160-year history, redefining the basic relationship between Catholics and their schools. 
Each elementary school has until now been financed mainly by members of its local parish. In the proposed reorganization, the cost of educating roughly 56,000 grade school students would be spread among all the parishes, and all the plate-passing churchgoers among 2.5 million Catholics in the archdiocese.
Joseph Zwilling, the archdiocese's spokesman, said no decision had been made about how many schools would close. But several pastors and school principals, who spoke on the condition that they not be named because they were not authorized to discuss the plan, said church officials had told them about 30 grade schools might close or be merged, most of them in the more densely populated and most financially ailing parishes of Manhattan and the Bronx, where large numbers of students are poor and non-Catholic. In the last 25 years, parochial school enrollment has plummeted by more than half, the bulk of it because of losses in those two boroughs.
Mr. Zwilling said that details of the plan, known as ''Pathways to Excellence,'' would probably be announced in October, and that the archbishop would not agree to an interview until then.
It will be Archbishop Dolan's first major initiative since he was named to head the church's flagship American diocese in February 2009. And it is expected to be the largest single school reorganization ever undertaken by the archdiocese, which includes Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and seven upstate counties.
The archbishop has not said whether he will place the schools under centralized archdiocesan authority or, as some dioceses have done, set up regional districts with a cluster of schools. In either case, the plan will take much of the ''parochial'' out of parochial school.
''We must admit that the days of expecting a parish by itself to support its school are coming to an end,'' the archbishop wrote on Sept. 9 in the archdiocesan newspaper, Catholic New York.
All dioceses have struggled with the steady loss of enrollment in parochial schools, which are considered important as feeders for Catholic high schools and colleges, and as developers of lifelong faith. Yet despite the loss of more than 1,500 schools in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities in the past decade, no church leader has suggested changes as sweeping as Archbishop Dolan's.
''Everybody has tried something piecemeal,'' said the Rev. Joseph V. Corpora, an administrator and consultant at the Alliance for Catholic Education, a project at the University of Notre Dame that is developing strategies to save Catholic schools. ''But what Archbishop Dolan is talking about goes way beyond that, to something all-encompassing.''
Many pastors said the idea of decoupling parochial schools financially from their parishes had deeper implications than any number of closings.
For example, parishes forced to close schools have long been allowed to keep the money from the sale or rental of those properties, since in most cases the buildings were built and maintained with parishioners' dollars. Those proceeds provide a financial cushion that has helped sustain many struggling parishes.
Under Archbishop Dolan's plan, however, all proceeds would go into a common fund for the education of children throughout the archdiocese.
Parent groups and principals also worry that centralized financing of schools will eliminate justification for a small tuition break now granted to students who live in the parish, a common practice in many parochial schools.
As if in anticipation of concerns like those, and of potential opposition from Catholics without children in the schools, Archbishop Dolan has recently spoken to business and education groups, calling for sacrifice for the greater good -- and sounding sometimes like a football coach trying to rally a faltering team during halftime.
''I fear a loss of nerve within our Catholic community!'' he wrote in Catholic New York. ''I fear as well an attitude that the support of our Catholic schools is only the duty of the parents who have children there.''
''Such a view, of course, is, simply put, 'non-Catholic,' '' he said.
Some experts say Archbishop Dolan is on the horns of a dilemma that has perplexed the church for a long time. ''He is saying what everyone has been thinking for years, but was too afraid to speak out loud,'' said Brother Brian Carty, founder of the De La Salle Academy in Manhattan, an independent middle school run by the Christian Brothers. ''Very few parochial schools draw kids from their parishes only.''
The recession has aggravated chronic budget problems in the archdiocese, which paid an additional $30 million in the 2009 fiscal year to help parishes and schools meet expenses, officials said.
The new initiative would not be the first big retrenchment by the archdiocese, which closed or merged 21 of its roughly 400 parishes and closed 9 schools in 2007. And it relies on some strategies that church leaders have used elsewhere, including in the neighboring Diocese of Brooklyn, which last year began creating community boards of lay people and priests to administer and raise money for clusters of struggling schools.
That diocese, which includes Brooklyn and Queens, has lost 20,000 students and closed more than 50 schools -- nearly half of its elementary school system -- in the last 12 years, reflecting a nationwide decline in Catholic school enrollment, from a peak of 5.2 million in the 1960s to about 2 million today.
Other strategies tried elsewhere include more aggressive fund-raising among alumni, and among the wealthy. Robert W. Wilson, a retired hedge fund titan and self-described atheist, gave $5.6 million to the archdiocese in August because, he said, Catholic schools ''do it better than the union-controlled inner city schools.''
Speaking to business leaders at the conservative Manhattan Institute in May, Archbishop Dolan said another priority was increasing the enrollment of Latinos, who make up almost half of all Catholics in the archdiocese but represent a tiny fraction of parochial school pupils -- mainly because of the difficulty many have paying tuition ranging from about $3,000 to $6,000 a year.
Church officials say they will seek feedback from parishioners and parents before finalizing the reorganization. Barbara Bortle-Gainey, president of the Staten Island Federation of Catholic School Parents, the most vocal of several parent groups, said the archdiocesan superintendent of education, Timothy J. McNiff, had requested a meeting with her group on Oct. 5.
''Everybody pretty much knows they have to come up with a different way to finance schools,'' Ms. Bortle-Gainey said.
In his recent statements, Archbishop Dolan pulled no punches: parochial schools have been ailing so long that administrators have adopted ''a hospice mentality,'' he said, as if '' 'the best we can do is making their passing comfortable.' '' To which he added, ''Malarkey!''

HEADLINE: WEST VIRGINIA SENATE RACE: Two New Endorsements

BYLINE: By BERNIE BECKER

 BODY:
The United States Chamber of Commerce announced Monday that it was endorsing its first Democratic Senate candidate of this cycle - Gov. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia.
Lisa Rickard, executive vice president of the Chamber, signaled in a statement that Mr. Manchin grasped the economic challenges the country faces and had created a climate in West Virginia conducive to creating jobs. 
''From cutting taxes on businesses and workers, to supporting common sense energy policies, Joe has been an independent voice in West Virginia,'' Ms. Rickard said.
The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce, which endorsed Mr. Manchin during his victorious runs for governor in 2004 and 2008, also said on Monday that it was backing his Senate bid. Steve Roberts, the West Virginia Chamber's president, said that the organization had historically stayed out of Senate races, but that it had been moved to act by the governor's commitment to job creation.
Mr. Manchin faces John Raese, a Republican businessman, in a November special election that will fill the remainder of the six-year term that the late Robert C. Byrd won in 2006.
The popular governor was widely seen as a heavy favorite when he entered the Senate race, even though he was running in what appeared to be a difficult political environment and in a state where President Obama lost handily in 2008. But there is concern among Democrats that the race has tightened, so the support from the pro-business Chamber could further bolster Mr. Manchin's centrist credentials.
For its part, the Raese campaign dismissed its opponent's new endorsements. ''It's a bunch of D.C. and Charleston insiders endorsing a professional politician,'' said Jim Dornan, Mr. Raese's campaign manager. ''It will have absolutely no impact on the final result.''
The national Chamber has vowed to play a major role in this year's elections and has already endorsed several Republicans running for Senate, including Marco Rubio in Florida, Rob Portman in Ohio and Carly Fiorina in California. J.P. Fielder, a Chamber spokesman, said the group also is backing some Democrats running for the House, including incumbents Dan Boren of Oklahoma and Walt Minnick of Idaho.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Brothers Koch and AB 32

 BODY:
Four years ago, bipartisan majorities in the California Legislature approved a landmark clean energy bill that many hoped would serve as a template for a national effort to reduce dependence on foreign oil and mitigate the threat of climate change. 
Now a well-financed coalition of right-wing ideologues, out-of-state oil and gas companies and climate-change skeptics is seeking to effectively kill that law with an initiative on the November state ballot. The money men include Charles and David Koch, the Kansas oil and gas billionaires who have played a prominent role in financing the Tea Party movement.
The 2006 law, known as AB 32, is aimed at reducing California's emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2020 and by 80 percent at midcentury. To reach these targets, state agencies are drawing up regulations that would affect businesses and consumers across the board -- requiring even cleaner cars, more energy-efficient buildings and appliances, and power plants that use alternative energy sources like wind instead of older fossil fuels.
The prospect that these rules could reduce gasoline consumption strikes terror into some energy companies. A large chunk of the $8.2 million raised in support of the ballot proposition has come from just two Texas-based oil and gas companies, Valero and Tesoro, which have extensive operations in California. The Koch brothers have contributed about $1 million, partly because they worry about damage to the bottom line at Koch Industries, and also because they believe that climate change is a left-wing hoax.
They have argued that the law will lead to higher energy costs and job losses, arguments that resonate with many voters in a state with a 12.4 percent unemployment rate. But this overlooks the enormous increase in investments in clean energy technologies -- and the jobs associated with them -- since the law was passed.
Overturning AB 32 would be another setback in the effort to fight climate change. The United States Senate has already scuttled President Obama's goal of putting a price on carbon. The Environmental Protection Agency, while important, can only do so much. This leaves state and regional efforts as crucially important drivers -- and if California pulls back, other states like New York that are trying to reduce emissions may do so as well.
The Kochs and their allies are disastrously wrong about the science, which shows that man-made emissions are largely responsible for global warming, and wrong about the economics. AB 32's many friends -- led by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California -- have therefore mounted a spirited counterattack in defense of the law.
Another respected Republican, George Shultz -- a cabinet member in both the Nixon and Reagan administrations -- has signed on as a co-chairman of this effort. Mr. Shultz credits AB 32 for an unprecedented ''outburst'' of technological creativity and investment.
Who wins if this law is repudiated? The Koch brothers, maybe, but the biggest winners will be the Chinese, who are already moving briskly ahead in the clean technology race. And the losers? The people of California, surely. But the biggest loser will be the planet.

HEADLINE: Cross-Border Tensions Are Seen at Conference

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
SANTA FE, N.M. -- There were hearty handshakes and friendly words, but the annual binational conference of border governors wound up here Monday as divided as it has ever been, as well as being a little short on governors.
The final communique showed a common vision among the participants about cracking down on violence along the border between the United States and Mexico, changing immigration laws and promoting economic development in the border zone. But it was the no-shows that made clear that cross-border unity was seriously frayed. 
Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona was supposed to host the 28th annual conference in Phoenix, but all six Mexican border governors refused to attend in protest of the immigration crackdown she signed into law.
After Ms. Brewer canceled her session, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico stepped in to organize a conference of his own, with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California as co-host.
Ms. Brewer stayed away, as did a fellow Republican, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. Then Mr. Schwarzenegger canceled because he was ill and sent his lieutenant governor, Abel Maldonado, a fellow Republican. That left Mr. Richardson as the lone United States governor in the discussions.
''It's their loss not to be here and to listen to their neighbors,'' Mr. Maldonado said of Ms. Brewer and Mr. Perry. ''We have some issues that we need to hash out.''
He said participants made a conscious decision not to dwell on Arizona or Ms. Brewer, which could have kept from discussions from moving on to anything else. ''We didn't want to cloud things up by bringing up Arizona,'' Mr. Maldonado said.
As five of the six Mexican border governors, and one governor-elect, spoke of unity, it was clear that the differences were significant. The view in Mexico is that heading to the United States for work is not an illegal act.
Whereas Mexican governors focus on the role of American guns and American drug use in the violence playing out in their country, the view in many parts of the United States is that the security woes south of the border are largely Mexican grown.
Perhaps trying to defend herself from afar, Ms. Brewer granted an interview with Univision, a major Spanish-language broadcaster, that was shown as the border governors' meeting began on Sunday. She said she was disappointed that the Mexican governors had not come to Arizona to hash out the issue of illegal immigration face to face and said she was hurt that she was being branded by some as a racist.
''Not only am I concerned, it's really disappointing to me,'' she told Jorge Ramos, a Univision anchor. ''I've lived in the Southwest my whole life. I've got many friends, of many cultures and certainly a great deal of them are Hispanics, and I love them from the bottom of my heart. I love everybody, Jorge, from the bottom of my heart.''
Mr. Richardson, the only Hispanic governor in the United States, said it was Arizona's harsh immigration law, much of which has been blocked by a federal judge, that prompted him to invite the Mexican governors to his state. ''This is not a meeting to criticize Arizona,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''We're here to have a positive meeting. We're not criticizing the governor. We're moving forward.''

HEADLINE: Neglecting The Base

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Maybe it was just a coincidence, but it was striking, nevertheless.
The mayor of Washington, Adrian Fenty, one of the so-called postracial black leaders, suffered a humiliating defeat in his bid for re-election last week when African-American voters deserted him in droves. The very same week President Obama, the most prominent of the so-called postracial types, was moving aggressively to shore up his support among black voters.
Mr. Obama, who usually goes out of his way to avoid overtly racial comments and appeals, made an impassioned plea during a fiery speech Saturday night at a black-tie event sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus. ''I need everybody here,'' he said, ''to go back to your neighborhoods, to go back your workplaces, to go to the churches and go to the barbershops and go to the beauty shops. And tell them we've got more work to do.'' 
It's no secret that the president is in trouble politically, and that Democrats in Congress are fighting desperately to hold on to their majorities. But much less attention has been given to the level of disenchantment among black voters, who have been hammered disproportionately by the recession and largely taken for granted by the Democratic Party. That disenchantment is likely to translate into lower turnout among blacks this fall.
The idea that we had moved into some kind of postracial era was always a ridiculous notion. Attitudes have undoubtedly changed for the better over the past half-century, and young people as a whole are less hung up on race than their elders. But race is still a very big deal in the United States, which is precisely why black leaders like Mr. Fenty and Mr. Obama try so hard to behave as though they are governing in some sort of pristine civic environment in which the very idea of race has been erased.
These allegedly postracial politicians can end up being so worried about losing the support of whites that they distance themselves from their own African-American base. This is a no-win situation -- for the politicians and for the blacks who put their hopes and faith in them.
Mr. Fenty was cheered by whites for bringing in the cold-blooded Michelle Rhee as schools chancellor. She attacked D.C.'s admittedly failing school system with an unseemly ferocity and seemed to take great delight in doing it. Hundreds of teachers were fired and concerns raised by parents about Ms. Rhee's take-no-prisoners approach were ignored. It was disrespectful.
Blacks responded last week by voting overwhelmingly for Mr. Fenty's opponent, Vincent Gray, who is also black. This blowback undermined whatever Ms. Rhee and Mr. Fenty had hoped to achieve. Thanks to their ham-handed approach to governing and disregard of the sensibilities of their constituents, both of them will soon be gone. But the children they claimed to care so much about will still be locked in a lousy school system.
Black voters across the country are not nearly as discontented with Mr. Obama as blacks in Washington were with Mr. Fenty. But neither do they have the same enthusiasm that they had in the historic 2008 election.
Mr. Obama has seldom addressed black concerns directly, although many of his initiatives have benefited blacks. What has taken a toll is the perception that the president has consistently seemed more concerned about the needs and interests of those who are already well off, who are hostile to policies that would help working people and ethnic minorities, and who in many cases would like nothing better than to see Mr. Obama fail.
Most blacks are reluctant to publicly express their concerns about the president because they are so outraged by the blatantly unfair and often racist attacks against him from the political right. But many blacks are unhappy that Mr. Obama hasn't been more forceful in the fight to create jobs. And there is disappointment over the dearth of black faces in high-profile posts in the administration.
The Shirley Sherrod fiasco fed the belief that the Obama administration was excessively concerned about the racial sensibilities of whites. The secretary of agriculture fired Ms. Sherrod without even giving her a hearing after an excerpt from a video appeared to show that she had discriminated against a white farmer. She had done no such thing, and she would later decline an offer to rejoin the administration.
There is real danger here for black people. In many cases, because of an excess of caution, policies that would help people in need are never even seriously considered, much less implemented. Forces that are hostile to blacks are not aggressively confronted, which, of course, empowers them. Perhaps more important, when you have to tiptoe around absolutely anything that has to do with blacks, it can leave the insidious impression that there is, in fact, something wrong with being black, something to be ashamed of.
We need to be careful not to corrode the joy and pride felt by blacks in the triumphs of African-American leaders.

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton, in Demand, Stumps for Obama

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
He was against him before he was for him.
During the 2008 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton was often at angry odds with the man who ultimately defeated his wife.
Now, in the final weeks of the 2010 midterm campaign, Mr. Clinton is stumping hard to help his onetime foe -- and has emerged as one of the most important defenders of President Obama's Congressional majorities. Some candidates are asking for his help on the campaign trail, rather than the president's. Even though Mr. Clinton insisted on Monday that he was only ''peripherally and fleetingly'' back in politics, he has been headlining rallies and fund-raisers across the country to buck up the depressed party faithful.
''They shouldn't take this lying down,'' Mr. Clinton said during a meeting with reporters and editors of The New York Times on Monday. 
Blaming Republican policies for digging the deep hole the economy is in, he said the Democrats needed to plead with voters for more time to turn things around.
''I think we ought to say, 'Look, don't go back to the shovel brigade -- give us two more years; if you don't feel better you can throw us all out.' ''
Mr. Clinton professes more interest in pressing humanitarian problems like clearing rubble in earthquake-ravaged Port-au-Prince -- the stuff of his day job at his Clinton Global Initiative charitable organization -- than monitoring turnout projections in Portsmouth, N.H.
In an interview that lasted roughly 90 minutes, Mr. Clinton talked passionately about his plans for the annual meeting this week of his nonprofit organization and about the need to more aggressively develop green industries and improve educational opportunities for women around the world.
But Mr. Clinton has not lost his fluency, and grasp of granular detail, in politics. For instance, he readily recalled the number of voters in a recent election for county executive in Westchester County, where he lives.
Mr. Clinton at times spoke in the apocalyptic terms of his party's more dejected activists.
''I hope they can avoid a calamity,'' Mr. Clinton said at one point, hastening to add, ''And I think they can.''
''If the election is about anger and apathy colored by amnesia, we're in deep trouble,'' he said. ''If the election is about what are we going to do now and who's more likely to do that, the president and the Congress have a real chance to come out of this fine.''
He called this year only ''partly'' a replay of 1994, the first midterm election of his presidential tenure, when Democrats lost their majorities in Congress. ''The Republicans are not led as adroitly as they were when Newt Gingrich had a whole plan,'' he said.
On the other hand, he said, Mr. Gingrich, who took over as speaker of the House in 1994, was willing to work with the White House post-election. He accused this year's Republicans of promising gridlock.
Whatever his feelings about Mr. Obama in 2008, Mr. Clinton is clearly feeling the president's strain.
''Most of the things they're saying about him they said about me, so I'm much more sympathetic to him than most people,'' he said. ''And when you get in there, if you're an earnest policy wonk like he is and I was, it's hard to believe there are people who really don't want you to do your job.''
In the last two weeks Mr. Clinton has campaigned for candidates in Georgia, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania, with plans to appear in California and Massachusetts in the days ahead. He has been a guest on ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,'' ''Meet the Press'' and even ''On the Record with Greta Van Susteren'' on the Fox News Channel on Monday night.
''He's welcome anywhere in the country,'' said Gov. Edward G. Rendell, Democrat of Pennsylvania, who spent a day campaigning with Mr. Clinton around Philadelphia last week. ''He's all upside and no downside.''
The Big Dog, as he is known among those in the tight world of Clinton associates, is actually a more diminutive dog these days -- so slimmed down that the ''Meet the Press'' moderator, David Gregory, asked him on Sunday, ''Are you O.K.?'' (The once voracious consumer of junk food says he lost weight at the insistence of his daughter, Chelsea, before her wedding in July, and credited a new heart-healthy diet.)
Mr. Obama, of course, is also the boss of Mr. Clinton's wife, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. And there is something in it for Mr. Clinton, too. Any microphone or tape recorder is a two-fer for him, giving him a chance to talk up his global works, as well as discuss politics. On Monday, for example, he urged donors to give more so he can hire more staff for the daunting rebuilding efforts in Haiti.
Mr. Clinton said he began making appearances only because Mrs. Clinton, in her current position, is forbidden from politicking. ''So there was nobody besides me to honor the people that supported her,'' he said.
It ''became something more,'' he added, when he realized how angry the electorate was, and how people did not appreciate what he described as the Democrats' accomplishments on student loans, jobs, health care and the economy.
On the trail, he tweaks his remarks depending on which Democrat he is speaking for -- a different speech for a candidate who supported health care than for one who did not.
He does not find it awkward that candidates want him at their side, rather than the current occupant of the White House.
''In '94,'' he said, ''some of them didn't want me.''

HEADLINE: Frustration and Fear Greet Obama in Town Hall Chat

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It was billed as ''Investing in America,'' a live televised conversation on the state of the economy between President Obama and American workers, students, business people and retirees, a kind of Wall Street to Main Street reality check.
But it sounded like a therapy session for disillusioned Obama supporters. 
In question after question during a one-hour session, which took place on Monday at the Newseum here and was televised on CNBC, Mr. Obama was confronted by people who sounded frustrated and anxious -- even as some said they supported his agenda and proclaimed themselves honored to be in his presence.
People from Main Street wanted to know if the American dream still lived for them. People on Wall Street complained that he was treating them like a pinata, ''whacking us with a stick,'' in the words of Anthony Scaramucci, a former law school classmate of Mr. Obama's who now runs a hedge fund and was one of the president's questioners.
''I'm exhausted of defending you, defending your administration, defending the mantle of change that I voted for,'' said the first questioner, an African-American woman who identified herself as a chief financial officer, a mother and a military veteran. ''I've been told that I voted for a man who was going to change things in a meaningful way for the middle class and I'm waiting sir, I'm waiting. I still don't feel it yet.''
A 30-year-old law school graduate told Mr. Obama that he had hoped to pursue a career in public service -- like the president -- but complained that he could barely pay the interest on his student loans, let alone think of getting married or starting a family.
''I was really inspired by you and your campaign and the message you brought, and that inspiration is dying away,'' he said, adding, ''And I really want to know, is the American dream dead for me?''
The extraordinarily personal tone of the session, coupled with more substantive policy questions from the host, John Harwood of CNBC and The New York Times, reflects the erosion of support for Mr. Obama among the constituencies that sent him to the White House two years ago.
It was all the more compelling coming from such a friendly audience; one questioner, a small-business owner in Pennsylvania, began by praising the president for turning around the auto industry, then lamented: ''You're losing the war of sound bites. You're losing the media cycles.''
As he leads his party into what many analysts expect to be a devastating midterm election for Democrats, the president faces overwhelming skepticism from Americans on his handling of the economy. A recent New York Times poll found 57 percent of respondents believed the president did not have a clear plan for fixing the nation's broken economy.
Mr. Obama sought on Monday to address those concerns, telling his business critics that he was not antibusiness and his middle class questioners that ''there are a whole host of things we've put in place to make your life better.'' He cited his health care bill, a financial regulatory overhaul measure that imposed tough requirements on credit card companies; an education bill that increased the availability of student loans.
The president also laid down a challenge to the Tea Party movement, whose candidates have swept aside mainstream Republicans in recent primaries in Alaska and Delaware. He said it was not enough for Tea Party candidates to campaign on a theme of smaller government; he tried to put them in an uncomfortable box by prodding them to offer specifics about the programs they would cut.
''The challenge for the Tea Party movement is to identify specifically: What would you do?'' the president said. ''It's not enough to say get control of spending. I think it's important for you to say, 'I'm willing to cut veterans benefits, or I'm willing to cut Medicare or Social Security, or I'm willing to see taxes go up.' ''
Mr. Obama hinted that he was open to considering a payroll tax holiday to spur job growth, saying he would be willing to ''look at any idea that's out there,'' although he went on to say that some ideas that ''look good on paper'' are more complicated than they appear.
And he ducked a question from Mr. Harwood about whether he would be willing to debate the House Republican leader, John Boehner of Ohio, the way former President Bill Clinton had a debate 15 years ago with Newt Gingrich, who was then the House speaker.
''I think it's premature to say that John Boehner's going to be the speaker of the House,'' Mr. Obama said.
Mr. Obama is stepping up his efforts to mobilize Democratic voters and find ways to improve the political climate for his party heading toward Election Day. He will begin trying to build enthusiasm among some of the voters who propelled him to victory in 2008, like college students, while Democratic strategists are considering ways to turn the increased prominence of the Tea Party movement to their advantage by characterizing positions taken by some Tea Party-backed Republican candidates as extreme.
The White House denied an article in The New York Times on Monday saying that Mr. Obama's political advisers were considering national advertising to cast the Republican Party as having been all but taken over by the Tea Party movement.
''The story that led The New York Times yesterday was flat out wrong,'' Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, said in an e-mail message. ''The White House has never discussed, contemplated or weighed such an ad campaign.''
Mr. Pfeiffer said the article ''was based on the thinnest of reeds,'' an anonymous source.
The Times stood by the report.
After his appearance on CNBC, the president flew to Philadelphia, where he appeared at two fund-raisers for Representative Joe Sestak, the Democratic Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, and raised $1 million for the Democratic National Committee.
If the televised session on Monday seemed to put Mr. Obama on the spot, he did not appear ruffled. Rather, he seemed resigned to the frustration of his questioners.
''My goal here is not to convince you that everything is where it needs to be,'' the president said, ''but what I am saying is that we are moving in the right direction.''

HEADLINE: Men Are Fuming, Women Are Despairing

BYLINE: By MEGAN THEE-BRENAN and JANET ELDER; Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It is not exactly the year of the angry man, but it may be something close to that. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found a sharp difference in the way men and women say they are going to vote in November.
Men say they will vote for the Republican candidate rather than the Democratic candidate in their districts by a margin of 45 percent to 32 percent. The numbers are nearly reversed for women, with 36 percent saying they will vote Republican and 43 percent saying they will vote Democratic. 
Ever since 1980, when Ronald Reagan inspired more men than women, the difference in the way men and women vote has been a significant part of American politics. Women have been more likely to favor Democratic candidates, an advantage Democrats have come to count on. Women also historically outnumber men when it comes to showing up at the polls.
But this year may be different. Even though women are still more likely to vote Democratic, the poll suggests that they may stay home this year, giving more of the decision-making to men by default.
So far in this election, women have not been nearly as attentive as men and have expressed less enthusiasm about voting, the poll found. Men are more likely than women to fall into the category of voters who say they are paying a lot of attention to the campaign right now. They are also more likely than women to say they are more enthusiastic about voting in this Congressional election than they remember being in past midterm elections.
The poll suggests that men are angrier than women, and that their anger may be more motivating than the sense of hopelessness expressed by women, particularly on economic issues.
''I'm confused'' about whom to vote for, one of the poll respondents, Diana Rhoads, 59, of Hallam, Pa., said in a follow-up interview. Ms. Rhoads, an independent who voted for President Obama, added: ''I just don't know who I can count on to move us in the direction I'd like to see the country go. Frankly, the financial problems are beyond our understanding.''
The political divide between men and women was bridged in 2006 when a wave of anti-Republican sentiment swept the country. In that year, when Democrats took control of the House and the Senate from Republicans, women made up 52 percent of the electorate and voted for Democrats by a 56 percent to 44 percent margin. Men followed suit, supporting the Democrats by a 52 percent to 48 percent margin.
Mr. Obama captured the male vote in 2008, the first time a Democratic presidential candidate had done so since 1992.
But 2006 and 2008 may prove to be anomalies. Kathleen Dolan, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, says that ''while the story of the gender gap has often been told through the lens of the outsize support women have for Democrats, the flip side is the outsize support men have for Republicans.''
She said that if men returned this year to their historical tendency to vote Republican, it would undercut Democrats in the midterm election.
Times/CBS polls in the last six months have found pluralities of men identifying themselves as independents, while pluralities of women still say they are Democrats. Majorities of both men and women currently have a negative view of the Republican Party. Women, however, maintain their party loyalty and view the Democratic Party positively.
While there is some doubt that the discouraged women will turn out to vote on Nov. 2 in the same numbers they historically do, that is not the only wild card this year. The question remains as to whether the men who voted Democratic in 2006 and 2008 will return reliably to the Republican Party.
One such voter, Ray Barrow of Reston, Va., a 69-year-old independent who voted for Mr. Obama, said: ''I'm enthusiastic about candidates that want to talk about fiscal conservatism. I am dissatisfied with the performance of both the president and the Democrat-controlled Congress. I'm going to vote for candidates who believe in fiscal conservatism and the right way to spend to create jobs.''

HEADLINE: DELAWARE SENATE RACE: Help From the Outside

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
Senator Jim DeMint, the conservative South Carolina Republican, is putting his political action committee's money where his mouth is, releasing on Monday a new television ad in Delaware that attacks the Democratic senate candidate, Chris Coons, for his close ties to Washington. 
Mr. Coons is running against Republican Christine O'Donnell, one of the handful of Tea Party candidates with Mr. DeMint's support. Considered a long-shot, she won the Republican primary for Delaware's open Senate seat less than a week ago.
The 30-second spot, funded with $250,000 from the Senate Conservatives Fund that Mr. DeMint chairs, begins with images of Mr. Coons and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. A narrator intones, ''Harry Reid calls Chris Coons his 'pet.'''
''Delaware doesn't need a Washington career politician's pet,'' the spot continues. ''Christine O'Donnell's not afraid to stand up to the party bosses and power brokers.''
In an interview with The Hill last week, Mr. Reid called Mr. Coons ''my pet'' and ''my favorite candidate'' - a sound bite that other conservatives have already picked up on.
On Saturday, former House speaker Newt Gingrich brought the crowd at the annual Values Voter Summit to applause when he declared: ''I love pets, I'm in favor of pets, I think pets are wonderful. But I do not think they should serve in the United States Senate.''
The S.C.F. ad, which will hit the airways officially on Tuesday, ends with a promise that Ms. O'Donnell will ''get our economy moving again,'' ''balance the budget,'' and ''stop the bailouts,'' before finally concluding, ''Christine O'Donnell stands up for us, not for Washington.''
The PAC-funded spot comes on the heels of another Delaware ad buy this past weekend attacking Ms. O'Donnell. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee released an ad Sunday warning that ''we don't know a lot about Christine O'Donnell'' and questioning her record.
The 30-second spot claims, as images of Ms. O'Donnell on a image of a blue-hued, photo negative click by, that the Republican candidate ''spends money she doesn't have,'' ''hired employees she didn't pay,'' ''stiffed businesses,'' and ''didn't pay her taxes.'' The ad ends by quoting a former O'Donnell aide who told a newspaper, ''She was financially completely irresponsible.''
She was originally considered a long-shot to win her party's nomination against Representative Mike Castle, a moderate Republican and long-time legislator, and an even longer shot to win Delaware's Senate seat in November. This new attack ad may be the D.S.C.C.'s attempt to prevent Ms. O'Donnell from picking up any further momentum.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: After Day of Intense Talks, Muslim Leaders Unite Behind Community Center

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD

 BODY:
The proposed Islamic community center and mosque in Lower Manhattan got its strongest vote of confidence yet from major Muslim leaders on Monday, after months of behind-the-scenes grumbling that they were not properly consulted on the project, and a day's worth of intense and painful conversations at a hotel near Kennedy International Airport.
Leaders of local and national groups gathered at the site of the planned center, two blocks from ground zero, and declared not only that the planners had a constitutional right to build it, but also that they would help the project move forward in the face of heated opposition. They insisted that, as a matter of principle, the center should not budge from its planned site. 
But the unity news conference followed a two-hour meeting on Sunday in which the leaders asked tough questions of Sharif el-Gamal, 37, the real estate developer spearheading the project. Mr. Gamal fully embraced Islam only as an adult and was meeting many of the nation's Muslim communal leaders for the first time.
In interviews on Monday afternoon, many of the participants said that Mr. Gamal had satisfied most of the concerns that American Muslims had about the project: that it was elitist and had not been sensitively planned or promoted.
According to people at the meeting and other members of their organizations, the developer apologized for not consulting more with leaders ahead of time and said that he had not realized how strong the opposition would be. He also addressed concerns that the center would be only for ''Manhattan elites'' who have embraced interfaith dialogues led by the imam involved in the project, Feisal Abdul Rauf, or can afford its potentially expensive amenities like swimming pools and gym memberships.
Aisha al-Adawiya, who founded Women in Islam, based in Harlem, said participants stressed that the center should be accessible to poorer Muslims and offer programming that addressed their interests and needs. Mr. Gamal, who lives on the Upper West Side, promised that it would be ''open and inviting'' to all Muslims, she said.
Mr. Gamal also promised that Islamic groups in the New York area, including those representing African-Americans, would be included on an advisory committee he was forming and on the center's board of trustees.
He fielded skeptical questions about how the center would raise money in a tough economic climate. He declared that he was ''the decision maker'' and that Mr. Rauf, who did not attend the meeting on Sunday, was heading only the center's religious and interfaith programs; participants had wondered who was in charge. And Mr. Gamal shared his personal journey in Islam, saying the religion helped him get his life together after several brushes with the law.
But if Mr. Gamal encountered problems in pushing his project forward as a relative unknown, he will now have to deal with baggage his new Muslim supporters carry. Just as he and Mr. Rauf have seen their lives and views dissected and combed for hints of anti-American or radical sentiment, many Islamic organizations since 9/11 have been dealing with heightened scrutiny of their donors and members. Those supporting Mr. Gamal on Monday were immediately pilloried on the Internet by some opponents of the project.
The meeting was organized by the Majlis Ash-Shura of New York, also known as the Islamic Leadership Council of Metropolitan New York, which represents 55 mosques and Muslim groups. But it also included leaders of large national Muslim groups, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the Islamic Circle of North America and the Muslim American Society, all of which have been under a microscope.
One of them, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, was listed as an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal case against the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, a charity based in Texas whose leaders were convicted in 2008 of funneling money to Hamas. The council has said it has no link to terrorism.
One of the most emotive new supporters was Mahdi Bray of the Muslim American Society, who said that like Rosa Parks, the center's planners were being told: ''We want you to move. You offend us being where you are. This is not the right place for you to be.''
Mr. Bray was asked about a video from 2000 in which he appeared to cheer and pump his fist when asked if anyone in the crowd supported Hamas and Hezbollah, listed as terrorist groups by the United States government; he said the scene was taken out of context.
Asked Monday by an audience member whether they would condemn Hamas, those at the news conference declined to answer, saying they wanted to focus on the planned center.
At the same time, they said their main concern was not the center itself but what they saw as a wave of anti-Muslim sentiment that had led people to oppose mosques in neighborhoods from Staten Island to California.
''Ground zero does not belong to a specific group of people or religion,'' said Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ''Ground zero belongs to all Americans.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 25, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about a vote of confidence from Muslim leaders over the proposed Islamic community center in Lower Manhattan may have left the incorrect impression that the Islamic Leadership Council of Metropolitan New York was listed as an unindicted co-conspirator in a case against a charity whose leaders were convicted of funneling money to Hamas. The reference to ''the council'' involved in the case was to the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

HEADLINE: Supporting a Modest Contest for Artists, but Hoping for a Big Influence

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
When it comes to art competitions, there are high-profile contests with big prizes and then, well, there are other ones.
Competitors on the Bravo reality show ''Work of Art: The Next Great Artist'' got to be on television, and the winner received $100,000 and a solo exhibition currently on view at the Brooklyn Museum.
In New York City's new contest for emerging artists, 150 winners will have their images printed on 5-inch-by-6-inch postcards and displayed at the Rush Arts Gallery in Chelsea or at three city-owned spaces on the Lower East Side, in Harlem and on Staten Island for 10 days. The city is spending $40,000 on the competition. 
Though the contest does not provide the grandest of platforms, the city still hopes it will help boost the fortunes of fledgling artists, whose vitality will in turn fuel the economy.
Danny Simmons, who is helping run the contest, known as Curate NYC, for the city's Economic Development Corporation, said he and his collaborator, Brian Tate, proposed using the postcards instead of actual works of art because of space limitations.
''We figured if we did it this way, so many more artists would get exposure,'' he said.
''There's an economic reason'' for helping the arts, said Teresa Vazquez, who directs arts and nonprofit development at the corporation. ''There are jobs associated with it and tourism associated with it, and an attraction for other industries to be here because there are creative thinkers here.''
The development corporation estimates that the arts employ roughly 40,000 people in the city and contribute billions of dollars annually in tourism.
Artists who want to enter the contest have until Oct. 6 to upload an image onto the competition's Web site, curatenyc.org. A panel of nine curators will choose the winners. As of Tuesday afternoon, 20 artists had submitted images.
Not everyone sees the utility of the contest.
''The winner doesn't have their art actually physically exhibited anywhere?'' asked the artist William Powhida of Brooklyn, who is known for his satirical illustrations of art-world power structures. ''I don't think anyone would go just to see a wall of postcards.''
But for artists who have no opportunity to show their work, something is better than nothing, Mr. Powhida acknowledged. And there was a time not too long ago when few people in city government worried about how to help artists gain recognition.
The contest is one of several recent initiatives the city has undertaken to help emerging artists. One program taught artists business skills, and another provides free outdoor performance spaces.
Because the city is still recovering from the recession, the programs have had to be financed modestly. Initially, no money was set aside for Curate NYC. The idea was to offer free space in city-owned properties and find organizations or individuals to run art exhibitions. But no one volunteered to help with that idea, so the development corporation retooled the concept, attaching the idea of a competition and offering the $40,000 to attract an outside organizer.
The contract was awarded to Full Spectrum Experience, a nonprofit group founded by Mr. Tate and Mr. Simmons, and largely financed by Con Edison.
In addition to the postcard shows, which will take place next month, the artists' work is being displayed on the contest's Web site, which Mr. Tate said was partly modeled on Charles Saatchi's Web site for student artists, saatchi-gallery.co.uk/stuart. The Web site will live on beyond the exhibition and become a permanent resource, he said.
Mr. Tate and Mr. Simmons said that the cost of the competition would have far exceeded the $40,000 budget but that they and their Web developer and printer agreed to charge discounted rates.
Mr. Simmons said the contest's success would be measured by how many artists submit their work and how many people visit the contest's Web site.
''Then, further down the road, we're trying to figure out from the artists those people who have had contacts with curators'' or dealers as a result of the program, he said.
Despite his skepticism, Mr. Powhida said he would do his part to publicize the competition's Web site. ''I think I'll try to do these artists a favor and send it out on Twitter,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Yemen Military Besieges Town It Says Is a Hide-Out for Dozens of Qaeda Militants

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH; Muhammad al-Ahmadi and Nasser Arrabyee contributed reporting from Sana, Yemen.

 BODY:
DAMASCUS, Syria -- Yemeni troops and counterterrorism teams have laid siege to a town in southern Yemen where several dozen Qaeda militants were said to be holed up, in an apparent escalation of the Yemeni government's campaign against the group, witnesses and officials said.
Thousands of civilians have fled the town of Hawta in recent days, after the government warned them to stay clear of the fighting, witnesses and relief officials said. Local officials said the military was intermittently shelling the town with tanks and artillery and firing on the jihadists from attack helicopters on Monday and Tuesday. 
The battle in Hawta follows a recent rise in deadly attacks by Al Qaeda's regional branch, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is based in Yemen. The militant group drew international attention last Dec. 25 when it claimed responsibility for training a Nigerian who tried to set off a bomb aboard a Detroit-bound jetliner.
The group was relatively inactive for some time afterward, but in recent months a series of brazen raids on checkpoints and security outposts have left at least 50 police officers and soldiers dead, mostly in southern Yemen.
This month, Al Qaeda's regional branch issued a ''death list'' of 55 police officials it threatened to kill, and late on Monday it claimed credit for the August kidnapping of a senior intelligence official in northern Yemen and gave the government 48 hours to release two imprisoned Qaeda members or face unspecified consequences.
The fighting comes as the Obama administration's top counterterrorism official, John Brennan, is in the Yemeni capital, Sana, to talk to President Ali Abdullah Saleh about American military and economic support. In the past, United States officials have expressed concern that the Yemeni government was not taking the Qaeda threat seriously enough, though it has worked more closely in the past year with the American military on counterterrorism efforts, including several American airstrikes.
Later this week the Friends of Yemen, a group of Western and Arab governments formed this year to help shore up Yemen's stability, is scheduled to meet in New York. Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, has struggled with an intermittent armed rebellion in the north and a secessionist movement in the south, and is increasingly dependent on foreign assistance.
Hawta, in southern Yemen's mountainous Shabwa Province, is at the heart of the remote area east and south of the capital where Al Qaeda's regional arm has sought sanctuary. It is also just to the north of a major new liquid natural gas pipeline -- a crucial resource in a country that is rapidly running out of oil and water -- and Yemeni officials have voiced concern about the possibility that jihadists could rupture the line.
Few details were available about the fighting in Hawta, which began on Monday. Three of the militants had been killed and four had been wounded as of early Tuesday, said Ali Hassan al-Ahmadi, the governor of Shabwa. It was not clear whether any of the jihadists in the town were among the leaders of Al Qaeda's regional branch, which is thought to number a few hundred members.
Yemen's Interior Ministry said on its Web site that the Qaeda fighters had prevented a number of villagers from leaving and were using them as human shields. One local tribal leader, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals, said the militants had refused all efforts by local tribesmen to persuade them to leave the town peacefully.
Hawta is the hometown of Abdullah al-Mehdar, a Qaeda member who was killed earlier this year, and it has been known for some time as a sanctuary for the group.
Al Qaeda's regional branch has taken advantage in recent months of the rising lawlessness in southern Yemen, where a secessionist movement has gathered force over the past year. North and South Yemen, previously separate nations, united in 1990 but fought a brief civil war four years later, and many southerners claim the north has mistreated them and starved them economically ever since.
Most leaders of the Southern Movement, as it is known, espouse nonviolence and condemn terrorism. But a rising hatred of the government throughout the south has fostered violent confrontations with the police and a chaotic environment where Al Qaeda appears to be flourishing.
Yemen also appears to be taking stronger courtroom measures against jihadists and people suspected of being their supporters. The Yemeni journalist Abdulelah Hider Shaea, who gained prominence after interviewing Qaeda leaders last year, was charged on Sunday with assisting the group, helping it recruit members and acting as its spokesman, Yemeni officials said.
Mr. Shaea has written extensively for aljazeera.net and has been widely quoted in the Western press; he had been planning to participate in a conference on Yemen in Washington earlier this year, but was unable to attend. He is the only journalist known to have interviewed Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born cleric who is believed to have been in contact both with the gunman in the Fort Hood massacre, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, and the Nigerian in the airline plot last December, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.
Mr. Awlaki is now hiding in Shabwa, and capturing or killing him has become a high priority for the American military.
Mr. Shaea's lawyer, Abdulrahman Barman, said Tuesday that he had seen no evidence to substantiate the charges, and that Mr. Shaea had bruises on his body, apparently the result of police beatings after he was arrested last month. Kamal Sharaf, a cartoonist, was also arrested with Mr. Shaea, though the charges against him were not clear.
Four other men were charged in Sana on Monday with plotting terrorist attacks, including a Yemeni-German teenager, Rami Hans Harman.
Prosecutors said the men trained alongside a suicide bomber who tried earlier this year to assassinate Britain's ambassador to Yemen, Timothy Torlot. No one was killed in that attack except the bomber.
Qaeda Unit Says It Kidnapped 7
PARIS -- A regional branch of Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, claimed responsibility on Tuesday for kidnapping seven foreign workers in Niger last Thursday, including five French citizens.
They were working for French companies, including the nuclear group Areva, which mines uranium in the Arlit region of Niger.
A spokesman for the militant group, in an audio statement on Al Jazeera, said that it would set demands for the release of the workers to the French government and warned France against taking military action.
French forces are trying to track down the kidnappers with sensor-equipped aircraft.

HEADLINE: Fed May Buy More Debt To Perk Up Recovery

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Officials at the Federal Reserve signaled on Tuesday for the first time that they were worried that the slow-moving economic recovery could be undermined by very low rates of inflation, and hinted strongly that it might resume buying vast amounts of government debt to spur the recovery. While the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee did not take any new steps on interest rates, it communicated in unmistakable terms its concerns about the fragility of the economic recovery and a threat to stable prices.
It said that underlying inflation levels, which have hovered at about half the Fed's 2 percent target rate, were ''somewhat below those the committee judges most consistent, over the longer run, with its mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.''
That was a departure from just six weeks ago when the committee commented that inflation measures had ''trended lower in recent quarters.'' The concern over low inflation has raised fears of deflation -- a sustained drop in wages and prices. 
Last month, the Fed said it was ''prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed'' to support the recovery and get inflation back to normal.
For now, the Fed took no such action. It will continue to maintain its portfolio of securities by reinvesting the proceeds from its holdings of mortgage-related bonds to buy long-term Treasury debt, the tactic it announced on Aug. 10. That strategy was intended to prevent the possibility of a slight tightening of monetary policy that would have occurred as bonds held by the Fed were paid off and money was taken out of the economy.
On Tuesday the Fed's policy-making committee did what most market analysts expected; it deferred the decision on whether it should begin a big new push to speed the recovery by creating money for large-scale purchases of Treasury securities, a strategy known as quantitative easing. Such easing would push down long-term interest rates, which could help reduce the already low cost of borrowing.
''They can't say unequivocally that we're going into another recession, but they certainly can't promise a rapid recovery,'' said Michael D. Bordo, an economist at Rutgers University and an authority on monetary policy. ''They're in this limbo state.''
Moments after the central bank announced its decision, stock prices, which had been flat most of the day, rose with the Dow increasing as much as 80 points. But some investors wanted the Fed to take bolder steps and the rally fizzled. The Dow ended the day up 7.41 points.
Last March, the Fed completed a big round of quantitative easing after buying $1.4 trillion in mortgage-related securities and $300 billion in Treasury debt in the space of 15 months.
In a speech on Aug. 27, at the Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, left no doubt that a big new round of quantitative easing was one option if the recovery needed a lift. Other options include signaling that the Fed intends to keep rates low for even longer than markets already expect, or lowering the interest paid on reserves that banks hold at the Fed -- a step that could encourage banks to lend more.
''The committee put a marker down in August,'' said Ellen E. Meade, an economist at American University who studies Fed decision-making. ''They want to keep it out there, but they don't want to use it just yet. They opened the door on quantitative easing, and they're keeping it open until they're sure they need to close it.''
Angel Gurria, secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said, ''The Fed needs to be vigilant but doesn't necessarily need to restart the program at this stage.''
He added: ''We need to know if this is a short-term weakness or if it has longer staying power. We believe it is more likely that the weakness is temporary and that we will probably recover from this recent bump. It's a pothole, not a ditch.''
The committee began its meeting on Tuesday at 8 a.m., an hour earlier than usual, to leave plenty of time for discussion in an acknowledgment of the Fed's uncertainty.
Though the recession officially ended in June 2009, as the academic arbiters of the nation's business cycles announced Monday, the 9.6 percent unemployment rate shows no signs of improvement.
''On balance, has the economy been worsening since Jackson Hole? Probably not,'' Professor Meade said. ''Have there been a few signs that things have gotten better? Maybe. The urgency that seemed to be on the margins in August may have lessened, and that's the argument for waiting.''
While the Fed tries to operate outside of political cycles, the fact that this was the last scheduled policy meeting before the midterm elections cannot have escaped its members' notice. The committee is next scheduled to gather for a two-day meeting on Nov. 2 -- Election Day -- and Nov. 3.
''All else equal, if they can postpone action until after the midterm election, they would prefer to do that,'' said Jonathan H. Wright, an economist at Johns Hopkins University and a former Fed researcher.
There is a growing expectation among Wall Street economists that the Fed will resume quantitative easing later this year, either at the November meeting or at the committee's final meeting this year, on Dec. 14. Of course, the forecasters have been known to err.
''I think there's a big split within the committee,'' Professor Wright said. ''To get the F.O.M.C. to really do any of the remaining options that they have open to them, it would take some really clear signal of the economic outlook worsening.''
To no one's surprise, the Fed on Tuesday left the benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal funds rate, at which banks lend to each overnight -- at near zero, its level since December 2008, and reiterated that the rate would likely remain ''exceptionally low'' for ''an extended period,'' the wording it has consistently used since March 2009.
And equally expectedly, Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, was the lone dissenter in the committee's 8 to 1 vote. He has objected at every committee meeting this year to the Fed's language on keeping short rates low, and he also opposed the decision made in August to reinvest proceeds from mortgage-related securities in new purchases of government debt.
The Tuesday meeting was unusual in one respect. There were only nine officials voting, not the normal 12. That was because the Fed's seven-member board of governors now has three vacancies, after the retirement of Donald L. Kohn on Sept. 1.
President Obama has nominated three people to fill the seats, but the Senate has not yet confirmed them. Along with the seven governors, the committee includes the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating group of four other regional Fed presidents.

HEADLINE: Currency, A Trade Gap And China

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Beijing
Spend enough time with Chinese officials and economists, and you will hear a story about the Japanese yen in the 1980s.
Back then, Americans were upset about Japanese imports flowing into the country, just as they are upset about Chinese imports today. So the United States pushed Japan to let the yen appreciate, thereby making Japanese imports more expensive and American exports to Japan cheaper. Tokyo complied, and the yen surged almost 50 percent from 1985 to 1987.
Yet the imports kept coming. The trade deficit with Japan actually widened to $108 billion in 1987, from $94 billion in 1985. The rising yen wasn't enough to halt the growth of companies like Sony and Toyota. They had too many advantages, including lower labor costs.
The moral of the story, in the Chinese telling, is that even a sharp rise in China's renminbi won't necessarily do much to help the American economy. ''Renminbi appreciation may not have a big impact,'' Fan Gang, an economist and former government adviser, said last week at a meeting here with American economists and policy makers, ''or an impact at all.'' 
And it's true that a stronger renminbi would not be a quick fix for our economic problems, as appealing a notion as that might be. The yen isn't the only parallel here. The renminbi itself rose 21 percent against the dollar from 2005 to 2008, and the trade deficit continued to widen.
But there is also no question that China's currency remains undervalued, probably by 20 percent or so. The economics are simple enough. The huge demand for Chinese goods should be driving up the price of its currency, but Beijing has been intervening to prevent that. Getting China to stop will be crucial to correcting the global economy's imbalances. A stronger renminbi will help China's people -- many of whom are hungry for better living standards, to judge by the recent labor strikes -- buy more goods and services, and it will also help the rest of world produce more. But change is not going to happen overnight.
China's Communist Party has had a very good 20-year run by making incremental changes and then watching the benefits accumulate over time. Realistically, that may be the best we can hope for with the renminbi.
It also happens to be the ultimate moral of the story about the yen -- even if Chinese officials tend to leave that part out.
A big change in an exchange rate seems at first glance that it should have an immediate impact. Certainly, it has some impact. The 1980s trade deficit with Japan would have grown even more rapidly had the yen not risen.
But there are two main reasons that a stronger renminbi probably will not lead to a rapid hiring increase in the United States.
The first is that China and United States aren't the only two countries in the world. Many products that we think of as being made in China, like the iPhone, are really just assembled in China. High-end parts often come from richer countries, like Israel or South Korea. Basic parts can be made in poorer countries, like Vietnam.
The entire value of the product counts toward the trade deficit between the United States and China. A stronger renminbi, however, would affect only the portion of the work done in China. And if the renminbi rose enough, some of this work would simply shift to a country like Vietnam (where per capita income is about $3,000, compared with $6,500 in China). Such a shift wouldn't help close our overall trade deficit.
Chinese officials sometimes go so far as to suggest that the value of the renminbi makes little difference. That's wrong. China's economy is now large enough that its currency matters. But the issue is more complicated than it first seems.
The second reason not to view the exchange rate as a cure-all is that economies, like battleships, tend to turn slowly. Companies rarely move production in a matter of weeks. If they are using a Chinese supplier, it is often cheaper to stick with that supplier for a while, even if costs rise, rather than find a new one in another country.
The car business makes for a good example of what might change and when. The industry may not seem typical of the China story, because it has more to do with American exports than Chinese imports. But exports probably matter more for American jobs anyway, given that low-end toy manufacturing in Guangdong Province isn't moving to Alabama or Michigan.
Like other first-time visitors to China, I have been struck by the number of Buicks on the roads here. In one Beijing traffic jam, three different Buick minivans were idling in the lane next to mine. When was the last time you were surrounded by Buicks?
Unfortunately for American autoworkers, though, none of those Buicks minivans was made in the United States. Buick exports only the high-end Enclave sport utility vehicle to China and makes the rest of its vehicles locally, with a Chinese partner. BMW, similarly, makes the 3- and 5-series here but ships in the costlier 7-series and Z sports cars.
With a stronger renminbi, you could see how carmakers might draw the dividing line in a different place, especially as the Chinese car market grows. The highest-margin vehicles would no longer be the only ones that could support the higher labor and shipping costs -- not to mention China's 25 percent vehicle tariff.
Already, American exports to China are a big deal. They are on pace to equal about $83 billion this year, up from $68 billion last year and $21 billion a decade ago, adjusted for inflation. As a point of reference, $10 billion of gross domestic product equals about 80,000 jobs on average. So every extra $10 billion of goods sold to China is like its own little stimulus program.
Like any other stimulus, this one will require some politics -- namely, pressuring China and negotiating with it. Companies will have to make clear, as General Electric, Microsoft and others have begun to, that their growth in China depends on the government taking property rights seriously and being more open to foreigners. As one European executive of a Chinese technology firm told me, ''Foreigners can't do anything alone here.''
The United States and other countries, meanwhile, will have to look for any possible leverage to reduce tariffs and other barriers and push up the renminbi. China is eager to buy advanced technology, for example, and not all the items on the United States' forbidden list are truly matters of national security. The Obama administration has started to prune this list.
Then, of course, there are those bills before Congress ominously threatening to put new tariffs on Chinese imports. The bills have definitely gotten China's attention. If anything, they are a hotter topic in Beijing than in Washington, filling state-run newspapers and broadcasts.
The tricky part now is using the credible threat of tariffs to force a faster rise in the renminbi -- which is up only 1.6 percent since 2008, mostly in the last two weeks -- without setting off a trade war that would cost jobs in both countries.
With the benefit of hindsight, we can see the real lesson of that story about the yen is that success can take time. The yen has continued to gain strength since the 1980s and, even after its fall in the last week, it is still more than twice as high versus the dollar as in 1985. Not coincidentally, the trade deficit with Japan, as a share of the economy, has shrunk 66 percent.
This is the path that rising economic powers, from Germany to the United States to Japan, have taken before. They start as exporters and then build up a thriving domestic economy. (Japan, alas, hasn't been so good at the second part.) It's the path China needs to take now, for the sake of its citizens and for the world.
The currency move of the past couple of weeks is a good start -- so long as it continues.

HEADLINE: Weakness on Wall Street After Fed Decision

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Shares on Wall Street got a brief bump on Tuesday after word that the Federal Reserve was ready to do more to help the economy, but indexes ended mostly lower after the central bank disappointed some investors by not taking any bold new actions.
Treasury prices rallied as investors saw the Fed's announcement as a signal that more bond purchases were on the way. 
The Fed said it was concerned that inflation was below levels consistent with a healthy economy and indicated that it was ready to provide ''additional accommodation'' to support the recovery. That would mean more purchases of Treasuries or other kinds of debt, which would keep interest rates low in a bid to encourage borrowing.
''They left themselves as much room as they possibly could,'' said E. William Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. ''In the bond world, the coast is clear for buyers.''
Treasuries rose sharply after the Fed's announcement, sending interest rates lower. The price on the 10-year Treasury note rose 1 4/32, to 100 14/32, while the yield fell sharply, to 2.57 percent from 2.70 percent late Monday. The yield is a common benchmark for setting interest rates on corporate debt and mortgages.
The Fed's statement, which came after a one-day meeting of its interest rate committee, had only a temporary effect on stocks. Hopes had been building that the Fed would announce a new bond-purchasing program.
Shares had been trading lower ahead of the Fed's announcement and rallied briefly after the news came out. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 80 points after the announcement.
But a late slump erased most of the day's advances. The Dow rose 7.41 points, or 0.07 percent, to close at 10,761.03. It is still up 7.5 percent for September.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 2.93 points, or 0.26 percent, to 1,139.78, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 6.48 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,349.35.
The weakness in broader indexes suggested that a three-week rally on the stock market might be losing steam as stocks started to seem expensive. The S.& P. 500 is still up 8.6 percent for the month, an extraordinarily strong showing for September, while the Nasdaq is up 11.1 percent.
Tom Porcelli, head of United States market economics at the Royal Bank of Canada, said there was now a good chance that the Fed would decide to add more debt to its books at the next meeting of its rate-setting committee on Nov. 2.
But another round of bond buying by the Fed may offer the economy little help, he argued. The last round of Fed purchases had the effect of lowering lending rates by a half a percentage point.
Now, a move by the Fed would probably have less impact. Interest rates are low but borrowing is still weak. ''The fact remains that the economic backdrop is the driver of lending, not low rates,'' Mr. Porcelli wrote in a note to clients after the announcement.
In corporate news, steep discounts and higher costs drove fiscal first-quarter profit lower at ConAgra Foods. Shares of the company, which owns the Chef Boyardee and Peter Pan brands, fell 80 cents, or 3.6 percent, to close at $21.57.
The cruise line operator Carnival Corporation reported a 22 percent jump in quarterly profit as demand was strong during the summer. It also raised its full-year earnings outlook well above analysts' forecasts. The company's stock rose 51 cents, to $37.57.
The dollar fell against other major currencies. Gold prices continued to hover near record highs, trading up $8.80, to $1,287.15 an ounce.
Falling stocks outnumbered rising ones two to one on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to one billion shares.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts in August Exceeded Analysts' Forecasts

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Housing starts in the United States increased more than expected in August, to their highest level in four months, and permits for residential construction also rose, government data showed on Tuesday, suggesting that the embattled market was starting to stabilize after the end of a tax credit. 
The Commerce Department said housing starts rose 10.5 percent, the largest increase since November, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 598,000 units. July's residential construction was revised down to show a 0.4 percent gain, which was previously reported as a 1.7 percent increase.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected housing starts to rise to a 550,000-unit rate. Compared with August a year ago, housing starts were up 2.2 percent.
New building permits rebounded 1.8 percent, to a 569,000-unit pace, last month after a 4.1 percent drop in July, lifted by a 9.8 percent rise in permits for multifamily units. Analysts had expected a 560,000-unit pace in August.
The housing market has hit a soft patch after the end of a home buyer tax credit in April. A combination of high unemployment and an oversupply of homes is also weighing on the sector, which was the main catalyst of the worst recession since the Great Depression.
The downturn ended in June last year, but the economic recovery has since lost momentum, setting off fears in financial markets of a renewed recession.
Residential construction in August was lifted by a 32.2 percent jump in groundbreaking activity in the volatile multifamily segment to an annual rate of 160,000 units.
Single-family starts increased 4.3 percent, to a 438,000-unit pace, the highest since June.
Home completions increased 5.6 percent, to a 603,000-unit pace, also the highest since June. The inventory of total houses under construction was unchanged at 444,000 units last month, while the total number of units authorized but not yet started fell 3.1 percent, to a record low 87,000 units

HEADLINE: Too Many Hamburgers?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Tianjin, China
To visit China today as an American is to compare and to be compared. And from the very opening session of this year's World Economic Forum here in Tianjin, our Chinese hosts did not hesitate to do some comparing. China's CCTV aired a skit showing four children -- one wearing the Chinese flag, another the American, another the Indian, and another the Brazilian -- getting ready to run a race. Before they take off, the American child, ''Anthony,'' boasts that he will win ''because I always win,'' and he jumps out to a big lead. But soon Anthony doubles over with cramps. ''Now is our chance to overtake him for the first time!'' shouts the Chinese child. ''What's wrong with Anthony?'' asks another. ''He is overweight and flabby,'' says another child. ''He ate too many hamburgers.''
That is how they see us. 
For the U.S. visitor, the comparisons start from the moment one departs Beijing's South Station, a giant space-age building, and boards the bullet train to Tianjin. It takes just 25 minutes to make the 75-mile trip. In Tianjin, one arrives at another ultramodern train station -- where, unlike New York City's Pennsylvania Station, all the escalators actually work. From there, you drive to the Tianjin Meijiang Convention Center, a building so gigantic and well appointed that if it were in Washington, D.C., it would be a tourist site. Your hosts inform you: ''It was built in nine months.''
I know, I know. With enough cheap currency, labor and capital -- and authoritarianism -- you can build anything in nine months. Still, it gets your attention. Some of my Chinese friends chide me for overidealizing China. I tell them: ''Guilty as charged.'' But have no illusions. I am not praising China because I want to emulate their system. I am praising it because I am worried about my system. In deliberately spotlighting China's impressive growth engine, I am hoping to light a spark under America.
Studying China's ability to invest for the future doesn't make me feel we have the wrong system. It makes me feel that we are abusing our right system. There is absolutely no reason our democracy should not be able to generate the kind of focus, legitimacy, unity and stick-to-it-iveness to do big things -- democratically -- that China does autocratically. We've done it before. But we're not doing it now because too many of our poll-driven, toxically partisan, cable-TV-addicted, money-corrupted political class are more interested in what keeps them in power than what would again make America powerful, more interested in defeating each other than saving the country.
''How can you compete with a country that is run like a company?'' an Indian entrepreneur at the forum asked me of China. He then answered his own question: For democracy to be effective and deliver the policies and infrastructure our societies need requires the political center to be focused, united and energized. That means electing candidates who will do what is right for the country not just for their ideological wing or whoever comes with the biggest bag of money. For democracies to address big problems -- and that's all we have these days -- requires a lot of people pulling in the same direction, and that is precisely what we're lacking.
''We are not ready to act on our strength,'' said my Indian friend, ''so we're waiting for them [the Chinese] to fail on their weakness.''
Will they? The Chinese system is autocratic, rife with corruption and at odds with a knowledge economy, which requires liberty. Yet China also has regular rotations of power at the top and a strong record of promoting on merit, so the average senior official is quite competent. Listening to Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China tick off growth statistics in his speech here had the feel of a soulless corporate earnings report. Yet he has detailed plans for his people's betterment, from universities to high-speed rail, and he's delivering on them.
Orville Schell of the Asia Society, one of America's best China watchers, who was with me in Tianjin, put it perfectly: ''Because we have recently begun to find ourselves so unable to get things done, we tend to look with a certain overidealistic yearning when it comes to China. We see what they have done and project onto them something we miss, fearfully miss, in ourselves'' -- that ''can-do,'' ''get-it-done,'' ''everyone-pull-together,'' ''whatever-it-takes'' attitude that built our highways, dams and put a man on the moon.
''These were hallmarks of our childhood culture,'' said Schell. ''But now we view our country turning into the opposite, even as we see China becoming animated by these same kinds of energies. I don't idealize China's system of government. I don't want to live in an authoritarian system. But I do feel compelled to look at China in an objective way and acknowledge the successes of this system.'' That doesn't mean advocating that we become like China. It means being alive to the challenge we are up against and even finding ways to cooperate with China. ''The very retro notion that we are undisputedly still No. 1,'' added Schell, ''is extremely dangerous.''

HEADLINE: Theater Renovation Welcomed as a Gain For Arts in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
An experimental music organization has plans to renovate a dilapidated 600-seat theater space near the Brooklyn Academy of Music, a move that some hope will re-energize an effort to build a cultural district around the academy in downtown Brooklyn.
The music group, Roulette Intermedium, which has been based in Manhattan since 1978, signed a 20-year lease in August for a total of 14,000 square feet of space at the Y.W.C.A. of Brooklyn, which will include its administrative offices and the theater, at the corner of Atlantic and Third Avenues. 
Roulette expects to spend $700,000 to $900,000 restoring the theater, which was built in 1927, into a top-notch performance site for its artists, who include Meredith Monk, John Zorn and visiting musicians, said Jim Staley, Roulette's founder.
''It's just the right kind of place and a very public space, with good acoustics and a lot of character, so we jumped on it,'' Mr. Staley said. Roulette had been seeking a permanent home for 15 years, he said.
For almost three years, the Y.W.C.A. weighed leasing space to various arts organizations against tenants like McDonald's and Duane Reade.
Those operations would have paid more but would have destroyed the theater's architectural integrity to create a conventional retail or restaurant space, said Martha Kamber, the Y's executive director.
Apart from the theater, the building contains housing for low-income women and a community center.
''We were really looking for a partner who loved the space as much as we did and was committed to restoring it,'' Ms. Kamber said.
While the Y.W.C.A. was initially asking $60 a square foot to lease the space, the organization ended up accepting a total of about $50,000 a year less to lease it to Roulette, she said.
''Some of that was because we fell in love with Roulette and thought they were the perfect fit, and some of that was because of the poor market,'' Ms. Kamber said. ''And I think our neighbors would not have been too happy with a Duane Reade.''
The Y.W.C.A. sits on the southwestern edge of what is called the Brooklyn Academy of Music Cultural District, an area between Fulton Street and Hanson Place south of Fort Greene Park that the city has been slowly transforming into a cultural haven for artists and performers over the course of a decade.
Several locations and offices for arts organizations were created earlier in the decade out of vacant and underused properties in the area, though activity has slowed in recent years with the pressure of the recession. The city says that more than 50 arts and cultural groups now exist in a concentrated area around the academy.
Though central to the BAM Cultural District, the academy does not oversee its development. In January 2009, however, it announced a $300 million expansion plan that includes a new 263-seat theater for the district. Called the BAM Fisher Theater, it is expected to be completed in the summer of 2012.
The city is leading the cultural district's development and has pledged to spend $100 million, some of which could be used to subsidize developers of arts and cultural venues or offices.
''Over the next several years, we will invest $100 million in new and enhanced cultural venues and infrastructure to expand downtown Brooklyn's cultural district and create an even more vibrant arts destination for Brooklynites, all New Yorkers and visitors from around the world,'' Kate Levin, the New York City cultural affairs commissioner, said in an e-mail.
Besides the BAM Fisher Theater, other projects, most of which have been on the drawing board for years, include a 27,500-square-foot site for the Theatre for a New Audience -- for which ground has not yet been broken -- and a streetscape enhancement project for Ashland Place and Lafayette Street within the district, both to be completed by fall of 2012.
Two other projects, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2012, are the renovation of the former Strand Theater on Fulton Street to create more space for arts organizations already there, and the creation of an 8,000-square-foot public Arts Plaza on Ashland Place.
In the meantime, the scattered parking lots ripe for redevelopment that have been the hallmark of the cultural district for the last decade remain. Still, many hope that Roulette's relocation to Brooklyn will provide inspiration to move forward with the district.
''The grand gestures of major development on those parking lots haven't happened yet,'' said Paul G. Wolf, a principal with Denham Wolf Real Estate Services, a commercial real estate firm focusing on nonprofits that put together the Roulette deal. ''But certainly, the idea of a cultural district inspired a lot of people to think about that area in a different way, and Roulette should be a driver of the neighborhood.''
Roulette will have its main entrance marked by an awning on Third Avenue at the corner of Atlantic, near a development called Atlantic Gardens, a collection of eight three-story row houses on Atlantic Avenue restored for retail and residential space in 2006.
Owned by Atlantic Assets Group, Atlantic Gardens has been trying to attract as tenants arts and cultural organizations, said Barbara Koz Paley, a partner in Atlantic Assets. Currently, tenants include the De Castellane Gallery, a chocolate maker, a cafe and a salon spa, but Atlantic Gardens has also had more than a dozen pop-up or temporary retailers in recent years, most of them arts organizations.
''We're very excited Roulette is coming,'' Ms. Paley said. At Atlantic Gardens, which has a 5,000-square-foot community garden, ''we're holding a fund-raiser for Roulette in October.''
Jaime Schultz, a senior retail leasing associate at GFI Retail Group, which is leasing remaining spaces at Atlantic Gardens, said a majority of the businesses seeking retail space along Atlantic Avenue, which holds an annual Art Walk, were creative ones. Roulette's presence should spur even more activity, she said.
''This major retail corridor, which is Atlantic, will encompass the flavor of all the surrounding communities,'' Ms. Schultz said, ''and support for the arts has been such a collaborative effort here, by landlords and residents, that I think the arts will be nurtured along Atlantic Avenue for a long time to come.''

HEADLINE: Injuries Gain Attention As Football Feels Pain

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Could we be witnessing the demise of American football as we know it?
This question struck me as I watched doctors and trainers scurry around on the sidelines in the first two weeks of the N.F.L. season, seemingly busier than ever in checking injured players.
The pressure is on football, at all levels, to deal with recent revelations that concussions are more dangerous and pervasive than most people had thought. 
''A player on the sideline no longer goes to the bench and shakes his head,'' said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee.
''He is now getting very serious attention,'' he added in a telephone interview Tuesday. ''That's very important.''
On Thursday, Miller's committee will hold its latest hearing on concussions, this time in Washington. He hopes this year to pass a bill mandating more attention to concussions. He and Representative Tim Bishop, Democrat of New York, are its sponsors.
Miller, 65, is clearly not out to destroy the sport he played in high school and community college -- fullback and linebacker, he said.
Both ways?
''Oh, yeah, in those days you begged to go both ways,'' he said with obvious enthusiasm.
Miller, who represents a district in the East Bay area near San Francisco, stayed up Monday night ''trying to root my 49ers home,'' he said. He said he watched college and high school football, and added, ''Members of my family coach, all my kids played, I went through all the hell that high school players go through, and all the fun.''
A willing straight man asked Miller if he had ever sustained a concussion.
''Ask the people who know me,'' he replied.
From his long association with the sport, he wants to make it safer.
''The N.F.L. ignored it for a long time, but it grabbed hold of it,'' Miller said, praising Commissioner Roger Goodell and the players union for facing the issue, albeit belatedly.
''The N.F.L. sets the trends,'' Miller said, noting that he saw three or four people attending to injured players in recent games.
Maybe more people are aware of injuries in football -- not a bad thing. Even with some slip-ups in allowing groggy players back onto the field, the N.F.L. certainly does seem to be trying to monitor injuries. Maybe it's because so many people are paying attention, but the injury rate in the first two weeks of the season seemed abnormally high.
Of course, with all the television loot the N.F.L. takes in, the league can afford to ratchet up the care of players during games and practices. But what about the players in youth leagues and high school programs and the semipro feeder league, that is to say, college football?
At what point does putting people on the field in helmets and pads become too expensive in dollars as well as residual carnage?
Miller said he wanted his bill to issue guidelines at the state and local level, letting the districts handle concussions in their own ways. But in these hard economic times, districts are cutting programs, including some sports, and some taxpayers are already irate about the cost of communal action. I can envision, in the near future, some kind of (you should pardon the expression) Tea Party revolt of taxpayers over the rising cost of football. Citizens may love their ''Friday Night Lights'' (Buzz Bissinger's book and a subsequent television series about high school football in Texas), but will they love their Monday morning tax increase?
Citizens may not want to pay a tax to have adequate medical treatment on the football sideline and continuing supervision of athletes during the year. Brain scans for 30, 40, 50 football players? Modern helmets? Ambulances and neurologists on the sideline? Who needs all that?
Also, given the Internet, parents and athletes now have access to recent articles by Alan Schwarz of The New York Times, some describing the dangers of concussions from practices rather than just games. At what point do parents refuse to allow their children to play football?
And it's not just football.
''Girls' soccer in high school is the second-leading place of concussions,'' Miller said, referring to the technique of directing the ball with the head. ''That's a very dangerous thing. You see it coming, it makes a difference in how you respond, how you distribute the force of that impact. But when you don't see it coming, you don't have time to respond to the impact.''
Still, it is football that is under the spotlight because of the rising number of damaged players. Does Miller think his sport is in trouble?
''I don't know -- it's pretty engrained,'' he said. ''It's a wonderful sport to watch, it's a wonderful sport to participate in, but I think you have to recalibrate the things we do for players' safety.''
This committee is not a hangin' jury for football. But the scrutiny of the sport could alter it forever.

HEADLINE: One Day In Transcendence

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
MORE than a year ago, before anybody had the slightest inkling that a potential closing was in the offing, I achieved the unexpected coup of a reservation at El Bulli, Ferran Adria's temple of avant-garde dining in Spain.
I had never been there before, and it was a bit of a departure for me. In covering food and wine, I've had an awful lot of opportunities to eat in Michelin three-star restaurants or the equivalent. Most of the time, I have tried to avoid them. Sure, the food is great. The meals are also complicated, incredibly expensive, time consuming and fatiguing. 
Maybe I've become that horrid caricature, the jaded guy who dreads the punishment of having to go to a fancy restaurant. And in this economy! I know, we all should have such problems.
I didn't always feel this way. Up until a few years ago, nothing would have thrilled me more than dining at one of the most famous restaurants on earth. I remember mind-blowing, life-changing meals at Boyer Les Crayeres outside Reims, France; and Taillevent in Paris; and fabulous gatherings here in New York, at Le Bernardin, Per Se and Jean Georges. Last year, I took my family to Daniel on my older son's 18th birthday as a rite of passage, and he and I had the joy of discovering Alinea together on a college trip to Chicago.
But over time, I have come to prefer simplicity over an exhausting complexity and numbing elaboration. One of the greatest meals in my recent memory took place in a rustic Italian wine cellar in Campania, where, leaning against barrels in the dim light, we bit into balls of warm, creamy buffalo mozzarella, bread torn from a crusty loaf and chunks of spicy dried pork sausage. We drank rough red wine, the perfect complement. The flavors were so elemental, direct and pure that I cannot imagine a better meal, even if we'd had cutlery.
I've experienced a parallel progression with wine. Who wouldn't love a great Burgundy, a first-growth Bordeaux or a beautifully aged Barolo every night of the week?
Should I feel ashamed to raise my hand here? Perhaps, again, because I have had the pleasure of drinking many of these wines, I can afford to feel choosy. Deserving wine lovers would trade an awful lot of Sancerre for a bottle of Montrachet, one of the pinnacles of white-wine making. I know this feeling deep in my gut. I certainly have not drunk enough Montrachet in my life to be jaded about it, but at least I've had the opportunity to savor it. Until you've had such experiences, the quest for great wines -- for benchmarks -- is of paramount intellectual importance.
But if you have had these enviable opportunities, what becomes clear is that majestic old bottles of magnitude and complexity, as well as more modest bottles, have their proper place. Young, fresh wines offer carefree pleasures, and build the foundation for a lifetime of enjoying wine. These unpretentious wines form a basis for distinguishing wines of greatness and consequence, just as humble, everyday meals provide the earthbound frame of reference for heavenly feasts.
Context is everything. Leaving aside moral consequences, the regular consumption of monumental wines and exquisitely prepared foods diminishes their capacity to inspire. When everything is awesome, people lose the capacity to be awed. But reserving them for the rare moments when the right company and the right time coalesce can't help but intensify their meaning.
So it was with El Bulli. It had been a gorgeous, sunny day in Spain, in the city of Roses on the Costa Brava, the takeoff point for our journey to the restaurant. And it is indeed a journey. A painfully narrow road winds precariously over a promontory to the quiet cove where the restaurant is. Dizzying drops, unimpeded by guardrails, plant gruesome images of smoking wrecks in the canyon below -- please, God, let it be after the meal, not before!
Finally we arrived at the restaurant, a tranquil oasis where the only sound seemed to be the waves lapping at the shore. For me, the drive was liberating, opening the mind and soul to whatever followed. It was not merely a cab ride across town, but a crossing to another world, like arriving at Brigadoon.
It almost doesn't matter what we ate, and after 38 courses, none bigger than a few bites, who can remember specifics? Oh, if you insist, I can't forget extraordinary beetroot cookies and tomato crackers, each capturing sweet essences in suspended animation. Or succulent oysters blended with luscious bone marrow, or tiny ravioli, the skins like clear plastic teabags, which melt in your mouth until they dissolve in an explosion of pine nut flavor.
What remains lodged in my memory is the totality -- the laughter, the surprise, the moments of discovered deliciousness as each novel presentation unmoored the food from the burden of expectations. I thought back many years, to the look of absolute astonishment and delight on the face of my son Peter the first time he tasted chocolate cake. I think that look was plastered on my face over the course of our five-hour meal.
One of my friends brought along some older Riojas that were astounding in their own right. But how do you pair wines with so many different dishes? Left to the extensive but quite reasonably priced wine list, I would have stuck happily with Champagne throughout the meal. Not ordinary Champagne either, but superb, hard-to-find bottles like Selosse Brut Initiale, which retails for about $125 but was on the list for $165, or Jerome Prevost for $140, or maybe both.
My meal was a transcendent experience, as it was meant to be. Once in a lifetime is perfect, though I wouldn't put it past El Bulli if twice were even more so.

HEADLINE: A Teenager's Summer Job Leaves a Lifelong Impact

BYLINE: By DAVID ROONEY

 BODY:
Evangelical fervor thrives on depression, so it's no surprise that America's economic free fall and plummeting national morale have coincided with a sharp rise in religious crusading. (Koran burning, anyone?) With no solution to his own or the world's problems, the end-times believer at the center of ''A Bright New Boise'' simply chants, ''Now, now, now,'' in a prayer for deliverance. 
Such bleak times foster desperate searches for meaning, a plight shared by all the characters in Samuel D. Hunter's play, which starts out funny and steadily becomes more disquieting as its existential questions are amplified.
Directed with a firm hand by Davis McCallum and designed with pinpoint accuracy by Jason Simms, the production comes to the Wild Project, an increasingly interesting Lower East Side home for new work, from the resident collaborative ensemble Partial Comfort Productions, of which Mr. Hunter is a member.
The setting is the drably utilitarian staff break room of Hobby Lobby, a craft-supply chain store. Its single window provides a rectangular view of the hard edges and dismally cheery colors of the retail space -- and the unaccommodating world -- beyond. The specter of ''corporate'' also looms in the regulations by which Pauline (Danielle Slavick), the store manager, runs her not-so-tight ship.
Into this Boise blah-zone steps Will (Andrew Garman), who has fled his rural Idaho hometown after a scandalous tragedy at his nondenominational church. In a blunt introduction, he blurts out his hidden connection to Alex (Matt Farabee), a sullen teenage summer worker.
The setup is a reversal of David Harrower's ''Blackbird,'' in which a young woman bursts into a sterile workplace to confront an older man with the sins of his past. As it develops, however, ''Boise'' takes a path more akin to those of comedies of intercolleague awkwardness, like ''The Office'' or, more specifically, ''The Good Girl,'' the 2002 movie about misfit workers in a tacky Texas department store.
But Mr. Hunter introduces darker themes. While Will seeks atonement, Alex wants to step out from behind his walls and belong. His protective foster-family brother, Leroy (John Patrick Doherty), aims to shock the world out of complacency with his profane T-shirt art. Pauline strives for order out of chaos, while the ditzy Anna (Sarah Nina Hayon), another employee, only wants a dramatic ending to the bland fiction she devours.
There are false notes, particularly from the female characters, but the five-member cast is uniformly strong and sympathetic.
Mr. Hunter undercuts the effectiveness of Will's big confessional reveal by having him relate the circumstances of his disgrace to Alex in an earlier exchange, but nonetheless, there's plenty to chew on here. And if the ending is anticlimactic, isn't that in keeping with a doomsday scenario in which life just goes wearisomely on?
''A Bright New Boise'' continues through Oct. 2 at the Wild Project, 195 East Third Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101, thewildproject.com.

HEADLINE: Iran's Leader Warns U.S. As He Rebuts Criticism

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; William Yong contributed reporting from Tehran.

 BODY:
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran ran through his standard talking points at his annual gathering with American journalists on Tuesday, denying that dissidents languished in jail or that economic sanctions were biting, and rejecting the idea that Tehran deserved anything less than a gold star for its nuclear inspection record. But this time, he embroidered his remarks with a little fresh bluster.
Seated at a conference table surrounded by news editors and television producers, the Iranian president told his breakfast guests that, should the United States attack Iran over its nuclear program, it would become embroiled in a war that would make previous American conflicts pale in comparison. 
''The United States has never entered a real war, not in Vietnam, nor in Afghanistan, nor even World War II,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said during the meeting at a hotel in Midtown Manhattan, part of what has become his ritual charm offensive when he attends the United NationsGeneral Assembly. ''War is not just bombing someplace. When it starts, it has no limits.''
At the same time, he rejected the idea that tensions would ever reach that point, dismissing the threat of an attack on Iran as mere psychological warfare. ''We have always been prepared to talk,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said.
Relations between Tehran and Washington have become even more distant since the United Nations Security Council passed a fourth round of sanctions in June -- penalties that were supplemented by additional measures passed by the United States and Asian and European nations. The United Nations nuclear watchdog said this month that Iran had since refused to give inspectors access and information about its nuclear program.
Iran insists that its nuclear program is peaceful, but American officials have said it is moving closer toward ''nuclear weapons capability.''
On Tuesday, Mr. Ahmadinejad blamed politics for the pressure and criticism from international inspectors, saying that they had access to Iranian nuclear sites and that his country was operating in line with international nuclear treaties.
''Iran's nuclear case is a political case,'' he said. ''Otherwise, why would it be essential for the details of our nuclear program to be made available to the media?''
He continued: ''What we do is legal. We always stand behind the law.''
Mr. Ahmadinejad defended Iran's judiciary, which faced a barrage of criticism over the arrests of an estimated 500 journalists, activists and government officials after his disputed re-election in June 2009. This summer, an Iranian woman's sentence of death by stoning for an adultery charge, which has reportedly been suspended, set off more international condemnation.
But on Tuesday, Mr. Ahmadinejad told reporters, ''You do not understand our judicial system.'' He said Iran was not imprisoning anyone for political reasons -- a view at odds with the assessments of human rights groups.
''Whatever happened is done under the supervision of the judge, disciplinary forces and the intelligence,'' he said. ''People criticize the government very harshly in fact, and we don't create any restrictions on it.''
Mr. Ahmadinejad, asked for his reaction to the proposed $60 billion sale of combat aircraft and other American arms to Saudi Arabia, said the United States evidently had economic problems the sale would help solve. The arms, he said, ''are not threats to us,'' although the deal was devised to bolster defenses with American allies in the region and restrict any leverage Iran might seek with its nuclear program.
But Mr. Ahmadinejad cautioned that such arms might one day fall into the wrong hands, apparently a wry allusion to what happened in Iran after the shah fell and an American-armed ally became an adversary. If Saudi Arabia's politics changed, he said, those arms ''might fall in the hands of others.''
While Mr. Ahmadinejad has sought to use the United Nations visit to portray himself as the powerful leader of a unified nation, political rivals in Iran's conservative hierarchy appear to be exploiting his absence to embarrass him at home. Some have suggested that he could even be impeached over what they have described as his autocratic behavior and disregard for other branches of government, particularly Parliament.
Parliament's speaker, Ali Larijani, broadly hinted at the constitutional power of the legislative branch to remove Mr. Ahmadinejad, in a speech given Sunday, as the president was traveling to New York. ''The legislative branch has important powers, and the people select representatives in the event that administration infringes on the rights of the people,'' Mr. Larijani said.

HEADLINE: Wary Kin Watch Cuba For Proof Of a New Path

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Elaine De Valle contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Fashion boutiques, restaurants, a bank -- Jorge Gomez plans to help his relatives in Havana open whatever business they want. But when?
Like many Cubans on and off the island, Mr. Gomez has been scrutinizing the Cuban labor federation's announcement last week that 500,000 public sector workers would soon be laid off and expected to find jobs in small private enterprises, possibly reshaping Cuba's state-dominated economy. That declaration, though, was not yet enough for Mr. Gomez; not enough to offset the memory of previous economic openings that Fidel and Raul Castro later slammed shut.
''You start something and they just tell you to stop,'' said Mr. Gomez, 40, the owner of a money transfer business here, as he waited for his flight to Havana. ''It's a system designed not to function.''
Cuba, it seems, is still being watched with wary eyes here -- and the nation's plan to step toward an unknown economic hybrid could hang in the balance. 
The expatriate community in South Florida, often so vehemently at odds with the Castro government, is a natural -- and perhaps necessary -- source of capital for the private sector Cuba says it must expand to resuscitate its economy.
A growing number of Cuban-Americans are already reconnecting with the island, making use of the Obama administration's decision last year to abandon restrictions on their ability to travel there and send money to relatives.
What many people now ask is whether Cuba is being forced by economic hardship to respond with its own halting, vague form of welcome.
Just over a month has passed since President Raul Castro told the National Assembly that the state's ''inflated rosters'' would be trimmed, opening the door to self-employment in jobs like carpentry or rabbit-raising, and for more workers to form cooperatives.
Experts say that the changes proposed by Cuban officials are far greater in scope than previous ones; for instance, the government has said that for the first time in decades Cubans will be allowed to hire workers who are not relatives.
But at this point, according to business owners and analysts, the government's intentions do not appear to have led to any clear spike in money sent to the island by relatives, or of goods that might help entrepreneurs get started.
The evolutionary plan, yet to be fully outlined, has instead raised as many questions as it answers. Where will businesses buy supplies? Will an influx of capital to some, but not others, foster new class and racial tensions, since Cuban-American wealth is largely concentrated among the white exiles here? What taxes will these new businesses pay, and how much profit will be allowed before the government steps in?
''Things move very slowly in Cuba because they are very, very concerned about breaking the balance of power with economic reforms,'' said Jorge Sanguinetty, president of the Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy, a research group. ''This is the reality. They don't want to emulate Gorbachev when he started making reforms in Russia and the whole thing came down.''
Mr. Sanguinetty, who served as a senior economic official with the Cuban government until he resigned in June 1966, said that Cuba might be just beginning the long, painstaking process of rebuilding the most basic economic relationships. He noted that Cuba even eliminated accounting schools in the first decade after the 1959 revolution because officials thought money would be unnecessary, and that many Cubans had no experience with credit cards, banks or checks. Now, he said, the government must move forward -- with import-export licenses, with clearer communication about rules -- if it hopes to make entrepreneurs a vital element of the economy.
Mr. Gomez said he wanted some legal reassurance that investments would not be lost to a government crackdown.
Serafin Blanco, owner of Nooo! Que Barato!, a huge discount store where recent arrivals stock up on $1.99 flip-flops and other items for relatives to resell in Cuba, said the American ban on tourist travel to the island would need to end before businesses could take off. ''That is when there will be enough money circulating to support these small stores,'' he said.
Other Cubans have told their relatives that they need to see neighbors succeed under the new system before they dive in.
Many people in Cuba are surviving already with their own underground capitalism, with government employees often working outside their actual jobs, as they try to supplement their state paychecks of about $20 a month.
Maria Garcia, a bank teller in Miami, said she bought her grandmother a blender in April to help her sell fruit shakes from her patio in Cuba. Ms. Garcia, who also sends her grandmother packets of artificial sweetener for the drinks, along with toys so they can be resold, said her family was in no hurry to leave the black market. ''We have to wait and see,'' she said.
She added that a friend of her mother's in Havana offered just one example of the challenge Cuba faced in experimenting with another limited dose of capitalism. The woman, named Olga, sews bras and underwear out of fabric sent to her from relatives in New Jersey. She got a government license several years ago after Cuba began to allow for more cuenta propistas, as self-employed business owners are called, but her sales to neighbors did not always cover the monthly cost of the license she needed to operate legally.
So Olga stopped getting the license -- but not making the bras.
All over Cuba, such experiences are common. At the peak of the licensing process in January 1996, there were about 209,000 licensed cuenta propistas, according to the World Bank. Now there are around 144,000 in a work force of 5.1 million.
Some experts and business owners with ties to Cuba -- like John Cabanas, owner of C & T Charters in Miami -- predict that this time private enterprise will grow without as much government interference.
Mr. Sanguinetty said Cubans should expect ''rigid flexibility,'' suggesting that the island would evolve even as internal elements resisted. He said that the construction industry would be one test of the government's commitment because it was primed for significant growth -- if leaders, bureaucrats and older Cubans all allowed for it.
Yet even as he imagined Cuba with a small finance industry again, providing loans to small businesses and the impetus for shiny new office towers in crumbling Havana, the minds of many Cubans are still stopping short of that. For now, those who travel back regularly are still seeing the future through the lens of past disappointment.
''It's just something to show the world that they're getting better,'' said Ernis Rodriguez, 36, just before heading back for a visit to the country he left seven years ago. ''But it's not true.''

HEADLINE: A Director's Many Battles to Make Her Movie

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Sonia Nassery Cole knew that shooting a movie on location in Afghanistan could get her killed. The most vivid reminder came a few weeks before filming, she said, when militants located her leading actress and cut off both of her feet.
But Ms. Cole, an Afghan expatriate with a flair for the dramatic and a history of not taking no for an answer, had her mind made up. Unable to find another actress to take the part -- the film is overtly critical of the Taliban -- Ms. Cole, 45, decided to play the role herself.
''Come hell, come shine, I was going to make this movie,'' said Ms. Cole, a novice filmmaker whose primary job is running the Afghanistan World Foundation, a charity focused on refugees and women's rights.
Ms. Cole, who holds both Afghan and American citizenship and lives in Los Angeles, has been a fixture in Afghan relief efforts since she wrote to President Ronald Reagan as a teenage refugee, and he unexpectedly invited her to the White House. She fled Afghanistan in 1979, although she is murky about the details, explaining that she plans to write a memoir. 
''The Black Tulip,'' a tragic love story that Ms. Cole finished at Warner Brothers, is scheduled for its premiere at the Ariana Cinema Theater in Kabul on Thursday. (Military leaders will get a private viewing on Wednesday at NATO's International Security Assistance Force headquarters.) The Sundance Film Festival is a likely next stop, and Afghanistan has submitted the picture as its entry for best foreign film at the next Academy Awards.
It is extraordinarily rare for a feature film to be shot on location in Afghanistan. Even films like ''The Kite Runner,'' the sweeping 2007 movie about two Afghan boys from different economic backgrounds, was mostly filmed in Kashgar, China, because Kabul was too dangerous and because it proved impossible to secure insurance coverage.
Afghanistan at one point had a bustling film industry, but the Taliban banned motion pictures and closed or destroyed theaters. Activity has returned -- Ms. Cole leaned heavily on a local casting director and the Afghan Film Organization, which is organizing the premiere -- but the current American-backed government has remained cautious. ''The Kite Runner,'' for instance, was not released in Afghanistan because of fears that it would inflame ethnic tensions.
Ms. Cole's only previous film experience was directing ''The Breadwinner,'' a 2007 short documentary about an 8-year-old Afghan boy who supports his family by selling calendars. To make ''The Black Tulip,'' she tapped her extensive network of government and philanthropic contacts, begun when President Reagan connected her with the Afghanistan Relief Committee.
For instance, the singer Natalie Cole, a celebrity ambassador for the Afghanistan World Foundation (but not related to Ms. Cole), recorded two songs for the film's soundtrack. Henry A. Kissinger is a friend from Ms. Cole's younger days spent in neoconservative social circles.
Even with the support, making ''The Black Tulip'' was anything but easy. Days on location sometimes began at 4 a.m. because security was easier to provide with fewer pedestrians around, she said. Before the film wrapped production last fall in Kabul, Ms. Cole survived a bomb blast that shattered the windows of her hotel, machine gun fire and grim telephone threats warning her to go home.
Three senior crew members -- her cinematographer, a producer and a set designer -- did just that, abandoning the movie in the middle of production , according to Ms. Cole.
''I know I broke her heart,'' said Keith Smith, the cinematographer who left. ''But I could feel death. I didn't sign up for that.''
Michael Carney, the set designer, says that he left four days before the end of the shoot, after working on the film in Afghanistan for two months.
Ms. Cole said she bore some of the responsibility for the defections, conceding that she painted a sanitized picture of life in a war zone while hiring a core crew in Los Angeles. But David McFarland, the cinematographer who replaced Mr. Smith, said he understood why she kept some details to herself.
''As the director of this film, she needed us to focus on our jobs and not be freaked out,'' Mr. McFarland said. ''What was she supposed to say? 'Oh, I got a note this morning saying we would all die on the set today. O.K., go focus on doing good work!' ''
Mr. McFarland said Ms. Cole did not tell him the reason she was also acting in the movie until after they finished filming. The woman who was to play the role, Zarifa Jahon, now lives with a relative in a remote area of the country, according to Ms. Cole, the local casting director and Latif Ahmadi, head of the Afghan Film Organization.
The only person aside from Ms. Cole who fully understood the danger of the project may have been her son, Chris. Before leaving last fall for Kabul, she gave him a list of instructions to follow if she ran into trouble.
''It said: 'If I am abducted, do not make a deal to get me released. Let them torture me. Let them kill me,' '' said Mr. Cole, who left a job in investment banking to help his mother produce the film. ''It was horrible to hear that from your mother. But she was insistent.''
''The Black Tulip,'' which has a primary cast of 11, takes place from 2001, just before the Taliban were routed from power, to the present day. A Kabul family seizes on a new window of freedom and opens a restaurant called The Poet's Corner, where artists and writers are encouraged to make use of an open mic. But the Mansouri family soon learns that the Taliban are not gone and pays a mighty price for daring to embrace culture again. Ms. Cole plays the passionate mother, Farishta Mansouri.
The tale is all too real: just this month an article by the McClatchy Newspapers correspondent Hashim Shukoor detailed how Taliban insurgents had been trying to reimpose their conservative views on music stores -- close, or we'll blow it up -- in the city of Jalalabad.
Ms. Cole would not disclose the film's budget, which she financed by selling personal property, mortgaging her home and relying on credit cards. But it wasn't cheap. Ms. Cole said at one point she had to pay $5,000 for an old microphone. The same seller then demanded an additional $5,000 from a crew member before handing it over. Mr. McFarland recalls driving hours around the city looking for a light bulb.
''I spent a small fortune on extortion and security,'' said Ms. Cole, who often listed fake locations on production schedules to minimize danger. ''Every couple of days, a random crew member would threaten to turn off the generator if I didn't pay him a large sum of money.''
''You start becoming paranoid very quickly,'' she added. ''Is that crew member you don't recognize there to help you or is he there to kill you?''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 24, 2010; September 27, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about an Afghan-American film director's efforts to shoot a feature film in Afghanistan reported that the director, Sonia Nassery Cole, said she took the leading role in her film after the actress she had cast had her feet cut off by militants. The local casting director and Latif Ahmadi, head of the Afghan Film Organization, corroborated Ms. Cole's account for the article. After the article appeared, questions were raised about the assertion, and in a followup article today on Page A10, Mr. Ahmadi contradicts his support of Ms. Cole's assertion, characterizing it as ''just propaganda for the film.''
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about an Afghan-American film director's efforts to shoot a feature film in Afghanistan omitted attribution for the statement that a producer and a set designer on the film had abandoned the director, Sonia Nassery Cole, in the middle of production. That was Ms. Cole's characterization. The article also omitted responses from the two, who were not named. Michael Carney, the set designer, now says that he left four days before the end of the shoot, after working on the film in Afghanistan for two months.

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief Set to Announce Sharp Rise in Aid for Health of Women and Children

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- Secretary General Ban Ki-moon plans to end a development summit meeting of world leaders on Wednesday by announcing a huge increase in aid to improve the health of women and children, but independent specialists said they were skeptical about the amount of actual new money committed, given the global economic crisis. 
Governments and private aid organizations committed to spending more than $40 billion toward that goal, Robert Orr, the assistant secretary general leading the effort, said Tuesday, and pledges were still flowing in.
The two lagging areas among the 15-year development goals that United Nations member states agreed to in 2000 are efforts to drastically cut the deaths of both young children and mothers in childbirth. The baseline to measure improvement is 1990.
Having money specifically directed at those two issues should help counteract ''the hard stuff that has been the most resistant to change,'' Mr. Orr said.
The eight Millennium Development Goals, or M.D.G.'s in the United Nations' alphabet soup, included cutting by two-thirds the number of children who die before age 5 and reducing maternal mortality by three-quarters by 2015.
Infant mortality has dropped to about 8.1 million annually from more than 12 million in 1990, while maternal mortality is down to about 350,000 from more than 500,000 -- improvements, but still short of the goals.
And the latest money committed will still not allow the world to meet the goals.
United Nations officials said they hoped that the bulk of the $40 billion would go to the poorest 49 countries, those least able to afford money from their own budgets. But those countries alone need a projected $88 billion over the next five years to meet the goals.
Mr. Ban's announcement is also expected to include an ambitious commitment by the poorest countries to add nearly $26 billion to their health budgets.
Aid groups remain skeptical that the traditional donors among Western nations will really increase their giving at a time when they are slashing budgets. In addition, experts say, any announced increases, like France and Norway pledging to increase by 20 percent previous commitments to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, still fall short of the need.
''It has to be more than announcing amounts at a summit, it is about going home and putting that money in national budgets,'' said Emma Seery, a development specialist at Oxfam International, a global antipoverty organization. ''I am not seeing where the money is coming from.''
The American ambassador, Susan E. Rice, said that no new American money would be committed beyond the $63 billion the United States set aside for global health aid through 2014, the bulk of it to combat AIDS.
At the development meeting on Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said that her country would not cut its aid budget, but she did not announce any increase.
''The primary responsibility for development lies with the governments of the developing countries,'' she said. ''Development aid cannot continue indefinitely.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Chief For Economics Is Set to Leave

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; John Harwood contributed reporting from Washington and Kate Zezima and Abby Goodnough from Boston.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The White House said Tuesday that Lawrence H. Summers, the chief architect of President Obama's economic policy, would leave at the end of the year, continuing an exodus of top-level advisers at a time when voters are expressing deep dissatisfaction with the president's stewardship of the economy.
The White House says the departure has been long-planned; Mr. Summers, 55, said in a brief interview that he must return to his professorship at Harvard by January to keep his tenure. His departure gives Mr. Obama a chance to reshape his economics team after the midterm elections, when Republicans are expected to gain strength and possibly reclaim the majority in Congress.
A brusque and brilliant economist and one-time Harvard president, Mr. Summers directs the president's National Economic Council, and runs Mr. Obama's daily Oval Office briefings on the economy. He has guided the president through an extraordinarily tumultuous time, on matters ranging from the $787 billion economic stimulus package to the financial regulatory reform bill passed this year, to the current fight with Republicans about whether to extend Bush-era tax cuts. 
''There's a time and a place for everything. It's been my plan long term,'' to return to Cambridge, Mass., Mr. Summers said. As to the administration's economic record, he said, ''I think history will judge that a profound crisis that might not have been contained was contained.''
But with unemployment at 9.6 percent, Republicans have been sharply critical of Mr. Summers. In a recent speech, the House Republican leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, called for both Mr. Summers and Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, to be fired. Tuesday's announcement came amid intense speculation about the future of both men; the White House confirmed Mr. Summers's plans after Bloomberg News first reported them.
A senior administration official said on Tuesday that Mr. Geithner expected to stay on. But other top economics advisers are already gone. Peter R. Orszag quit as budget director earlier this year, and just this month Christina D. Romer, the administration's chief economics forecaster, left to return to teaching at the University of California, Berkeley. And Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, is contemplating leaving to run for mayor of Chicago, adding to the expectation of a postelection shake-up.
''We are on a better path thanks in no small measure to Larry's wise counsel,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement on Tuesday. Just one day earlier, the president brushed off a question about the futures of both Mr. Summers and Mr. Geithner, saying he thought they both were doing an outstanding job.
''This is tough, the work that they do,'' Mr. Obama said then, during a televised question-and- answer session on CNBC. ''They've been at it for two years. And you know, they're going to have a whole range of decisions about family that'll factor into this as well.''
Republicans have been running for election on the theme that the midterm elections are a referendum on the economy, as Mr. Boehner told business leaders in Cleveland last month. He said Mr. Obama's team lacked ''real-world, hands on experience,'' a direct shot at Mr. Summers's career as an academic.
News of Mr. Summers's departure set off speculation that Mr. Obama would replace him with a corporate executive to counter the impression that he is antibusiness. His exit will undoubtedly expand the influence of Mr. Geithner and also of Austan Goolsbee, a longtime adviser to the president who was recently named to replace Ms. Romer. Jack Lew, the new budget director -- he held the same position under President Bill Clinton -- is also emerging as a powerful voice, especially as the president puts more emphasis on cutting the federal deficit.
Such changes are natural for an administration at the halfway point, especially in the current era, when working at the White House can be a taxing grind. Still, the rearranging will undoubtedly be watched closely for evidence of policy shifts or a so-called ''midcourse correction,'' especially if the election is as devastating for Democrats as many analysts expect.
''I wouldn't call it a shake-up,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser. ''I think the nature of administrations is that they evolve, and you'll see some people will stay and some new people will come in, and they'll have different styles and different approaches, and they'll bring different strengths.''
With his suffer-no-fools manner and sharp-edged management style, Mr. Summers has not always won friends; in 2005, as Harvard president, he caused an uproar with impolitic comments about women, and was eventually forced to resign as president after a vote of no-confidence by the faculty.
But he rehabilitated himself as valuable counselor to Democrats. After Mr. Obama was elected, he persuaded Mr. Summers -- who had served as Treasury secretary for Mr. Clinton -- to take the lower-profile job of running the National Economic Council, a job that some thought might be beneath him.
He greatly expanded the role by establishing the daily economics briefing, which he controlled and ran. Early on, he ruffled feathers, disagreeing with Mr. Geithner -- to whom he had been a mentor -- and Ms. Romer, although those differences seemed to abate over time. There was also widespread speculation that he wanted to be chairman of the Federal Reserve, a job he did not get when Mr. Obama reappointed Ben S. Bernanke.
''We prevailed on Larry to take a job that generally someone who has been secretary of the Treasury would not have taken, and we did it because it was an extraordinary time and we needed that expertise and that insight,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''But everyone knew that he couldn't stay indefinitely. He ended up staying longer than anybody expected.''
Mr. Summers told Mr. Obama at the end of last year that he wanted to leave, but the president asked him to stay on, and he agreed, said an administration official who asked for anonymity because the conversations were private.
Mr. Summers's wife remained in Cambridge -- they have school-age children and did not want to relocate -- and he had been commuting there on weekends, the official said.
At Harvard, where Mr. Summers holds the prestigious title of university professor, his colleagues predicted he would liven up the campus and said they would be happy to have him back -- so long as he did not take a management job.
''Larry is always a source of lively argument and ideas,'' said Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology who had been one of Mr. Summers's toughest critics, adding, ''The Summers presidency ended quite a long time ago, and everybody at Harvard has long since moved on.''

HEADLINE: Energy Access Seen as Vital To Abolishing Worst Poverty

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
More than $36 billion a year is needed to ensure that the world's population benefits from access to electricity and clean-burning cooking facilities by 2030, the International Energy Agency said Tuesday. 
In a report prepared for the United Nations Millennium Development Goals meeting in New York, the agency said the goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2015 would be possible only if an additional 395 million people obtained access to electricity and one billion gained access to more modern cooking facilities that minimize harmful smoke in the next few years.
''Without electricity, social and economic development is much more difficult,'' Fatih Birol, the energy agency's chief economist, said by telephone. ''Addressing sanitation, clean water, hunger -- these goals can't be met without providing access to energy.''
The problem of energy inequality mirrors the gap between rich and poor countries, Mr. Birol said. ''The amount of electricity consumed by sub-Saharan Africa, with 800 million people, is about the same as that used in New York State, with about 19 million people,'' he said.
The agency, which produced the report in conjunction with the United Nations Development Program and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, looked at both the lack of access to electricity and the reliance on and use of traditional biomass like wood as cooking fuel. In sub-Saharan Africa, the report notes, the electrification rate is 31 percent, and 80 percent of people rely on biomass for cooking.
About 1.4 billion people around the world lack electricity, and they are overwhelmingly in rural areas, the report said, while 2.7 billion rely on traditional biomass to cook. In addition to contributing to deforestation in poor nations, traditional cooking fuels degrade air quality, causing serious health problems and premature deaths, the energy agency report says.
Mr. Birol played down concerns that bringing more of the global population into the modern energy economy would be bad for the environment.
He predicted that meeting the development goal would raise global oil consumption just 1 percent, while raising carbon emissions only 0.8 percent.
Still, ''without a concerted international effort, it's unlikely that the problem will be solved, because markets alone won't address it,'' Mr. Birol said. Companies are reluctant to invest in many areas because the return is not guaranteed, he said, so seed money is needed from wealthier countries.
In Nigeria, a major oil exporter with a population of about 155 million people, 76 million do not have electricity, he said. ''If only 0.4 percent of their oil and gas revenues were invested in power production, they would solve the problem,'' he said, ''so it's not just a question of money, it's how the money is managed.''
Separately on Tuesday, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the United States would provide about $50 million in seed money over five years for a project known as the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. More than a dozen other partners, including governments, multilateral organizations and corporate sponsors, are to contribute an additional $10 million or more.

HEADLINE: Revising Our Immigration Rules for Foreign Workers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Foreign Stimulus'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 14):
Pia Orrenius and Madeline Zavodny are completely on the money with their call for a greater emphasis on work-based immigration to enhance our competitiveness in the world economy. It should be the national policy of the United States to forthrightly and unapologetically attract the best minds from all over the world and turn them into assets of the United States. 
How we do it -- through the proposed auction system, a reform of the existing skills-based system or some other method -- is less important than that we do it.
Matthew J. Maiona Chairman, New England Chapter American Immigration Lawyers Assn. Boston, Sept. 15, 2010
To the Editor:
Pia Orrenius and Madeline Zavodny correctly note that today's immigration laws are a crazy quilt of befuddling provisions that scarcely serve our national economic interests. Their stimulative cure, however, would harm the nation in the long term.
They propose to create what amounts to a latter-day slave auction that would deprive talented foreign workers of a long-term privilege of remaining in the United States or becoming citizens. Few worthy immigrants would be willing to enter the country with their families on a promise of portable work permission that could be yanked whenever the economy dipped.
Increasing the cost of entry through exorbitant user fees or auctions will dissuade American employers and talented foreign workers. It will only cause more jobs to be outsourced and more foreign workers to stay away.
We need to revamp our immigration system so that it encourages innovation, prudent risk-taking and job creation. Ivory tower solutions that fail to consider the motivations and alternative options of American employers and foreign citizens will not achieve these ends.
Angelo A. Paparelli Los Angeles, Sept. 15, 2010
The writer is the founder and past president of the Alliance of Business Immigration Lawyers.
