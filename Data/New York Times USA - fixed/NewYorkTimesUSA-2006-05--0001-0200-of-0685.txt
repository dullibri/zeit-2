HEADLINE: The Drought Derivative

 BODY:
The pictures of starving babies on CNN are both the savior and curse of international relief efforts. Those pictures bring in the money. But by then the famine is usually months old. 
 For food relief groups, the primary problem is raising enough money; the second problem is getting it on time. In March, the United Nations World Food Program announced a novel way to combat both problems: it has paid $930,000 for an insurance policy against drought in Ethiopia. If rainfall indicators at 26 sites drop below a certain level between March and October of this year -- a sign the harvest could fail -- the French insurer AXA Re will pay the agency up to $7.1 million, which it will distribute to 67,000 affected households.
 The policy, paid for almost entirely by the United States Agency for International Development, would help only a small fraction of affected farmers. But it is a first stab at what may become a wider solution to some of the most vexing problems in aid. 
 Hunger is becoming more widespread and persistent even as donors become less interested in financing food. At least 19 African nations right now have food crises. The number of the world's hungry, which fell in the 1990's, has been rising steadily since. But in 2004, the volume of food aid given to the World Food Program was half that of 1999. The agency continually runs a third short of what it needs. 
 Late aid is inefficient aid. It can't prevent drought -- by killing locust larvae before they hatch, for instance -- and it can't prevent families from having to eat next year's seeds. Later in a crisis people need more food and services to stay alive. 
 To have money at the ready, the United Nations has set up a central emergency relief fund. But donations have fallen far short of the need, leading to the dilemma of whether to spend all on early disasters and risk leaving nothing for later.
 If rich countries bought insurance premiums instead of food, they could budget predictable amounts in advance. It is currently expensive, but costs will fall as more countries and risks broaden the portfolio and disaster insurance becomes less of a novelty for insurers. If it can make timely food aid possible, however, harvest insurance may end up saving money and lives.

HEADLINE: Guidelines For Radio Tags Aim to Protect Buyer Privacy

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Some of the opponents in the debate over the potential privacy abuses of identification and tracking systems using tiny radio tags have come together to draft best-practices guidelines that are to be released today at a technology trade show in Las Vegas.
 Radio tagging technology, called RFID for radio frequency identification, is already widely used in wireless toll collection systems and to control access to buildings, track livestock and manage industrial assets. It is also rapidly spreading into libraries, hospitals and systems that track consumer goods through the retail supply chain. Radio tags, which are based on microchips, carry more information than bar codes, and large numbers of them can be scanned at the same time. 
Among other things, the guidelines say that consumers should be notified when goods have radio tags, which can be invisibly buried in labels, packaging or the goods themselves. The guidelines also say that it should be clear to consumers how to disable disposable forms of the tags and that it should be easy to do so once items with such tags have been purchased. Businesses are called on to notify consumers about how information gathered from the tags will be used.
 The guidelines were the work of a group of businesses and consumer advocates. Among the participants who are expected to endorse the guidelines are Procter & Gamble, I.B.M., Microsoft, Visa USA and the National Consumers League. 
 ''This is a really good start,'' said Susan Grant, vice president for public policy at the National Consumers League, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington. 
 However, some participants in the drafting are not endorsing the result, including the National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retailing trade group, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that was the most vocal privacy advocate.
 ''We are calling it an interim draft for a reason,'' said Paula J. Bruening, staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology, a policy organization in Washington that orchestrated the effort. ''There's a clear sense the guidelines will have to be reconsidered in the future.''
 A survey last year found that 7 percent of 89 retailers and 11 percent of 120 consumer products manufacturers had delayed or scaled back RFID investments because of privacy concerns, according to Christine Overby, who follows the technology for Forrester Research, a market research company based in Cambridge, Mass.
 The technology got a major boost two years ago when Wal-Mart endorsed a standard developed by an industry consortium and researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for tagging consumer goods, and said that it would begin requiring suppliers to tag cartons and pallets shipped to it. That standard, called E.P.C. (for electronic product code), is now administered by EPCglobal, which is based in Brussels. EPCglobal has issued its own privacy guidelines. 
 Maureen Riehl, a lawyer with the National Retail Federation, said that experience with the E.P.C. guidelines was one reason her group was not endorsing the broader guidelines to be released today. Legislators in New Hampshire are using the E.P.C. guidelines as a basis for a proposed law that retailers there say could be costly and unnecessarily alarming for consumers, she said. 
 Lee Tien, senior staff lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that the new guidelines were a valuable ''first step'' but that they gave industry too much ''wiggle room.'' 
 He also noted that the guidelines ignored government use of RFID and privacy concerns for employees in business-to-business dealings. Mr. Tien said that he had warned his fellow participants at the outset that it was highly unlikely his group would endorse the end result.

HEADLINE: Groups Opposing Wal-Mart Get Help From New Web Site

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Trying to stop a Wal-Mart from coming to town? Hit the print button. 
 Two groups, Wal-Mart Watch and Sprawl-Busters, have teamed up to create an online toolkit for community groups opposing the giant discount retailer. The site, called Battlemart, features everything a local activist needs: grants (to start a citizens' group), reports on the economic impact of a Wal-Mart (to be submitted to a local city council), the names of local traffic engineers (to testify at zoning hearings), and even advice on how to name a group (try ''[city name here] First.''). 
Battlemart, which will be formally introduced today, is intended to ''level the playing field'' for residents facing off against a company with 5,000 stores and $300 billion in annual sales, said Al Norman, the founder of Sprawl-Busters and the author of ''Slam-Dunking Wal-Mart,'' a guide to keeping giant national stores in check. ''It's a grab and go,'' Mr. Norman said. ''You download it and take it to your Sunday night citizens' group. They say, oh, we need a lawyer and a assessor, letters to the editor.''
 Battlemart even offers fund-raising tips for fledgling anti-Wal-Mart groups. ''Avoid very labor-intensive events like car washes and bake sales,'' it advises.
 Wal-Mart Watch -- which has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Service Employees International Union -- will be host of the Web site and offer start-up grants of $500 to $3,000. So far, it has financed 10 groups, including Gresham First in Gresham, Ore., and Great Falls First in Great Falls, Mont.
 Battlemart (www.walmartwatch.com/battlemart) reflects the degree to which the debate over Wal-Mart, once confined to living rooms and union halls, has now shifted to the Web.
 Mr. Norman, who has posted some of these suggestions on sites like WakeUpWalMart.com, said he would serve as a blogger on the Battlemart Web site, tracking local campaigns to block stores and responding to questions.
 A Wal-Mart spokeswoman could not be reached for comment yesterday.
 Asked if Battlemart would help a handful of residents block a store favored by the majority of local residents, Nu Wexler, a Wal-Mart Watch spokesman, said: ''We are not trying to create cookie-cutter site fights,'' as local zoning battles are called. ''This Web site is responding to demand, not creating it.'' MICHAEL BARBARO

HEADLINE: Duke's Struggling Cousin Rises From Its Shadow

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C., April 30 

 BODY:
North Carolina Central University does not have a lacrosse team. Students often cannot check out books from the main library, which is being renovated after a mold infestation. The business school is fighting to regain accreditation. Sixty percent of the students receive need-based financial aid. Eighty-one percent are black. Only 28 percent graduate after four years.
 Just three miles from Duke University and its master-planned marriage of Gothic elegance and academic excellence, North Carolina Central, a rambling red-brick, historically black institution, is across the tracks, across the highway, across an immeasurable cultural divide. Or so goes the armchair anthropology.
Yet North Carolina Central is also engaged in an ambitious push to enhance its academics and its campus, to remake its image and its mission. At least $121 million in state spending in the last six years has brought new law and science buildings and dormitories, and more projects are planned. 
 The university is aggressively recruiting top minority students -- sometimes competing for them against Duke -- and pursuing a niche in biotechnology, hoping to take advantage of its location here next to Research Triangle Park. Enrollment is up to about 8,200, compared with about 5,400 just five years ago. Aspirations have risen, too. 
 Now, with the universities uncomfortably linked by a North Carolina Central student's accusations that she was raped by members of Duke's lacrosse team, which had hired her as an exotic dancer for a party, some officials, alumni and students at North Carolina Central say perceptions that their school is a struggling academic afterthought in Durham may be the hardest thing to change. 
 They say that the storyline of race, class and cultural divide in the South that has framed the case may be compelling, but that it is simplistic. So while Duke is under intense national scrutiny, North Carolina Central is seeking a delicate balance of supporting the accuser, improving its relationship with Duke and continuing to raise its profile.
 ''America by and large doesn't know who we are,'' James H. Ammons, the chancellor of North Carolina Central, said in an interview. ''They see this incident, but they don't know that we're one of the fastest-growing institutions in the state, with an historic law school, the first public liberal arts college for African-Americans, at the center of a biotechnology initiative that's going to change the economy.''
 No one disputes the obvious contrasts between Duke and North Carolina Central. About 90 percent of North Carolina Central's students are in-state residents, compared with 13 percent at Duke. Tuition, room and board at North Carolina Central for one year is about $8,000 for in-state students, and $41,000 at Duke. North Carolina Central's endowment is about $22 million. Duke's is $3.8 billion.
 But people with links to both universities say that the relationship is enduring and complex, that both benefit from it and that both face challenges as the lacrosse case settles into what lawyers say could be a long court fight. 
 Two Duke players have been indicted on charges of first-degree forcible rape, first-degree sexual offense and kidnapping. The accuser, a 27-year-old mother of two, is among 200 or so students listed on a bulletin board in the student union at North Carolina Central as being eligible for a national honor society. 
 ''We are concerned and we are going to be as supportive as we can of the student in this incident, but we're also going to be as patient and respectful of the legal system, to let it work,'' Mr. Ammons said. ''At the same time, we can't be distracted so much that we lose focus on trying to continue to build the university and enhance its stature.''
 Founded in 1910 as the National Religious Training School and Chautauqua, a private school with a mission to prepare blacks for community leadership roles, the institution became the nation's first state-supported liberal arts college for blacks in 1925. Now it covers 135 acres on the south side of downtown Durham. 
 The university grew out of the thriving black community that developed as Durham prospered after the Civil War, largely from tobacco. In 1898, a group of black business leaders in Durham founded North Carolina Mutual, a life insurance company that has become one of the largest black-owned businesses in the country. 
 In 1907, Mechanics and Farmers Bank was founded by another group of blacks, one of whom, James E. Shepard, later founded what became North Carolina Central.
 Many older commercial buildings near North Carolina Central were demolished in the 1950's and 1960's to make way for roads and urban renewal projects. Many closer to the East Campus of Duke have been saved and now house intermittent blocks of coffee shops, restaurants, book and music stores that nurture an offbeat Southern sophistication. 
 ''We don't have a strip,'' said Medina Clark, a 21-year-old junior from Atlanta who is majoring in theater at North Carolina Central. ''We used to, back in the time.''
 Four decades after integration, some black families in Durham now have one generation that went to North Carolina Central and another that went to Duke. Some recall complicated emotions when they could finally choose between the two. Others recall racial tension.
 State Representative Mickey Michaux, a Democratic from Durham who is black, graduated from North Carolina Central's law school in 1964. White law professors from Duke and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the next city west, taught some of his classes.
 Mr. Michaux said that before the civil rights movement of the 1950's and 1960's, Duke, a private university, had ''sort of a plantation mentality.'' But after his younger brother, Eric, graduated from Duke's law school in 1966 and was later rejected by a state lawyer's association because of his race, Duke withdrew its involvement from the association in protest, both brothers recalled.
 ''They said if you can't take one of our graduates, then we don't have any use for you,'' recalled Mickey Michaux, now 75.
 Integration has also worked the other way. The state's governor, Michael F. Easley, a Democrat who is white, graduated from North Carolina Central's law school in 1975 and his wife, Mary, who is also white, taught law there for many years. 
 Richard H. Brodhead, the president of Duke, was asked in a telephone interview this week if the case involving the lacrosse team members would change the relationship between the two universities.
 ''Certainly,'' Mr. Brodhead said. ''The funny thing is, Chancellor Ammons and I have made ever so many public appearances together in these last few weeks, but when the lacrosse case is over, the residue will be that our schools will work more closely together in many areas.''
 Both leaders say they are focused on preparing students for a more technological world.
 ''Being in the Research Triangle, you have to be at the top of your game,'' said Mr. Ammons, who came to North Carolina Central in June 2001 from Florida A&M University in Tallahassee, where he was provost and vice president for academic affairs. ''They've been at it longer. They have a great reputation. But a rising tide lifts a lot of boats, and the region has such a reputation for education and innovation. We're in that environment, and we have to show that we can compete.''
 The challenge was evident on the North Carolina Central campus this week. 
 Danielle Gadson, a 19-year-old freshman from Winston-Salem who is majoring in marketing, said she was planning to transfer this summer to North Carolina A&T, another historically black state university, in Greensboro. Ms. Gadson said she was frustrated that the business school had lost its accreditation, though business school officials have said they hope to regain it as early as May.
 ''It's kind of behind,'' she said of North Carolina Central in general. Asked what she thought of Duke, she said, ''I haven't been over there.''

HEADLINE: Egypt Renews Emergency Detention Law

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Abeer Allam and Sahar Farag contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: CAIRO, April 30 

 BODY:
President Hosni Mubarak on Sunday pushed through Parliament a two-year extension of an emergency law, a measure that for almost 25 years has effectively allowed the Egyptian government to detain prisoners indefinitely and without charge. 
 In asking Parliament to approve the extension, Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif said the emergency law would eventually be replaced with a provision focusing exclusively on terrorism, as the president repeatedly promised during his campaign for re-election last year. But, Mr. Nazif said, devising a new law will take time, and Egypt can not afford to wait, with the emergency law set to expire at the end of May.
''We will never use the emergency law against the Egyptian people,'' he said to the crowded parliamentary chamber. ''We will use it only to protect the citizens and face the terror cells that did not quell until now.'' 
 But the extension was widely criticized by political opposition groups, human rights groups and citizens on the streets of Cairo, who said it demonstrated that the government was intent on protecting itself, not the people. 
 Officials had hinted days ago that they would push for renewal, and so could not credibly claim the decision was in response to three terrorist attacks in Sinai last week that left at least 18 people dead and many more seriously wounded.
 ''We are living in a country with no protection from the people who are supposed to secure us,'' said Dalia Sherif, 26, an unemployed college graduate, as she walked Sunday through the center of the city.
 The extension provided another signal that the government had stalled -- if not reversed -- the commitment it had made toward increasing freedoms. In recent days, Egypt, like other countries in the region, has backtracked on such promises as pressure from the United States has eased.
 Throughout his re-election campaign last year, Mr. Mubarak promised he would promote more political freedom, work to amend the Constitution to give more power to Parliament, help foster alternative political parties and replace the emergency law.
 ''There is a need for a firm and decisive law that eliminates terrorism and uproots its threats,'' he said in a speech last July. ''A law that protects national security and ensures stability. A law that provides a legislative substitute to combat terrorism and replaces the current emergency law.'' 
 Since his lopsided victory, with more than 88 percent of the votes cast, his government has used its security forces to beat and shoot voters trying to cast ballots in parliamentary elections for opposition candidates; sentenced an opposition political leader, Ayman Nour, to five years in prison; delayed local elections for two years; sought to punish judges who reported fraud at the polls during past elections; and denied requests to create new political parties. 
 As if to underscore the point, the authorities on Saturday arrested several dozen young men from opposition groups who had been posting signs that read ''No to the emergency law'' and ''Together against extension of the emergency law.''
 The emergency law was first passed in 1981 in response to the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat, and at its height was used to detain more than 30,000 prisoners indefinitely without charge. Mr. Mubarak has had the law renewed every three years since -- and human rights groups estimate that there are now approximately 15,000 prisoners who have not been charged in Egypt's jails. 
 The law expressly allows the authorities to hold individuals for up to six months without charging or trying them. But in practice, legal experts said, the government goes through the motions of technically releasing prisoners after six months and then rearresting them, without ever having actually let them go. In Parliament, Mr. Nazif's speech, and his offer of a two-year extension instead of the customary three years, was widely supported by the majority of legislators in Mr. Mubarak's governing National Democratic Party. The N.D.P. and its members have a monopoly on power in Egypt, so it was a foregone conclusion that the law would be adopted. It passed with a vote of 237 to 91.
 ''We understand that the emergency law does not completely destroy terrorism,'' Mr. Nazif said. ''But it allows the necessary security measures to combat terrorism.''
 The opposition has found its way in to Parliament -- and the largest bloc included 88 members of the Muslim Brotherhood who were elected as independents last year. They stood Sunday in the parliamentary chamber wearing black sashes that called for an end to the emergency law. 
 ''When I go out in the street, I feel that the stick that security uses to hit me on the head for expressing my opinion is only there because of the emergency law,'' said Essam el-Erian, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood, who was himself tried before a military judge for his work with the group, which is technically banned, though tolerated. ''The government lies and uses terrorism to justify extending the law, but terrorism increased and flourished under the emergency law.''

3 Suspects in Resort Attacks Killed
 EL-ARISH, Egypt, April 30 (Reuters) -- Egyptian police officers on Sunday shot dead three men suspected of belonging to a group of Sinai Bedouins who killed at least 18 people in the Red Sea resort of Dahab last week, police officials said. The police said they captured four suspects. 
 The police said a patrol came across two of the men, who threw grenades which did not explode. The police opened fire and killed them. 
 In a separate incident, the police killed a suspected member of the group in a gun battle in another area.

HEADLINE: With Calls for Boycott by Immigrants, Employers Gird for Unknown

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Gretchen Ruethling contributed reporting from Chicago for this article, and Fernanda Santos from New York.

 BODY:
Leading up to a new wave of immigration demonstrations around the country set for today, employers met with workers, posted letters on bulletin boards and in employee lunchrooms, and braced for the day ahead. 
 Some urged their employees to come to work today despite calls for a broad economic boycott as a show of immigrants' strength. Others announced that they would let workers out early to participate in events, or, unsure of just what today would bring, would close for the day.
In Las Vegas, operators of some of that city's biggest casinos urged their employees to come to work and to channel their concerns about immigration into carefully planned and approved alternatives -- signing petitions available at work or attending a rally after the first work shift. 
 In the country's midsection, the owners of Cargill Meat Solutions told some 15,000 workers that beef and pork plants in Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois and other states would close for the day, and, in the case of five of the seven Cargill facilities, open for business next Saturday instead.
 The wide range of plans set out by companies in recent days reflected a broader uncertainty about what would actually happen today in scores of cities and towns.
 Would large numbers of immigrants stay away from their jobs, from schools and from spending money for what some organizers are calling the Great American Boycott of 2006? Or would more simply attend demonstrations, prayer services and voter registration drives on International Workers Day, as other leaders, who do not support a boycott, have urged?
 ''A walkout really isn't the constructive way -- it's the opposite of what should be happening,'' said Alberto Lopez, a spokesman for Harrah's Entertainment, the casino company, where prominent banners and petitions calling for immigration reform (to be delivered, ultimately, to members of Congress) have been placed in employee dining halls. But, in the end, no one was certain what workers would choose to do. 
 Across the country, immigration advocates themselves have been divided over the notion of a sweeping boycott as a method of protest. 
 Supporters say it would reveal the size of the country's dependence on immigrant workers and remind Congress of the power behind their voices at a crucial time when leaders in Washington are arguing over whether to allow millions of illegal immigrants to become legal. Opponents, though, say a walkout might erode support for the central goals, and could cause immigrants to be disciplined at their jobs and at school. 
 Predictions for the day varied vastly from city to city. 
 In Los Angeles, the police prepared for hundreds of thousands of people to attend demonstrations, while smaller rallies were expected in other West Coast cities. Some advocates in Los Angeles have pressed for a full boycott, while other leaders there, including Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, the archbishop of Los Angeles, have urged a milder approach.
 Jesse Diaz, a rally organizer in Los Angeles, has called on people to avoid buying or selling products, and to skip work or school. He dismisses any division over the question as ''wishy-washy.''
 In an earlier march, Mr. Diaz said, the crowd went ''crazy'' when he announced plans for the boycott. ''You could just tell these folks were ready to boycott,'' he said.
 But in Chicago, where police predicted that the crowd for a rally and march could number into the hundreds of thousands, many demonstration organizers said they were not calling for a boycott. 
 ''We are trying to add on allies and make sure there's unity, not division,'' said Juan Salgado, president of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, one of the 250 or so groups involved in organizing.
 Instead, leaders in Chicago said their events would focus broadly on immigration reform, labor rights and civil rights, and would include groups -- people of Polish, Chinese and Irish descent -- beyond the Latino base that has overwhelmingly attended earlier demonstrations.
 Over the weekend, too, legal permanent residents were invited to a workshop at a Chicago church where they were advised on the paperwork, English proficiency exams, interviews and other steps needed for citizenship.
 In New York City, immigrant rights groups and others were calling on workers and employers to join in ''human chains'' in locations in all five boroughs at 12:16 p.m. The time, they said, reflects the date -- Dec. 16 -- that the House of Representatives passed a measure that would make it a felony for an immigrant to stay illegally in the United States. The measure galvanized anger among immigrants' advocates and spurred the first demonstrations. A late afternoon rally in Union Square in Manhattan is also scheduled.
 The human chain will hold for 15 or 20 minutes, some organizers said, then disband so that the workday may resume. 
 In Denver, Ricardo Martinez, an organizer of a planned march and rally there and a co-director of a group called Padres Unidos, said he and others were encouraging a boycott but were not telling students to leave school. He said that at least 200 businesses, including jewelry stores, grocery stores, landscaping businesses and a meatpacking plant, agreed to close for the day.
 Some employers who announced in advance that their companies would close today said this weekend that they had already begun to see unexpected fallout.
 Before an earlier set of demonstrations, Cargill Meat Solutions officials had urged its workers to write letters to Congress rather than missing work. Some workers went to the demonstrations anyway, said Mark Klein, a spokesman, and the company decided to close this time.
 ''It made it clear that there's a lot of emotion and passion about these issues,'' he said. ''We're trying to tell employees that we're in this together. We thought that this gesture would reinforce that.''
 Since the announcement, Cargill has received a flurry of e-mail messages and phone calls from people outside the company accusing it of employing illegal immigrants. 
 ''In the meat business, we're very aggressive in verifying employment eligibility,'' Mr. Klein said. ''They are misconstruing this decision as proof that Cargill makes a practice of hiring illegal workers, and that's not true.''

HEADLINE: Unity Through Autonomy in Iraq

BYLINE: By Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Leslie H. Gelb. 
Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, is the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Leslie H. Gelb is the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations.

 BODY:
A decade ago, Bosnia was torn apart by ethnic cleansing and facing its demise as a single country. After much hesitation, the United States stepped in decisively with the Dayton Accords,which kept the country whole by, paradoxically, dividing it into ethnic federations, even allowing Muslims, Croats and Serbs to retain separate armies. With the help of American and other forces, Bosnians have lived a decade in relative peace and are now slowly strengthening their common central government, including disbanding those separate armies last year.
 Now the Bush administration, despite its profound strategic misjudgments in Iraq, has a similar opportunity. To seize it, however, America must get beyond the present false choice between ''staying the course'' and ''bringing the troops home now'' and choose a third way that would wind down our military presence responsibly while preventing chaos and preserving our key security goals. 
The idea, as in Bosnia, is to maintain a united Iraq by decentralizing it, giving each ethno-religious group -- Kurd, Sunni Arab and Shiite Arab -- room to run its own affairs, while leaving the central government in charge of common interests. We could drive this in place with irresistible sweeteners for the Sunnis to join in, a plan designed by the military for withdrawing and redeploying American forces, and a regional nonaggression pact. 
 It is increasingly clear that President Bush does not have a strategy for victory in Iraq. Rather, he hopes to prevent defeat and pass the problem along to his successor. Meanwhile, the frustration of Americans is mounting so fast that Congress might end up mandating a rapid pullout, even at the risk of precipitating chaos and a civil war that becomes a regional war.
 As long as American troops are in Iraq in significant numbers, the insurgents can't win and we can't lose. But intercommunal violence has surpassed the insurgency as the main security threat. Militias rule swathes of Iraq and death squads kill dozens daily. Sectarian cleansing has recently forced tens of thousands from their homes. On top of this, President Bush did not request additional reconstruction assistance and is slashing funds for groups promoting democracy.
 Iraq's new government of national unity will not stop the deterioration. Iraqis have had three such governments in the last three years, each with Sunnis in key posts, without noticeable effect. The alternative path out of this terrible trap has five elements.
 The first is to establish three largely autonomous regions with a viable central government in Baghdad. The Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws, administration and internal security. The central government would control border defense, foreign affairs and oil revenues. Baghdad would become a federal zone, while densely populated areas of mixed populations would receive both multisectarian and international police protection.
 Decentralization is hardly as radical as it may seem: the Iraqi Constitution, in fact, already provides for a federal structure and a procedure for provinces to combine into regional governments.
 Besides, things are already heading toward partition: increasingly, each community supports federalism, if only as a last resort. The Sunnis, who until recently believed they would retake power in Iraq, are beginning to recognize that they won't and don't want to live in a Shiite-controlled, highly centralized state with laws enforced by sectarian militias. The Shiites know they can dominate the government, but they can't defeat a Sunni insurrection. The Kurds will not give up their 15-year-old autonomy.
 Some will say moving toward strong regionalism would ignite sectarian cleansing. But that's exactly what is going on already, in ever-bigger waves. Others will argue that it would lead to partition. But a breakup is already under way. As it was in Bosnia, a strong federal system is a viable means to prevent both perils in Iraq. 
 The second element would be to entice the Sunnis into joining the federal system with an offer they couldn't refuse. To begin with, running their own region should be far preferable to the alternatives: being dominated by Kurds and Shiites in a central government or being the main victims of a civil war. But they also have to be given money to make their oil-poor region viable. The Constitution must be amended to guarantee Sunni areas 20 percent (approximately their proportion of the population) of all revenues. 
 The third component would be to ensure the protection of the rights of women and ethno-religious minorities by increasing American aid to Iraq but tying it to respect for those rights. Such protections will be difficult, especially in the Shiite-controlled south, but Washington has to be clear that widespread violations will stop the cash flow.
 Fourth, the president must direct the military to design a plan for withdrawing and redeploying our troops from Iraq by 2008 (while providing for a small but effective residual force to combat terrorists and keep the neighbors honest). We must avoid a precipitous withdrawal that would lead to a national meltdown , but we also can't have a substantial long-term American military presence. That would do terrible damage to our armed forces, break American and Iraqi public support for the mission and leave Iraqis without any incentive to shape up. 
 Fifth, under an international or United Nations umbrella, we should convene a regional conference to pledge respect for Iraq's borders and its federal system. For all that Iraq's neighbors might gain by picking at its pieces, each faces the greater danger of a regional war. A ''contact group'' of major powers would be set up to lean on neighbors to comply with the deal. 
 Mr. Bush has spent three years in a futile effort to establish a strong central government in Baghdad, leaving us without a real political settlement, with a deteriorating security situation -- and with nothing but the most difficult policy choices. The five-point alternative plan offers a plausible path to that core political settlement among Iraqis, along with the economic, military and diplomatic levers to make the political solution work. It is also a plausible way for Democrats and Republicans alike to protect our basic security interests and honor our country's sacrifices.

HEADLINE: China's Leader Signs Oil Deals With Africans 

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 30 

 BODY:
President Hu Jintao returned to Beijing on Sunday after a diplomatic tour that began awkwardly in the United States but ended with a swing through Africa that brought China several trade and energy deals. 
 Mr. Hu ended his five-nation tour in Kenya, where he signed an agreement on Saturday for licenses that would allow the state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation to explore for oil off the coast of Kenya. Earlier in the week, Mr. Hu signed a deal that bought the Chinese energy company a substantial share of a major oil field in Nigeria.
 Mr. Hu's trip, particularly the oil deals, was highlighted in the state-controlled Chinese media, underscoring the enormous emphasis the government places on securing energy supplies to support the country's rapidly growing economy. 
 Mr. Hu, usually a colorless and aloof figure, seemed to be mounting something of a charm offensive in Africa. On Friday, China's state-run English-language newspaper, China Daily, featured a large front-page photograph of Mr. Hu smiling and warmly embracing President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria. 
 At the airport in Nairobi, Kenya, Mr. Hu left the red carpet and gave an impromptu performance on a traditional drum used by a musician in the welcoming ceremony, according to news agency accounts.
 But Mr. Hu's turn through Africa was also a reminder that China has not hesitated to do business with governments frowned on by the United States and other nations. China has invested heavily in Sudan at a time that its government is accused of instigating the crisis in Darfur. 
 In Nigeria, meanwhile, China could face problems with the militant group Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, which has shut down nearly 20 percent of the country's oil output in a dispute with the government over oil revenues. The group has already warned China not to drill in the region.
 Unlike the United States, which often demands human rights improvements in exchange for trade deals, China takes the opposite approach. Mr. Hu told reporters in Africa that China pursued ''the principle of noninterference in others' internal affairs.''

HEADLINE: In Search of $1 Billion in Revenue

BYLINE: By SUSAN MORAN

 BODY:
BOOKSTORE shelves are crowded with how-to books for business leaders striving toward excellence. David G. Thomson's recently published book, ''Blueprint to a Billion: Seven Essentials to Achieve Exponential Growth,'' takes a different approach. Mr. Thomson evaluates patterns shared by what he calls ''blueprint companies'' -- the 387 businesses that have gone public since 1980 and have reached $1 billion in revenue. 
 These star businesses represent just 5 percent of the companies that have gone public in that time frame, yet they accounted for more than half of their employment and two-thirds of their market value in 2005. Many of them are household names: Microsoft, Starbucks, Google, Nike, Genentech and Staples. Mr. Thomson notes that of the 4,000 publicly traded companies with $30 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, only 30 become billion-dollar businesses each year. ''We must improve our hit rate,'' he said. ''If we could make that 60, we'd be a different nation.'' 
The seeds for Mr. Thomson's research were planted during his own corporate career. He was general manager for residential services at Nortel Networks, where he helped create caller-ID software; an associate principal at the management consultant firm McKinsey & Company; and most recently worked in corporate accounts at the Hewlett-Packard Company. 
 The blueprint companies he writes about in his book drive America's innovation and growth in the increasingly global economy. To Mr. Thomson's own surprise, a disproportionate number of them exist in the consumer retail sector, not in information technology. 
 Whether your business is a start-up scrambling for seed financing or a well-heeled one with more than $25 million in revenue, Mr. Thomson's research shows that you need to pursue seven essentials: create and sustain a breakthrough value proposition; exploit a high-growth market segment; secure ''marquee'' customers early; build alliances with larger companies that help you break into new markets; master the equation of exponential returns (fast and sustained revenue growth, and high return on invested capital); build an ''inside-outside'' management team; and include customers and other outside experts on your board.
 In a recent interview from his home in Overland Park, Kan., Mr. Thomson spoke about his book and his research:

Q. Your research shows that only 18 percent of the blueprint companies are in the information technology sector. The largest group was the consumer sector, which represented 26 percent of the blueprint companies. What does this say about our economy?

A. You're 50 percent more likely to be successful in the consumer sector than you are in tech. If you look at the number of companies that have grown to a billion dollars, we truly are a service economy. We may not look to Starbucks as an innovator like Google, but in fact we innovate to a greater degree in services.

Q. What does this suggest about the information technology sector and the United States as a competitor in the global economy?

A. First, in order to restore America's leadership, tech needs to be as proportionately represented as it has been in the past 25 years, and more. Second, technology, especially info tech, builds infrastructure for other industries such as managed health care. Info-tech companies are still America's innovation engines when it comes to returns to shareholders. Take Cisco Systems. Over 90 percent of the company's value doesn't come from the industry it's in.

Q. Must companies achieve all seven essentials or can they get to the billion-dollar target on just two or three? Which are the most critical?

A. It depends on your situation. The car engine is a good analogy. To make an engine run smoothly and with maximum power, a spark is required in every cylinder.
 Having said that, there are three core essentials to the ecosystem. First, you must have a breakthrough value proposition. Then you must attract marquee customers who use your product or service in a big way, help define the benefits in customer terms and finally sell for you. They are so committed to your success that they proactively call their friends. This reduces your sales cycle time and sales costs by at least half. 
 Finally, marquee customers who have a significant unmet need help your company create exponential returns. This entails generating higher margins followed by not overinvesting in order to grow results and become cash-flow positive early. Scaling a cash-flow positive model is the success pattern exhibited by blueprint companies -- exactly the opposite of what was the norm during the 2000 bubble.

Q. Your sixth essential, creating an ''inside-outside'' management team -- one inward-looking executive to run the day-to-day business, the other to focus on building markets, partners and customers -- resonates with many start-up entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Why is this duo leadership formula so critical for success? And when is it critical to bring in the second core leader?

A. You may think the founder should step aside for a seasoned management team. Founders played a critical role among blueprint companies, but it wasn't the C.E.O.-founder who did it all. The founders need to transition to the inside-outside leadership pair to execute all seven essentials simultaneously. Let's look at Microsoft, the most valuable blueprint company. Before the Bill Gates-Steve Ballmer duo of the 1990's, the company reached an inflection point in 1983. It outgrew its small-time style faster than Gates could handle it. Gates tried to take charge of five product lines, but he couldn't pay enough attention to customers' needs.
 At $50 million in revenues, he hired Jon Shirley, a 25-year career veteran at the Tandy Corporation [now the RadioShack Corporation], to serve as Mr. Inside while Bill Gates focused on the outside role. It is this leadership duo that propelled Microsoft to $1 billion in revenue. Current examples include eBay, with Maynard Webb on the inside and Meg Whitman looking outward; and Tractor Supply, with Jim Wright and Joe Scarlett as the inside-outside pair. 

Q. Why is it so critical to achieve exponential revenue growth to the billion-dollar mark?

A. The exponential growth pattern is the only one that can get you to become a billion-dollar company in any reasonable time. If you're talking about linear or erratic or low growth, then you're not going to be thinking of the seven essentials in the same way. The only way you can reach the billion mark is with a compounded annual growth rate.
 A billion dollars gets you to be a global competitor. And billion-dollar companies disproportionately employ over half the employment in and generate two-thirds of the market value of all American I.P.O. companies in the last 25 years. You want to work for and do business with these companies.

Q. Where should the inflection point be for companies expecting to reach the billion-dollar mark?

A. On average it's around $50 million in revenue. We found this number by backward-engineering financial results. At some point, say between $30 million and $100 million, you hit this really high growth rate, and then as you scale you naturally slow down. As an analogy, you need escape velocity to get into orbit. You need an escape growth rate to get onto the billion-dollar growth trajectory. If you don't hit that high growth rate early on, if you're just doing 20 percent a year, you don't get to a billion in a reasonable time.

HEADLINE: Love Your Classic Car? They'll Insure It for You

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. 

 BODY:
UNTIL a white 1960 Cadillac Eldorado convertible appeared last February in the window of a new $6 million service center in town, not many people here paid attention to Hagerty Insurance.
 They do now.
The handsome brick-and-glass building and eye-catching $85,000 car reflect the rising prominence of this family-owned company, which employs 325 people in Traverse City and is commanding a place at the head of this country's multibillion-dollar collector car industry.
 Hagerty's primary business is insuring valuable cars that are at least 25 years old. The company also insures vintage military transports, motorcycles, hot rods, wooden boats and other specialty vehicles. But it is the classics, the showy muscle cars that adorned high school parking lots in the 1960's and 70's, that stoke the enterprise.
 The company's second-generation principals, Kim Hagerty, 49, and her brother McKeel Hagerty, 38, say they insure 400,000 of the four million collector cars in the United States, which makes Hagerty the nation's largest insurer in one of the industry's most profitable segments. Though neither sibling would disclose the company's revenue, their competitors estimate that Hagerty's sales are about $100 million annually. 
 The Hagertys are ambitious, and their business plan reflects a desire to get bigger. The company now finances collector car purchases up to $1 million. It also gives policy holders the option to buy 24-hour roadside assistance. Every collector vehicle now sold on eBay, the country's largest collector car market, comes with a free 30-day roadside assistance package from Hagerty. 
 Two factors lie at the core of Hagerty's performance. The first is the potent blend of demographic, gender and economic trends that are fueling the popularity of collector cars. Millions of male baby boomers with money, time and investment skills have transformed a onetime garage hobby into a chic addition to their portfolios. A 1960 Chevrolet Impala convertible in superb condition is valued at $35,000. A 1968 Shelby Mustang GT500 convertible can fetch $275,000. 
 ''It's amazing how much people are putting into it,'' said David Goodman, vice president of InPro, an insurance agency in Troy, Mich., that sells Hagerty Insurance. ''There are a lot of girls out there who would love to have that kind of attention and money thrown at them.'' 
 While there are no formal statistics available on how large the collector car industry is, it is growing quickly. The business of supplying parts is said to be $2 billion annually, according to trade journals. Half of the nation's 6,000 auto-body shops do some work in restoring old cars, experts say. In January, the Barrett-Jackson collector car auction in Scottsdale, Ariz., sold 1,000 cars for $100 million. Prices are rising 10 percent to 15 percent annually, car experts say.
 The second factor elevating the fortunes of Hagerty Insurance and its competitors is the collector car insurance segment's exceptional ''loss ratio.'' Most classic car owners coddle their vehicles and rarely drive them. Accidents are uncommon. The low payout versus the premiums coming in gives Hagerty a higher rate of return than other areas of the insurance industry.
 It took some time for the family to recognize the full promise of insuring collector cars. The company's roots go back to 1956, when Frank and Louise Hagerty opened a storefront general insurance agency in Traverse City, then sold the business in 1979 because the economy was weak and Frank was seeking new opportunities. Serendipity followed. When each of Frank Hagerty's three children -- his middle daughter, Tammy, 46, is not involved in the company's management -- got their drivers' licenses, he encouraged them to buy old cars and restore them. His son, McKeel, still owns the 1967 black Porsche 911S that he and his father pulled out of a snowbank 23 years ago. 
 Frank Hagerty owns and dotes on six vintage mahogany speedboats that no company would insure. ''They're seen in the industry as dried-up pieces of wood filled with gasoline,'' McKeel Hagerty said. 
 In 1983, Frank and Louise started up Hagerty Insurance again. After measuring the extent of the vintage wooden boat population in the United States (about 40,000), and negotiating with insurance underwriters, the couple introduced a full-protection policy at a reasonable rate. In a few years, the company was selling insurance to half the vintage wooden boat owners in the nation. 
 Many boat owners also collected old cars and often asked the Hagertys for guidance in securing policies at much lower cost than those carried by conventional insurers. Collector car policies, they felt, were expensive and inadequate. Insurers assumed that, like ordinary cars, the value of collector vehicles steadily declined. In an accident, owners were paid far less than the value of the loss. 
 The Hagertys were interested enough to focus on that part of the business, which grew so fast it inspired Kim to leave a successful law practice and McKeel to cut short graduate studies in philosophy. Both returned to Traverse City to take over the company in 1995. Though the young Hagertys had vowed earlier on never to make a career in insurance, their familiarity with the industry, experience in writing policies for old boats and knowledge of old cars proved to be the right fit. 
 The siblings knew that, like the owners of old speed boats, collector car enthusiasts babied their vehicles. The company designed a low-cost policy for owners who have good driving records and occasionally put their vehicles on the road. Full coverage under a Hagerty policy is surprisingly inexpensive: $150 a year for a $25,000 vehicle; $650 a year for a $100,000 vehicle.
 Hagerty's other important innovation is that it pays policy holders the ''agreed value'' of the vehicle if there is a claim. This means the company understands that collector cars increase in value and that Hagerty Insurance agrees to compensate its policy holders for the full value of the loss. 
 The company advertised in collector car magazines, at auctions and industry gatherings, and waited for the toll-free phone calls to flood the sales office. ''At that time the world was still not accustomed to buying insurance over the phone,'' McKeel Hagerty said. ''People just didn't feel comfortable buying insurance out of a magazine from someone they don't know.''
 The calls came and policies were sold. And the Hagertys, who have made it a priority to adopt the most up-to-date technology, were well positioned to take advantage of the Internet as a sales tool when interest and prices of collector cars began to soar in 2000. Another marketing innovation that the Hagertys embraced was a series of offbeat advertisements in collector car magazines and on television. ''We always want to make it fun,'' McKeel Hagerty said, ''seriously.''

HEADLINE: Where Comfort Food Is the Plat du Jour 

BYLINE: By PABLEAUX JOHNSON

DATELINE: New Orleans 

 BODY:
TWO months after Hurricane Katrina ripped through this city, Aaron Wolfson and Peter Menge rolled out a three-prong marketing plan for their new business: a 3,500-person e-mail list, an oversize propane burner and a hand-lettered butcher-paper sign reading ''FAT CRABS.''
 Although not conceived as a restaurant, their business, the Savvy Gourmet, quickly became known after the storm as a place where locals gathered to participate in the city's favorite pastime -- talking about food.
The partners in the operation, Dr. Wolfson and Mr. Menge, both 35, tended customers while a fisherman tended a large boiling pot. Clouds of spicy, fragrant steam drifted on Magazine Street and through the repopulated Uptown neighborhood, luring customers to buy the crabs. 
 ''We sent out e-mails to our list saying that we'd be boiling crabs, but people would smell it and just pull over,'' Mr. Menge said. ''People didn't know what to make of it. It was a snippet of normalcy, at least for here.''
 In a city known for its culinary traditions, food has played an integral role in New Orleans's recovery. And as the small businesses return to operation, the keys to success seem to be agility, flexibility and the ability to bring people to the table. In the city's current business climate, a cooking school has been transformed into a lunch destination, and a wine shop has become an al fresco nightclub, as the need to congregate over food and drink remains strong. 
 The Savvy Gourmet was the brainchild of Dr. Wolfson, a local psychologist. After three years of operating the Savvy Gourmet as a cooking school with no fixed location, Dr. Wolfson and Mr. Menge found a building to renovate in 2004. The space, a former carpet-cleaning warehouse, would contain the expanded business's three components: a sales floor for cookware, commercial kitchen for catering and an open classroom area with a demonstration kitchen. 
 The partners were days from the opening when New Orleans's levees collapsed. Weeks later, they were surprised to discover that the building suffered little structural damage, and after a thorough cleanup could be open for business. 
 But the pair realized that the Savvy Gourmet as originally planned wasn't practical after the storm, and responded instead to the immediate needs of the returning community. ''Who needs expensive pots when the city's under water?'' Dr. Wolfson said. ''But why don't we serve lunch?''
 With the help of a chef, Corbin Evans, Mr. Menge and Dr. Wolfson converted the classroom to a 60-seat dining room with borrowed chairs and tables. 
 ''We'd ask the local farmers and producers, 'What do you have?' '' Dr. Wolfson said. ''And that became the day's menu.''
 Making a quick transition from sidewalk seafood boils to midday dining, the Savvy Gourmet's improvised restaurant became a bustling Uptown destination and a post-storm institution. The two kitchens pumped out weekday lunches for construction crews, office workers and laptop-bound diners checking e-mail messages or the status of insurance claims. Soon the Savvy Gourmet added a brunch service and reinstituted cooking classes. With a staff of 14, it has blossomed into a culinary community center and home to New Orleans's ''slow food'' chapter, while meeting its original economic projections set before the hurricane.
 CLOSER to downtown, Jennifer Powell was caulking ceiling joints as Katrina churned in the Gulf of Mexico. She was putting the finishing touches on her new business, Sip Wine Shop, as evacuation orders were issued for the city. 
 Ms. Powell, 34, and her business partner, Mary Youngblood, 62, had been renovating the small Magazine Street storefront in the Garden District since March. Weeks from the shop's opening and still awaiting final licensing, the pair left their business in limbo as they evacuated. 
 Spared by geography and located in an exceptionally active commercial zone, Sip seemed workable even during the recovery. The store is aimed at a nontraditional audience: younger drinkers age 25 to 30 who are often put off by the pretensions surrounding wine. Sip stocks 250 kinds, averaging $15 a bottle, and arranges them by dominant flavor (smoky, floral, earthy, herbal) instead of by variety or vineyard. Accessible and informal, the business seemed suited to the recovering city. The biggest obstacles proved to be bureaucratic. 
 Widespread layoffs in the municipal work force had left the licensing offices in disarray. ''All the people we'd been dealing with, the people who knew our history and our case the best, they were gone,'' Ms. Youngblood said. ''It was a month of hair-pulling and determination.'' 
 Almost immediately after opening in late October, Sip drew a dedicated following. Daytime customers could buy a bottle with dinner or uncork their purchase at a sidewalk table. Before long, Sip's storefront became an oasis of cafe life, fueled by survivor stories and returnees' need for contact. 
 The daily gatherings start slowly, as afternoon workers switch from coffee to wine ahead of the happy-hour crowd. 
 ''We didn't expect it to be such a social space, but we're very proud of that,'' Ms. Powell said. 
 IN the French Quarter, chaos presented an opportunity for yet another culinary business. 
 When Philipe LaMancusa returned to his home there after taking refuge in San Francisco, he found that rents had skyrocketed on less damaged buildings, and that some landlords were demanding full rent on properties with collapsed ceilings and no basic utilities. 
 A lifelong waiter, line cook and pastry chef, Mr. LaMancusa, 62, saw the chance to reopen an earlier sideline, Kitchen Witch Cookbooks. 
 The small used-bookstore had grown out of Mr. LaMancusa's love of cookery and collection of 5,000 cookbooks. In an earlier incarnation, in a Rampart Street storefront, Mr. LaMancusa had run the shop during the day and worked restaurant jobs at night. In 2003, the Kitchen Witch went into hiatus. 
 After the storm, however, conditions were right to reopen. 
 ''It was all word of mouth,'' he said. ''I listened to the whisper of the street. And sure enough, I found the perfect place.''
 It is located within blocks of two of the most recognizable tourist spots, the St. Louis Cathedral and Bourbon Street. The previous tenant, selling used records and CD's, had vacated the premises, leaving wooden crates that became bookshelves. The rent was reasonable, the lease terms fair. 
 Mr. LaMancusa and his partner, Debbie Lindsey, 52, have revived the Kitchen Witch, holding down night shifts at restaurants.
 ''We had eight hours to make a decision on a 10-year commitment,'' Mr. LaMancusa said. ''It was like being given a stake in rebuilding the city. It's like a pearl without price.
 ''Eighty percent of the city was flooded, which means 80 percent of the cookbooks have to be replaced, because the kitchen's always on the first floor.'' 
 In New Orleans, people take their food personally. ''People are trying to replace their food memories,'' Mr. LaMancusa said. ''They come in and thumb through books to see if that one important recipe is there.'' 
 For now, sales are brisk enough to meet the break-even point. 
 ''We're not quitting our night jobs just yet,'' Mr. LaMancusa said, laughing. ''But the store's taking care of itself.''

HEADLINE: Should You or Shouldn't You (Outsource)?

BYLINE: By FRAN HAWTHORNE

 BODY:
SMALL-BUSINESS owners know they cannot do everything. Their first priority has to be the product line. Nevertheless, all the ancillary functions that are part of running a company -- order-taking and shipping, payroll, employee benefits, customer service, Web site maintenance, publicity -- must get done somehow. 
 For many businesses, the answer is to farm out the work to specialized contractors, whether payroll-services companies or Web designers. Yet outsourcing that work can bring its own set of problems. It means giving away control to a third party who may not do things the way a business owner wants. If the vendor has bigger clients, a small business may be sent to the back burner. And outsourcing doesn't necessarily save money. 
There are few guidelines to help a business know when it pays to outsource and when it does not. ''The bottom line is what you need to look at,'' said Joyce Moy, director of the Small Business Development Center at LaGuardia Community College in Queens. ''But you must look at the bottom line in terms of reputation and efficiency as well. There are situations where you will want to hold on to what you're doing.''
 The tasks most ripe for outsourcing are tax preparation and managing the payroll and employee benefits like retirement plans and health insurance. These are complex jobs that require arcane knowledge and an ability to keep up with constantly changing laws. Moreover, the financial risks involved are high. A small company that tries to self-insure rather than take out an insurance policy could be devastated by a single health insurance claim from an employee with cancer. 
 Beyond these areas, however, there is less agreement. Edward Rogoff, an assistant professor of management and the academic director for the Field Center for Entrepreneurship and Small Business at Baruch College in Manhattan, suggested that ''things related to interface with customers are best handled in house -- you don't want to lose control of that relationship.'' In that category, he puts taking orders and handling service requests. 
 But Al Titone, director of the Small Business Development Center at York College in Queens, warns that in an expensive city like New York, it may not be worth paying rent on the warehouse space that is required for filling orders.
 What other areas? Building maintenance and advertising, says Bruce Phillips, a senior economist at the National Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation. Yet, a contrary view comes from Marsha Firestone, president and founder of the Women Presidents' Organization, a national association of 1,000 women who are entrepreneurs. She says publicity is best handled by staff members, if possible, because ''the P.R. person internally usually has the story down pat.'' 
 Hiring a middleman inevitably means an extra layer of expense. A. Steve Arizpe, executive vice president of Administaff, a Houston-based business that provides a range of human-resources services, says the company's 5,000 clients typically pay 2 to 3 percent above what it might cost to do the work in house. Academic experts like Mr. Rogoff and Mr. Titone put the markup even higher, at 5 to 20 percent. (Highly competitive fields like payroll services tend to be at the lower end of that range, Mr. Titone said.) 
 Of course, doing the work internally has its own costs. ''For a small-business owner, doing payroll is time,'' Mr. Titone said. ''If you're spending four hours a day on payroll, that's four hours you could be spending building your business.''
 But even if you contract for a service, you still have to invest your time. The only way to be sure of getting quality work is to train vendors intensively and monitor their performance. Even then, a business owner may not receive full attention. After all, a vendor has plenty of other clients, many of them probably bigger. ''If you need a report tomorrow morning, are you that important to a back-office outfit?'' Ms. Moy of LaGuardia asked. 
 It comes down to a trade-off. ''If you outsource to a large company, they obviously have the capability to do the work,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''However, you're not very important to them. If you go to a vendor that is smaller, you have more leverage, but their capabilities may be less.
 ''A good rule of thumb is to start with outsourcing most functions, to keep your fixed costs as low as possible until you're confident you're not going to run out of cash,'' Mr. Rogoff said. Only when a company is big enough to be sure an in-house employee will have enough work should it consider tackling such tasks, he said. When does that magic moment occur? Maybe at 20 to 25 employees, said Mr. Phillips of the National Federation of Independent Business. 
 Mr. Titone of York College warns, however, that a company can be too small to try outsourcing. If there are fewer than seven employees, he said, ''payroll is so little work that you can do it yourself.'' 
 For some entrepreneurs, outsourcing itself is a business opportunity. The LVM Group, a seven-person public-relations firm in Manhattan, farms out its accounting, computer services, legal and human resources work. But its own bread-and-butter -- $1.65 million in annual revenue -- comes from being the hired P.R. gun for about 60 companies, half of them small businesses. 
 ''You're not working in a vacuum,'' said Jeannette Boccini, one of the firm's owners. ''You're working in partnership with the client.''

HEADLINE: Walkout Is Planned to Show Solidarity With Immigrants

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
From behind a vending cart in Jackson Heights, Queens, Mohammad Ali, 58, minced some betel palm tree leaves and nuts in a plastic bowl -- mouth freshener made to order for the man in a burgundy tunic who sells Islamic books from a nearby stand.
 ''Busy, busy, every day, but 15 minutes Monday, no work,'' Mr. Ali said yesterday, using the few English words he has managed to master since arriving in New York five years ago from Hyderabad, a city in India. 
He then unfolded a bright orange flier and offered it to this reporter, by way of explanation. ''Form a human chain in an expression of solidarity for immigrant rights,'' the flier read. ''Join the nation in highlighting the many ways in which immigrant workers and businesses contribute to our economy.''
 At 12:16 p.m. today, immigrants and their supporters are set to take a short break from work and stand side by side along busy commercial strips citywide to make their presence known. Later in the day, at 4:30 p.m., immigrants and advocates are to rally in Union Square.
 The specific moment of the lunchtime demonstration is meant to represent the date -- Dec. 16 -- that the House of Representatives passed a bill that would make it a felony to be in the country illegally, organizers said. In early April, a version of the bill stalled in the Senate. 
 Similar demonstrations are planned for the same time in the city's other boroughs: along East Broadway, Canal Street and St. Nicholas Avenue in Manhattan; on Fifth Avenue between 40th and 60th Streets and along Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn; and at East Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. It was unclear yesterday where the Staten Island demonstration would take place. In Jackson Heights, protesters will gather at 37th Avenue and 74th Street, just outside Pizza Boy, where Nick Lombardo, 53, has worked for the past 30 years, long before he became a United States citizen in 1998.
 ''These immigrants came here, I came here, my mother and father came here for a better future,'' said Mr. Lombardo, who was a teenager when he left Sicily to move to New York. ''Everybody around here is from some place else. America is a country of immigrants, so it's important that we all participate, whether we're legal or not.''
 Word of the demonstration spread quickly throughout Jackson Heights, where the language options at automated-teller machines -- English, Spanish, Korean and Hindi -- mirror the diversity of the neighborhood. There were mentions in the pages of ethnic newspapers and on Spanish-language television broadcasts. 
 Mr. Lombardo, a manager at Pizza Boy, said he got his flier on Thursday, as did many of the business owners and workers in a four-block section of 37th Avenue, between 72nd and 76th Streets -- a stretch known as Little India for its South Asian flair. He has since ordered the two Mexican brothers who bake and deliver the pizzas for his restaurant to join the demonstration. 
 Mr. Ali plans to be there as well, along with Adrian Cardenas, 37, a hairdresser at Ingrid's Full Service Salon nearby. 
 ''We must be united to affirm our strength,'' Mr. Cardenas, who hails from the Colombian coffee-growing city of Armenia. ''It doesn't matter where we're from.''
 Two-thirds of Jackson Heights residents are foreign born, according to the 2000 census, but no single ethnicity prevails. On Roosevelt Avenue, for example, one can savor culinary delicacies from nearly every country in Latin America. On Broadway, near 37th Avenue, there is a small strip of Korean-owned businesses. On 37th Avenue, the air smells of curry, women wear colorful saris and stores display the elaborate jewelry from the Indian state of Gujarat.
 While immigrant groups in a number of American cities were organizing full work stoppages for today, and some legislators in Albany were planning to walk out this afternoon, groups in New York City preferred just the brief demonstration. 
 ''Some workers had legitimate concerns about losing their jobs,'' said Ana Maria Archila, executive director of the Latin American Integration Center, which provides services to immigrants in Queens and on Staten Island. ''Business owners are immigrants, workers are immigrants and the people who shop in many of the stores in this city are immigrants, so if we boycotted business, we'd be basically boycotting ourselves.''

HEADLINE: Plan to Race Stock Cars Frays Tempers At S.I. Meeting

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Nearly two years ago, when promoters of stock-car racing first proposed a Nascar speedway for Staten Island, the notion of bringing one of the country's most popular spectator sports to New York City was met with a mix of curiosity and amusement.
 But two events on Thursday-- one involving a city councilman being roughed up, according to witnesses -- drew attention to the intense opposition that the project has encountered in parts of Staten Island and signaled that the speedway may be quickly developing into one of the more contentious land-use proposals in recent memory. 
Until last week, the project, which could cost up to $600 million in private funds and take until 2010 to be completed, seemed to be inching forward. In May 2004, officials of the International Speedway Corporation, a Nascar affiliate based in Daytona Beach, Fla., confirmed their plans to build the race track. That December, they paid $100 million to buy 450 of the roughly 660 acres of the site, an abandoned petroleum tank farm near the Goethals Bridge. (A developer plans to build a shopping center on the remaining land.)
 In March 2005, the company released a traffic study that proposed a complex network of ferries, charter buses and park-and-ride lots that would allow fans to reach the site during the three full racing weekends expected to be scheduled each year. The three-quarter-mile track would have 82,500 seats and 8,400 parking spaces, but Nascar promoters insisted that the traffic effects could be managed.
 On Thursday, the Sierra Club, joined by a half-dozen local environmental groups, issued a report saying that the project would generate 30,000 vehicle trips for a typical Saturday race; worsen air quality during times when respiratory illnesses are most prevalent; require filling in 14 to 15 acres of fragile saltwater wetlands; and harm several wildlife species.
 Several hours later, the Department of City Planning held its first public hearing on the project, which requires both a land-use review and an environmental-impact study. More than 1,000 people attended the meeting, at the Michael J. Petrides Educational Complex in Sunnyside, about half for and half against the project.
 Less than an hour after it began, the meeting, according to people on both sides of the dispute who were present, degenerated into a shouting match. They said that a top union official who supports the development was involved in a scuffle with Councilman Andrew J. Lanza, a Republican who opposes it, as two planning officials tried unsuccessfully to calm the angry crowd. 
 Mr. Lanza said yesterday that he was trying to describe his views on the project when ''a guy put a bearhug on me, threatening me while guys standing in front of him were urging him, 'Punch him in the face. Hit him.' '' 
 Mr. Lanza identified the man as Christopher J. Wallace, president of Local 20 of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. Mr. Wallace, whose union has 630 members, said yesterday, ''That's silliness.'' 
 ''Clearly, the speedway and the benefits to Staten Island are what we should be talking about,'' he said.
 In telephone interviews, two Staten Island residents who are volunteers for neighborhood environmental groups and oppose the project, Ronald M. Lauria and Charles E. Perry, and an International Speedway Corporation official, Michael P. Printup, all said yesterday that they saw Mr. Wallace place his arm around Mr. Lanza while trying to grab a microphone from him. 
 ''It's a shame the elected officials couldn't speak and finish their thoughts,'' said Mr. Printup, who oversees the project and said it would generate $200 million a year in economic activity and create 75 permanent jobs. 
 Police officers disbanded the meeting shortly afterward, saying that the auditorium's capacity had been exceeded. No arrests were made. A new hearing date has not been scheduled. 
 The speedway corporation has hired Guy V. Molinari, a former borough president, to sway opponents. 
 ''We're going to have to reconvene and hopefully start to answer their questions,'' Mr. Printup said.
 Coincidentally, another land-use dispute involving auto racing has also generated high emotions.
 On April 21, North American Motorsport Events, of Fleetwood, Pa., presented a proposal to bring an annual auto race involving single-seat, or open-wheel, racing cars, to Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, which was the city's first municipal airport, built on 1,500 acres of reclaimed marshland, and is now part of the Gateway National Recreation Area.
 Representative Anthony D. Weiner, who represents parts of Queens and Brooklyn, sent an aide to the meeting and later said that the aide was berated by State Senator Carl Kruger of Brooklyn, who represents the area and has expressed tentative support for the project.
 The acrimony between Mr. Weiner and Mr. Kruger, both Democrats, led to a loud argument at a fund-raising dinner on Thursday in Brooklyn, The Daily News reported. 
 Mr. Weiner said the project, which is backed by the actor (and race car driver) Paul Newman, would violate National Park Service regulations. ''There is no doubt in my mind that when the senator learns how fervently his constituents oppose megadevelopment at Floyd Bennett Field, his position will either reverse or become awfully quiet,'' Mr. Weiner said.
 Senator Kruger said of the project, ''It's an exciting, unique opportunity to take what was the forgotten Floyd Bennett Field, energize it and bring a Grand Prix to Brooklyn. It will attract a very high-end, sophisticated clientele that will mean dollars coming into Brooklyn.''
 The National Park Service, which controls the site, has not taken a formal position on the proposal, which would not require permanent construction. It would cost an estimated $15 million a year, provide some money for charity, and be affiliated with the Champ Car World Series.

HEADLINE: Jets' New Brain Trust Puts Emphasis on Character

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., April 30 

 BODY:
The Jets' 10 draft picks range in size from under 5 feet 8 inches to over 310 pounds and include a cowboy, a kinesiology major and two husbands. For all their discernible differences, the newest Jets share a common football DNA. They seem to be smart, tough, hard-working, competitive, selfless and passionate about the game. 
 They seem to be, in other words, a reflection of the Jets' new architects, General Manager Mike Tannenbaum and Coach Eric Mangini. 
 Tannenbaum, 37, and Mangini, 35, became the youngest G.M.-coach tandem in the N.F.L. on the strength of their desire and their dedication. Those are the pillars on which they plan to reconstruct the Jets, who spiraled to a 4-12 record last season. 
 ''Toughness, competitiveness and leadership are all attributes that we want as many of our players to have as possible,'' Tannenbaum said Sunday. ''We think that's a common thread to successful organizations, not only professional football but other sports as well. It's something we're committed to.'' 
 The Jets unfurled their blueprint with their first pick Saturday, taking a 312-pound left offensive tackle, D'Brickashaw Ferguson of Virginia, when the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Matt Leinart was available. For the rest of the weekend, they did not deviate from their plan. 
 Four of their next five picks were captains of their college teams: center Nick Mangold of Ohio State, linebacker Anthony Schlegel of Ohio State, safety Eric Smith of Michigan State and quarterback Brad Smith of Missouri, who was the Jets' first pick Sunday when the draft resumed with the fourth round. 
 Smith, the first quarterback in Division I to throw for 8,000 yards and rush for 4,000, will start out at wide receiver. He said he had no problem with the switch. 
 ''I'm coming in as a team player and athlete, so wherever I need to go,'' he said. ''I'm excited to make plays for the Jets.'' 
 After completing his undergraduate degree in business, Smith is pursuing a master's degree in economics. 
 ''He has rare leadership, rare intelligence, his production's off the charts, his character is off the charts,'' Tannenbaum said. ''There's a lot of things to like about Brad.'' 
 If quarterback Chad Pennington cannot rebound from a second operation on his right throwing shoulder in less than a year, and if Patrick Ramsey struggles, the Jets will at least have some alternatives other than coaxing Vinny Testaverde out of retirement again. 
 In addition to Smith, they used their first pick in the second round Saturday on quarterback Kellen Clemens of Oregon, whose arm strength, according to the Jets, is superior to that of Vince Young or Leinart, the first two quarterbacks drafted. 
 Clemens, who was raised on a 3,500-acre cattle ranch in eastern Oregon, completed 64 percent of his passes in his senior year before sustaining a season-ending broken leg in the eighth game. ''This is a chance to bust tail on my part,'' said Clemens, one of two draft picks who are married (Schlegel is the other). 
 That kind of attitude is music to Mangini's ears. Mangini, an overachieving defensive lineman who was captain of the Wesleyan football team, looks for players whose infectious enthusiasm matches his own, players like Mangold, the projected heir apparent to the departed center Kevin Mawae. Mangold sounded excited enough to jump offside after he was acquired by the Jets with their second pick in the first round. 
 ''Wherever they want to put me, I'd love to be,'' he said.
 Schlegel, a 6-foot-1 linebacker, was similarly effusive after being acquired in the third round. ''Wherever the coaches see me fit best, I'm going to do it,'' he said. ''Special teams, linebacker, whatever they want me to do, I'll do it, because all I want is to help the Jets win the Super Bowl.'' 
 While working with the New England Patriots' defense, Mangini taught wide receiver Troy Brown how to play cornerback to shore up a depleted secondary. That Mangold and Brad Smith are skilled and smart enough to play multiple positions is not by chance. 
 ''When we look at guys, regardless of what position they may be playing, we try to just look at, O.K., at the end of the day, they're just football players,'' Mangini said. 
 Other players who became Jets on Sunday were Leon Washington, a running back from Florida State who is a shade under 5-8; tight end Jason Pociask from Wisconsin; Drew Coleman, a 5-8 cornerback from Texas Christian; and Titus Adams, a defensive tackle from Nebraska.
 It is a start, and a statement. 
 ''When games get tough, when a season gets tough, when situations get tough, guys with character usually win out,'' Mangini said. ''If you can combine character with talent, you go from the good player to the great player. I really believe that.''

PERSON: John Kenneth Galbraith

HEADLINE: John Kenneth Galbraith, Iconoclastic Economist and Diplomat, Dies at 97 

BYLINE: By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE and DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
John Kenneth Galbraith, the iconoclastic economist, teacher and diplomat and an unapologetically liberal member of the political and academic establishment he often needled in prolific writings for more than half a century, died Saturday at a hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 97.
 Mr. Galbraith lived in Cambridge and at an ''unfarmed farm'' near Newfane, Vt. His death was confirmed by his son J. Alan Galbraith.
Mr. Galbraith was one of the most widely read authors in the history of economics; among his 33 books was ''The Affluent Society'' (1958), one of those rare works that forces a nation to re-examine its values. He wrote fluidly, even on complex topics, and many of his compelling phrases -- among them ''the affluent society,'' ''conventional wisdom'' and ''countervailing power'' -- became part of the language. 
 An imposing presence, lanky and angular at 6 feet 8 inches tall, Mr. Galbraith was consulted frequently by national leaders, and he gave advice freely, though it may have been ignored as often as it was taken. Mr. Galbraith clearly preferred taking issue with the conventional wisdom he distrusted. 
 He strived to change the very texture of the national conversation about power and its nature in the modern world by explaining how the planning of giant corporations superseded market mechanisms. His sweeping ideas, which might have gained even greater traction had he developed disciples willing and able to prove them with mathematical models, came to strike some as almost quaint in today's harsh, interconnected world where corporations devour one another for breakfast.
 ''The distinctiveness of his contribution appears to be slipping from view,'' Stephen P. Dunn wrote in The Journal of Post-Keynesian Economics in 2002.
 Mr. Galbraith, a revered lecturer for generations of Harvard students, nonetheless always commanded attention.
 Robert Lekachman, a liberal economist who shared many of Mr. Galbraith's views on an affluent society they both thought not generous enough to its poor nor sufficiently attendant to its public needs, once described the quality of his discourse as ''witty, supple, eloquent, and edged with that sheen of malice which the fallen sons of Adam always find attractive when it is directed at targets other than themselves.'' 
 From the 1930's to the 1990's Mr. Galbraith helped define the terms of the national political debate, influencing both the direction of the Democratic Party and the thinking of its leaders. 
 He tutored Adlai E. Stevenson, the Democratic nominee for president in 1952 and 1956, on Keynesian economics. He advised President John F. Kennedy (often over lobster stew at the Locke-Ober restaurant in their beloved Boston) and served as his ambassador to India. 
 Though he eventually broke with President Lyndon B. Johnson over the war in Vietnam, he helped conceive of Mr. Johnson's Great Society program and wrote a major presidential address that outlined its purposes. In 1968, pursuing his opposition to the war, he helped Senator Eugene J. McCarthy seek the Democratic nomination for president. 
 In the course of his long career, he undertook a number of government assignments, including the organization of price controls in World War II and speechwriting for Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Kennedy and Johnson. 
 He drew on his experiences in government to write three satirical novels. One in 1968, ''The Triumph,'' a best seller, was an assault on the State Department's slapstick efforts to assist a mythical banana republic, Puerto Santos. In 1990, he took on the Harvard economics department with ''A Tenured Professor,'' ridiculing, among others, a certain outspoken character who bore no small resemblance to himself. 
 At his death, Mr. Galbraith was the Paul M. Warburg emeritus professor of economics at Harvard, where he had taught for most of his career. A popular lecturer, he treated economics as an aspect of society and culture rather than as an arcane discipline of numbers. 

A Polarizing Figure
 Mr. Galbraith was admired, envied and sometimes scorned for his eloquence and wit and his ability to make complicated, dry issues understandable to any educated reader. He enjoyed his international reputation as a slayer of sacred cows and a maverick among economists whose pronouncements became known as ''classic Galbraithian heresies.'' 
 But other economists, even many of his fellow liberals, did not generally share his views on production and consumption, and he was not regarded by his peers as among the top-ranked theorists and scholars. Such criticism did not sit well with Mr. Galbraith, a man no one ever called modest, and he would respond that his critics had rightly recognized that his ideas were ''deeply subversive of the established orthodoxy.''
 ''As a matter of vested interest, if not of truth,'' he added, ''they were compelled to resist.''
 Nearly 40 years after writing ''The Affluent Society,'' Mr. Galbraith updated it in 1996 as ''The Good Society.'' In it, he said his earlier concerns had only worsened: that if anything, America had become even more a ''democracy of the fortunate.'' 
 Mr. Galbraith gave broad thought to how America changed from a nation of small farms and workshops to one of big factories and superstores, and judgments of this legacy are as broad as his ambition. Beginning with ''American Capitalism'' in 1952, he laid out a detailed critique of what he saw as an increasingly oligopolistic economy. Combined with works in the 1950's by writers like David Reisman, Vance Packard and William H. Whyte, the book changed people's views of the postwar world.
 Mr. Galbraith argued that technology mandated long-term contracts to diminish high-stakes uncertainty. He said companies used advertising to induce consumers to buy things they had never dreamed they needed. 
 Other economists, like Gary S. Becker and George J. Stigler, both Nobel Prize winners, countered with proofs showing that advertising is essentially informative rather than manipulative.
 Some suggested that Mr. Galbraith's liberalism crippled his influence. In a review of ''John Kenneth Galbraith: His Life, His Politics, His Economics'' by Richard Parker (Farrar, 2005), J. Bradford DeLong wrote in Foreign Affairs that Mr. Galbraith's lifelong sermon of social democracy was destined to fail in a land of ''rugged individualism.'' He compared Mr. Galbraith to Sisyphus, endlessly pushing the same rock up a hill that always turns out to be too steep.
 Amartya Sen, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, maintains that Mr. Galbraith not only reached but also defined the summit of his field. In the 2000 commencement address at Harvard, Mr. Parker's book recounts, Mr. Sen said the influence of ''The Affluent Society'' was so pervasive that its many piercing insights were taken for granted.
 ''It's like reading 'Hamlet' and deciding it's full of quotations,'' he said. 

Born on a Farm
 John Kenneth Galbraith was born Oct. 15, 1908, on a 150-acre farm in Dunwich Township in southern Ontario, the only son of William Archibald and Catherine Kendall Galbraith. His forebears had left Scotland years before.
 His father was a farmer and schoolteacher, the head of a farm-cooperative insurance company, an organizer of the township telephone company, and a town and county auditor. His mother, whom he described as beautiful and decidedly firm, died when he was 14.
 Mr. Galbraith said he inherited his liberalism, his interest in politics and his wit from his father. When he was about 8, he once recalled, he would join his father at political rallies. At one event, he wrote in his 1964 memoir ''The Scotch,'' his father mounted a large pile of manure to address the crowd. 
 ''He apologized with ill-concealed sincerity for speaking from the Tory platform,'' Mr. Galbraith related. ''The effect on this agrarian audience was electric. Afterward I congratulated him on the brilliance of the sally. He said, 'It was good but it didn't change any votes.' '' 
 At age 18 he enrolled at Ontario Agricultural College, where he took practical farming courses like poultry husbandry and basic plumbing. But as the Depression dragged down Canadian farmers, the questions of how farm products were sold and at what prices became more urgent to him than how they were produced. He completed his undergraduate work at the University of Toronto and enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he received a master's degree in 1933 and a doctorate in agricultural economics in 1934.
 A major influence on him was the caustic social commentary he found in Veblen's ''Theory of the Leisure Class.'' Mr. Galbraith called Veblen one of American history's most astute social scientists, but also acknowledged that he tended to be overcritical.
 ''I've thought to resist this tendency,'' Mr. Galbraith said, ''but in other respects Veblen's influence on me has lasted long. One of my greatest pleasures in my writing has come from the thought that perhaps my work might annoy someone of comfortably pretentious position. Then comes the realization that such people rarely read.''
 While at Berkeley, he began contributing to The Journal of Farm Economics and other publications. His writings came to the attention of Harvard, where he became an instructor and tutor from 1934 to 1939. 
 In those years the theories of John Maynard Keynes were exciting economists everywhere because they promised solutions to the most urgent problems of the time: the Depression and unemployment. The government must intervene in moments of crisis, Keynes maintained, and unbalance the budget if necessary to get the nation's economic machinery running again.
 Keynesianism gave economic validation to what President Roosevelt was doing, Mr. Galbraith thought, and he resolved in 1937 ''to go to the temple'' -- Cambridge University -- on a fellowship grant for a year of study with the disciples of Keynes.
 In 1937 Mr. Galbraith married Catherine Merriam Atwater, the daughter of a prominent New York lawyer, whom he met when she was a graduate student at Radcliffe. 
 In addition to his wife and his son J. Alan, of Washington, a lawyer, he is survived by two other sons, Peter, a former United States ambassador to Croatia and a senior fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation in Washington, and James, an economist at the University of Texas; a sister, Catherine Denholm of Toronto; and six grandchildren. 

The War Years
 Mr. Galbraith became an American citizen, and taught economics at Princeton in 1939. But after the fall of France in 1940, Mr. Galbraith joined the Roosevelt administration to help manage an economy being prepared for war. He rose to become the administrator of wage and price controls in the Office of Price Administration. Prices remained stable, unlike in earlier wars, but he grew controversial, drawing the constant fire of industry complaints. ''I reached the point that all price fixers reach,'' he said, ''My enemies outnumbered my friends.''
 He was forced to resign in 1943 and was rejected by the Army as too tall when he sought to enlist. He then held a variety of government and private jobs, including director of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey in 1945, director of the Office of Economic Security Policy in the State Department in 1946 and a member of the board of editors of Fortune magazine, from 1943 to 1948. It was at Fortune, he said, that he became addicted to writing.
 In 1949 he returned to Harvard as a professor of economics; his lectures were delivered before standing-room-only audiences. And he began to write with intensity. 
 He completed two books in 1952, ''American Capitalism: The Concept of Countervailing Power'' and ''A Theory of Price Control.'' In ''American Capitalism,'' he set out to debunk myths about the free market economy and explore concentrations of economic power. He described the pressures that corporations and unions exerted on each other for increased profits and increased wages, and said these countervailing forces kept those giant groups in equilibrium and the nation's economy prosperous and stable.
 In his 1981 memoirs, he said that though the basic idea was still sound, he had been ''a bit carried away'' by his notion of countervailing power. ''I made it far more inevitable and rather more equalizing than, in practice, it ever is,'' he wrote. 
 He summarized the lessons of his days at the Office of Price Administration in ''A Theory of Price Control,'' later calling it the best book he ever wrote. He said: ''The only difficulty is that five people read it. Maybe 10. I made up my mind that I would never again place myself at the mercy of the technical economists who had the enormous power to ignore what I had written. I set out to involve a larger community.''
 He wrote two more major books in the 1950's dealing with economics, both aimed at a large general audience. Both were best sellers.
 In ''The Great Crash 1929,'' he recalled the mistakes of an earlier day and suggested that some were being repeated as the book appeared, in 1955. Mr. Galbraith testified at a Senate hearing and said that another crash was inevitable. The stock market dropped sharply that day, and he was widely blamed. 
 ''The Affluent Society'' appeared in 1958, making Mr. Galbraith known around the world. In it, he depicted a consumer culture gone wild, rich in goods but poor in the social services that make for community. He argued that America had become so obsessed with overproducing consumer goods that it had increased the perils of both inflation and recession by creating an artificial demand for frivolous or useless products, by encouraging overextension of consumer credit and by emphasizing the private sector at the expense of the public sector. 
 Anticipating the environmental movement by nearly a decade, he asked, ''Is the added production or the added efficiency in production worth its effect on ambient air, water and space -- the countryside?'''' Mr. Galbraith called for a change in values that would shun the seductions of advertising and champion clean air, good housing and aid for the arts.
 Later, in ''The New Industrial State'' (1967), he tried to trace the shift of power from the landed aristocracy through the great industrialists to the technical and managerial experts of modern corporations. He called for a new class of intellectuals and professionals to determine policy. While critics, as usual, praised his ability to write compellingly, they also continued to complain that he oversimplified economic matters and either ignored or failed to keep up with corporate changes. 
 One of his early readers was Adlai Stevenson, the governor of Illinois, who twice ran unsuccessfully for president against Dwight D. Eisenhower. Mr. Galbraith often wrote to Mr. Stevenson, introducing him to Keynesian taxation and unemployment policies. In 1953, Mr. Galbraith and Thomas K. Finletter, the former secretary of the Air Force and later ambassador to NATO, formed a sort of brain trust for Mr. Stevenson that included Ambassador W. Averell Harriman, the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and the foreign policy specialist George W. Ball.
 Although Mr. Galbraith did not at first regard Kennedy as a serious member of Congress, he began to change his view when Kennedy was elected to the Senate in 1952 and began calling him for advice. The senator's conversations became increasingly wide-ranging and well informed, Mr. Galbraith said, and his respect and affection grew.
 After Mr. Kennedy won the presidency in 1960, he appointed Mr. Galbraith as United States ambassador to India. There were those, Mr. Galbraith among them, who believed that the president had done this to get a potential loose cannon out of Washington.
 He said in his memoirs: ''Kennedy, I always believed, was pleased to have me in his administration, but at a suitable distance such as in India.'' Mr. Galbraith was fascinated with India; he had spent a year there in 1956 advising its government and was eager to return. 
 He spent 27 months as ambassador, clashed with the State Department and was more favorably regarded as a diplomat by those outside the government. He fought for increased American military and economic aid for India and acted as a sort of informal adviser to the Indian government on economic policy. Known by his staff as the Great Mogul, he achieved an excellent rapport with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and other senior officials in the Indian government. 
 When India became embroiled in a border war with China in the Himalayas in 1962, Ambassador Galbraith effectively took charge of both the American military and diplomatic response during what was a brief but potentially explosive crisis. He saw to it that India received restrained American help and took it on himself to announce that the United States recognized India's disputed northern borders. 
 The reason he had so much control over the American response, he said, was that the border fighting occurred during the far more consequential Cuban missile crisis, and no one at the highest levels at the White House, State Department or Pentagon was readily responding to his cables. 
 In 1968, Mr. Galbraith published ''Indian Painting: The Scenes, Themes and Legends,'' which he wrote with Mohinder Singh Randhawa. An avid champion of Indian art, he donated much of his collection to the Harvard University Art Museums.

Falling Out With Johnson
 After Kennedy was assassinated, Mr. Galbraith served as an adviser to President Johnson, meeting with him often at the White House or on trips to the president's ranch in Texas to talk about what could be accomplished with the Great Society programs. Mr. Galbraith said that Johnson had summoned him to write the final draft of his speech outlining the purposes of the Great Society, and that when the writing was done, said, ''I'm not going to change a word. That's great.'' 
 The relationship between the two men soon broke apart over their differences over the war in Vietnam. Nevertheless, when Adlai Stevenson died in 1965, the ambassadorship to the United Nations became vacant, and word reached Mr. Galbraith that the president was considering him as Mr. Stevenson's successor.
 Not wanting to be placed in the position of having to defend administration positions he was strongly against, Mr. Galbraith suggested Justice Arthur J. Goldberg of the Supreme Court. The president named Mr. Goldberg, and Mr. Galbraith later blamed himself for a mistake that ''cost the court a good and liberal jurist.'' Others said he took too much credit for what happened. 
 In 1973 he published ''Economics and the Public Purpose,'' in which he sought to extend the planning system already used by the industrial core of the economy to the market economy, to small-business owners and to entrepreneurs. Mr. Galbraith called for a ''new socialism,'' with more steeply progressive taxes; public support of the arts; public ownership of housing, medical and transportation facilities; and the conversion of some corporations and military contractors into public corporations.
 He continued to pour out magazine articles, book reviews, op-ed essays and letters to editors; he lectured everywhere, sometimes debating William F. Buckley Jr., his friend and Gstaad skiing partner. 
 In 1977 he wrote and narrated ''The Age of Uncertainty,'' a 13-part television series surveying 200 years of economic theory and practice. In 1990 he wrote ''A Tenured Professor,'' about a Harvard professor who devised a computer-assisted system for playing the stock market and used his billions in profits on programs for education and peace -- only to be investigated by Congress for un-American activities and forced to shut down his operations. 
 In 1996, as Mr. Galbraith approached his 90th year, he wrote ''The Good Society.'' He contended that Republicans out to roll back the welfare state made a fundamental error in thinking that politicians and their actions drive history. Liberals did not create big government; history did, he argued.
 Mr. Galbraith, who received the Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 2000, continued to make his views known. Some were surprising, like his speech in 1999 praising Johnson's presidency, which he had helped to bring down by working with the 1968 McCarthy campaign.
 In 2004, Mr. Galbraith, who was then 95, published ''The Economics of Innocent Fraud,'' a short book that questioned much of standard economic wisdom.
 He remained optimistic about the ability of government to improve the lot of the less fortunate. ''Let there be a coalition of the concerned,'' he urged. ''The affluent would still be affluent, the comfortable still comfortable, but the poor would be part of the political system.''

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Monday and in late editions on Sunday about the economist and diplomat John Kenneth Galbraith referred incorrectly to his family at several points. He had a younger brother, William, who died several years ago; he was not an only son. A sister, Catherine Denholm, also died several years ago; she was not among his survivors. Mr. Galbraith had 10 grandchildren, not 6. Because of an editing error, the term for his wife's vocation was truncated in some copies. She is a linguist. A caption misstated the date of a photograph of the Galbraiths taken at their home in New Delhi while he was an ambassador. It was in 1956, not 1966.
A picture caption on Monday and in late editions on Sunday with the obituary of the economist and diplomat John Kenneth Galbraith misstated the date of a photograph of the Galbraiths. And a correction on this page on Thursday gave a second erroneous date. The photo was made at the Galbraiths' home in New Delhi during his term as ambassador to India, 1961-63, not in 1966 or 1956.
An obituary on May 1 and in late editions on April 30 about the economist and diplomat John Kenneth Galbraith referred incorrectly to his position with the United States Strategic Bombing Survey in 1945. As one of several directors of the effort, he oversaw a study of the economic effects of American bombing; he was not overall director of the survey. The error was pointed out by a reader in a letter dated May 22; the correction was delayed by an editing oversight.

HEADLINE: A Century of Intervention, Regarded With a Cold Eye

BYLINE: By RICHARD K. BETTS. 
Richard K. Betts is director of the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies, Columbia University, and adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

 BODY:

Overthrow
America's Century of Regime Change From Hawaii to Iraq
By Stephen Kinzer
Illustrated. 384 pages. Times Books/Henry Holt & Company. $27.50.
 By Stephen Kinzer's count, the United States has toppled foreign governments 14 times in the 110 years between the 1893 coup in Hawaii and the occupation of Iraq, making regime change by force as American as apple pie. But Mr. Kinzer says the results are always damaging to the countries involved, and to American security as well.
Mr. Kinzer, formerly a foreign correspondent for The New York Times, has written on this subject before, in books on United States intervention in Iran and Guatemala. In ''Overthrow'' he surveys all 14 cases in an admirably written page-turner. 
 Although the book does not add to historical knowledge of the individual cases, it may be the first to bring them together in a comparison over time. This makes the narrative more interesting than a single case study, but also more depressing. 
 In Mr. Kinzer's treatment there are no bright spots. In one instance after another, arrogant Americans are shown tossing out legitimate governments and installing corrupt brutes who turn out to cause more problems for foreign policy than did the ousted leaders. 
 Mr. Kinzer's main explanation for these recurrent misadventures is greed. The prime villains are United Fruit, ITT, Aramco, Halliburton and other corporations and plutocrats operating through like-minded officials. He proceeds from the classic theory first advanced by the British economist J. A. Hobson, and most prominently in Lenin's ''Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism,'' that overproduction causes a scramble for new markets and ''a policy of forcing foreign nations to buy American products.'' This may be convincing for the early cases, but Mr. Kinzer underestimates the relative force of geopolitical concerns during the cold war, when, he claims, economic motives played just as strong a role as ever.
 Actually Mr. Kinzer cannot quite make up his mind. At the beginning he contends that things like spreading democracy, Christianizing heathen nations, ''establishing military bases around the world and bringing foreign governments under American control were never ends in themselves'' but were ''ways for the United States to assure itself access to the markets, resources and investment potential of distant lands.'' But later he says, ''Americans overthrew governments only when economic interests coincided with ideological ones,'' and details cases in which intervention came not just from greed but from humanitarian hubris as well. At the outset he discounts moralism, but later he credits ''the power of the noble idea of American exceptionalism.'' 
 The easy answer is that everything mattered, but without clarifying which causes are necessary or sufficient, the story does not tell us which levers we should look to first to change the pattern.
 We should not ask good journalism to proceed like social science, but on especially controversial cases more fastidious analysis would help. Consider Chile. Mr. Kinzer emphasizes that his book covers only cases where the United States role was decisive in deposing governments, not those where American agents played ''subsidiary roles.'' On this basis he refuses to count the coup against the right-wing Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, even though the United States supplied weapons to plotters at one point, direct action beyond what the United States did in 1973 to help bring down the president of Chile, Salvador Allende, which is covered in the book.
 Washington can be tagged with a decisive role in the Chile coup only by blurring together the events of 1970 and 1973. In 1970 President Richard M. Nixon did encourage a coup to prevent Allende from taking office after the Chilean election, but the scheme failed. Although plotters accidentally killed the army commander, the coup never got off the ground. 
 In the next three years Washington undertook covert action programs that funneled money to anti-Allende newspapers, parties and private groups. The definitive investigation under Senator Frank Church, however, found no evidence that the United States instigated or aided the military coup. 
 Mr. Kinzer notes that a truckers' strike that contributed to disorder preceding the coup was ''supported in part by C.I.A. funds,'' but he does not report that these funds were diverted, against C.I.A. rules, by a private-sector group that had received them for other purposes. American intelligence got advance warning of the coup, but in the weeks beforehand almost everyone in Chile knew it was coming.
 The horrors of the Pinochet regime, the movie ''Missing,'' the record of previous covert actions and Nixon's happiness with Allende's ouster generated the folklore that Washington had done to Allende just what it did to Mossadegh in Iran and Arbenz in Guatemala. But no such evidence has yet come to light, even in the 17,000 pages of documents declassified in the Clinton administration. Among those, as the Latin America specialist Mark Falcoff has pointed out, were secret recordings of Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger supporting their claim that the United States did not have a hand in the coup.
 Distinctions between coup support and other covert actions may strike some as hair splitting. But the difference is significant, and readers should remember that some assertions about the record are more controversial, and reality more complex, than a broad survey conveys. If the record of his 13 other cases is clear of such confusions, however, the overall story is just as bad, and sad, as Mr. Kinzer says.


CORRECTION-DATE: May 5, 2006

 CORRECTION:
The Books of The Times review on Tuesday, about ''Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change From Hawaii to Iraq,'' by Stephen Kinzer, referred incompletely to what a Latin America specialist, Mark Falcoff, said in 2003 about a recording of a conversation between Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger regarding the overthrow of the Allende government in Chile 30 years earlier. Mr. Falcoff wrote in Commentary that the recording supported the United States' assertion that it did not have a hand in the coup. But the writer later acknowledged that he had omitted part of the transcript (with a name blanked out), in which Mr. Kissinger said: ''We didn't do it. I mean we helped them. ---------- created the conditions as great as possible.''

 BODY:

IMMIGRATION PROTESTS -- Hundreds of thousands of immigrants and their supporters skipped work and school and marched in dozens of cities from coast to coast. The demonstrations did not bring the nation to a halt as planned by some organizers, though they conveyed in peaceful but sometimes boisterous ways the resolve of those who favor loosening the country's laws on immigration. [Page A1.] 


RETREAT ON TAX PLAN -- Senate Republicans hurriedly abandoned a broad tax proposal opposed by the oil industry and business community, another sign of their struggle to come up with a legislative answer to high gasoline prices. [A1.]

BOLIVIAN OIL -- President Evo Morales of Bolivia on Monday ordered the military to occupy energy fields around the Andean country as he placed Bolivia's plentiful oil and gas reserves under state control. [A9.]

NEW ECONOMIC DATA -- Robust spending on homes, cars and other consumer goods kept the economy moving at a brisk pace and sent a crucial measure of inflation higher in March, the Commerce Department reported, renewing concerns that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates further. [C1.]

CHURCHES AND PENSIONS -- Under a little-known aspect of pension law, churches and organizations affiliated with them can opt out of the costly and complicated rules that apply to secular employers. Tens of thousands of people work for organizations that have opted out of the law, and most do not know that they are exposed to large losses. [A1.]

DETERMINED TO GO WEST -- BenQ, whose cellphone unit primarily made handsets for big companies like Motorola, formed a venture with Siemens so it could sell its own branded phones beyond Taiwan and China. But by trying to reach consumers in the West, BenQ now competes more directly with the companies it used to sell to, and some are taking their business elsewhere. [C1.]

S.U.V. LAWSUIT -- Ten states, including California and New York, plan to file a lawsuit to force the Bush administration to toughen mileage regulations for sport utility vehicles and other trucks. [A21.]

GOOGLE VS. MICROSOFT -- The rivalry between Google and Microsoft is growing more combative, and with good reason: the outcome is likely to shape the future of competition in computing and the way people use information technology. To succeed, Microsoft has to make strong inroads into Internet services and software, where Google is a leader. [C1.]

INTEL'S INTERNET PLAN -- Intel plans to announce a design for a sub-$400 educational laptop and a five-year, $1 billion program to train teachers and to extend wireless digital Internet access worldwide. The initiative comes as Intel is embarking on what it says will be a $1 billion restructuring program in the face of declining market share. [C3.]

ENRON TESTIMONY -- Having $100 million in personal debt did not stop Kenneth L. Lay from spending $200,000 on a birthday cruise for his wife and holding onto some $30 million in real estate, even as banks were demanding repayment, according to testimony at his trial. [C3.]

STOCKS DIP -- Anxiety over interest rates sent stocks lower. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 23.85 points, to 11,343.29. The Standard & Poor's 500 dropped 5.42 points, to 1,305.19, and the Nasdaq lost 17.78 points, to 2,304.79. [C6.]

QUESTIONS ON MEDICAL STUDIES -- Recent disclosures of fraudulent or flawed studies in medical and scientific journals have called into question the merits of their peer-review system. [F1.]

HEADLINE: Spending Pushes Up Inflation 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Robust spending on homes, cars and other consumer goods kept the economy moving at a brisk pace and sent a critical measure of inflation higher in March, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, renewing concerns that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates further.
 Prices paid for consumer items excluding food and energy -- a gauge closely watched by policy makers -- rose at an annual pace of 2 percent in March, up from 1.8 percent in February, as personal spending, income and home construction all increased. Economists had expected prices to rise 1.9 percent. Including food and energy, prices rose 2.9 percent, the same pace as the month before. 
Analysts and investors are carefully monitoring the latest economic data in an effort to divine whether the Fed will raise rates once, twice, or even three more times before stopping. 
 The latest increase in prices, though modest, will concern policy makers because it could set the stage for higher inflation later, said Nigel Gault, an economist at Global Insight, a research firm. If gasoline and oil prices stay at current levels or move higher, businesses may be forced to raise the prices of other goods and services. Inflation excluding food and energy may then surpass 2 percent, the top end of the range Fed officials consider ideal. 
 ''There is a risk that we will push up above 2 percent, not necessarily over the next month, but sometime over the next few months,'' Mr. Gault said. ''That will be a concern to the Fed.''
 In deciding whether to raise its short-term rate, now at 4.75 percent, the Fed will have to weigh inflation concerns and signs of growth against evidence that the economy may lose some of its vigor. Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a Congressional committee last week that the Fed may pause in its rate increases later this year to give policy makers more time to weigh competing signals from different statistics. Some economists contend that the Fed should stop after one more increase, at its meeting on May 10, because strong growth in March and in the first quarter would probably not be sustained.
 Those experts say that higher gasoline prices, now about $3 a gallon in many areas, are more worrisome as a threat to spending and growth than as a source of inflation. At the same time, rising interest rates have led to a 20 percent drop in mortgage applications in the last 12 months and have cooled real estate prices in many once-hot coastal markets.
 Gregory L. Miller, chief economist at SunTrust Banks in Atlanta, said that the Fed's top concern should be to make sure the economy did not stall from the burden of too many rate increases. One reason for the Fed to stop and take stock, Mr. Miller said, is that the economy has not yet felt the full dampening impact of recent rate increases. 
 ''Policy takes time to resonate through the economy,'' he said.
 Growth does not appear to be stalling yet. For the first quarter, the economy grew at a 4.8 percent annual pace after an anemic 1.7 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department reported last week. 
 The quarter ended on an upswing, as the data released yesterday showed. Personal spending rose 0.6 percent in March after rising 0.2 percent in February and 0.9 percent in January. The biggest jump was seen in services, up 0.7 percent, and durable goods, up 0.5 percent. Economists had expected spending to rise by 0.4 percent, according to a survey by Bloomberg News.
 Personal incomes jumped 0.8 percent, with about half the increase, or $40.9 billion, coming from the federal government's new Medicare prescription drug plan; analysts had expected incomes to increase 0.4 percent. Wages, salaries and other forms of compensation increased by 0.5 percent.
 In a separate report yesterday, the Institute for Supply Management, an industry group, said that its manufacturing index rose to 57.3 in April, from 55. A reading greater than 50 indicates that managers are generally optimistic about their businesses' prospects for growth. The survey indicated that manufacturers had stepped up hiring and were paying more for raw materials.
 Anticipating more interest rate increases, investors pushed bond prices down yesterday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 5.14 percent, up from 5.06 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: Republicans Drop a Tax Plan After Business Leaders Protest

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Edmund L. Andrews and Kate Phillips contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1 

 BODY:
Senate Republicans on Monday hurriedly abandoned a broad tax proposal opposed by the oil industry and business leaders, another sign of their struggle to come up with an acceptable political and legislative answer to high gasoline prices.
 Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said he had decided to jettison the provision, which would have generated billions of dollars by changing the way businesses treat inventories for tax purposes. Instead, he said the Senate Finance Committee would hold hearings on the plan ''later this year, so the pluses and minuses of the provision can become well known.''
 The retreat came after a torrent of objections from business leaders and their advocates, who typically view Republicans in Congress as allies. They said they had been blindsided by the inclusion of the proposal as a central element of the Republican leadership's energy package late last week. 
 The centerpiece of the leadership proposal, a $100 rebate check to compensate taxpayers for higher gasoline prices, continued to receive a rough reception. Members of the public have telephoned and written to ridicule the idea, and even Republican lawmakers are finding fault. 
 ''Political anxiety in an election year is to blame for a lot of the bad bills Congress passes,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who on Monday called the rebate a ''knee-jerk populist idea'' that voters would see through. 
 Democrats are trying to rally voters against Republicans, pointing to the rising fuel costs as evidence of how consumers were hurt by the opposition's ties to the oil industry.
 The Republican energy package was assembled quickly last week after lawmakers returned from a recess punctuated by public complaints about the rapidly rising gas costs . Senate officials acknowledged privately that they were paying a price for rolling out the proposal before having time to vet it fully. 
 Besides the tax provision and the rebate, the measure includes new protections against price gouging, incentives to expand domestic oil refinery capacity, support for new energy initiatives and tax incentives for buying hybrid vehicles.
 Outside Congress, experts have said the government has few realistic options that would quickly reduce gas prices. And as lawmakers struggle to gain political advantage on the issue, they must juggle the often competing goals of curbing prices, increasing production and tamping down populist anger about oil industry profits. 
 Major trade groups quickly and vociferously registered their disdain for the tax provision, saying the plan amounted to a hefty new tax not only on the oil industry, but also on many manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers that rely on large inventories as well. 
 ''This just came out of the blue,'' said Dorothy Coleman, vice president of tax and domestic economic policy at the National Association of Manufacturers. ''Before you make a change in longstanding tax policy -- I am talking 70 years or so -- you don't just up and do it in an energy bill.''
 At the National Retail Federation, Rochelle Bernstein, vice president and tax counsel, said lobbyists there immediately raised a red flag with lawmakers and aides. ''Our concern was did they understand what they were doing, did they know this was a proposal that could have wide-ranging implications?'' Ms. Bernstein said.
 One leadership aide who did not want to be identified as discussing internal deliberations said the decision was made to drop the provision rather than have the energy proposals caught up in a secondary tax fight. It remained unclear how quickly the leadership might move to bring its plan to the floor but it appeared unlikely to be added to the emergency spending bill the Senate is considering this week. 
 Though the Senate previously approved a more narrowly defined proposal to require the accounting change for major oil companies, the plan announced last week would have extended to all business sectors. It would have represented a major shift in policy for Congressional Republicans, who have wrapped their economic approach around tax cuts rather than increases.
 The decision to drop it eliminates a chief source of revenue to pay for the rebate checks to be mailed to an estimated 100 million taxpayers. After the tax plan was dropped, Mr. Frist said money to pay for the rebate program could be generated by opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling, another element of the plan. But the drilling initiative, previously rebuffed in Congress several times, faces serious opposition of its own and the revenues would not be realized for years. 
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, called the decision to drop the tax proposal ''just another example of the Bush Republicans' inability to break their ties to big oil.'' 
 There were no estimates of how much money the change would have produced, though it had been projected at more than $11 billion in the past. The proposal in a separate tax bill to bar the accounting practice known as last in, first out for the oil companies was estimated to raise about $4.3 billion from them alone. That idea is still part of the continuing tax negotiations. But whether it will be in the final measure is unclear, and President Bush has threatened to veto it.
 Business advocates said taxes could have been driven up significantly by ending the practice that allows companies to record sales from inventory at the higher, current cost of acquiring or producing the goods rather than a potentially lower original price.
 Some panicked executives told their Washington representatives the increase could be from $30 million to $60 million for their individual companies alone.
 ''When this deal first surfaced late Thursday, the business community was just shocked,'' said Bruce Josten, at the United States Chamber of Commerce. "Instantly, if not rather simultaneously, people started making calls to the Senate leadership, to the staff of the Senate Finance Committee. It was the wholesalers, the manufacturers, the mass retailers."
 Jade West, senior vice president at the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, said she learned about the full reach of Mr. Frist's proposal at midafternoon on Thursday and did not believe the report at first. 
 When Ms. West polled some of the association's largest members, all of whom juggle large inventories, their response was frantic. One called the proposal ''dumb and irrational,'' she said. By Friday, the wholesalers had mobilized an e-mail campaign that resulted in about 350 letters to the Senate by Monday morning.
 The Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group representing about 400 businesses including Wal-Mart and Target, began rallying their big-box store members first thing Friday. 
 ''It was just surprising that they didn't see the writing on the wall, they didn't see the opposition that this provision would face,'' said Shannon Campagna, the organization's vice president for government affairs. ''They didn't have their ear to the ground.''

HEADLINE: Immigrants Take to U.S. Streets in Show of Strength

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Reporting for this article was contributed by Cindy Chang from Los Angeles, Steve Friess from Las Vegas, Carolyn Marshall from Watsonville, Calif., and Gretchen Ruethling from Chicago.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 1 

 BODY:
Hundreds of thousands of immigrants and their supporters skipped work, school and shopping on Monday and marched in dozens of cities from coast to coast. 
 The demonstrations did not bring the nation to a halt as planned by some organizers, though they did cause some disruptions and conveyed in peaceful but sometimes boisterous ways the resolve of those who favor loosening the country's laws on immigration.
Originally billed as a nationwide economic boycott under the banner ''Day Without an Immigrant,'' the day evolved into a sweeping round of protests intended to influence the debate in Congress over granting legal status to all or most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country. 
 The protesters, a mix of illegal immigrants and legal residents and citizens, were mostly Latino, but in contrast to similar demonstrations in the past two months, large numbers of people of other ethnicities joined or endorsed many of the events. In some cases, the rallies took on a broader tone of social action, as gay rights advocates, opponents of the war in Iraq and others without a direct stake in the immigration debate took to the streets. 
 ''I think it's only fair that I speak up for those who can't speak for themselves,'' said Aimee Hernandez, 28, one of an estimated 400,000 people who turned out in Chicago, the site of one of the largest demonstrations. ''I think we're just too many that you can't just send them back. How are you going to ignore these people?''
 But among those who favor stricter controls on illegal immigration, the protests hardly impressed.
 ''When the rule of law is dictated by a mob of illegal aliens taking to the streets, especially under a foreign flag, then that means the nation is not governed by a rule of law -- it is a mobocracy,'' Jim Gilchrist, a founder of the Minutemen Project, a volunteer group that patrols the United States-Mexico border, said in an interview.
 While the boycott, an idea born several months ago among a small group of grass-roots immigration advocates here, may not have shut down the country, it was strongly felt in a variety of places, particularly those with large Latino populations.
 Stores and restaurants in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York closed because workers did not show up or as a display of solidarity with demonstrators. In Los Angeles, the police estimated that more than half a million people attended two demonstrations in and near downtown. School districts in several cities reported a decline in attendance; at Benito Juarez High School in Pilsen, a predominantly Latino neighborhood in Chicago, only 17 percent of the students showed up, even though administrators and some protest organizers had urged students to stay in school.
 Lettuce, tomatoes and grapes went unpicked in fields in California and Arizona, which contribute more than half the nation's produce, as scores of growers let workers take the day off. Truckers who move 70 percent of the goods in ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., did not work.
 Meatpacking companies, including Tyson Foods and Cargill, closed plants in the Midwest and the West employing more than 20,000 people, while the flower and produce markets in downtown Los Angeles stood largely and eerily empty.
 Israel Banuelos, 23, and more than 50 of his colleagues skipped work, with the grudging acceptance of his employer, an industrial paint plant in Hollister, Calif.
 ''We were supposed to work,'' Mr. Banuelos said, ''but we wanted to close down the company. Our boss didn't like it money-wise.''
 The economic impact of the day's events was hard to gauge, though economists expected a one-day stoppage to have little long-term effect. In large swaths of the country, life went on with no noticeable difference. But protesters in numerous cities, many clad in white and waving mostly American flags in response to complaints that earlier rallies featured too many Latin American ones, declared victory as chanting throngs shut down streets. 
 Most of the demonstrators' ire was directed at a bill passed by the House that would increase security at the border while making it a felony for an illegal immigrant to be in the country or to aid one. The marchers generally favored a plan in the Senate, for which President Bush has shown signs of support, that would include more protection at the border but offer many illegal workers a path to citizenship.
 Still, the divide among advocates over the value and effectiveness of a boycott resulted in some cities, including Los Angeles and San Diego, playing host to two sizable demonstrations, one organized by boycotters and the other by people neutral or opposed to it.
 That split played out across the country. While many business owners warned employees about taking the day off, many others also sought to negotiate time off or other ways to register workers' sentiments.
 Las Vegas casinos reported few disruptions, partly because many of their owners announced their support for workers at a news conference last week. On Monday, more than 40 casinos set up tables in employee lunchrooms for workers to sign pro-immigration petitions.
 Leaders of Local 226 of the Culinary Workers Union also urged members to go to work. The union is Las Vegas's largest hospitality union, representing 50,000 workers, of which 40 percent are Hispanic. 
 Smaller businesses in Las Vegas, where tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered on the Strip, also took a hit. Javier Barajas said he closed his family's four Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas because members of his staff warned him they would not show up, costing him more than $60,000 in revenue.
 ''I cannot fire anybody over this, but I would have liked to see some other way to express themselves,'' said Mr. Barajas, who was once an illegal immigrant from central Mexico but became a United States citizen. ''It's the small businesses that are hurt by this.''
 For many immigrants, however, it was just another workday.
 At a Home Depot in Hollywood, day laborers as always crowded parking lot entrances, hoping for work. At a car wash in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, employees buzzed, with workers vacuuming, buffing and drying cars. People lined up at markets, though some reported slower business.
 ''I was thinking about not buying things, but then I needed to buy stuff,'' said Alex Sanchez, 28, a construction worker buying an avocado, chilies and beer.
 The boycott grew from an idea hatched by a small band of grass-roots advocates in Los Angeles, inspired by the farmworker movement of the 1960's led by Cesar Chavez and Bert Corona. Through the Internet and mass media catering to immigrants, they developed and tapped a network of union organizers, immigrant rights groups and others to spread the word and plan events tied to the boycott, timed to coincide with International Workers' Day.
 The Los Angeles organizers said some 70 cities held boycott activities.
 The day spawned all manner of supportive actions here. A department store chain offered space for lawyers to give legal advice to immigrants; in Hollywood, the comedian Paul Rodriguez appeared at the comedy club the Laugh Factory to promote a daylong health care fair for immigrant workers.
 In Chicago, there was solidarity in diversity, as Latinos were joined by immigrants of Polish, Irish, Asian and African descent. Jerry Jablonski, 30, said he had moved to Chicago from Poland six years ago, flying to Mexico and then crossing the border. He now works a construction job.
 ''Poland is my old country,'' Mr. Jablonski said. ''This is my new country. I can make everything happen here.''

HEADLINE: Thousands Turn Out, But Support Is Mixed Among City's Immigrants

BYLINE: By MICHELLE O'DONNELL; Reporting for this article was contributed by Ann Farmer, Kate Hammer, Jennifer Medina and Mick Meenan.

 BODY:
At his corner grocery on Coney Island Avenue in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, Tariq Asheik minded the store alone yesterday morning, having given his two Mexican employees the day off to join rallies in support of immigrant rights.
 ''I love immigrants,'' said Mr. Asheik, who is from Pakistan. ''Everyone's an immigrant here.''
Along the unusually quiet commercial strip, dozens of Hispanics and Pakistanis joined hands to form a human chain. 
 But up the street at his sign store, David Lanzman said he had no plans to close his business, despite the shuttering of other stores nearby in gestures of support. 
 ''Who's going to secure the store?'' said Mr. Lanzman, a Romanian who immigrated to the United States more than 30 years ago. ''Maybe I lose $1,000 or $2,000.''
 Across the New York region, thousands of people took part in demonstrations and an economic boycott called for by some immigration leaders and labor unions, culminating in a demonstration last evening by tens of thousands of people in Union Square in Manhattan. But despite the large turnout of Hispanics, there was far from uniform support for the rallies among all immigrant groups.
 The divide was visible in New York City, where immigrants from different countries live side by side. In Ditmas Park, the door to La Nueva Union, a Mexican bakery, was locked, while a nearby film developing shop, owned by a Pakistani man, remained open. 
 Denise Rodriguez, a Mexican immigrant who works as a maid, said she stayed home from work and kept her two young sons home from school yesterday to attend a rally. Education officials said attendance in city schools yesterday was down about 6 percent.
 In the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, which is home to large numbers of Hispanics and Asians, about 3,000 people, mostly Hispanic, turned out for a midday rally, although Asian-owned businesses largely remained open. That was to be expected, said Artemio Guerra, a rally organizer, who said legislation pending before Congress that would overhaul immigration law was a ''racial attack on Hispanics.'' 
 Some of the store closings and rallies took place at 12:16 p.m., a time chosen as a symbolic protest against the passage of the bill by the House of Representatives on Dec. 16 last year.
 One of the most visible demonstrators in Sunset Park was Sylvia Garcia, an immigrant from Mexico, who held a large hand-lettered sign reading, ''I lost my job to be here today.'' Ms. Garcia, 32, said she was dismissed from her job as a cashier at Cafe O in Midtown Manhattan, along with five co-workers, after attending the rally without being given the day off, an account confirmed by Patrick Lee, the manager. 
 ''They came last minute without a heads up,'' Mr. Lee, an immigrant from Korea, said yesterday as he worked a long day as cashier. ''I understand their situation, but I don't understand why she didn't give me a heads up.''
 In Jackson Heights, Queens, an area with a large Central and South American population, thousands of people poured onto 37th Avenue, waving flags and holding signs adorned with a red apple reading, ''I love immigrant New York!'' 
 In Albany, the State Assembly, controlled by Democrats, stopped business for the day to show support for the national rallies. Shortly after the session was called to order around 3 p.m., about two dozen Assembly members turned and walked out in silence. The Assembly adjourned several minutes later, without acting on any legislation.
 On Long Island, where the most visible pools of immigrant labor are the outdoor sites where Hispanic men and women gather to wait for daily work, the boycott appeared more uniform. 
 Along Willis Avenue in Roslyn, where a line of hundreds of Hispanic men awaiting work usually stretches for nearly a mile, there was no one yesterday, said the Rev. Allan B. Ramirez, an advocate for immigrants.
 ''It looked like the streets were abandoned,'' Mr. Ramirez said.


CORRECTION-DATE: May 5, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about divisions among immigrants in New York over the nationwide boycott in support of immigrants' legal status misidentified the Long Island location referred to by the Rev. Allan B. Ramirez, an advocate for immigrants, where Hispanic laborers awaiting work usually form a line nearly a mile long. It is on Grand Avenue in New Cassel. 
 The article also referred incorrectly to another Long Island site mentioned by Mr. Ramirez. It is a store in Roslyn Heights, not Roslyn, and it normally attracts smaller groups of laborers, not long lines. The street name at that point is Mineola Avenue, not Willis Avenue.

HEADLINE: Sense and Sandwiches 

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
The proletariat celebrated May Day by taking to the streets of America to demand lower wages. 
 That's effectively what immigrants across America were doing yesterday, at least according to the economists who believe that allowing more immigration would depress the wages of unskilled workers in America. If that's true, then the immigrants already working in low-paid jobs here will suffer if there's a surge of new arrivals.
Yet immigrants yesterday skipped work, boycotted stores and attended rallies to support freer immigration. Some are illegal immigrants who want Congress to legalize their status, but many of the protesters already have green cards. Why do they welcome new competitors for their jobs? 
 The clearest answers I've found come from the international panel of experts I consulted at the Sunrise Cafe, the deli near my office where I get tuna sandwiches. It's staffed by immigrants from five countries in Central America and South America. They offered a couple of explanations: one economic, one moral.
 They wonder, to begin with, if new immigrants are really much of an economic threat, and they're not alone in their skepticism. Although some economists calculate that immigrants have depressed wages for low-skilled workers by 8 percent, many others estimate the decline is only half that much. And others believe there's virtually no harm done, because businesses expand to create new jobs.
 To the extent that anyone's hurt by immigration, the burden falls not so much on the people complaining the loudest -- American-born workers -- but on the immigrants who are already here. The new immigrants have a harder time competing for jobs against English-speaking natives than against fellow immigrants. 
 Patricia Cortes of M.I.T. calculates that a 10 percent increase in immigration would reduce the wages of low-skilled natives by less than 1 percent, while causing an 8 percent reduction in the pay of the low-skilled immigrants already here. 
 Some of the immigrants at the Sunrise Cafe suspect that their wages might be affected, but they're still committed to the pro-immigration cause. Although they went to work yesterday, they vowed not to do any shopping, and most planned to go to a rally or march after work.
 They told me they didn't see themselves as activists marching for Latino civil rights or political power. They said they supported freer immigration not to help themselves -- they were already citizens or had green cards -- but simply to give others the same chance they'd had.
 ''People need to support their families,'' said one of the cashiers, Carmen Salcedo, who arrived three years ago from Panama. ''Here you can earn four times as much as you could earn in my country.''
 In between grilling sandwiches, Jorge Alvarez said he couldn't blame anyone for leaving El Salvador, as he had 19 years earlier. ''There are not enough good jobs there,'' he said. ''If people want to work hard, it's not fair to deny them the opportunity to come here.''
 The reasoning at the deli makes more sense than what I've been hearing from some intellectuals who want to restrict immigration in the name of social justice. Although more immigration may be a net benefit to the American economy, they've argued, it's not fair because it hurts low-income Americans and exacerbates the gap between rich and poor.
 But even if you accept the debatable economic premise that low-income workers are significantly harmed, the argument fails on moral grounds. It flunks the famous ''veil of ignorance'' test of John Rawls, the quintessential liberal philosopher who stressed protections for the least fortunate members of society. Social rules are fair, he wrote in ''A Theory of Justice,'' if you would endorse them without knowing what your position in society would be.
 Suppose you were setting immigration policy from behind that veil of ignorance. Which of these would you choose?
 (1) Restricting immigration to protect some of the lower-paid workers in America from a decline in wages that would be no more than 8 percent, if it occurred at all.
 (2) Expanding immigration to benefit most Americans while also giving some non-Americans living in dire poverty the chance to quadruple their income.
 You don't need to slog through ''A Theory of Justice'' to figure out this one. You can get the answer at the Sunrise Cafe -- and an excellent sandwich, too.

HEADLINE: They Are America

 BODY:
Warnings of a crippling immigrant boycott did not come true yesterday. The economy survived. But what may not survive -- we hope -- is people's willful misunderstanding of the nature of the immigrant-rights movement. 
 The worst among our citizens and politicians are eager to depict illegal immigrants as criminals, potential terrorists and alien invaders. But what we saw yesterday, in huge, peaceful rallies in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago, Denver, New York, Atlanta and other cities, were regular people: the same types of assimilation-minded moms, dads and children we wistfully romanticize on holidays devoted to, say, St. Patrick and Columbus.
 If these extraordinarily positive events were a protest of anything, it was the idea of the immigrant as temporary and unwelcome guest worker. The marches flew in the face of theories that undocumented workers want nothing but to labor unnoticed and separate from the nation that employs them to make its meals, trim its hedges and slaughter its beef. 
 These immigrants, weary of silent servitude, are speaking up and asking for something simple: a chance to work to become citizens, with all the obligations and opportunities that go with it. 
 Our lawmakers, to their discredit, have erected barriers within barriers, created legal hurdles and bureaucratic hoops, and dangled the opportunity for lowly guest-worker status without the citizenship to go with it. It is an invitation to create a society with a permanent underclass deprived of any ladder to something better. It is a path to creating a different, and lower, vision of our country and ourselves.
 It is not only the border-obsessed Minutemen who should be shamed by yesterday's joyous outpouring. Lawmakers who have stymied comprehensive immigration reform with stalemated name-calling and cold electoral calculation should listen up. A silent, shadow population is speaking with one voice. The message, aimed at Washington but something the whole country should hear, is clear: We are America. We want to join you. 
 It's a simple message. It should be sinking in by now.

HEADLINE: Judge Bars Subsidy Cuts In Adopting Foster Children 

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
A federal judge in Missouri yesterday blocked a state law that cut aid to parents adopting foster children, ruling that it violated federal statutes and the Constitution's equal protection clause. 
 The case had been watched by children's advocates nationally, who said the law, which passed last year as part of a broader effort to curb social spending, was a dangerous precedent that would undercut the adoption prospects of troubled children.
''We hope that this decision will stem efforts around the country to find inventive ways to cut budgets while harming voiceless populations,'' said Ira P. Lustbader, a lawyer with Children's Rights, a group in New York that joined in the case with local advocates and parents' groups. ''This law made no sense as a legal matter, as a policy matter or as an economic matter.'' 
 Gov. Matt Blunt, a Republican, had pushed the law, saying that adoption subsidies were spiraling out of control and that it made sense to focus money on the neediest parents. The governor did not issue a statement yesterday. 
 Hours after the ruling, by Judge Scott O. Wright of United States District Court in St. Louis, the state filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, a spokesman for the state attorney general's office, John Fougere, said. 
 The state said that such subsidies cost it $60 million a year and that the law would save it $12 million.
 Critics said that by discouraging adoptions the law would end up costing the state more over time in foster expenses and in later social costs, because so many former foster children end up homeless, with drug problems or in prison. 
 Finding permanent homes for foster children who cannot return to their biological parents is a national goal, backed up by federal, state and local subsidies for adoptive parents who are often taking on children with cognitive or medical disabilities. In Missouri, such payments can range from $225 to $650 a month, depending on needs for therapy or other special care. 
 The law required adoptive parents to reapply for subsidies annually, voiding contracts that had guaranteed aid to age 18. For a subgroup of parents, whose children were not covered by a federal program that bars means tests, it ended aid if the parents earned more than 200 percent of the poverty line, or $38,314 a year for a family of four. 
 In August, Judge Wright temporarily delayed invoking the law. After a one-day trial last week, he issued a permanent injunction yesterday, saying that the annual renewal of subsidy agreements violated federal law and that the means test was discriminatory because it applied just to a subgroup without rational justification. 
 ''The means test will not save taxpayer money, but will increase the overall cost of child welfare in the State of Missouri,'' he said. Several states have acted to curb adoption subsidies or eligibility, but the Missouri law went further than others by retroactively imposing means tests and other changes on parents who had adopted in the past. 
 Promoting the adoption of foster children who cannot return to their biological parents was a goal of federal laws passed in 1980 and 1997. Such adoptions have increased to 50,000 in recent years from 28,000 in 1996. 
 Related aid to parents has grown, reaching $4 billion last year, with half paid by the federal government, according to a study in the March issue of The Social Service Review. 
 The increasing costs have drawn the scrutiny of financially beleaguered states. 
 If a subsidy cut discourages adoptions, that is likely to prove shortsighted, said Richard P. Barth, a professor of social welfare at the University of North Carolina. Professor Barth is a co-author of the March study, which found that the public cost of supporting a child in the foster system tended to surpass significantly any adoption subsidies. 
 ''Our research shows that adoptive parents pay quite a substantial amount for services that their children need, and this is only partly offset by the subsidies they receive,'' Professor Barth said. ''These parents are taking on a substantial challenge and deserve the appreciation of the public.''

HEADLINE: Qatar Grants Millions in Aid to New Orleans

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The nation of Qatar plans to announce today roughly $60 million in grants to benefit the victims of Hurricane Katrina, including $17.5 million to Xavier University of Louisiana, the only historically black Catholic university in the United States.
 Other beneficiaries are Tulane University, Children's Hospital in New Orleans, Habitat for Humanity, Louisiana State University and the March of Dimes.
Nasser Bin Hamad M. al-Khalifa, Qatar's ambassador to the United States, said the remainder of the $100 million his country had pledged would be assigned in the coming months. 
 ''Hurricane Katrina was so devastating that everyone in Qatar and the rest of the world felt a responsibility to really act,'' Mr. Khalifa said. More than 50 countries donated money, expertise and materials, according to a tally by Foreign Policy, a magazine published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
 Qatar was one of several Persian Gulf nations to donate tens of millions of dollars. Saudi Arabia, for instance, gave more than $100 million, and the United Arab Emirates pledged $100 million.
 Poor nations also donated. Less than a year after the Indian Ocean tsunami engulfed it, Sri Lanka gave $25,000 to the American Red Cross. Bangladesh gave $1 million, Cyprus $50,000, Ghana $15,000 and the Dominican Republic $50,000.
 European countries tended to offer expertise, supplies and equipment instead of money. Denmark, for example, donated blankets, water purification units and first aid kits. 
 Many donor countries funneled their gifts through the State Department or other government agencies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for instance, used $66 million of foreign assistance to underwrite Katrina Aid Today, a consortium of nine religion-based and secular relief organizations led by the United Methodist Committee on Relief that is using the money to offer case management services to 100,000 families for two years.
 The Department of Education now controls $60 million donated by foreign governments that it said it would disburse to organizations to rebuild classrooms and libraries, buy books and maybe even pay teachers' salaries. 
 ''We want to give the money where it will have the greatest impact so the foreign governments can see how their funds are being used,'' said Valerie Smith, an Education Department spokeswoman.
 Countries also gave money to the American Red Cross and to the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund, the charity set up by former Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton.
 Qatar elected to distribute its money directly, rather than rely on an intermediary.
 Ambassador Khalifa said the country wanted to insure transparency and accountability.
 ''Our past experience is that while you can give to any organization or to a government,'' he said, ''you have no control over the money and then you discover the people most affected have not benefited.''
 To identify projects Qatar might want to support, the ambassador and his representatives talked to relief organizations, educators, members of Congress and other experts, and some embassy staff members traveled to the region.
 Mr. Khalifa also drafted former Secretary of State James A. Baker; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, dean of the business school at the University of California, Berkeley, and a former economic adviser to President Clinton; Lee Raymond, former chief executive of the Exxon Mobil Corporation; and John J. DeGioia, the president of Georgetown University, to serve as an advisory board. 
 Qatar is giving Xavier, which is in New Orleans, $12.5 million to add 60,000 square feet to its College of Pharmacy so it can increase enrollment. The gift has additional benefits, the ambassador said, because it will provide construction jobs and because students from the university work in community clinics.
 Xavier will also get $5 million for scholarships for students affected by the disaster.
 ''It's going to allow us to help those students to finish their educations,'' said Norman C. Francis, Xavier's president. ''That's important because Xavier is the No. 1 producer of African-American graduates in the natural sciences, and those students then go on to get admitted to medical school.''
 Tulane will receive $10 million to help undergraduate students from Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama who were affected by Hurricane Katrina, as well as students from those states entering the university next fall.
 ''The money will follow those students all the way through to graduation,'' said Scott S. Cowen, the university's president. ''We anticipate over four years it will support roughly 300 students.''
 Qatar's $5.3 million gift was the biggest Children's Hospital has ever received, said Steve Worley, its president. The hospital will use $5 million to establish the Qatar Cares Fund, which it will use to underwrite medical care for needy children whose families were affected by the hurricane. The remaining $351,000 will go toward restoring the two of the hospital's five primary care clinics that were left standing after the storm. 
 ''It's hard to know how to express our gratitude,'' Mr. Worley said.

HEADLINE: Thousands Denounce Fox On Labor Day In Mexico City

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. and ANTONIO BETANCOURT

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 1 

 BODY:
After weeks of rising tensions between the administration of President Vicente Fox and union leaders, tens of thousands of workers, Communists and revolutionaries thronged the center of Mexico City on Monday to send a message to the government: The unions are still here, and they are angry. 
 ''Fox, listen! The people are up in arms,'' members of the electricians union chanted as they marched from the Monument of the Revolution to the Zocalo, or central square. ''From north to south, from east to west, we will win this fight, no matter what the cost.'' 
More than 90,000 workers turned out for the May 1 labor marches, which in recent years have been quiet affairs. Some called for the labor secretary to resign, others complained that the Fox administration's free-trade policies had failed to lift up the working class. 
 Small groups of protesters called on Mexicans to boycott American companies like Wal-Mart and Coca-Cola as an act of solidarity with their countrymen living illegally in the United States on a day on which many immigrants in the United States participated in a one-day work boycott. 
 After the union marches, the leader of the Zapatista rebels, Subcommander Marcos, wearing his signature ski mask and appearing here for the first time since 2001, led students, rural workers, Communists, anarchists and other leftists from the American Embassy to the Zocalo.
 Union members said Monday that relations between organized labor and the government had hit a new low. Most complained that their economic condition had not improved much under Mr. Fox's tenure.
 ''The rich are richer and the poor, we are poorer,'' said Arturo Sierra, 38, an electrician. ''The government has taken it upon itself to deliver the country to foreign governments and to the rich Mexicans, who continue exploiting workers with miserable salaries.''
 President Fox skipped the festivities, which he has always attended in the past. Instead, he held a small celebration at his residence, where he emphasized the importance of unions acting within the law.
 Mr. Fox has been locked in a struggle with Napoleon Gomez Urrutia, the leader of the national union of mine and metal workers, since 65 coal miners died in a mining disaster in Coahuila in February. The discord has divided the union movement and led to violence.
 Francisco Hernandez Juarez, the leader of the National Workers Union, an independent umbrella group, has charged the government with meddling in union affairs by trying to oust Mr. Gomez and replace him with a less combative leader, Elias Morales.
 Supporters of Mr. Gomez have continued to carry out wildcat job actions. Two weeks ago, federal and state police officers stormed a steel plant in Michoacan, where miners loyal to Mr. Gomez had gone on strike. Two miners died, drawing protests from union leaders across the country.
 The strike at the steel plant was illegal, Mr. Fox said Monday in remarks at his home, because the workers had no labor dispute with the owners but only wanted to flex their muscles to help Mr. Gomez.
 ''Mexico needs unions that defend their legitimate interests within the framework of the law and respect for the law,'' he said.
 The marches drew a variety of people with complaints against the government. 
 A group of naked men and women lined part of Paseo del la Reforma, the city's main boulevard, to call attention to what they said was the Fox administration's failure to honor agreements with farmers in rural Veracruz.
 College students, maintaining that free-trade policies harm workers, spoke out against globalization. Two carried a banner that depicted President Bush as a cannibal and called his government ''troglodyte.''
 Mr. Marcos lambasted the Bush administration in a speech in front of the American Embassy, while his supporters shouted, ''Zapata lives, the struggle continues!'' He accused the Bush administration of having ''sown death and destruction throughout the world'' and of spreading a ''religion of neoliberalism'' that holds dear ''the maximum profit at whatever cost.''
 ''The Bush government has managed in just a few years to make the American flag for most inhabitants of this planet a symbol of plunder, authoritarianism, destruction, obligation, contempt and death,'' he said.
 Mr. Marcos has been touring the country trying to drum up support for a new Marxist movement. But the number of supporters who turned out Monday was smaller than in the past.

HEADLINE: The Circle of Crude

 BODY:
The public derision of Republicans' idea for a $100 gasoline rebate has focused on the desperate political pandering embodied in the proposal. But there's another view that makes it seem even worse. Consider the China angle.
 With the nation already deeply in debt -- and with Congress angling this week to cut taxes for affluent investors by more than $20 billion -- lawmakers would need to borrow $10 billion to make the rebates happen. Since more than 80 percent of the immense borrowing of the Bush years has been from foreigners, it's safe to assume that most of the rebates would be courtesy of foreign lenders, of which China has been one of the most willing.
It's the circle of crude: China's competition for the world's oil is pushing up prices. Congress piles on more debt to calm angry consumers with a rebate. The increased debt is a prescription for a weaker dollar, which in turn would make imports, including oil, even more expensive. 
 The United States' huge -- and growing -- foreign indebtedness and its refusal to curb its appetite for oil risk eroding its position in the world, at precisely the moment when it needs to use its leverage as the world's dominant power to manage the extraordinary repercussions that will come with China's growth. Energy prices and the effect on global warming are only the beginning. China's demand for other natural resources poses new dangers as well, as The Times's report last week on China's planned leveling of the Indonesian tropical forests attests. 
 The United States can't, and shouldn't, try to curb China's economic progress, or the appetite of Chinese consumers for the good things in life. But dealing with the effects will require strong and savvy diplomacy. President Bush blew the chance to make that point -- to Americans and the Chinese -- during the recent visit of China's president, Hu Jintao. Then last week, as Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader, was dreaming up his $100 rebate plan, President Hu moved on to Africa. He exchanged warm hugs with Nigeria's president, Olusegun Obasanjo, and signed a deal to buy a big share of a major oil field in Nigeria. A few days later, in Kenya, he banged happily on a traditional drum at the welcoming ceremony, and then proceeded to sign a deal that will allow China to explore for oil off the coast of Kenya. 
 The United States' outsized needs for the same resources that China covets, plus its need to borrow from China and other countries, diminish its influence with countries whose importance goes beyond that of their oil wells. Nigeria, the United States' fifth-largest oil supplier, is also important to American counterterrorism efforts, especially in the strategically important Gulf of Guinea. Kenya is also important in the fight against terror because its location on the Horn of Africa has made it both a training ground and a way station for terrorists.
 Both countries are rife with corruption that the United States has been trying to help mitigate, in hopes of more stable economic relations and of a safer, more humane world. But America's laudable goals are, at best, wishful thinking -- at worst, propaganda -- unless the United States develops energy and fiscal policies that will allow it the maneuverability it needs to balance China's deepening ties not only with places like Nigeria and Kenya, but also with Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Indonesia, Myanmar and so on, as global competition continues unabated. 
 Unfortunately, as of now, the level of America's response to this new challenge has been embodied in that pathetic recipe: borrow money from the Chinese central bank, and use it to give every voter $100 to buy more gas. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 13, 2006

 CORRECTION:
Clarification: A May 2 editorial, ''Circle of Crude,'' had an incomplete description of the effects of a weaker dollar. When it comes to oil, the impact is indirect because the international price of oil is set in United States dollars. But a weak dollar makes oil relatively cheaper in other countries, a change that could drive up international demand and raise the price over all

HEADLINE: For Science's Gatekeepers, a Credibility Gap

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

 BODY:
Recent disclosures of fraudulent or flawed studies in medical and scientific journals have called into question as never before the merits of their peer-review system.
 The system is based on journals inviting independent experts to critique submitted manuscripts. The stated aim is to weed out sloppy and bad research, ensuring the integrity of the what it has published.
Because findings published in peer-reviewed journals affect patient care, public policy and the authors' academic promotions, journal editors contend that new scientific information should be published in a peer-reviewed journal before it is presented to doctors and the public.
 That message, however, has created a widespread misimpression that passing peer review is the scientific equivalent of the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. 
 Virtually every major scientific and medical journal has been humbled recently by publishing findings that are later discredited. The flurry of episodes has led many people to ask why authors, editors and independent expert reviewers all failed to detect the problems before publication.
 The publication process is complex. Many factors can allow error, even fraud, to slip through. They include economic pressures for journals to avoid investigating suspected errors; the desire to avoid displeasing the authors and the experts who review manuscripts; and the fear that angry scientists will withhold the manuscripts that are the lifeline of the journals, putting them out of business.By promoting the sanctity of peer review and using it to justify a number of their actions in recent years, journals have added to their enormous power.
 The release of news about scientific and medical findings is among the most tightly managed in country. Journals control when the public learns about findings from taxpayer-supported research by setting dates when the research can be published. They also impose severe restrictions on what authors can say publicly, even before they submit a manuscript, and they have penalized authors for infractions by refusing to publish their papers. Exceptions are made for scientific meetings and health emergencies. 
 But many authors have still withheld information for fear that journals would pull their papers for an infraction. Increasingly, journals and authors' institutions also send out news releases ahead of time about a peer-reviewed discovery so that reports from news organizations coincide with a journal's date of issue. 
 A barrage of news reports can follow. But often the news release is sent without the full paper, so reports may be based only on the spin created by a journal or an institution.
 Journal editors say publicity about corrections and retractions distorts and erodes confidence in science, which is an honorable business. Editors also say they are gatekeepers, not detectives, and that even though peer review is not intended to detect fraud, it catches flawed research and improves the quality of the thousands of published papers.
 However, even the system's most ardent supporters acknowledge that peer review does not eliminate mediocre and inferior papers and has never passed the very test for which it is used. Studies have found that journals publish findings based on sloppy statistics. If peer review were a drug, it would never be marketed, say critics, including journal editors.
 None of the recent flawed studies have been as humiliating as an article in 1972 in the journal Pediatrics that labeled sudden infant death syndrome a hereditary disorder, when, in the case examined, the real cause was murder. 
 Twenty-three years later, the mother was convicted of smothering her five children. Scientific naivete surely contributed to the false conclusion, but a forensic pathologist was not one of the reviewers. The faulty research in part prompted the National Institutes of Health to spend millions of dollars on a wrong line of research. 
 Fraud, flawed articles and corrections have haunted general interest news organizations. But such problems are far more embarrassing for scientific journals because of their claims for the superiority of their system of editing.
 A widespread belief among nonscientists is that journal editors and their reviewers check authors' research firsthand and even repeat the research. In fact, journal editors do not routinely examine authors' scientific notebooks. Instead, they rely on peer reviewers' criticisms, which are based on the information submitted by the authors. 
 While editors and reviewers may ask authors for more information, journals and their invited experts examine raw data only under the most unusual circumstances.
 In that respect, journal editors are like newspaper editors, who check the content of reporters' copy for facts and internal inconsistencies but generally not their notes. Still, journal editors have refused to call peer review what many others say it is -- a form of vetting or technical editing.
 In spot checks, many scientists and nonscientists said they believed that editors decided what to publish by counting reviewers' votes. But journal editors say that they are not tally clerks and that decisions to publish are theirs, not the reviewers'. 
 Editors say they have accepted a number of papers that reviewers have harshly criticized as unworthy of publication and have rejected many that received high plaudits.
 Many nonscientists perceive reviewers to be impartial. But the reviewers, called independent experts, in fact are often competitors of the authors of the papers they scrutinize, raising potential conflicts of interest.
 Except when gaffes are publicized, there is little scrutiny of the quality of what journals publish.
 Journals have rejected calls to make the process scientific by conducting random audits like those used to monitor quality control in medicine. The costs and the potential for creating distrust are the most commonly cited reasons for not auditing.
 In defending themselves, journal editors often shift blame to the authors and excuse themselves and their peer reviewers.
 Journals seldom investigate frauds that they have published, contending that they are not investigative bodies and that they could not afford the costs. Instead, the journals say that the investigations are up to the accused authors' employers and agencies that financed the research.
 Editors also insist that science corrects its errors. But corrections often require whistle-blowers or prodding by lawyers. Editors at The New England Journal of Medicine said they would not have learned about a problem that led them to publish two letters of concern about omission of data concerning the arthritis drug Vioxx unless lawyers for the drug's manufacturer, Merck, had asked them questions in depositions. Fraud has also slipped through in part because editors have long been loath to question the authors.
 ''A request from an editor for primary data to support the honesty of an author's findings in a manuscript under review would probably poison the air and make civil discourse between authors and editors even more difficult than it is now,'' Dr. Arnold S. Relman wrote in 1983. At the time, he was editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, and it had published a fraudulent paper. 
 Fraud is a substantial problem, and the attitude toward it has changed little over the years, other editors say. Some journals fail to retract known cases of fraud for fear of lawsuits.
 Journals have no widely accepted way to retract papers, said Donald Kennedy, editor in chief of Science, after the it retracted two papers by the South Korean researcher Dr. Hwang Woo Suk, who fabricated evidence that he had cloned human cells.
 In the April 18 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine, its editor, Dr. Harold C. Sox, wrote about lessons learned after the journal retracted an article on menopause by Dr. Eric Poehlman of the University of Vermont.
 When an author is found to have fabricated data in one paper, scientists rarely examine all of that author's publications, so the scientific literature may be more polluted than believed, Dr. Sox said.
 Dr. Sox and other scientists have documented that invalid work is not effectively purged from the scientific literature because the authors of new papers continue to cite retracted ones.
 When journals try to retract discredited papers, Dr. Sox said, the process is slow, and the system used to inform readers faulty. Authors often use euphemisms instead of the words ''fabrication'' or ''research misconduct,'' and finding published retractions can be costly because some affected journals charge readers a fee to visit their Web sites to learn about them, Dr. Sox said.
 Despite its flaws, scientists favor the system in part because they need to publish or perish. The institutions where the scientists work and the private and government agencies that pay for their grants seek publicity in their eagerness to show financial backers results for their efforts.
 The public and many scientists tend to overlook the journals' economic benefits that stem from linking their embargo policies to peer review. Some journals are owned by private for-profit companies, while others are owned by professional societies that rely on income from the journals. The costs of running journals are low because authors and reviewers are generally not paid.
 A few journals that not long ago measured profits in the tens of thousands of dollars a year now make millions, according to at least three editors who agreed to discuss finances only if granted anonymity, because they were not authorized to speak about finances.
 Any influential system that profits from taxpayer-financed research should be held publicly accountable for how the revenues are spent. Journals generally decline to disclose such data.
 Although editors of some journals say they demand statements from their editing staff members that they have no financial conflicts of interest, there is no way to be sure. At least one editor of a leading American journal had to resign because of conflicts of interest with industry.
 Journals have devolved into information-laundering operations for the pharmaceutical industry, say Dr. Richard Smith, the former editor of BMJ, the British medical journal, and Dr. Richard Horton, the editor of The Lancet, also based in Britain. 
 The journals rely on revenues from industry advertisements. But because journals also profit handsomely by selling drug companies reprints of articles reporting findings from large clinical trials involving their products, editors may ''face a frighteningly stark conflict of interest'' in deciding whether to publish such a study, Dr. Smith said.

HEADLINE: An Online Game's Economy Yields A.T.M. Dollars

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL

 BODY:
When you put your card into an automated teller machine, view your balance on the screen and then receive money from the dispenser, you probably understand that a merely electronic notion -- your bank account -- is being translated into a physical object with value: greenbacks.
 But what if you are at the corner A.T.M. and your net worth is locked up in an imaginary asteroid mining venture? 
Until now you would be plumb out of luck. But today the makers of Entropia Universe, a popular online science-fiction game, plan to introduce a real-world A.T.M. card that will allow players instantly to withdraw hard cash automatically converted from their virtual game treasury. So a player with, say, 2,000 spare P.E.D.'s (Project Entropia Dollars) left over after purchasing a new laser rifle in the game could withdraw $200 and take a date to a real-life ballgame.
 With around 250,000 players, Entropia is the leader of a small but growing group of online computer games with virtual economies explicitly based on real-world money, and today's announcement is the most ambitious step yet to meld an in-game economy with the real global financial system.
 The game's maker, MindArk, based in Gothenburg, Sweden, estimates that Entropia players generated $165 million (or 1.65 billion P.E.D.'s) in total economic activity last year. Since the game's inception in 2003, it has been relatively simple for players to add money to their Entropia accounts via credit card or electronic bank transfer. But until now withdrawing money from the system was a cumbersome affair that could take months, as MindArk employees manually verified that the player's virtual fortune had been earned legitimately (and not by hacking). 
 ''We want this game to be a full second reality,'' Jan Welter, MindArk's chief executive, said in a telephone interview. ''We want you to be able to have fun, make friends, make a business, enjoy music and art and do it in our game. The A.T.M. card is a big step toward bringing people into our world because they can have comfort that they can access their virtual funds immediately.''
 In most mainstream online games, like the spectacularly popular World of Warcraft, spending real money for virtual items is not only against the rules but also considered the worst sort of louche behavior, like paying for sex. But in Entropia, the entire game system is based on the fact that 10 P.E.D.'s equal a dollar and that the game's virtual items and assets have real-world value.
 For instance Jon Jacobs, known online as Neverdie, a 39-year-old Entropia player in Miami Beach, last year sold almost everything he owned (real and virtual) to scratch together $100,000 (1 million P.E.D.'s) to buy a huge space station in the game. By selling apartments and storefronts to other players and by imposing taxes on players' hunting and mining on his real estate, he is now making about $12,000 a month on his investment, he estimates. And his big nightclub is still under construction.
 ''The A.T.M. card is a huge step forward because it's all about making the experience more immersive, and now that we know we have easy access to our money, it's going to give people even more confidence in the system,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''Among the higher echelon of players we're moving money around big time. Like when I'm upgrading my resort, and I want to buy a new creature for people to hunt, we're talking about $1,500 or $5,000. 
 ''People are spending $10,000 for land that's not even prime property. Now people are hunting in my resort, and I can take money out and go buy a real dinner. That's fantastic.''
 Mr. Welter said that MindArk software engineers had been working on the A.T.M. project for years, and that they had finally developed a system secure enough to allow instant verification and cash authorization. He said his company was in contact with the Swedish government, and that systems were in place to prevent money laundering and other potential abuses.
 ''We have ways of detecting abnormal fluctuations between players and so on, and if this would happen, we would know about it,'' Mr. Welter said.
 He said that MindArk had never been asked about the game by the Internal Revenue Service or United States law-enforcement agencies.

HEADLINE: Turmoil in Asia Doesn't Dent Investors' Enthusiasm for Its Markets 

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, May 1 

 BODY:
There was a time when coup threats and constitutional crises were turnoffs to foreign investors considering emerging markets. 
 These days it seems no amount of turmoil can deter them. In Thailand, despite huge street demonstrations, foreign investors have poured $2.7 billion into the stock market so far in 2006, the biggest inflow of overseas funds in more than five years. Even when the prime minister resigned in early April, another $552 million rolled in that week. The deluge of funds has helped Thailand's benchmark stock index edge up more than 7 percent. Its currency, the baht, is up about 9 percent against the United States dollar so far this year. In the Philippines, the president is facing protests and accusations of corruption after warning in February that elements of the military were planning a coup d'etat. Yet foreign purchases of Philippine stocks are at five-year highs, the benchmark index is up 3.4 percent and the Philippine peso has appreciated about 8 percent. To some extent, this remarkable sangfroid with regard to Southeast Asia stems from a faith that political turmoil is not undermining economic growth. But economists and analysts say there is a bigger factor: a glut of global savings that is making cheap capital available to both heavily indebted rich economies and riskier developing countries. The resulting avalanche of global investment capital has become largely impervious, they say, to the political risks that often buffet Southeast Asia's accident-prone economies. 
''Globally there's too much money chasing too few profits,'' said Sean Darby, regional equity strategist at Nomura International in Hong Kong. ''Risk appetite remains exceedingly high.''
 Economists are divided as to how long this situation can last, or what might cause its end. But most economists agree that what they call the mispricing of risk is unsustainable, since it helps create asset-price bubbles -- and their inevitable and very costly collapses. Some even point to the global boom in housing prices as a manifestation of this problem. Underlying this global liquidity bubble, as economists refer to it, are the divergent savings habits in Asia and the United States and the politically contentious trade gap it has created. In general, Americans save very little. Asians save a lot, creating what Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, has called an Asian savings glut. In February, the Commerce Department reported that the American household savings rate had fallen to nearly zero, the lowest since the Depression. Economists differ on the importance of such figures, since United States figures do not account for property or stockholdings. But few disagree that Asians still tend to set more aside for a rainy day. In Japan and Korea, rates have been falling, but households still manage to save at least 2.5 percent of their incomes. 
 In contrast, savings are higher in poorer countries where prospects are less uncertain. Economists estimate that the average Chinese household saves about one-third of its income. Indian households save about a quarter of their incomes. 
 The flood of dollars to Asia would under normal circumstances push up the value of Asian currencies, raising the price of Asian goods in dollars and gradually reducing the ability of Americans to keep buying them. But central bankers in Asia, which has long depended on exports for economic development, then need to put those earnings to work and maintain a stable currency. 
 They do that by buying safe investments like Treasury bonds, and that keeps their currencies from rising while lending Washington the money to finance the deficits and allowing American consumers to continue buying Toyotas and Samsung TV's and Chinese-made textiles. That is why some countries like China have gone so far as to fix the value of the currency to the United States dollar.
 Economists say the gusher of global funds became a torrent after 9/11, when the Fed and other central bankers from the Group of 7 industrialized nations steered interest rates lower in response to a growing global recession and fears of deflation.
 With long-term United States bond yields barely higher than short-term yields, investors looking for higher returns have had to head abroad into markets considered riskier than United States bonds or stocks. 
 ''This is the story that's been driving Asia for the last couple of years -- this hunt for global yield,'' said Nicholas Bibby, an associate director at Barclays Capital in Singapore. 
 While precise figures are not available, Barclays estimates that Asia has received roughly $670 billion in net capital inflows since 2001, including $42.2 billion so far this year. That does not include the earnings Asia generates from exports.
 Where once Southeast Asian markets received funds largely from Asian banks or international mutual funds specializing in the region, analysts say these days that hedge funds and pension funds are increasingly dabbling in the region's securities. 
 And the money is coming not only from America. A rapidly growing private banking industry has emerged in Asia to service the appetite for risk among the new rich being created by China's rise. Record oil prices have created a flood of petrodollars from the Middle East in search of investments. And Japan's own banks and brokerage firms have long been venturing out in search of returns for their depositors and clients since the country's central bank set rates effectively at zero in an effort to jump-start the economy and stave off deflation.
 Thus, even as local investors ship their cash out of Indonesia, foreigners continue to pump funds back in, buying $570 million in Indonesian stocks this year, pushing the Indonesian rupiah up 9 percent and the benchmark stock index up 17 percent. That is small change compared with India, where foreign investors have bought $4.1 billion in equities this year. Foreign buying in Vietnam's still tiny stock market has helped make it the world's best-performing market so far in 2006 with a gain of 77 percent.
 To be sure, most analysts agree that Asian markets remain attractive and that despite the influx of funds, stock prices remain low relative to average corporate earnings. Their economies, moreover, depend heavily on agriculture and global demand for their electronics exports, and domestic political disruptions are likely to have little effect on them. ''Industry and exports will continue to roll on,'' said Chua Hak Bin, senior regional economist at DBS Bank in Singapore. 
 Some fear that financial trends are poised to reverse the situation. Some economists say that the recent plunge in Iceland's currency and stock prices portends a worldwide retreat by Japanese funds in the aftermath of the Bank of Japan's decision to end what was essentially no-interest financing. Others say continued low interest rates in Japan will preserve this so-called yen carry trade -- in which lenders borrow at low Japanese interest rate and lend at higher rates abroad -- and that China's decision last month to begin allowing its own savers to begin investing abroad will only expand the amount of money sweeping global markets.
 One thing is sure, economists say: Financial risk has become mispriced. Perhaps the best evidence is in Asia's bond markets, where the cost to borrow for governments has been steadily declining. In part, economists say, this reflects how steady capital inflows are improving government finances. But more and more, so much cash is available that it has become a borrower's market. Governments in Indonesia or the Philippines are now selling 10-year bonds that offer investors an interest rate only about two percentage points higher than bonds issued by the United States government, which are considered the most risk-free investment in the world. 
 ''Risk?'' said James McCormack, head of Asian sovereign ratings at Fitch Ratings in Hong Kong. ''No one talks about it anymore. It's a bad word.''

HEADLINE: Defense Presses Police Informer About His Job

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
The paid police informer who is the central witness at the trial of a Pakistani immigrant charged with plotting to blow up the Herald Square subway station testified yesterday that he collected a wide range of information on his visits to two city mosques, from the tenor of the sermons to how many people attended the services.
 The informer, Osama Eldawoody, 50, secretly recorded roughly two dozen conversations about the plot with the immigrant, Shahawar Matin Siraj, in the summer of 2004 -- many of them incriminating. He was questioned by Mr. Siraj's lawyer about the information he provided to the police on his frequent visits to mosques in Brooklyn and Staten Island. The visits occurred over roughly 13 months in 2003 and 2004, both before and after the informer met Mr. Siraj. 
Regardless of the outcome of the trial for Mr. Siraj, 23, who faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, Mr. Eldawoody's testimony is shedding light on what seem to be new police tactics to uncover terrorist plots before they come to fruition. While a federal judge gave the police expanded powers in 2003, critics have nonetheless raised objections to the use of informers in places of worship, political events and other gatherings. 
 Mr. Eldawoody had earlier testified that he had been told to keep ''his eyes and ears open for any radical thing,'' but many of the details that came out during questioning seemed mundane: How many people attended a service. How long it lasted. The name of the imam who spoke.
 A frequent phrase in the reports he made to the police was, ''the service was religious in nature.''
 What he reported sometimes seemed like small talk among worshipers. For example, pressed by one of Mr. Siraj's lawyers to explain what one report, about a man who discussed opening a new mosque on Staten Island, had to do with radicals, Mr. Eldawoody replied, ''He doesn't have to be bad or good -- I report it -- he doesn't have to be a terrorist to report it. I report what happens and what I saw and what I heard.''
 Earlier in the day, prosecutors concluded their questioning of Mr. Eldawoody by playing a 45-minute videotape for jurors showing Mr. Siraj agreeing to guide a bomber into the subway station and to point out where he should plant backpack bombs. But he said he did not want to place the bombs himself, stressing he wanted to cause only economic damage. He also said he had to ask his mother first.
 ''I will work with those brothers, that's it,'' he said. ''As a planner or whatever. But to putting there? I'm not sure.''
 Although Mr. Siraj was captured on the recordings talking about his plan to blow up the subway station, his lawyers contend that the young man, who came to New York from Karachi, Pakistan, in 1999 with his parents, was duped by the informer, who was motivated by the nearly $100,000 paid to him by the Police Department over about three years.
 Yesterday, one of Mr. Siraj's lawyers, Martin R. Stolar, appeared to be trying to highlight the Police Department's tactics as he cross-examined Mr. Eldawoody for several hours, questioning him on his recollections about the information he gave to the intelligence division detective who was his handler, including details about his visits to the al-Noor mosque on Staten Island and the Islamic Society of Bay Ridge in Brooklyn.
 Using reports filed by the detective, which were piled roughly two inches high on a table beside him, Mr. Stolar asked the witness about his registration as a paid informer in July 2003 and questioned him about each mosque visit. Sometimes there were several visits in one day.
 Mr. Stolar questioned him about the documents filed by the detective, Stephen Andrews -- which reflected information Mr. Eldawoody had provided, by telephone or in person -- asking if he recalled making the reports.
 At one point, Mr. Stolar asked about a report indicating that he had told the detective that the imam of the Staten Island mosque was looking for a new house in New Jersey. Mr. Eldawoody said that he did not recall giving that information.
 At another, the lawyer asked about a report suggesting Mr. Eldawoody had suspicions about a man named Maher, who was looking for foreclosure properties to buy. Mr. Eldawoody said he did not remember that. 
 And he asked about Mr. Eldawoody's reasons for reporting another conversation: ''How did the fact that somebody wanted to open a new mosque on Staten Island relate to the mission that you thought you were doing, which was looking for violent jihad or radical talk?''
 Under questioning by prosecutors last week, Mr. Eldawoody, a nuclear engineer who became a naturalized citizen after coming to America in 1986, said he began working as an informer to protect his new country.
 Mr. Stolar, who has suggested that Mr. Eldawoody's motive was financial, asked the witness if he was spying in the mosque.
 ''I don't see it that way -- that I was spying,'' he said. ''If there is anything wrong that would hurt the United States, I would be the one to defend the country.''
 Mr. Stolar has said he intends to put the Police Department's tactics on trial, and at the beginning of his cross-examination, which he said would last several days, he suggested that he would focus closely on Mr. Eldawoody's actions and how the department supervised him.
 At one point, he questioned the witness about a report that indicated that he had written down the license plate numbers of worshipers at a mosque.
 ''I was asked to do that,'' Mr. Eldawoody replied.
 ''Who asked you?'' Mr. Stolar said.
 ''The detective,'' he said.
 ''He told you to go out and write down the license plates of people who attended services?'' the lawyer asked.
 ''Yes,'' Mr. Eldawoody replied.

HEADLINE: Finances of Social Security And Medicare Deteriorate 

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1 

 BODY:
The financial condition of Medicare and Social Security deteriorated in the last year, the Bush administration reported Monday, and it warned again that the programs were unsustainable in their current form.
 Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund, a widely watched gauge of the program's solvency, will run out of money in 2018, two years earlier than projected in last year's report, the trustees said.
And the Social Security trust fund will be exhausted in 2040, one year earlier than projected last year, the trustees said. At that point, in 2040, Social Security tax collections would be adequate to pay only 74 percent of scheduled benefits. 
 Lawmakers said they would never allow the trust funds to run dry. But the insolvency dates are a vivid way of showing that the programs are unsustainable. To keep them solvent, Congress would need to trim benefits, raise taxes or take some combination of such steps.
 ''The systems are going broke,'' President Bush said Monday in a speech to the American Hospital Association.
 Almost every element of the programs reflects a political judgment, but Mr. Bush said, ''It's time to set aside politics and restructure Social Security and Medicare for generations to come.''
 Republicans and Democrats seized on the reports to renew the political battle over Social Security and Medicare, with an eye to Congressional elections this fall. 
 The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said the reports showed that ''despite White House scare tactics, Social Security remains sound for decades to come.'' Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said the administration had worsened Medicare's problems by promoting managed-care plans, which he said often ''cost more than traditional Medicare.''
 The administration urged Congress to approve the president's proposals to slow the growth of Medicare by curbing payments to hospitals. Under current law, the trustees said, doctors already face a cut of 4.7 percent or more in Medicare fees in each of the next nine years.
 The trustees' reports are authoritative documents prepared by career civil servants, mainly actuaries, and are full of data used as a basis for policy making and political debate.
 In the report on Medicare, the Bush administration reduced its estimates of the number of people who would sign up for the new prescription drug benefit.
 The trustees now predict that 31.4 million people will have signed up for the drug benefit by the end of the initial enrollment period in two weeks, and that monthly enrollment for 2006 will average 29.2 million, down from an estimate of 39 million published in last year's report. 
 Likewise, the administration now predicts enrollment of 34 million for 2007, down from an estimate of 39.8 million in last year's report.
 Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said Medicare's financial problems were more severe than those of Social Security because of ''steady large increases in underlying health care costs.''
 The new report estimates that the basic Medicare premium -- what a beneficiary pays for coverage of doctors' services and other outpatient care -- will be higher than predicted last year. The premium has increased more than 50 percent in the last three years, to $88.50 a month, from $58.70 in 2003, and the Bush administration predicts that it will rise to $98.20 next year.
 By contrast, in last year's report, the administration predicted that the basic 2007 premium would be $87.70.
 But the average premiums for drug coverage are lower than expected: $32.20 this year and $35.86 in 2007. The comparable figures in last year's report were $37.37 and $41.22.
 The administration lowered its estimate of the cost of the drug benefit for the period from 2006 to 2014. The administration now puts the cost at $872 billion, down from $1.1 trillion last year. (The figures do not reflect premiums paid by beneficiaries or compulsory payments by states to help defray the costs.)
 In a joint statement, the public trustees of the two programs, John L. Palmer and Thomas R. Saving, said the projected costs of the drug benefit were ''significantly lower than those in the 2005 report due to recent slower growth in overall prescription drug spending and lower enrollment in stand-alone prescription drug plans than was expected a year ago.''
 Still, the administration said, the cost of the drug benefit will grow an average of 11.5 percent a year in the next decade, more than twice as fast as the economy.

HEADLINE: Immigrants Take to U.S. Streets in Show of Strength

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Reporting for this article was contributed by Cindy Chang from Los Angeles, Steve Friess from Las Vegas, Carolyn Marshall from Watsonville, Calif., and Gretchen Ruethling from Chicago.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 1 

 BODY:
Hundreds of thousands of immigrants and their supporters skipped work, school and shopping on Monday and marched in dozens of cities from coast to coast. 
 The demonstrations did not bring the nation to a halt as planned by some organizers, though they did cause some disruptions and conveyed in peaceful but sometimes boisterous ways the resolve of those who favor loosening the country's laws on immigration.
Originally billed as a nationwide economic boycott under the banner "Day Without an Immigrant," the day evolved into a sweeping round of protests intended to influence the debate in Congress over granting legal status to all or most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country. 
 The protesters, a mix of illegal immigrants and legal residents and citizens, were mostly Latino, but in contrast to similar demonstrations in the past two months, large numbers of people of other ethnicities joined or endorsed many of the events. In some cases, the rallies took on a broader tone of social action, as gay rights advocates, opponents of the war in Iraq and others without a direct stake in the immigration debate took to the streets. 
 "I think it's only fair that I speak up for those who can't speak for themselves," said Aimee Hernandez, 28, one of an estimated 400,000 people who turned out in Chicago, the site of one of the largest demonstrations. "I think we're just too many that you can't just send them back. How are you going to ignore these people?"
 But among those who favor stricter controls on illegal immigration, the protests hardly impressed.
 "When the rule of law is dictated by a mob of illegal aliens taking to the streets, especially under a foreign flag, then that means the nation is not governed by a rule of law -- it is a mobocracy," Jim Gilchrist, a founder of the Minutemen Project, a volunteer group that patrols the United States-Mexico border, said in an interview.
 While the boycott, an idea born several months ago among a small group of grass-roots immigration advocates here, may not have shut down the country, it was strongly felt in a variety of places, particularly those with large Latino populations.
 Stores and restaurants in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York closed because workers did not show up or as a display of solidarity with demonstrators. In Los Angeles, the police estimated that more than half a million people attended two demonstrations in and near downtown. School districts in several cities reported a decline in attendance; at Benito Juarez High School in Pilsen, a predominantly Latino neighborhood in Chicago, only 17 percent of the students showed up, even though administrators and some protest organizers had urged students to stay in school.
 Lettuce, tomatoes and grapes went unpicked in fields in California and Arizona, which contribute more than half the nation's produce, as scores of growers let workers take the day off. Truckers who move 70 percent of the goods in ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., did not work.
 Meatpacking companies, including Tyson Foods and Cargill, closed plants in the Midwest and the West employing more than 20,000 people, while the flower and produce markets in downtown Los Angeles stood largely and eerily empty.
 Israel Banuelos, 23, and more than 50 of his colleagues skipped work, with the grudging acceptance of his employer, an industrial paint plant in Hollister, Calif.
 "We were supposed to work," Mr. Banuelos said, "but we wanted to close down the company. Our boss didn't like it money-wise."
 The economic impact of the day's events was hard to gauge, though economists expected a one-day stoppage to have little long-term effect. In large swaths of the country, life went on with no noticeable difference. But protesters in numerous cities, many clad in white and waving mostly American flags in response to complaints that earlier rallies featured too many Latin American ones, declared victory as chanting throngs shut down streets. 
 Most of the demonstrators' ire was directed at a bill passed by the House that would increase security at the border while making it a felony for an illegal immigrant to be in the country or to aid one. The marchers generally favored a plan in the Senate, for which President Bush has shown signs of support, that would include more protection at the border but offer many illegal workers a path to citizenship.
 Still, the divide among advocates over the value and effectiveness of a boycott resulted in some cities, including Los Angeles and San Diego, playing host to two sizable demonstrations, one organized by boycotters and the other by people neutral or opposed to it.
 That split played out across the country. While many business owners warned employees about taking the day off, many others also sought to negotiate time off or other ways to register workers' sentiments.
 Las Vegas casinos reported few disruptions, partly because many of their owners announced their support for workers at a news conference last week. On Monday, more than 40 casinos set up tables in employee lunchrooms for workers to sign pro-immigration petitions.
 Leaders of Local 226 of the Culinary Workers Union also urged members to go to work. The union is Las Vegas's largest hospitality union, representing 50,000 workers, of which 40 percent are Hispanic. 
 Smaller businesses in Las Vegas, where tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered on the Strip, also took a hit. Javier Barajas said he closed his family's four Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas because members of his staff warned him they would not show up, costing him more than $60,000 in revenue.
 "I cannot fire anybody over this, but I would have liked to see some other way to express themselves," said Mr. Barajas, who was once an illegal immigrant from central Mexico but became a United States citizen. "It's the small businesses that are hurt by this."
 For many immigrants, however, it was just another workday.
 At a Home Depot in Hollywood, day laborers as always crowded parking lot entrances, hoping for work. At a car wash in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, employees buzzed, with workers vacuuming, buffing and drying cars. People lined up at markets, though some reported slower business.
 "I was thinking about not buying things, but then I needed to buy stuff," said Alex Sanchez, 28, a construction worker buying an avocado, chilies and beer.
 The boycott grew from an idea hatched by a small band of grass-roots advocates in Los Angeles, inspired by the farmworker movement of the 1960's led by Cesar Chavez and Bert Corona. Through the Internet and mass media catering to immigrants, they developed and tapped a network of union organizers, immigrant rights groups and others to spread the word and plan events tied to the boycott, timed to coincide with International Workers' Day.
 The Los Angeles organizers said some 70 cities held boycott activities.
 The day spawned all manner of supportive actions here. A department store chain offered space for lawyers to give legal advice to immigrants; in Hollywood, the comedian Paul Rodriguez appeared at the comedy club the Laugh Factory to promote a daylong health care fair for immigrant workers.
 In Chicago, there was solidarity in diversity, as Latinos were joined by immigrants of Polish, Irish, Asian and African descent. Jerry Jablonski, 30, said he had moved to Chicago from Poland six years ago, flying to Mexico and then crossing the border. He now works a construction job.
 "Poland is my old country," Mr. Jablonski said. "This is my new country. I can make everything happen here."

HEADLINE: Continuity At Jazzfest: The Party Must Go On

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, May 1 

 BODY:
The first weekend of the 37th annual New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival ended on Sunday night with a rendition of ''When the Saints Go Marching In.'' When the familiar chorus arrived, the white handkerchiefs New Orleanians seem to keep handy on all occasions were waved high. 
 Yet it wasn't the jaunty, cliched jazz version. Bruce Springsteen played ''Saints'' as nothing less than a hymn, and he sang a rarely noticed final verse: ''Some say this world of trouble is the only world we'll ever see/ But I'm waiting for that morning when the new world is revealed.''
It was a fitting wrap-up for a weekend that found hope, and solace, in the continuity of tradition. Jazzfest, as everyone calls it, is itself a tradition after nearly four decades, and like Mardi Gras, it is not only a tourist magnet but also a defining event for the city. ''It's bigger than just the music,'' said George Wein, the chief executive of Festival Productions and the executive producer of Jazzfest. ''This is people's lives.'' 
 Music in New Orleans has always been entertaining, but never just entertainment. It held on to cultural memories, negotiated between Old and New World aesthetics, and bound together families, neighborhoods and communities. It's party music, but it's also a secular ritual. And while the city has spawned far more than its share of gifted musicians, its music was not created from the top down. 
 It bubbled up out of the neighborhoods, including some that are now just wreckage. Its roots, constantly renewed in pre-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, were in street parades and barroom jam sessions, full of nonprofessionals who knew how to shake a tambourine. 
 After the hurricane New Orleans music could no longer be taken for granted, in or out of the city. There was an immediate and worldwide surge of interest. Musicians who had gotten by on regular local club dates now work a larger touring circuit -- sometimes between their old home and their new one -- and performers from New Orleans will be all over the summer jazz festivals in the United States and abroad. 
 Even with much of the city's population displaced and scattered, New Orleanians are determined not to let the music and its public celebrations disappear. At Jazzfest, Mardi Gras Indians, who usually take the whole year to hand-sew their elaborate feathered and beaded suits, were resplendent. Social aid and pleasure clubs, the neighborhood associations that sponsor parades and funerals, might not have had their old neighborhoods to return to, but they showed up at Jazzfest to parade in brand-new suits. Gospel choirs exiled from their home churches regrouped to sing about unswerving faith. 
 Although Jazzfest does not compile final figures until after the festival ends, it was clearly well attended, with more than 100,000 tickets sold in advance for its six days. Sets by headliners had sprawling and tightly packed audiences. The first weekend included stars from outside New Orleans, like Mr. Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Herbie Hancock and Elvis Costello, along with New Orleans's own multimillion-selling rapper, Juvenile. 
 Paul Simon, Jimmy Buffett, Lionel Richie and the country hit maker Keith Urban are booked for the second half, Friday through Sunday. Some stars were working for nothing more than expenses, to show support for the festival and for New Orleans. 
 Mr. Springsteen led his large but never unwieldy Seeger Sessions Band -- with horns, fiddles, banjo and more -- in a set featuring folk songs from Pete Seeger's repertory. The arrangements gleefully veered toward south Louisiana Cajun music and New Orleans traditional jazz. Mr. Springsteen had written new verses about New Orleans for Blind Alfred Reed's ''How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live,'' and he dedicated it to ''President Bystander.'' Introducing the song, he said, ''This is what happens when people play political games with other people's lives.''
 Mr. Costello was there because in November he had recorded an album with Allen Toussaint, an archetypal New Orleans songwriter. That album, ''The River in Reverse,'' is scheduled for June release, and the songs from it that they performed together touched on mourning, anger and resolute optimism. But the heart of the festival wasn't in the visiting stars: not in Mr. Springsteen's set, or Etta James's soulful and sassy rhythm and blues, or in having the Edge, U2's guitarist, jamming with the Dave Matthews Band, as he did on Saturday. 
 This Jazzfest, with the world's attention on New Orleans, was even more concentrated on the city's own music than it has been in decades. About 92 percent of the performers were from Louisiana and from New Orleans in particular, though at the moment they may be living elsewhere. 
 Jazzfest's essence was in the gathering of a 50-woman choir from the Franklin Avenue Baptist Church, which sustained $9 million in damage and now holds services for parts of its congregation in Houston and Baton Rouge as well as New Orleans. Some choir members had not seen one another since the hurricane. They, and other performers at the festival, kept saying, ''It's like a reunion.''
 The Mahogany Brass Band was playing for the first time since the storm, and it was the first time all its members, dispersed as far as Phoenix and San Francisco, had seen one another. Brice Miller, the band's leader, started a strikingly emotional ''St. James Infirmary'' alone as a tearful solo trumpet dirge; when he sang the lyrics -- about seeing a lover's dead body -- he interjected, ''My baby's New Orleans.'' 
 Musicians aren't the only ones who have reconvened for the festival. Vaucresson's Sausage Company, founded in New Orleans in 1899, has served its Cajun sausages at every Jazzfest, and it wasn't about to miss this one. Its factory was lost in the hurricane. To serve food at this year's festival, it restarted production in nearby Kenner, La., while rebuilding its old place. Vendors reported some of their best Jazzfest sales ever. It seemed everyone wanted a piece of New Orleans. 
 There were songs about the hurricane and songs that had been transfigured by it. The accordionist Dwayne Dopsie and his band, the Zydeco Hellraisers, performed a song he had written and recorded before Katrina -- ''My Name Is Hurricane'' -- as a frenzied two-step that had become prophetic. Gospel performers like Yolanda Adams sang about getting through storms. Juvenile's ''Get Ya Hustle On'' had a verse about using checks from Federal Emergency Management Agency to buy drugs. 
 The good times in the music were more treasured at this Jazzfest, and rightly so. Making happy music after so much sorrow was a defiant and beautiful laugh in the face of tribulation. Behind the scenes every New Orleans band at Jazzfest had to recreate itself after the city was evacuated: to find its place in New Orleans or to reconstitute it somewhere else. The New Birth Brass Band, originally from New Orleans, wore its latest T-shirts depicting both Louisiana and Texas. 
 New Orleans music hasn't stopped putting pleasure first. Jazzfest is, as always, a festival of good-time dance music, whether it's traditional jazz, bayou zydeco, brass-band struts, Mardi Gras Indian chants or fiercely complex electric funk. A superb jazz pianist, Jonathan Batiste, grounded his jubilant, splashy harmonies in Caribbean and New Orleans rhythms. Brass bands like Rebirth, New Birth and the Soul Rebels spanned classic second-line swing and hip-hop-influenced funk, with the Soul Rebels also pushing toward Latin beats. And there was plenty of straightforward funk from New Orleans elders like the Meters and Dr. John, as well as next-generation funk bands like Galactic and Papa Grows Funk. 
 The destruction in New Orleans is bound to change the city's culture. (For one thing, an influx of Mexican labor for construction could add yet another ingredient to New Orleans music.) And whether a majority of the city's population can ever return will be decided by large political and economic decisions, not by who's appearing in the clubs. 
 But this Jazzfest was a symbol of how eager the city is to rebuild itself, and how resourceful its inhabitants -- current and former -- can be. If the New Orleans of deep local traditions cannot renew itself, it won't be for lack of desire. 
 The triumph of this year's festival is that on the surface it is a normal Jazzfest: crowded, sweaty, ebullient and full of homegrown New Orleans spirit. ''Normal is an incredible word to use down here,'' said Quint Davis, the producer and director of Jazzfest. ''Normalcy is a nonexistent term.''

HEADLINE: $16 Billion Spending Plan Approved in Connecticut

BYLINE: By STACEY STOWE

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 1 

 BODY:
The State Senate passed a $16 billion budget on Monday, giving final legislative approval to a compromise spending plan in which competing tax cuts proposed by the two parties failed to survive.
 The budget was adopted 35 to 1, on time and under the state's constitutional spending cap.
The one-year plan, which Gov. M. Jodi Rell said she expected to sign this week, would revise the $31 billion two-year budget that was adopted last year. 
 To win approval of the budget, Mrs. Rell, a Republican who is running for her first full term in November, conceded on two key proposals that would primarily have benefited the state's wealthier residents. 
 One would have eliminated the car tax, a local levy widely criticized as inconsistent from town to town. 
 The other was the phasing out of the inheritance tax, a levy starting at 5 percent on estates valued at $2,000,001 or more.
 ''These are not life-changing financially,'' said Morton Tenzer, who taught political science for 26 years at the University of Connecticut. ''At this point she doesn't want to get into a nasty confrontation and interfere with her standing. She comes across as Miss Clean, Miss Junior Leaguer.''
 The Democrats who control the legislature also showed a willingness to compromise. They gave up on two tax relief proposals -- a $500 tax credit for low-income taxpayers, and an earned-income tax credit program.
 One by one on Monday, senators from both parties stepped up to thank each other and praise themselves for reaching an agreement with speed and an absence of enmity.
 Martin Looney, a Democrat who is the Senate majority leader, thanked his colleagues for producing a budget that both parties could live with, rather than one ''where we would just wince and vote for it.''
 The give-and-take that led to the budget this year was in sharp contrast with the days of former Gov. John G. Rowland, who was willing to confront and cajole to win approval of his budgets by a Democratic legislature. 
 Mr. Rowland recently completed a prison term on corruption charges and is jobless. Mrs. Rell, his replacement, chose a series of compromises rather than do battle with lawmakers.
 With the breathing room afforded by a $660 million surplus, legislators, among other items, chose to spend $246 million to finance the teacher retirement fund, $33 million to cities and towns in a one-time revenue-sharing plan, and $136 million to the Rainy Day Fund, an emergency account kept in the event of an economic downturn.
 The legislature also approved several tax relief measures. Lawmakers voted to increase the property tax credit to $500 from $400. 
 The new budget would also eliminate the 15 percent corporation tax surcharge for 2007 and provide a tax credit for the restoration and rehabilitation of historic property.
 In a separate action, the Senate was also expected to approve a $2.3 billion transportation package that the House has already passed. Several political analysts said it was not in Mrs. Rell's interest to fight over her tax cut proposals. 
 Her approval rating in February stood at 81 percent, and arguing to eliminate the inheritance tax could suggest she is more conservative than she may want to appear, said Howard L. Reiter, chairman of the University of Connecticut's political science department.
 Mr. Reiter said it was important for Mrs. Rell to hammer out an agreement with her Democratic colleagues rather than ''look as though they can't get anything done in Hartford.''

HEADLINE: 10 States, in Challenge to U.S., Plan Suit to Force Better Mileage Rules for S.U.V.'s

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 1 

 BODY:
Ten states, including California and New York, plan to file suit this week to force the Bush administration to toughen mileage regulations for sport utility vehicles and other trucks. 
 The suit, which the states are to announce on Tuesday, contends that the administration did not do a rigorous enough analysis of the environmental benefits of fuel economy regulations, as required by law, before issuing new rules last month for S.U.V.'s, pickup trucks and minivans. The suit will also claim that the government did not consider the impact of gasoline consumption on climate change when devising the new rules.
While the states have initiated a number of suits over Washington's environmental policies, the new suit is the first to take aim at federal fuel economy regulations. With gasoline reaching $3 a gallon in many parts of the country, there has been a broad outcry for action but little consensus on what to do. 
 Senate Republicans have proposed a $100 rebate to help taxpayers pay gas bills, a proposal that has been met with criticism even from the right, while President Bush has asked for Congressional authority to revise mileage regulations for passenger cars. He already has the authority to do so for S.U.V.'s and other trucks. 
 California will be lead plaintiff in the suit, which also includes Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont, as well as New York City and the District of Columbia. Many of the same states have teamed up in other environmental suits against the administration, though with mixed success; a recent suit against the Environmental Protection Agency over power plant emissions was dismissed. 
 ''It's disappointing when you see power exercised to benefit the auto industry rather than consumers or environmental challenges,'' said Bill Lockyer, the attorney general of California, discussing the Bush administration's fuel economy rules. 
 The attorney general of Massachusetts, Thomas F. Reilly, said in a statement, ''At a time when we are all facing a gas crisis, the Bush administration is pushing for fuel economy standards that appear to be authored by the oil and auto industries.''
 Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said he could not comment on the suit because he had not seen it. But Mr. Tyson defended the regulations and said, ''There's no question the analysis was rigorous.'' 
 Several top Democrats, and also some Republicans, including Senator John McCain of Arizona, have called for tougher mileage requirements for S.U.V.'s, which must meet less stringent fuel economy guidelines because they are classified in the same category as light trucks, instead of with passenger cars . 
 Late last year, the Bush administration unveiled the first broad overhaul of mileage regulations for S.U.V.'s, pickup trucks and minivans since the rules were created in the 1970's. Currently, each automaker's annual production of passenger cars must average 27.5 miles a gallon, while light trucks, which include S.U.V.'s, must average 21.6 miles a gallon in 2006 models.
 The administration's new system would take the single truck category and break it up into a number of smaller categories with varying requirements. Government officials predict that overall truck fuel economy will rise to 24 miles a gallon by 2011, though it will depend on the sales mix among S.U.V.'s and other trucks. 
 Automakers have said the new regulations are tough enough. 
 Jennifer Moore, a spokeswoman for the Ford Motor Company, referred to a previous company statement that commended the traffic safety agency for creating a new regulatory system that would ''pose significant challenges'' but also be ''more equitable to every automaker.''
 An overdependence on sales of large S.U.V.'s like Hummers, Chevrolet Suburbans and Ford Explorers is seen as among the reasons General Motors and Ford, the last two American-owned automakers, are suffering steep losses and closing plants. 
 Environmentalists say the Bush administration's new truck fuel economy system will not do enough to curb oil consumption and adds uncertainty to a complex system already characterized by loopholes. 
 In setting the standards, the administration ''looked high gas prices, oil addiction and global warming squarely in the eye and blinked,'' said Daniel Becker, the director of the global warming program at the Sierra Club.
 The administration is, however, closing one loophole, an exemption that has left the largest S.U.V.'s, including the Hummer H2, outside the regulatory system. 
 But the administration's rules are considerably less daunting than new California global warming emissions regulations that would force steeper fuel economy increases on vehicles sold there. New York is planning to pass similar air-quality rules. The industry is challenging the state rules in court, and the administration has strongly opposed the movement by states to regulate global warming emissions.
 Mr. Tyson, of the traffic safety agency, said many other factors were considered in addition to the price of gas, including ''the ability of industry to be able to meet the standard.''
 ''You can't propose something that's not technically feasible for them to achieve,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Intel to Offer Its Own Plan For Global Internet Access 

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 1 

 BODY:
Aiming to help close the so-called digital divide, the Intel Corporation plans to announce a design for a sub-$400 educational laptop and a five-year, $1 billion program to train teachers and to extend wireless digital Internet access worldwide.
 The moves are intended to bolster Intel's reach into new markets, but may also have an effect on the American market for computers in education. 
The program is to be announced on Tuesday at the World Congress on Information Technology, a conference in Austin, Tex., where Intel's chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, will elaborate on it in a speech on Wednesday.
 The initiative, called World Ahead, comes as Intel, the No. 1 chip maker, is embarking on what it says will be a $1 billion revamping program in the face of declining market share and a lagging share price. It will roughly double what Intel is spending annually on training and technology support in places lagging in digital development, Mr. Otellini said in a telephone interview on Monday.
 The company plans to support the computer training of 10 million teachers around the world. It has already financed the training of three million, he said.
 He distinguished Intel's efforts from other campaigns with similar aims by saying Intel would focus on full-featured computer systems with enough power and memory to run Microsoft software.
 Intel's rival chip maker, Advanced Micro Devices, has backed the concept of reaching half of the world's population with inexpensive personal computers by 2015, and Nicholas Negroponte, a co-founder of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has been designing a sub-$100 notebook computer for educational use in developing nations. 
 Those machines have either been designed to run open-source software or a subset of the complete version of Microsoft's standard desktop software. 
 The issue has been a highly charged one, both for political and business reasons. 
 At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Mr. Negroponte publicly debated the issue with Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, and his chief technology officer, Craig J. Mundie, who suggested that a better alternative to an ultralow-cost computer might be a combination phone and personal organizer that can be fitted with an inexpensive display and a keyboard.
 On Monday, Mr. Otellini appeared to be making a point of defending the utility of the Intel-Microsoft desktop standard.
 ''We don't think you cross the digital divide with old technology,'' he said. ''It doesn't need exotic technology and it runs real applications.''
 The new Intel design, to be called Eduwise, will include software for the classroom. Makers of the computer are to be named later.
 Mr. Otellini dismissed the possibility that the emergence of such low-cost computers might cannibalize existing markets, saying that low-end portable computers were already close to these prices in the United States.
 Mr. Negroponte, whose machine will have a handle, a hand crank and an innovative display screen, is in discussions with Brazil, China, Egypt, Thailand and South Africa to purchase millions of the notebooks.
 He said that the Intel program was a step forward, but that focusing efforts on training teachers had serious drawbacks.
 ''Anything is better than nothing,'' he said, ''but teacher training is the slowest way to improve global education and reaches very few rural, remote teachers in very poor places.''
 He argued that a more radical and more efficient approach was to equip children with technology. Intel has already announced several PC design initiatives for specific regions, including a desktop computer for the Indian market and another for Mexico. The Mexican machine is based on a partnership with Telmex, the Mexican communications company and involves a subsidy for a broadband Internet connection. The machine is priced about 20 percent below the consumer market price for a similar machine.
 In addition to training and access to computing, Intel's focus will be on Internet connections. The company has already financed 175 experimental wireless networks using Wi-Max, a longer-distance version of the Wi-Fi networking standard.
 Intel executives have said they believe that Wi-Max deployments will leapfrog stages of development in the nonindustrialized world.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Shows a Candidate's Mettle to Republicans in Iowa

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

DATELINE: DAVENPORT, Iowa, May 1 

 BODY:
Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said on Monday that he was seriously exploring whether he has ''a chance'' of winning the presidency in 2008, as he visited politically important Iowa and huddled with state advisers, donors to President Bush and other prominent Republicans.
 While Mr. Giuliani was officially in Iowa to attend two Republican fund-raisers, his behavior and remarks came close to politicking for himself. He ruminated openly about running, disclosed he was not sure what he would do if his friend John McCain also ran, and argued that if Republicans are to be a majority party, they need to accept politicians like himself who support abortion rights, gay rights and gun control.
''I've got a lot of places to go and a lot of people to talk to and a long process of figuring out whether it makes sense to run for president in 2008,'' Mr. Giuliani said before speaking at a daytime fund-raiser in Des Moines for a Republican congressional candidate. ''I don't know the answer to that yet.''
 He added: ''My effort this year will be to help Republicans get elected, and then, quite honestly, as part of it, saying to myself, does it look like I have a chance in 2008? And make that decision after the 2006 election.'' 
 At a fund-raiser in Davenport on Monday night, Mr. Giuliani offered a stout defense of President Bush's leadership, arguing that the economy was growing and that Mr. Bush would go down in history as ''a great president.'' 
 ''I don't know what we're all so upset about,'' he said, referring to concerns about the economy and rising costs, such as gas prices. 
 At another point he called the war in Afghanistan ''successful,'' noting that the Taliban had been ousted from power and that elections had been held. Later, when pressed, he acknowledged that a primary American goal -- the capture of Osama bin Laden -- had not been achieved.
 ''It would be better if bin Laden were captured,'' Mr. Giuliani said, ''but it's better that he's on the run.''
 In response to another question, Mr. Giuliani disclosed that he was not sure if his own presidential plans would be swayed if Senator McCain of Arizona also ran in 2008, as many expect. 
 ''John is a good friend and someone I have tremendous admiration for, and he's a hero of mine, so I haven't really thought about how I would approach that,'' Mr. Giuliani said.
 And Mr. Giuliani weighed in on the new film ''United 93,'' about one of the hijacked planes on Sept. 11, saying that he saw the film on Saturday and found it ''very difficult to watch.''
 ''I thought it was a valuable contribution to explaining the heroism of those people who I believed saved the Capitol, and gave up their lives to do that,'' he said. ''I think it's something that people should see in order to remind themselves of what's going on. When we say the war on terror, there's a reason for it.''
 At an early news conference in Des Moines, where he spoke briefly at a private fund-raiser, Mr. Giuliani said he did not think his moderate views on social issues would hurt his chances in the presidential sweepstakes in places that are less liberal than New York City.
 ''The party's a big party, and I fit in to the party real well over the last 10, 15 years,'' he said.
 For the most part, Mr. Giuliani said, his views were in the mainstream with the party faithful in Iowa and nationally, noting that he favored lower taxes, free trade, smaller government programs and a strong military.
 ''We then have a party that has disagreements on issues that have to do with religion and what you call social issues,'' he said. ''But it's a party that has room for Arnold Schwarzenegger and me, and a party that has room for people who have different views on that. The more we grow like that, the more of a chance we're going to have to be a majority party.''
 Mr. Giuliani also acknowledged that his personal popularity -- burnished by his leadership of New York City during and after the Sept. 11 terror attack -- did not guarantee that Iowa voters would support him in the January 2008 caucuses.
 ''I do understand that there is a difference between popularity, and then, you know, does that convert itself into somebody voting for you in a caucus, primary, an election,'' he said. 
 Still, he noted, ''It's always nicer when people cheer for you than when they boo you.''
 Mr. Giuliani was cheerful as he faced reporters from Iowa, New York and Washington after the fund-raiser, and he rather politely parried questions about his plans for 2008. As television news cameras rolled, he showed a local touch, noting Iowa's problems with methamphetamine -- a concern of Iowa caucusgoers in 2004 -- and joked that there was more balance between Republicans and Democrats in Iowa than in New York.
 Mr. Giuliani also endorsed ''appropriate levels'' of federal subsidies for farmers and particularly aligned himself with government support for ethanol, an alternative fuel made from corn that is a prized issue in Iowa.
 Before the fund-raiser, Mr. Giuliani met with several Iowa Republican leaders who were players in past presidential caucuses -- among them David M. Roederer, the state chairman of the Bush-Cheney campaign in 2004, and Terry E. Branstad, a four-term governor who left office in 1999.
 In an interview, Mr. Roederer said that a Giuliani presidential bid ''would find a very receptive audience in Iowa.'' 
 While many traditional caucusgoers are more hard-core conservatives and may oppose Mr. Giuliani over social issues, Mr. Roederer said, other more moderate Republicans might come out of the woodwork and attend the caucuses for the first time to support him because of his brand of politics and his leadership during the 9/11 crisis. More than 610,000 Iowans are registered Republicans, Mr. Roederer said, but only about 110,000 typically vote in the caucuses.
 ''The larger the turnout, the less impact the social issues will have,'' he said.
 Ray Hoffmann, the chairman of the state's Republican Party, who met Mr. Giuliani for the first time on Monday, said he was adopting a wait-and-see position on whether issues such as abortion rights and gun control could jeopardize a Giuliani candidacy in Iowa.
 ''Initially, he's got this stardom, this superstar-type thing,'' Mr. Hoffmann said. ''Down the road there's going to be the tough questions, the questions on abortion, on gun control, on all those kind of things. He has to answer those things.''
 Mr. Giuliani was a host at a cocktail party in New York on Sunday night for Governor Schwarzenegger of California, and he helped raise money last month for Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: Study Says Older Americans Are Less Healthy Than British

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, May 2 

 BODY:
Americans 55 and over are much sicker than their British counterparts even though the United States spends more than twice as much per person on health care as Britain, researchers said Tuesday. 
 Writing in The Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers from University College, London, also seemed to confirm stereotypes tossed across the Atlantic, concluding that Americans are prone to obesity while Britons drink too much.
The conclusions followed an inquiry that used data from American and British health surveys to compare the relative health of people ages 55 to 64 and how their health varies as a result of social and economic status. 
 The researchers wrote that ''health insurance cannot be the central reason for the better health outcomes in England because the top socioeconomic-status tier of the U.S. population have close to universal access but their health outcomes are often worse than those of their English counterparts.'' 
 In Britain, many people depend on the widely available, state-run National Health Service, which is facing huge deficits that have eliminated thousands of hospital beds. 
 Dr. Michael Marmot, an author of the report, said the research showed that differences in health could not be ascribed to the ''usual suspects,'' like rates of smoking, obesity or alcohol abuse. 
 Nor could varying levels of health be attributed to differences between the health care systems of the United States and Britain, he said.
 ''I'm arguing that it's due to the differences in the circumstances in which people live,'' he said Tuesday in a telephone interview. ''Work, job insecurity, the nature of communities, residential communities, et cetera -- I think that's the place we should try to look.''
 The article, in the issue of JAMA to be published Wednesday, said ''middle-aged to older U.S. residents have higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, heart attack, stroke, lung disease and cancer than their English counterparts.''
 American per capita expenditure on medical care is $5,274 a year compared with $2,164 in Britain, according to the article. 
 ''Whether greater financial expenditures translate into better health for a country's citizens is uncertain,'' JAMA said in a news release summarizing the article. Researchers found that diabetes was twice as prevalent in the United States as in England and that hypertension was 10 percent more common in the United States.
 Comparing the habits of the people surveyed, the researchers wrote that ''smoking behavior was similar in both countries, with about one in five people between the ages of 55 and 64 years currently smoking.''
 But they added, ''Obesity rates were much higher in the U.S., and heavy drinking was more common in England.''
 Wealthier and better-educated people in both countries were much healthier than poorer and less-educated people, the researchers concluded. 
 But, the press release said, the study found that ''differences in socioeconomic groups between the two countries were so great that those in the top education and income level in the U.S. had similar rates of diabetes and heart disease as those in the bottom education and income level in England.''

HEADLINE: U.S., Britain and France Draft U.N. Resolution on Iran's Nuclear Ambitions

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO; Judy Dempsey contributed reporting from Berlin for this article.

DATELINE: PARIS, May 2 

 BODY:
The United States, Britain and France have drafted a binding United Nations Security Council resolution requiring Iran to stop critical nuclear activities, but Russia and China are resisting, officials involved in the negotiations said Tuesday. 
 The emerging standoff signals the beginning of a new confrontation that is expected to take weeks to negotiate, and even then might not result in a clear outcome.
The Americans and the Europeans, who want to move swiftly against Iran, will introduce the resolution in New York on Wednesday or Thursday, according to R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state who has led American diplomatic efforts on Iran. 
 ''The Security Council has no option but to proceed under Chapter 7,'' Mr. Burns told reporters in Paris, referring to the article in the United Nations Charter that makes resolutions mandatory under international law and opens the way to sanctions or even military action. 
 He predicted a drawn-out process in the Security Council, saying at one point that it would take 30 to 40 days and at another point, a month or two. Mr. Burns was in Paris for preliminary talks with the political directors of Britain, China, France and Russia -- the four other nations that along with the United States are permanent members of the Security Council -- as well as Germany. 
 After Tuesday's talks, one of the European participants acknowledged that ''there remain differences on how we take the next step forward,'' although he called the talks ''useful.''
 The talks are designed to pave the way for a meeting of the countries' foreign ministers in New York on May 8, part of an American- and European-led campaign to forge a common position against Iran after it failed to comply with an informal Security Council deadline last Friday to suspend uranium enrichment. 
 The draft resolution, which has not been made public, expresses ''serious concern'' that Iran has not complied with its international commitments. It further calls on Iran to stop producing enriched uranium, which can have both peaceful and military uses, and to return to the negotiating table, according to officials involved in its drafting. 
 In its current form, the resolution does not include a fixed deadline for compliance or a specific threat of action against Iran if it fails to comply, the officials said. 
 In recent weeks, Iran has responded to threats of punitive measures with threats of its own. On Tuesday, Gen. Mohammad Ebrahim Dehghani, a senior commander of the Revolutionary Guards, told the ISNA news agency that if the United States attacked Iran militarily, ''the first place we target will be Israel.''
 Iran, which maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful, has remained steadfast in its position that it will never give up its right to enrich uranium to the low grade required to power a reactor, and in the past month has accelerated that program. 
 Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, expressed confidence Tuesday that both Russia and China, two of Tehran's most important trading powers, would veto any Security Council resolution that calls for economic sanctions. 
 ''There is a very wrong assumption held by some that the West can do anything it wants through the Security Council,'' Mr. Mottaki told Kayhan, a conservative newspaper in Tehran. 
 But Mr. Burns stressed that sanctions, if they are imposed, would come only later, if negotiations failed. He said that oil and gas sanctions were not under discussion, but predicted that there would eventually be international support for some sanctions. He mentioned sanctions on technology imports with both civilian and military uses, a travel ban on Iranian officials and a ban on all arms sales as possibilities. 
 Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the director of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, announced Tuesday that Iran had succeeded in enriching uranium to a level of 4.8 percent, a higher level than it had previously acknowledged. He said that Iran would not enrich it further because, he said, this level suffices for making nuclear fuel. In its report last Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said that samples taken inside Iran ''tend to confirm'' the enrichment level of 3.6 percent declared by Iran, the level needed to make electricity. 
 Although Mr. Aghazadeh's claim can be seen as provocative, it is well within the bounds of what is used in the most common reactors, enrichment levels of generally less than 5 percent. Uranium must be enriched to about 90 percent for use in bombs. 
 The Americans, together with the French and the Europeans, are convinced that isolation of Iran by the international community is the only way to stop it from moving forward with what Washington says is a plan to make nuclear weapons. 
 The Russians and the Chinese, by contrast, argue that the American and European initiative to punish Iran in the Security Council lacks a strategic goal and will only escalate the crisis. 
 In Ottawa on Monday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, again floated a proposal to enrich uranium inside Russia for use by Iran. Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has publicly rejected that proposal, although other Iranian officials say the plan is still alive. 
 Iran is expected to be a major topic of discussion when Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany meets with President Bush in Washington on Wednesday. 
 Mrs. Merkel is expected to discuss the Russian proposal, which is to enrich uranium for Iran in Russia and ship it back, German officials said. 
 And although Mrs. Merkel takes a line similar to that of her American and other European counterparts, some of her senior advisers have called for more flexibility. 
 The German defense minister, Franz Josef Jung, for example, said in a recent interview that it would be hard to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough without direct talks between Washington and Tehran. 
 ''This is also our request to Washington: that it begin direct talks and from there reach results,'' Mr. Jung said. 
 But in his remarks to reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Burns ruled out talks. 
 ''Diplomacy is not always about words,'' he said, adding: ''Right now, isolation is what will work best.''

HEADLINE: After Immigration Protests, Goal Is Still Elusive

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Julia Preston contributed reporting from New York for this article, and Rachel L. Swarns from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2 

 BODY:
The nascent immigrant rights movement showed on Monday that it could build an organization, mobilize hundreds of thousands of people across the country and wield economic power. 
 But the protesters do not appear to have achieved their primary goal: changing votes in Congress. And some critics say the demonstration may have generated a backlash, hardening positions on Capitol Hill.
The protests, which began in March and resumed on Monday with a boycott of work, school and shops, have clearly grabbed the nation's attention when the issue of illegal immigration is high on the agenda in Washington. 
 The heightened attention will make it difficult for Congress to duck the question of what to do with the estimated 11 million to 12 million people living illegally in the United States. Although the outpouring has drawn comparisons to the civil rights movement of the 1960's, questions remain about whether the protesters can translate their passion into political results.
 Some companies closed on Monday, yet it is too early to assess the economic effects of the boycott. The effects were diminished because many workers notified their employers ahead of time that they planned to take the day off. 
 ''This was a one-day deal,'' said Randel Johnson, vice president of the United States Chamber of Congress, which supports bills to legalize immigrants. ''If immigrants decided to abandon their jobs for two weeks, that would definitely have an impact.''
 Some advocates who support ''comprehensive immigration reform,'' the idea that illegal workers should be put on a path to citizenship, say the protests have given that concept an important lift in the debate on Capitol Hill. 
 Even some immigrant rights backers say few if any minds were changed and called the marches a Rorschach test in which people simply saw their own view reflected in the sea of mostly Latino marchers.
 ''I have no effective data on this, but it has probably hardened positions and maybe done a little bit of wedging,'' said Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, a Democrat and former senator who said he supported the protesters' cause. ''I think that the people that were really fired up about this still are, and the position that they had to start with, they still carry.''
 Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said: ''The protest, I don't think, changes votes on the floor of the Senate. I think what changes votes is coming down, sitting down, talking about it, as opposed to students' staying out of school. I happen to think that students' staying out of school is counterproductive.''
 The protesters have discovered that there is a thin and potentially dangerous line between promoting national pride and pushing opponents' buttons. They used tactics -- flying the Mexican flag, recording ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' in Spanish -- that have left even some supporters feeling a bit queasy.
 ''I have a great respect for a lot of the people that did the protesting, but I think their message is all confused,'' said Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, whose sympathy dates from his childhood, when his mother, an Italian immigrant, was nearly deported. ''The flag, the anthem, all that, it got everybody all mixed up. 'Take off work' -- it sounded wrong to some people, right to others.''
 The public is deeply divided on illegal immigration. A survey in March by the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, found that 53 percent of respondents said people who were in the United States illegally should be required to go home and that 40 percent say the immigrants should be granted some kind of legal status that allows them to stay here.
 ''What buttons were pressed?'' Roberto Suro, the director of the center, asked, wondering aloud about what Americans saw when they looked at the protesters. ''Was it that there are so many people here outside of government control or was it the hard-working family types? I think that's really imponderable.''
 That divide is reflected among Republicans on Capitol Hill. The House opposes giving citizenship to illegal immigrants, and it has passed a bill aimed only at controlling the borders, while a more comprehensive Senate bill is backed by Republicans like Mr. Domenici, as well as Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, John McCain of Arizona, and Mel Martinez of Florida.
 Some say the protests have given the Senate approach a boost. ''While you could never point to a specific vote, they moved the tone and the thrust where now a balanced bill has the upper hand, and it's in part because of the protests,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said.
 The Senate bill collapsed last month amid partisan bickering on procedure, but the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist of Tennessee, says he wants to resume the debate this month. On Tuesday, the minority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, offered to limit the debate to 10 amendments a side. Mr. Frist did not accept that, and they continued talks. The Republican split is complicated because not just the immigrants are weighing in. Among their biggest allies are employers, large and small, who want assurances that they will continue to have that labor pool. Business groups are important for the Republican base, and many employers gave immigrant employees the day off on Monday in solidarity with the marchers. 
 With Republicans so divided, reaching consensus will be difficult. 
 ''Obviously, there's tremendous pressure on lawmakers to fix the problem,'' said Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, an advocacy group. ''The marches in the street, the public opinion polls that show immigration is one of the top two or three issues in the country. 
 ''But the crosscurrents of politics and policy are such that it's going to take a tremendous push from President Bush and from Democratic and Republican leaders to get this done.''
 It is clear that the protests have raised some hackles. After the March rally, Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, said he was deeply offended by marchers' waving the Mexican flag.
 ''I want to be sensitive to human concerns, why they're here and how they're here. But when they act out like that, they lose me,'' Mr. Lott said.
 He suggested a risk of deportation and said, ''We had them all in a bunch, you know what I mean?''

HEADLINE: Bolivia's Energy Takeover: Populism Rules in the Andes

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO and JUAN FORERO; Paulo Prada and Renwick McLean contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Bolivia's nationalization of its energy industry, announced Monday by President Evo Morales, was a vivid illustration that the populist policies, championed most prominently by Venezuela, were spreading. 
 The impact on international energy markets is expected to be minimal because Bolivia produces mostly natural gas and exports it to just two countries, Brazil and Argentina.
Symbolically, however, the dispatch of troops to refineries and oilfields threatens to inject more nationalistic fervor into the policies of Bolivia and other energy exporters, in Latin America and abroad.
 ''We're experiencing the supremacy of emotional politics at this time,'' Gonzalo Chavez, an economist at the Catholic University of La Paz in Bolivia, said in a telephone interview. ''The nationalization was received with great enthusiasm, but we'll have to wait and see how the economic impact of all this plays out.'' 
 Many countries have already taken steps to assert greater control over their natural resources, spurred by nationalist politics and lofty energy prices. 
 Major oil suppliers like Saudi Arabia and Iran nationalized their oil interests decades ago. Russia recently reorganized its domestic energy industries as well. But it is in the Andean region where momentum is quickly building for a greater government role. 
 Venezuela, a top supplier of oil to the United States, is at the forefront of this trend, recently forcing foreign energy companies to accept state control of important ventures. 
 Ecuador imposed rules in April that increase the state's share of windfall oil profits, while in Peru, Ollanta Humala, a presidential candidate, has called for a more aggressive government role in natural gas and mining operations. 
 On Tuesday, Bolivia's vice president, Alvaro Garcia, said major mining companies would also have to pay higher taxes. ''There are not going to be company expropriations, of course,'' he told a local radio station, according to Reuters, ''but we're going to assume a greater level of state control.'' 
 The government said it expected the nationalization of its energy sector, which includes the second-largest natural gas reserves in Latin America, behind Venezuela's, to raise its annual revenues by more than $300 million, to $780 million.
 ''I don't think the game is over,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the PIRA Energy Group, which is based in New York and is supported by the petroleum industry. ''It's going to move from the Americas to the Africans. This is a very dangerous precedent.''
 Bolivia's step highlighted the region's changing political landscape, pointing first to the weakening influence of the United States, and to the rising profile of Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, who has been empowered by soaring oil revenues. 
 But it also threatened to open a schism among the region's new wave of left-leaning leaders. Brazil's president, Luis Ignacio da Silva, while nominally left-leaning, has drifted more toward the center since his election in 2002. Now he will have to negotiate a way out of the current crisis for his country, which is one of the biggest investors in Bolivia's energy industry and the main buyer of Bolivia's natural gas. 
 Brazil announced late Tuesday that Mr. da Silva would meet Thursday in Puerto Iguazu, Argentina, with Mr. Morales and with Argentina's president, Nestor Kirchner, to press for stability in energy supplies and prices. Mr. Chavez may also attend. 
 The Brazilian state oil company, Petrobras, the nation's largest company, is among the small number of foreign energy companies that will feel the brunt of Bolivia's decision.
 At a news conference on Tuesday, Andre Singer, a Brazilian government spokesman, said Petrobras would maintain its Bolivian operations for the time being, though it remained wary of future investments. 
 Other energy companies affected include the BG Group in Britain, Repsol-YPF S.A. of Spain and Total of France. The only Bolivian investment of Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company, is a minority stake in a nonproducing gas field controlled by Total. 
 The president of Repsol, Antonio Brufau, said the Bolivian decree fell ''outside the norms and logic of business that should be the guides for relations between companies and governments.'' 
 Companies said they were waiting for more details to emerge and for negotiations or legal arbitration to begin with the Bolivian government, which has given them six months to agree to the new conditions or leave. 
 For the largest natural gas fields, the decree would give the government 82 percent control, including royalties, taxes and direct stakes, while that level would be lower for smaller fields. 
 But specifics remain to be clarified, in particular whether infrastructure or assets will be seized without compensation. The decree described earlier policies giving foreign companies a foothold as ''treason.'' 
 Edward E. Miller, president of Gas TransBoliviano S.A., a company that operates part of the pipeline to Brazil, said people in the energy industry were still trying to make sense of the changes. 
 ''We have military in front of our offices, but they're not doing anything but making sure people don't take anything out of the offices,'' Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview from Santa Cruz de la Sierra, in Bolivia. ''They're not abrasive, they just don't want anyone to leave with laptops or documents.'' 
 In taking such a bold step, Mr. Morales appeared to have taken a cue from President Chavez, who has used his oil money to buttress alliances. In Bolivia's case, Venezuela has agreed to supply about 200,000 barrels a month of subsidized diesel, donated about $30 million for social programs and sent literacy volunteers into the Bolivian countryside. 
 Just a day before his nationalization speech, Mr. Morales entered into a trade agreement with Venezuela and Cuba called the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas. 
 ''Chavez is forcing Bolivia into a radical shift,'' said Roger Tissot, director of markets and countries for PFC Energy, a consulting firm in Washington. ''That is the major headache for the U.S.'' 
 The Bush administration has quietly tried to engage the new Bolivian government, though that overture and Brazil's efforts to moderate Mr. Morales appear to have had little effect. 
 A perception that foreign oil and mining concerns have exploited landlocked Bolivia has been a driving force in the country's politics for decades. But it gained new currency after Bolivia and other nations in the region reopened the energy industry in the 1990's. 
 Since then, there have been boisterous protests and a tide of electoral revolts by voters who felt that the economic benefits had not spread to the poor. 
 Bolivians have also chafed somewhat at their dependence on Brazil. Petrobras controls 45 percent of Bolivia's natural gas fields, and part of a pipeline that supplies 51 percent of Brazil's need for natural gas. 
 At the same time, Brazilian companies, eager to expand into neighboring countries, have been struggling to do so without offending their hosts.
 ''Brazilian companies still do not have a nuanced approach, a diplomatic culture, particularly in relation to smaller countries,'' Luis Nassif, one of Brazil's leading economic commentators, recently wrote in the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. ''They are arrogant, like the British before World War II.'' 
 Yet while Brazil might feel tremors from Bolivia's decision, it is Bolivia that may be risking its potential as a major natural gas exporter. 
 Companies had been holding off on investments in Bolivia for some time, unnerved by growing talk of precisely the kind of step that Mr. Morales took this week. Foreign direct investment, much of which goes to energy and mining, fell to $103 million in 2005, from $1 billion in 1999.
 What is more, unlike oil, natural gas is not easily exportable, with costly liquefaction facilities, customized tankers or pipelines needed to take the fuel to markets. Chile, a potential market for Bolivian gas, may choose instead a project to import the fuel from as far away as Africa.
 Even Brazil, while now reliant on Bolivian gas, has recently discovered large offshore gas reserves of its own. Thus the window of opportunity for Bolivia to become a leading gas exporter may be closing, even as it grows more courageous in its dealings with foreigners. 
 ''If Brazil decides to give the cold shoulder to Bolivia,'' said Carlos Alberto Lopez, an independent consultant for oil companies in La Paz, ''Bolivia will be left with its gas underground.''

HEADLINE: Let's (Third) Party

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
What would OPEC do if it wanted to keep America addicted to oil? That's easy. OPEC would urge the U.S. Congress to deal with the current spike in gasoline prices either by adopting the Republican proposal to give American drivers $100 each, so they could continue driving gas-guzzling cars and buy gasoline at the current $3.50 a gallon, or by adopting the Democrats' proposal for a 60-day lifting of the federal gasoline tax of 18.4 cents a gallon. Either one would be fine with OPEC.
 So, to summarize, we now have a Congress proposing to do exactly what our worst enemies would like us to do -- subsidize our addiction to gasoline by breaking into our kids' piggybanks to make it easier for us to pay the prices demanded by our oil pushers, so that we will remain addicted and they will remain awash in dollars. 
With a Congress like this, who needs Al Qaeda? 
 Seriously, there is something really disturbing about the utterly shameless, utterly over-the-top Republican pandering and Democratic point-scoring that have been masquerading as governing in response to this energy crisis. The Republicans are worse, because they control all the levers of power and could move the country if they proposed a serious energy policy -- but won't.
 ''We used to say the system is broken because it won't respond until there is a crisis,'' said David Rothkopf, author of ''Running the World,'' a history of U.S. foreign policy. But now it's really broken, ''because the system can't even respond to a crisis!''
 What to do? I'm hoping for a third party. The situation is ripe for one: America is facing a challenge as big as the cold war -- how we satisfy our long-term energy needs, at reasonable prices, while decreasing our dependence on oil and the bad governments that export it -- and neither major party will offer a solution, because it requires sacrifice today for gain tomorrow. 
 Combine a huge leadership vacuum on a huge issue with an Internet that has proved itself as an alternative platform for organizing, financing and energizing a political campaign outside the Washington establishment, and you have the makings of a credible third party. 
 I would not call it the ''Green Party'' -- the name's been taken, and it connotes an agenda that is too narrow and liberal. Today's third party has to be big, strategic, centrist and forward-looking -- something like the ''American Renewal Party,'' something that frames the energy issue as critical to restoring American strength and wealth, not just conservation.
 Energy really is key to American renewal -- from stimulating more young people to study math and science, to bringing down the trade deficit by decreasing our dependence on imported oil, to bringing down the fiscal deficit by raising gasoline taxes, to improving U.S. competitiveness by making us leaders in clean technologies, to restoring U.S. global respect by leading the fight against climate change, to advancing democracy by finding alternatives to oil and thereby weakening some of the world's worst regimes, who are using their oil windfalls to halt the spread of freedom. 
 ''There is an opportunity here for someone who will seize it,'' said Micah Sifry, author of ''Spoiling for a Fight: Third-Party Politics in America.'' That someone would have to be a more emotionally stable and energy-focused Ross Perot type. Because, added Mr. Sifry, ''if the issue of the day in 1991-1992 was the ballooning budget deficit that we were not dealing with, then the issue today we are not dealing with is the energy and environmental catastrophe that awaits the next generation. It is as much a mortgaging of our children's future as the deficit issue. It needs the right leader, though.''
 Like someone who will tell the truth: The only way Americans are ever going to enjoy relatively cheap gasoline again is if we raise the price now with a gasoline tax-- and fix it at that higher level for several years -- so investors know that it is not coming down, and therefore it makes economic sense for them to make the long-term investments in alternative, renewable sources of energy. That is the only way to break our oil addiction and ultimately bring down the price. 
 Yes, our system is rigged against third parties. Still, my gut says that some politician, someday soon, just to be different, just for the fun of it, will take a flier on telling Americans the truth. The right candidate with the right message on energy might be able to drive a bus right up the middle of the U.S. political scene today -- lose the far left and the far right -- and still maybe, just maybe, win a three-way election.

P.R. FOR BIG OIL -- A new public relations campaign by the oil industry, coupled with a huge lobbying network in Washington, is not only aimed at consumers but is an effort to blunt intensifying efforts by lawmakers who are calling for a windfall profits tax and repeal of some of the tax breaks and other incentives provided just last year by Congress in its energy legislation. [C1.] 


SHIFT IN SOUTH AMERICA -- Bolivia's nationalization of its energy industry indicates that the populist policies championed most prominently by Venezuela are spreading. [A8.]

ESCHEWING S.U.V.'S -- Americans shied away from large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in April as gas prices approached $3 a gallon. With a battery of new S.U.V.'s waiting in the wings, domestic automakers are now facing the very situation they had hoped to avoid. [C3.]

HEADLINE: Industry Thinks It Has a Message, but It Isn't Reaching Consumers

BYLINE: By KATE PHILLIPS and JULIE BOSMAN; Kate Phillips reported from Washington for this article and Julie Bosman from New York. Jad Mouawad contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2 

 BODY:
Just last November, Senate Republican leaders extended an unusual privilege to five of the nation's top oil executives. To prevent what might seem like a ''perp walk,'' the officials entered a Senate hearing room outside the whirl of television and press photographers, who had been briefly shooed away from the site.
 Moreover, the officials were not required to take an oath, avoiding the infamous imagery created when tobacco company executives lined up, right hands in the air, and then proceeded to uniformly declare before a Senate panel that cigarettes were not addictive.
But as gasoline prices have soared again in recent weeks, to more than $3 a gallon, the industry is no longer receiving the same courtesy. Not only were executives from Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, BP and Royal Dutch Shell compelled to return to Capitol Hill in March -- this time to testify under oath -- but they have also faced mounting attacks from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. 
 Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, took the major oil companies to task last week over their profits: ''Outside of satanic cults, these people have the worst P.R. of anybody in the world.''
 It's not for want of trying. In their latest counteroffensive to that type of demonization, the big oil companies and their trade groups have stepped up their own campaigns, spending millions of dollars on television, radio and newspaper advertisements in hopes of blunting the reaction.
 The public relations effort, coupled with a huge lobbying network here in Washington, is aimed at both consumers and lawmakers, who are joining in a louder chorus of voices calling for such previously heretical ideas on Capitol Hill as a new windfall profits tax and a repeal of some of the tax breaks and other incentives Congress provided the industry just last year in its energy legislation. 
 The industry can already claim an early success, with big-business interests quickly persuading the Senate leadership to drop a provision that would have increased taxes on inventories not just of oil companies but of other industries as well. But that was just the opening skirmish in what the energy companies now see as a long bruising battle ahead.
 The oil companies, like Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, are certainly prepared to fight it out all summer. Last year alone the top 10 oil companies spent more than $30 million on their lobbying battalions. 
 And they have recently lined up additional firepower, enlisting familiar Washington figures like the former Reagan official, Michael K. Deaver, and former Senator J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, the architect of the royalty relief package for gulf exploration in the 1990's that is now bedeviling the image of an industry awash in billions of dollars of extra profits. 
 ''We can no longer be fortress America,'' said Red Cavaney, president of the American Petroleum Institute. ''I think we, like other industries, have been slow in understanding the need to communicate what we're doing to the public and opinion makers.''
 For its part, the petroleum institute has brought on Blue Worldwide, the advertising arm of Edelman Public Relations and the Hawthorn Group. As oil industry profits soared, it started a campaign of full-page newspaper ads, arranged for dozens of op-ed articles, and produced television and radio commercials in an effort to explain why gas prices have risen so much.
 The campaign has cost the institute more than $20 million over the last several months, though this is minuscule when set against the profits most oil companies have been making. Even BP, the only major to report a drop in earnings for the quarter, still had net income of more than $5 billion. Chevron said profit rose 49 percent in the quarter.
 The trade group, along with others representing refineries and independent producers, has developed a set of talking points: the impersonal forces of demand have outstripped supply, particularly as China's industrial expansion has added a new force to the global economy; oil industry profits are not outsize by the standards of other major industries; Western oil companies have only a limited share of the crude oil market, which is now dominated by OPEC and other oil-producing nations.
 Many cite a federal study to try to prove that the last go-round on a windfall profits tax reduced production and jobs. 
 But while there is certainly a fair amount of political posturing on the part of those attacking the industry, oil companies are also finding that fewer lawmakers are willing to listen to their case. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and a staunch defender of his home state's oil interests, said the industry's reputation had indeed plummeted.
 He acknowledged that the industry might have to give up some subsidies or incentives that no longer seem necessary in light of the ''extraordinarily high profits.'' 
 ''I'm not sure what they can do about it,'' Senator Cornyn said of the industry's image.
 ''I think what they need to do is tell their story, which has to do with the amount of money they actually invest to develop additional supplies,'' the best way that the industry can help bring down prices.
 One figure stepping forward as the new public face of the industry is Rex W. Tillerson, who took over as Exxon's chief executive at the beginning of the year. While his predecessor, Lee R. Raymond, was better known for his dismissive attitude toward public opinion, Mr. Tillerson has tried to address the ''huge challenge'' the industry faces in dealing with the global energy market. 
 ''It's important that the American consumer understands the fundamentals of what's going on,'' said Mr. Tillerson in a brief interview on Tuesday between appearances at public policy forums here, meetings with Republican leaders, and a planned television interview on NBC's ''Today'' show on Wednesday. ''To the extent we can explain that in terms that people can understand, I hope that would be helpful.'' 
 On another front, smaller independent natural gas and oil producers, which are centered in the oil-patch states of Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, are hoping that their hometown image and grassroots connections will help quell the fever. 
 ''The oil and natural gas industry is very misunderstood by the public and, from what we've seen over the past week, by Congress,'' said Jeff Eshelman, vice president for public affairs at the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which lobbies on behalf of its 5,000 large and small independent oil and natural gas producers. ''Congressional efforts have really been misguided: they've done nothing to lower gasoline prices; they've done nothing to increase supplies.''
 But industry and trade officials concede that lawmakers are in no mood right now to contemplate long-term solutions to today's energy situation.
 Republicans like Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Finance Committee, and the ranking Democrat, Max Baucus of Montana, recently demanded that the top 15 oil companies turn over their tax returns. Mr. Grassley has called for some oil profits to be used to help finance the low-income home heating program, an idea the industry has rebuffed.
 Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, has joined two Democrats, Senators Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, to push for a profits tax on the industry.
 Mr. Johnston, the former senator now representing the industry, said he hoped to slow the bandwagon by reminding them of the past. ''I've got one of the most expensive energy educations that Americans can have, expensive because we made a lot of mistakes with synthetic fuels, windfall profits,'' he said. ''I've seen all those mistakes made, so that experience is very good.''
 Both industry officials and Congress recognize the potency of gas prices as a lever at the polls. The oil industry is a powerful campaign donor, with more than $1 million being donated to federal candidates in 2005 and the first three months of this year by the top 10 oil industry political action committees, largely to Republicans, according to the PoliticalMoneyLine, an online Web site that compiles finance data.
 ''This is an election year and our organization does have a political action committee,'' Mr. Eshelman said. ''We are making it one of our priorities to raise funds for the political action committee and we will be involved in the upcoming elections.''
 Money talks, of course, but business lobbyists are also working overtime trying to persuade lawmakers to avoid rushing to judgment. 
 ''I have never seen so much confusion in my entire life,'' said William Kovacs, vice president for environment, technology and regulatory affairs at the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''They're all hoping that if they throw enough stuff at the wall, something will stick. We shouldn't be doing energy policy in the middle of a crisis.''
 For all his effort to help the industry, Mr. Johnston admits to feeling a little ambivalent about the whole circus atmosphere surrounding oil prices.
 ''I think it's a great issue for Democrats and I'm a Democrat,'' he said. ''So I hope they win.''
 Still, he added: ''I'm on the side of a lot of Democrats who feel the other way, but look, some we agree or disagree on. So what else is new?''

HEADLINE: Foolishness on Fuel

 BODY:
Americans can be forgiven for thinking that the outcry over gasoline prices has finally persuaded Congress and President Bush to rethink their opposition to making meaningful improvements in fuel economy standards, largely unchanged for 20 years. Last week Mr. Bush practically begged Congress for the authority to raise these standards; a House committee then urgently scheduled a hearing. 
 This is mostly theater. Mr. Bush can raise the standards on his own, subject to later Congressional veto. He does not want to do that. What he wants is the authority to change the current system -- in effect, to rewrite the underlying fuel economy law.
Under present law, the passenger cars produced each year by an automaker must average 27.5 miles a gallon. Mr. Bush wants to replace that easily understood standard with a more complex system under which vehicles would be divided into categories and assigned mileage standards based on size -- but with no firm fleetwide target. 
 This is essentially what Mr. Bush did earlier this year when he unveiled the first broad overhaul since the 1970's of the mileage rules governing S.U.V.'s, minivans and pickup trucks. The administration says the new system will improve fuel economy for these vehicles by about 8 percent by 2011 -- a trivial gain measured against the need, and suspect in any case because the more complex the system, the easier it is to manipulate. Ten states, including New York, filed suit yesterday to force the administration to toughen the standards. 
 Representative Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican from upstate New York, has suggested a simpler, more transparent approach. While building some flexibility into the system, he would abolish the distinction between S.U.V.'s and ordinary passenger vehicles and require a fleetwide average of 33 miles per gallon. This, he estimates, would save about 2.6 million barrels of oil a day by 2025, nearly a third of the current consumption for cars and light trucks.
 If that sounds radically ambitious, consider this bit of history: In 1990, two senators -- Slade Gorton, a conservative Republican, and Richard Bryan, a liberal Democrat -- proposed raising fuel economy standards to 40 miles a gallon over 10 years. They actually got 57 votes for their proposal, which lost to a filibuster. 
 Had it passed, we would probably be consuming half the gasoline we use now and be in better shape to deal with today's price squeeze. There's still time to prepare for the next one.

HEADLINE: TALIBAN THREAT IS SAID TO GROW IN AFGHAN SOUTH

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: TIRIN KOT, Afghanistan, April 27 

 BODY:
Building on a winter campaign of suicide bombings and assassinations and the knowledge that American troops are leaving, the Taliban appear to be moving their insurgency into a new phase, flooding the rural areas of southern Afghanistan with weapons and men.
 Each spring with the arrival of warmer weather, the fighting season here starts up, but the scale of the militants' presence and their sheer brazenness have alarmed Afghans and foreign officials far more than in previous years.
''The Taliban and Al Qaeda are everywhere,'' a shopkeeper, Haji Saifullah, told the commander of American forces in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry, as the general strolled through the bazaar of this town to talk to people. ''It is all right in the city, but if you go outside the city, they are everywhere, and the people have to support them. They have no choice.'' 
 The fact that American troops are pulling out of southern Afghanistan in the coming months, and handing matters over to NATO peacekeepers, who have repeatedly stated that they are not going to fight terrorists, has given a lift to the insurgents, and increased the fears of Afghans. 
 General Eikenberry appealed for patience and support. ''There has not been enough attention paid to Uruzgan,'' he said in a speech to the elders of Uruzgan Province gathered at the governor's house in Tirin Kot, the provincial capital. ''I think the leaders, the Afghan government and the international community recognize this. There is reform coming and this year you will see it.'' 
 The arrival of large numbers of Taliban in the villages, flush with money and weapons, has dealt a blow to public confidence in the Afghan government, already undermined by lack of tangible progress and frustration with corrupt and ineffective leaders.
 This small one-street town is in the Taliban heartland, and the message from the townspeople was bleak.
 Uruzgan, the province where President Hamid Karzai first rallied support against the Taliban in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks, is now, four years later, in the thrall of the Islamic militants once more, and the provincial capital is increasingly surrounded by areas in Taliban control, local and American officials acknowledge. A recent report by a member of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan shown to The New York Times detailed similar fears.
 The new governor, Maulavi Abdul Hakim Munib, 35, who took up his position just a month ago, controls only a ''bubble'' around Tirin Kot, an American military officer said. The rest of the province is so thick with insurgents that all the districts are colored amber or red to indicate that on military maps in the nearby American base. Uruzgan has always been troublesome, yet the map marks a deterioration since last year, when at least one central district had been colored green, the officer said.
 ''The security situation is not good,'' Governor Munib told General Eikenberry and a group of cabinet ministers at a meeting with tribal elders. ''The number of Taliban and enemy is several times more than that of the police and Afghan National Army in this province,'' he said.
 Uruzgan is not the only province teetering out of control. Helmand and Kandahar to the south have been increasingly overrun by militants this year, as large groups of Taliban are reportedly moving through the countryside, intimidating villagers, ambushing vehicles, and spoiling for a fight with coalition or Afghan forces. 
 Insurgents also have the run of parts of Zabul, Ghazni and Paktika Provinces to the southeast, and have increased ambushes on the main Kabul-Kandahar highway. 
 The Bush administration is alarmed, according to a Western intelligence official close to the administration. He said that while senior members of the administration consider the situation in Iraq to be not as bad as portrayed in the press, in Afghanistan the situation is worse than it has been generally portrayed. 
 Asked about the surge in Taliban activity in southern Afghanistan, a Pentagon spokesman, Bryan Whitman, said: ''We have seen Taliban activity fluctuate from time to time.'' The British-led NATO force taking over from the American troops in the south ''has well-equipped, well-led and fully prepared forces to operate in this challenging environment and deal with any threats,'' he added.
 He noted that the United States would continue to be the largest contributor of troops to Afghanistan, and would continue to have primary responsibility for counterterrorism operations and for training Afghan Army units, even with NATO taking over in the south.
 In one of the most serious developments, some 200 Taliban have moved into the district of Panjwai, only a 20-minute drive from the capital of the south, Kandahar, Mr. Karzai's home city. The police and coalition forces clashed with them two weeks ago, yet the Taliban returned, walking in the villages openly with their weapons, and sitting under the trees eating mulberries, according to a resident of the district.
 The resident, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said the Taliban had been demanding food, lodging and the Muslim tithing, zakat, from villagers. Their brazenness and the failure of the United States-led coalition to deter them is turning public opinion about the effectiveness of the government. 
 For the first time the Afghan government has sent 500 men of the newly trained Afghan National Army to the neglected province. The official police force of Uruzgan is 347 strong, with 45 men deployed in each of the five districts, but far fewer actually turn up for work. American officials estimated armed Taliban in the province numbered from 300 to 1,000 men. The governor estimated there were 300 armed insurgents in each district.
 The Taliban are warning the people to expect more attacks, the shopkeeper, Mr. Saifullah, told General Eikenberry. ''During the day the people, the police, and the army are with the government, but during the night, the people, the police, and the army are all with the Taliban and Al Qaeda,'' he said. 
 Another man, Rahmatullah, told the general that his brother had been arrested by American forces and the raids and house searches had made the young men take to the hills to join the militants. ''Release my brother and the tribal elders will persuade the young men to come back home and stop fighting,'' he said. 
 ''The unemployment rate is very high and the people of Uruzgan are very poor,'' said Mullah Hamdullah, the elected head of the provincial council. 
 Unsure of the strength and commitment to fight of the incoming NATO forces -- with British, Canadian, Dutch and Australian contingents -- Afghan provincial officials, who stand first in the Taliban's firing line, have demanded that Mr. Karzai provide them with hundreds more police officers and weapons. 
 The governors of Uruzgan and Kandahar both said in interviews that they have lobbied the president for a force of 200 police officers for every district -- four times current numbers -- and to provide more resources to equip and supply them properly.
 In a recent strategy review, Mr. Karzai agreed to increase the government presence in the frontline provinces, his chief of staff, Jawed Ludin, said. ''We are increasingly hearing this, that there only 40 officers per district, and half of them are protecting the district chief as bodyguards, and the other half are on leave,'' he said. 
 A deputy minister of the interior, Abdul Malik Siddiqi, told the gathering that the government had a plan to send 200 to 250 police officers to each district of Uruzgan, and to find resources to equip them and pay their salaries.
 General Eikenberry expressed caution about the idea, warning that there were not enough trained officers to send to the area, and more important, a lack of good leaders to control those police forces. 
 Uruzgan has suffered from a lingering Taliban presence and its forbidding terrain, which has made security and governing extremely difficult, resulting in neglect from the central government, he said. There has been no police reform or training here, no presence of the Afghan National Army and virtually no development, he said. 
 General Eikenberry is hoping to turn things around this year with new and better local leaders. ''Now we see a lot of those conditions changing,'' he said, in an interview in the cockpit of the C130 military plane on the way to Uruzgan. Replacing the governor, and police and intelligence chiefs, should allow for reform and better governance, he said. Some 500 men of the national army have been deployed in the province and the police should receive better resources.
 Hopes are pinned on Maulavi Munib, an educated, religious man from eastern Afghanistan, who was deputy minister of tribal affairs of the Taliban government. He is starting from scratch since the former governor sold all his vehicles, including police vehicles, and all the arms and ammunition owned by the province. 
 Governor Munib's past brings an added complication, since he remains listed by the United Nations Security Council sanctions committee as a wanted member of the Taliban leadership, which technically bars any government from providing financial, technical or military assistance to his province.
 The Afghan government has formally requested that he, and three other former Taliban officials, including two members of Afghanistan's new Parliament, be removed from the list, a process that demands the agreement of all Security Council members, but Afghan officials said Russia remained opposed to the proposal.


CORRECTION-DATE: May 10, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on May 3 about the growing brazenness of Taliban insurgents in southern Afghanistan referred imprecisely to the combat policies of NATO peacekeeping forces that are scheduled to take over responsibilities as American troops withdraw from that region in coming months. While some contributing nations to the NATO forces have said they do not intend to fight Taliban and other militants, others, including Canada, have said they consider the NATO mission to be more than just peacekeeping and would operate under the same rules of engagement as the Americans.

 BODY:
CHESTERHILL, a tucked-away village in Ohio's Appalachian southeast, has been on technology's periphery for years. Its 312 residents have limited cellphone service and no broadband Internet service. The town's antiquated telephone lines struggle to handle minimal Internet speeds for those who do dial up. 
 But thanks to a rural technology grant from the American Distance Education Consortium and a network built by Ohio State University's Information Office, residents are set to go high speed wirelessly. With a satellite receiver mounted at their library, and a broadcast antenna on the village water tower, Chesterhill, where 20 percent of the residents live below the poverty line, now has a 1.5-megabit Internet pipeline in the air.
Switchboard In the Sky 
Local governments across the country are getting into the wireless Internet business. Communities left behind by the high-technology revolution of the last two decades view municipal networks as an affordable means of renewing their economic competitiveness and a way to bridge the digital divide between technology haves and have-nots.
 Big cities and their suburbs see potential in municipal Wi-Fi, too. Systems are being developed in San Francisco, Philadelphia and Chicago, while last week Suffolk County on Long Island announced it was planning a network that would reach 1.5 million people spread over more than 900 square miles.
 The new programs have put local governments into the telecommunications arena, where they sometimes work with conventional service providers and sometimes compete with them. 
 Many telecommunications providers are resisting such community networks, particularly when they overlap with the carriers' own service territories. Arguing that they are better suited to the task than their municipal rivals, telecommunications companies are bidding to manage civic networks. At the same time, industry-friendly legislative proposals at the state and federal levels threaten to limit municipal control.
 Chesterhill's wireless network, which began service last month, has sparked excitement in the village and already led to several new community programs. The library will offer higher-education courses through regional colleges; the volunteer fire department will work with online distributors for discounted equipment; and local businesses expect to set up Web sites. 
 Ann Horner, a lifelong resident of Chesterhill and owner of the Posy Place, a flower shop, said she planned to discontinue FTD floral service and manage her own customers online. ''I can keep that 20 percent, and my customers can get their full value,'' she said. 
 Municipal wireless networks are cheaper to build than cable or fiber- optic networks and are easier to deploy. According to one study by muniwireless.com, an industry Weblog, more than 120 such networks are up and running around the country, including some that allow public access and others that are exclusively for city services. Nearly 60 other cities and towns have requested proposals from vendors or taken steps toward creating networks. 
 Rollouts of municipal networks in major metropolitan regions like San Francisco and Philadelphia have attracted attention, but development of community wireless networks holds even greater promise for out-of-the-way and poorer areas. For these smaller cities and towns, the networks are a tool for more efficient municipal operations and a way to provide inexpensive Internet access to residents who could not afford it.
 A case in point is the Tribal Digital Village, a high-speed network linking 14 remote Indian reservations spread across 250 square miles of mountains and valleys in San Diego County, Calif. The network operates by solar-powered antennas, which relay signals between tribal settlements as far as 26 miles apart. The mountaintop backbone attains transmission speeds in excess of 45 megabits a second, which is equivalent to the speeds used by Internet service providers and major Web sites. 
 Broadband access has greatly improved communications on a swath of reservation land that still lacks full telephone service -- and in some places even water and electricity. 
 Michael Peralta, a descendant of the Rincon Band of Luiseno Indians and the network's administrator, regularly scales the reservation's mountains to install and maintain the equipment, sometimes with helicopter assistance. Mr. Peralta says the newfound connectivity has quickly changed life on the reservation. 
 ''There are elders who a little while ago didn't know what a computer was,'' he said. ''Now they bug me whenever they can't get to their e-mail.''
 More than a social services project, the Tribal Digital Village is also a potential revenue source for the tribes. ''There are million-dollar homes out there, and they can't get broadband,'' Mr. Peralta said. ''We're looking at a new business plan that could provide broadband to those homes as well.'' 
 To speed the process and ease network responsibilities, some communities have turned to private companies for help operating municipal wireless intranets and providing Internet access to the public. 
 Several approaches are being tested. Philadelphia established a nonprofit corporation in 2004 to plan its municipal network. It contracted with the Internet service provider EarthLink to manage the infrastructure and make subsidized access available to the public, although the city has yet to finish plans or begin building the network. 
 In San Francisco, the city selected Google and EarthLink to offer tiered levels of wireless service. Google will provide free public access at near-dial-up speed, paid for by in-browser advertising, while EarthLink will charge around $20 a month for faster, ad-free service. It is unclear when the network will be completed, and last week a local politician threatened to block the arrangement for lack of public comment. 
 In Suffolk County, the plan announced last week calls for a comprehensive countywide network for use by the government and the public. Sharon Cates-Williams, Suffolk County commissioner for information technology, said that officials were evaluating how to pay for the system. 
 ''It's a little too early to tell what we're going to do,'' Ms. Cates-Williams said. She added that she would look at other cities' business plans for ideas, and expected proposals from providers by the end of the year. ''I want something that is not going to have any expense to the taxpayer, whether that's public or commercial or a combination.'' 
 Chicago announced in February that it would build a citywide wireless network requiring no public financing. City officials said they would begin requesting bids this spring from private-sector companies to install and manage the system. Other cities have chosen not to rely on existing providers but handle network administration on their own. 
 After unsuccessfully petitioning Verizon to bring broadband to their community, town officials in Scottsburg, Ind., decided to run their Wi-Fi network like a public utility. Scottsburg charges home users $35 a month for access to a 512-kilobit-per-second data stream (comparable to residential DSL service).
 Some municipalities charge nothing at all. St. Cloud, Fla., where the city-led municipal network is among the showpieces of the community wireless movement, was the first to install a free citywide network, paying for it with money saved by administrative efficiencies generated by the network itself. 
 Glenn Sangiovanni, St. Cloud's former mayor, rallied for the network. ''We had a true need for economic development,'' he said. ''We needed a hook, and looked at making this a tech-savvy community.''
 Mr. Sangiovanni said that the rising cost of broadband service was the best argument for the public network. A study by the city showed that 47 percent of the residents were paying $450 a year for broadband, a third more than the average household's city tax bill. In all, nearly $4 million in broadband fees was leaving the community every year, Mr. Sangiovanni said. 
 ''What if we could keep those dollars here, and spark the local economy with this project?'' he said. 
 St. Cloud, an Orlando suburb of about 22,000 residents, spent $2.6 million to set up a network over 15 square miles. The city expects to save $650,000 annually in operating efficiencies like supplying Internet-based cellphone service to city workers. As of April 20, 45 days after it began service, 36 percent of the city had logged nearly 192,000 hours online. The network will not only help increase the efficiency of existing systems, officials say, but it will also help develop new services in health care, education and public safety. 
 ''We're going to be doing things with public safety, and mounting video cameras in parks so our police force won't have to be everywhere in order to keep the city safe,'' said Howard DeYoung, director of information technology for St. Cloud. ''This is going to open up performance dramatically.'' 
 When St. Cloud was considering its wireless plan, it hired MRI, a branding and consulting company, to hold public meetings on the subject to build support. 
 ''We told them that this was no more expensive to install than a roadway intersection,'' said Jonathan Baltuch, MRI's president. 
 Despite having a free wireless network in St. Cloud, Mr. Baltuch said, there is still an option for existing providers there to sell better offerings. ''Their opportunity is to deliver 20-megabit, or even 100-megabit service, to offer a luxury service to premium clients,'' he said.
 Established telecommunications companies, meanwhile, argue that they are better equipped than local governments to provide the infrastructure for city wireless networks. 
 ''In many cases, it's a much more effective solution to work with a service provider,'' said Jason Hillary, a spokesman for AT&T, which has bid on city projects in Houston and Grand Rapids, Mich. ''We have infrastructure in a local level and at a backbone level, and we're updating the networks on a daily basis.''
 In some cases, industry spokesmen say, there is no need for municipal networks at all.
 Link Hoewing, vice president for technology policy at Verizon Communications, said that carriers like Verizon are already expert at providing broadband service. ''Where there's a lack of broadband, it makes sense for communities to take care of this,'' he said, ''but in urban areas, we believe the private sector already responds well.'' 
 Mr. Hoewing said there was a role for community hot spots, however, in places like libraries and city halls, as well as in rural communities beyond the carriers' reach. ''We have not supported outright bans on municipal Wi-Fi networks,'' he said. 
 Yet state and federal legislators are pushing for just that. Telecommunications companies and cable television providers are supporters of laws that could hamper cities' abilities to deploy networks, both wired and wireless. Fifteen states have passed such legislation. 
 Two federal bills introduced in 2005 threaten to rein in municipal broadband projects. The Preserving Innovation in Telecom Act, introduced by Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas, and the Broadband Investment and Consumer Choice Act, sponsored by Senator John Ensign, Republican of Nevada, would limit public services' ability to coexist with private providers. 
 John Eger, professor of communications and public policy at San Diego State University and a former director of the White House Office of Telecommunications Policy, said such legislation could backfire if telecommunications companies shut out their largest customers, cities. 
 ''Providers don't want a partnership, they want to provide it all by themselves,'' he said. 
 Mr. Eger faulted the federal government for failing to curtail the companies' influence over policy.
 The Congressional battle may be shifting. Another new proposal, the Community Broadband Act, sponsored by Senators Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, and John McCain, Republican of Arizona, would protect municipal broadband programs as long as the public providers did not discriminate against private ones. And last week, the House of Representatives defeated a proposed amendment to another communications bill that would have made it easier for supporters of incumbent telecommunications providers to block rural Wi-Fi networks. 
 ''I would hope the incumbents stand back and look at what they're seeing across the country,'' said Jim Baller, a lawyer in Washington who represents local governments in utility issues. ''There is a way to view this situation as an opportunity.'' 
 Mr. Baller says that municipalities considering wireless programs can draw a lesson from history, and likens the modern wireless movement to the rural electrification movement of the late 1800's. Then, communities beyond the reach of the electric companies took control of their electric futures and struck out with their own power plans. 
 ''And they were successful,'' Mr. Baller said. More than 2,000 of the original electrification groups still exist in rural communities and big cities like Los Angeles.
 ''There are a great many parallels,'' he said. ''Broadband is becoming today's platform for everything we do: economics, education, safety, medicine and cultural enrichment. You can't blink this away.''

HEADLINE: Best Cellphone Company? All of Them, to Hear Them Say It

BYLINE: By Ken Belson

 BODY:
FOR decades, marketers in crowded categories like banking and fast food have tried to avoid price wars by promoting qualities like service and convenience. Now cellphone companies have joined the fray, and their ads are causing backbiting as intense as any showdown between Coke and Pepsi.
 In the latest cycle of campaigns, begun last year, Verizon Wireless has been promoting itself as ''America's Most Reliable Network.'' In more recent advertisements, Sprint Nextel says ''no one has a more powerful network'' while Cingular says its customers experience the ''fewest dropped calls.''
The emphasis on service quality -- which broadly includes factors like coverage area, dropped calls and the speed of data connections -- comes as the carriers spend tens of billions of dollars to upgrade their networks, leaving them eager to avoid price wars that could undercut their chances of recouping their money. 
 ''None of them want to lead with price, so if you have a network that is better, it's great,'' said Jonathan Atkin, a telecommunications analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ''Spending on voice calls is falling even without a price war, so they don't want to cut prices.'' On a per-minute basis, the price of cellphone calls has fallen by about 80 percent since 1996, according to J. D. Power & Associates.
 From a consumer standpoint, the carriers' emphasis on quality is not unwarranted. According to a poll conducted in January by the Harris Interactive Technology Research group, 78 percent of those surveyed said their cellphone companies could improve coverage and service quality.
 The three biggest cellphone carriers spent $3.1 billion on advertising last year, as much as 20 percent of that on promoting their networks. The question is how well consumers can distinguish between the claims and whether they are switching to another provider because of them.
 As evidence of their ads' success, the companies point to the millions of new customers they are signing up (often at the expense of smaller carriers) and an increase in customer loyalty. Verizon Wireless and Cingular, for instance, both added 1.7 million new subscribers in the first quarter, and Sprint added 1.3 million subscribers. The largest carriers have also reduced their churn, or the percentage of customers who switch to rival services.
 But there are few precise ways to figure out what role their ad campaigns contributed to their recent performance. The companies also accuse each other of playing fast and loose with the facts in their ads.
 Take Verizon Wireless. Since early 2005, the company has run ads promoting its network reliability. Some of the ads highlight the fact that about 100 of the company's engineers drive around the country making calls to compare Verizon phones with those of other carriers. Not surprisingly, Verizon has found that it has the best service.
 The company insists that its tests are scrupulously impartial. ''Everyone is given a fair chance to place a call and ensure that the call stays up,'' said Mike Haberman, who is in charge of Verizon's cellular network in the New York metropolitan area. 
 Cingular and Sprint Nextel, however, question the objectivity of Verizon's findings, and point to other data that they say shows they have better networks.
 Verizon accuses Cingular and Sprint Nextel of introducing ''me too'' campaigns on network quality. The two companies dispute that.
 ''The fact that they were saying they were the most reliable had to be challenged,'' said Marc Lefar, the chief marketing officer at Cingular. ''We cover more potential customers on voice and data, and now we have the fewest dropped calls. It's a direct result of the investments we made in the past year.''
 Cingular Wireless, which spent $6.5 billion on network improvements last year, says its ads are based on findings by Telephia, an independent research firm that collects data on mobile phone networks.
 In a letter sent on Monday to the four largest wireless companies, Telephia confirmed that Cingular had a ''statistically significant lower dropped-call rate than the competition across some market/time period groupings.'' But Telephia also said it had ''no knowledge of the specific methodology (markets, time periods or statistical thresholds) Cingular used to reach the nationwide 'lowest dropped call' conclusion.'' 
 A Telephia spokesman said she was not aware of any letter being sent to the carriers.
 For its part, Sprint Nextel says its ''most powerful'' network includes the widest coverage area and the best handsets and features. The company also points to reports from J. D. Power that show Sprint Nextel has made more progress than others in improving its network. Sprint Nextel has broadened its claims, yet also says its ads are more focused because they link network quality with its handsets and features.
 ''We're attempting to take a more rifle-shot approach than the broad spending by the two big carpet bombers,'' said Mark Schweitzer, the chief marketing officer at Sprint Nextel, referring to Verizon and Cingular. ''They were successful for getting more credit than they deserved.''
 Verizon spent $1.38 billion on advertising in 2005 while Cingular spent $1.23 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence. Sprint Nextel spent $450 million and T-Mobile spent $484 million.
 Plenty of that money still goes toward promoting phones and service plans, like Sprint's ''Fair and Flexible'' campaign.
 Even so, some analysts say that Verizon has already won the debate over who has the best network service and that Sprint and Cingular should find other, more distinct messages to send to consumers. They note that in a survey compiled by Consumer Reports last year, consumers said that Verizon had the best coverage in 17 of the 18 cities covered by the poll.
 ''Anyone who's been through business school would find it odd'' that Verizon's rivals are focusing on network quality, said David Chamberlain, an analyst at In-Stat, a research firm. ''There are huge things to talk about -- data speeds, 3G service, customer service. I don't think networks are the last thing you can talk about.''
 Some research even suggests that network quality may be less of an issue than companies and even consumers think it is. In the 50 largest markets nationwide, more than 97 percent of wireless calls are connected and completed successfully, according to Telephia. More than one-third of the wireless subscribers surveyed by Telephia also said their network quality had improved since they signed up with their current provider, while only 13 percent said it had declined.
 The consumers who really value network quality, Mr. Chamberlain and others say, are those who use a cellphone as their only phone and those who rely on their phones for work. Many other consumers, particularly younger ones, are more likely to choose a carrier based on the handset, not the quality of the network, they said.
 ''Honestly, these ads don't make a dent,'' said Meredith Belloli, the president of Slant, a marketing agency that focuses on consumers in their 20's. Young consumers ''are aware of the 'Can you hear me now?' guy, but it comes down to the style and coolness of the phones.''

HEADLINE: Signs of an Upturn In New Jersey

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
It has been a long, hard climb back to reasonable health for the New Jersey commercial office market since the Sept. 11 attack in New York.
 In the weeks after the attack, there was a belief that businesses in Lower Manhattan and elsewhere in New York City might consider moving to New Jersey, and a number of companies offered a flood of space for sublease.
But New Jersey landlords apparently anticipated a much greater need for temporary space than materialized, mistakenly thinking that mass relocation might occur. Then, consolidation and cutbacks by telecommunications and technology companies in 2002 and 2003 emptied out more offices, and a two-year economic slowdown amplified the effect. 
 It wasn't until the second half of 2005 that the situation began to move in the right direction. The average vacancy rate for office space, which soared to nearly 20 percent from about 14 percent in the six-month period after Sept. 11, stayed at 19 percent or above through last year. For the first quarter of 2006, the rate was 18.4 percent, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate company.
 In addition, average annual asking rents for office space rose to $25.18 a square foot in the first quarter of this year, up 55 cents from the preceding quarter, and up $1.04 a square foot from a year earlier, according to CB Richard Ellis, another major company in commercial property. Analysts there termed the higher rents ''a sure sign the market is gaining momentum.''
 Still, Andrew Merin, who is vice chairman of the metropolitan area capital markets group of Cushman & Wakefield, which brokers sales of commercial real estate to investors, summed it up: ''It has not been a pretty picture for office space over the last four years, any way you look at it. Things will take a while longer to straighten out.''
 Mr. Merin said that while his group continued to execute numerous significant deals each year on office properties, it was currently most bullish on multifamily rental properties.
 ''The amount of capital chasing multifamily assets has reached record levels,'' he said. ''During 2006, we expect to see a renewed focus on urban redevelopment projects as families look to move to more urban areas.'' 
 New Jersey commercial office developers uniformly insist that they are bullish on the office market, given the signs of improvement. Speculative office space construction has started up again, with one million square feet under construction around New Jersey, as GVA Williams pointed out in its first-quarter market analysis, and another half-million square feet is planned.
 Nevertheless, Hartz Mountain Industries, which helped to build up the state's largest concentration of office space, in Jersey City, decided sometime last year that that riverfront city could not absorb the additional office space it had planned to build and began trying to sell sites to residential developers. 
 In 2000 to 2005, about seven million square feet of new office space was created in Jersey City, but currently there is not a single project on the drawing board, according to city officials. On the other hand, about 15,000 new apartments are in the construction pipeline. 
 Without commenting publicly, Hartz sold one of two major downtown sites that it owned to the home-building giant K. Hovnanian just last month. Hovnanian announced it had purchased the site near the Hudson riverfront at 77 Hudson Street for $65 million and would act as a co-developer of the property to create a condominium tower and a rental tower, with a combined 1,300 units.
 Hartz has been reported to be near a deal to sell a second Jersey City site to Roseland Properties for a residential project in Jersey City, and it is also known to be trying to sell a site near the Lincoln Tunnel in Weehawken.
 A number of big developers of office space have, meanwhile, hedged their bets by opening new divisions that build apartments, or by starting redevelopment projects that include housing and stores along with office space.
 SJP Properties of Parsippany, which is known for building high-end office developments around New Jersey, including the two-building Waterfront Corporate Center in Hoboken, seems to be waiting for the right moment to break ground for a third building.
 At the same time, SJP's residential division, established in 2004, has moved forward with construction of two condominium towers in Manhattan: one with 250 units at Eighth Avenue and 46th Street, and another at 45 Park Avenue on the site of the former Sheraton Russell. SJP also has a plan to build 68 very-high-end town house condominiums, each with 4,000 square feet of living space, in Peapack, N.J. 
 Two other office developers have big mixed-use projects in the works. The Matrix Development Group is at work on a $400 million waterfront development in Newark that will create 500 residential units in four towers in addition to a hotel, retail space and a 14-story office building. 
 The Advance Realty Group is developing a center in adjacent Harrison, planned to include more than 700 residential units next to a new professional soccer stadium, 140,000 square feet of stores and 190,000 square feet of office space.
 Mr. Merin predicts a major surge in rental apartment sales in New Jersey, especially along the Hudson. After several slower years, the rental market has been increasing, he said: ''Occupancy rates have increased to the low- to-mid 90 percent range in the region.'' 
 He also said that ''concessions'' -- like several months of free rent, or free amenities and upgrades that were being offered at many higher-end buildings while interest rates stayed at record lows and home-buying fever was at high pitch -- are becoming less common. 
 ''As condominium developers become slightly less aggressive with pricing, and interest rates begin to rise,'' Mr. Merin said, ''more people will opt to move into rental apartments, and they will become a better and better investment.''

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, driving the Dow Jones industrial average to a close above 11,400 for the first time since early in 2000. A jump in oil prices lifted major energy shares and earnings surpassed forecasts.
 The insurer St. Paul Travelers, the manufacturer Emerson Electric and the agricultural processor Archer Daniels Midland all posted stronger-than-expected quarterly results.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 73.16 points, or 0.64 percent, to 11,416.45. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 8.02 points, or 0.61 percent, at 1,313.21, a five-year high. 
 The Nasdaq composite index gained 5.05 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,309.84. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization stocks rose 6.49 points, or 0.85 percent, to 767.61.
 Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered decliners by a margin of nearly 2 to 1. Big Board volume was 1.72 billion shares, above last year's daily average of 1.61 billion.
 Crude oil for June delivery settled 91 cents higher in New York, at $74.61 a barrel, amid new statements from Iran, a big producer, and what appeared to be the start of a new confrontation over Iranian nuclear development at the United Nations.
 The dollar, which has had a succession of weak days against major currencies, fell further yesterday against the euro, the yen and the British pound. It also fell against the Canadian dollar, which settled at 90.44 cents. 
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 6/32 yesterday, to a price of 95 10/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, was 5.11 percent, down from 5.14 percent late Monday.
 Interest-rate-sensitive stocks rebounded as investors looked past rate concerns fueled by a television report the day before. Shares of J. P. Morgan Chase rose 72 cents, to $45.50.
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was reported saying that the markets had misinterpreted his recent comments about a potential pause in the Fed's 22-month-long cycle of rate increases. 
 Helping the Nasdaq were shares of Apple Computer, the maker of iPod music players. Apple has renewed contracts with the world's four largest music companies to sell songs through its iTunes music store. Yesterday, Apple shares rose $2.02, or 2.9 percent, to $71.62.
 The stock of Archer Daniels Midland jumped $3.90, or 10.3 percent, to $41.90, a record. Emerson Electric rose $1.11, or 1.3 percent, to $86.53. St. Paul Travelers, which also raised its 2006 forecast, gained $2.20, or more than 5 percent, to $45.60.
 Earnings for S.& P. 500 companies are forecast to rise 13.5 percent in the first quarter, up from a forecast of 12.5 percent last week, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Eric Kuby, chief investment officer of the North Star Investment Management Company, commented, ''We've gotten good reports from a variety of companies, supporting the thesis that corporate earnings are going to increase in the double digits this year.'' 
 The share prices of energy companies rose along with crude oil futures. Exxon Mobil, the largest publicly traded oil company, gained $1.25, to $64.67. Chevron advanced $1.63, to $62.80. The refiner Valero Energy rose $1.19, closing at $67.14.
 An auto parts supplier, Visteon, advanced $1.09, or 18.6 percent, to $6.95, on volume of 14.9 million shares. It posted an unexpected quarterly profit and raised its full-year earnings target.
 Adobe Systems, the design software maker, bucked the positive trend, posting quarterly profit and revenue at the low end of its previous targets. Its shares dropped 6.7 percent, to $35.76, after hours.

HEADLINE: Student Housing Leads an Urban Turnaround

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
The transformation of Temple University in recent years from a commuter school to a residential campus with a more geographically diverse student population is stimulating private investment in one of the city's most troubled neighborhoods.
 Today, more than 8,000 students live on or near the main campus in North Philadelphia, twice as many as four years ago. About half live in housing built by the university or created by private developers on property owned by Temple.
 As Temple's student population has swelled to 34,000, other private developers have been acting on their own to take advantage of the demand for student housing, where rents can exceed what young professionals pay to live in Center City, the downtown area less than two miles to the south.
 The Temple area's largest commercial project so far is nearing completion after long delays and two false starts, including one by the developer of Harlem U.S.A., a six-year-old shopping center that helped spur commercial development on 125th Street in Manhattan. 
 The $80 million project is being built on city-owned land at Broad Street and Cecil B. Moore Avenue, just opposite the southern end of Temple's main campus and next to a subway station. It will house 1,200 students and the first movie theater in North Philadelphia in decades.
 Development around Temple, a public university, is still relatively modest in scale, especially in comparison with what has occurred since the mid-1990's in the West Philadelphia neighborhood surrounding the much wealthier University of Pennsylvania, the city's largest private employer. Penn invests nearly $314 million a year in building projects, according to a report issued last month by the Econsult Corporation, a local consulting company. 
 Unlike Penn, Temple is not investing its own money off-campus. Instead, Temple is spending more than $400 million on campus buildings like its new student and technology centers. But it is no longer building dormitories. The last dorm developed by the university, 1300 Cecil B. Moore Avenue, opened in August 2000, at a cost of $60,000 for each of its 1,044 beds, said Gregory S. Rost, chief of staff to the college president, David Adamany. ''That's a lot of money,'' Mr. Rost said. ''It's a question of what do you want to do with your money?'' 
 During his tenure, Mr. Adamany, who will step down in June, accelerated plans begun by his predecessor, Peter Liacouras, to create a lively campus and raise the university's academic standards. He also sought to improve relations with the surrounding community. University officials acknowledge that Temple has not always been a good neighbor. In the 1960's, the university displaced thousands of residents and businesses to expand its main campus. 
 ''There are still some people out there with fears of the big institution taking over,'' said Darrell L. Clarke, a city councilman who represents North Philadelphia. ''I'm not going to tell you there's no concern, but it's minimal. The student housing has created an environment that's going to bring in retail development that's needed by the community.''
 To house its growing student population, the university signed long-term ground leases for underused buildings with private developers. In one case, the red-brick Kardon Building, a former cardboard box factory at 10th Street, between Montgomery Avenue and Berks Street, was converted by Philadelphia Management and Companies, a local apartment developer, into housing for 500 students. 
 In 2004, American Campus Communities, a real estate investment trust based in Austin, Tex., opened University Village, a building with 750 beds on Temple property. (Student housing is often leased by the bed, rather than the apartment, so that individual students are not liable for their roommates' rent.)
 While these buildings and others were going up, a major retail project envisioned for the neighborhood stalled. The plans, announced in 1998, called for 12 movie screens, but the timing was bad, said the original developer, Drew R. Greenwald, president of Grid Properties of New York, which built Harlem U.S.A. The movie theater industry was retrenching after a period of overexpansion, and several companies had filed for bankruptcy protection. In 2002, the city withdrew the development rights, prompting Grid to sue the city, accusing it of breach of contract. The case is still pending.
 A second developer, Kravco, withdrew from the project in 2003 when the developer was acquired by the Simon Property Group.
 The project finally moved forward in 2004 after the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority signed a long-term ground lease with Tower Investments, a local development company. Tower's president, Bart Blatstein, is a Temple graduate who built two other movie theaters in Philadelphia. 
 The retail portion of the project, now known as Avenue North and scaled back to 93,000 feet, including a seven-screen theater, is expected to open this summer, Mr. Blatstein said. When Mr. Blatstein was unable to attract an established movie exhibitor to run the theater, he decided to manage it himself.
 About half the retail space is leased, he said. Among the tenants is Bank of America, a welcome addition to an area with few bank branches, said Kenneth E. Scott, the president of Beech Interplex, a community development group that has also built student housing around Temple.
 Stephen D. Steinour, the president of the Citizens Financial Group, the parent of Citizens Bank of Philadelphia, which helped finance the retail building using tax credits intended to encourage inner-city development, said he was not concerned about the pace of the leasing. ''This is a home-run site,'' he said. 
 Before planning the student housing, Mr. Blatstein said, he asked students what they wanted. ''They said, 'private bathrooms, retail at the base of the building, vending machines and flat-screen TV's,' '' he recalled. The housing, called the Edge, has those things and other fancy touches like maple doors and tanning beds. Each student will pay $500 a month for a furnished apartment, sometimes doubling up two to a room. The average rent last year in Center City for an unfurnished two-bedroom apartment was $1,902, according to the Center City District, a business improvement district.
 ''Students are much more demanding today,'' said Jim Titus, the managing director of Realpoint, the research division of Capmark Investments. ''They want the ability to have wireless Internet. The years of sharing the big old common bathrooms are over.''
 Many students will pay a premium for convenience to campus, said William T. Bergman, vice president for operations at Temple. ''A lot of students like the idea of getting out of bed in the morning and they're there.''
 Student housing was once considered a high-risk business, but it has become more mainstream and can be very lucrative, said Kenneth T. Rosen, chairman of the Rosen Consulting Group in Berkeley, Calif. But turnover is higher than it is for traditional apartments, and the tenants pose more credit risks, he said. '' It's not a slam-dunk,'' he said. ''It has to be carefully managed.''
 Chris Vecchiarelli, the president of the VDP Corporation, a New York residential developer who has been building housing on Sydenham Street for 140 students, said that catering to this market requires certain precautions. He said he installs extra security cameras and refrains from building roof decks, which might encourage rowdy behavior.
 Jonathan Weiss, a local developer who started building student housing near Temple in 1997, said he is worried that the market might be reaching a saturation point.
 ''There's been a lot of fast development there,'' said Mr. Weiss, who has rehabilitated 45 buildings from the late 19th century, with 400 beds, and has others in the pipeline. ''How long that will run is a question.''

PERSON: Louis Rukeyser

HEADLINE: Louis Rukeyser, Television Host, Dies at 73

BYLINE: BY JAMES GRANT. 
James Grant was a panelist on ''Wall Street Week'' for 10 years, beginning in 1988.

 BODY:
Louis Rukeyser, the exquisitely tailored and pun-loving television host who helped millions of Americans believe that they could get rich in the stock market, or at least begin to understand it, died yesterday at his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 73. 
 He died of multiple myeloma, said his brother Bud Rukeyser.
When ''Wall Street Week'' was broadcast for the first time on Nov. 20, 1970, probably nobody, not even the always self-assured Mr. Rukeyser, dreamed that the show would run for 32 years while attracting the biggest audience on public television and making its host a celebrity in the improbable field of light-hearted, free-market-oriented financial commentary. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was then languishing, and the population of American mutual funds numbered a scant 323. 
 And though the Dow continued to languish (not until 1982 did it push above 1,000, a mark it had first set in 1966), ''Wall Street Week'' prospered. ''I invented the job of economic commentary on television,'' Mr. Rukeyser said in 1980. He was already well along in inventing the medium of investment broadcasting. 
 ''Fridays at 8:30 find me -- amply fed, digestive organs ruminating contentedly to the rhythmic sloshing of martini juice -- sitting in my Louis Quinze armchair awaiting another installment of 'Wall Street Week,' '' wrote Russell Baker in The New York Times at the beginning of the show's second decade. ''By 8:33 my mind is reeling so wildly with gyrations of the Dow Jones average and the pinwheeling of money funds, Treasury bills and gold markets that I often require a calming infusion of brandy.''
 The show attained its biggest audience, some six million viewers, in the mid-1980's. 
 Mr. Rukeyser, though he prodded the financial gurus who appeared on the program to forecast the stock market (the rosier the outlook, the better he liked it, as a rule), he usually kept his own predictive counsel. 
 But when, in 1980, he uncharacteristically ventured part way out on a limb -- ''I think we have entered the decade of the common stock,'' he said -- he proved only partly correct. In fact, the market had embarked on a nearly two-decade up-cycle, and Mr. Rukeyser was started on his own professional bull market. 
 ''Wall Street Week'' had as its point of origin not the beating heart of American finance in Lower Manhattan but the leafy Baltimore suburb of Owings Mills, Md. The show was the brainchild of Anne Truax Darlington, a producer with Maryland Public Broadcasting, and the original corps of panelists was recruited from the Baltimore financial community, not previously noted for its telegenic possibilities. 
 Mr. Rukeyser's supporting cast members (later augmented by experts from outside Baltimore) became little celebrities in their own right. ''I get recognized in bus lines,'' one long-serving panelist, Monte Gordon, remarked in 1990. ''I get recognized when I'm eating in restaurants. There's a lot of psychic satisfaction to being on the show.''
 There was money at stake, too. The value of an appearance on ''Wall Street Week'' to each week's ''special guest''-- mutual-fund portfolio manager, bank trust officer, economist -- climbed as the bull stock market went higher and higher.
 ''So how badly do people want to get on?'' The Times asked a New York publicist, Len Kessler, in 1990. ''It's spelled k-i-l-l,'' said Mr. Kessler. 
 Louis Richard Rukeyser was second of four sons of the financial journalist Merryle S. Rukeyser, who wrote a syndicated column in the Hearst newspapers. 
 Louis Rukeyser graduated from the Woodrow Wilson School of Princeton University in 1954. He took a reporting job at The Baltimore Sun and, within five years, was made London bureau chief, an unusually swift rise through the newsroom ranks. He joined ABC News in 1965 as a correspondent and commentator. Not until 1973 did he judge it safe to quit his day job for a still-unproven ''Wall Street Week.'' 
 It was a decision that he never regretted. After 20 years on the air, Mr. Rukeyser was earning $300,000 a year from the show and $1 million or more in annual speaking income, each speech bearing the same title, ''What's Ahead for the Economy'' -- the echo of the title of a book he wrote for Simon & Schuster in 1983.
 He produced, in addition, a thrice-weekly newspaper column and a book on investing (''How to Make Money in Wall Street,'' Doubleday, 1974). Later he added a pair of newsletters, Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street and Louis Rukeyser's Mutual Funds. He flew first class, loved to gamble, slept in the best and gaudiest suites in the finest hotels and dressed every inch the sybarite he was. In 1991, The Fashion Foundation of America pronounced him the ''best-dressed man in finance.''
 The host of ''Wall Street Week'' (''with Louis Rukeyser,'' he never failed to add to the show's title) and self-described champion of the ''little guy'' could be openly contemptuous of professional investors, a sentiment many of them warmly reciprocated. Mr. Rukeyser reserved his most withering scorn for the ''gloomy Guses'' and ''Wrong-Way Corrigans'' who warned of financial troubles that, during the prosperous 1990's, never transpired. 
 An eternal bull on the stock market, the more bullish, and less tolerant of dissenting bears he became, the higher the averages climbed. On the program of Nov. 5, 1999, Mr. Rukeyser announced the firing of the veteran panelist Gail Dudak for her 156 consecutive weeks of bearishly errant forecasting. Ms. Dudak heard the news from her neighbors the next morning. The stock market peaked four months later. 
 Though ''Wall Street Week'' never fell from the top of the heap of TV financial programs (a pile that owed much of its impressive height to Mr. Rukeyser's success), viewership slipped as stock prices fell and as competition from other financial media increased. In March 2002, Maryland Public TV announced that the snowy-haired Mr. Rukeyser would be eased out to make room for a youth movement led by the staff of Fortune Magazine. 
 Mr. Rukeyser would have none of it. ''I want you to rise up out of your chairs,'' he summoned his viewers from the set of ''Wall Street Week' the next Friday evening, ''not to shout, 'I'm mad as hell and not going to take it anymore!' but,'' he added, to ''write or e-mail your local PBS station saying you heard Louis Rukeyser is still going to have a program and that you'd like to see it.'' 
 Mr. Rukeyser was fired. But he quickly re-established the show at CNBC. He took pride in his new success and glee in the spectacle of Maryland Public Broadcasting suffering a forced retrenchment as his sponsors decamped from public television with him. (The Fortune version of ''Wall Street Week'' was canceled in 2005.) 
 Failing health forced Mr. Rukeyser off the air in 2003. He was presented with the Gerald Loeb Lifetime Achievement Emmy for Business and Financial Reporting in 2004. 
 Besides his brother Bud, of West Palm Beach, Fla., he is survived by his wife, Alexandra; three daughters, Beverley Bellisio of Middletown, Conn., Susan Rukeyser of Amarillo, Tex., and Stacy Rukeyser of West Hollywood, Calif.; two grandchildren; and two other brothers, William S., of Knoxville, Tenn., and Robert, of Greenwich. 
 One cost of celebrity for Mr. Rukeyser was the jibes he would have to bear while indulging his fondness for casino gambling. No sooner had he settled into a blackjack game, he once recalled, than someone would ask him if the odds at the table were really better than those on Wall Street.

HEADLINE: Ruling Sets Back a Development in Yonkers

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, May 2 

 BODY:
A state judge ruled on Tuesday that the City of Yonkers violated local and county laws when it reduced the number of votes required to approve a zoning change for a development of homes, offices and stores in the northwest part of the city.
 In a 13-page decision, Justice Nicholas Colabella of State Supreme Court in Westchester County said the City Council erred in November when it abolished a provision in the city code requiring the votes of five of its seven members to approve zoning changes for any project rejected by the Westchester County Planning Board. 
The Council lowered the required number of votes for such zoning changes to a bare majority of four -- all that the project's supporters on the Council were able to muster. 
 The judge also concluded that Yonkers should have held a public hearing on the proposed change and should have referred it to the county's Planning Board before the Council voted on it. 
 Justice Colabella's decision means that the Council's 4-to-3 vote to approve a zoning change for the $660 million Ridge Hill Village was invalid. City officials said on Tuesday that they planned to appeal, but for now the developer will be allowed to continue to work on the site and prepare it for construction, according to the Council's president, Chuck Lesnick, who was among those who challenged the new voting procedure in court.
 Mr. Lesnick and others who went to court are not seeking to stop the project but to scale back its scope to reduce its potential impact on traffic.
 The ruling is the latest in a series of setbacks for the Ridge Hill project since it was proposed three years ago and was met with vociferous opposition by nearby residents concerned about its size and the increased traffic it might generate. 
 ''We are disappointed by this decision, but confident it will be overturned on appeal,'' said Bruce Bender, the executive vice president of Forest City Ratner, the project's developer.
 The planned development covers 81 acres along the New York State Thruway and would include 1,000 high-rise apartments and condominiums and 1.3 million square feet of retail space. Forest City Ratner has agreed to pay the city $23.7 million in annual taxes -- proceeds that could help lift Yonkers out of its longstanding fiscal problems.
 ''All that was accomplished was the senseless delay of a project that will bring thousands of jobs to Yonkers and infuse millions of dollars in new revenues into our school system and our economy,'' Mayor Philip A. Amicone of Yonkers said on Tuesday in a statement. ''Each month that the lawsuit delays the Ridge Hill project costs the city and its school system almost $2 million in lost revenues and legal expenses.''
 Mayor Amicone blamed the four City Council members who are among the plaintiffs -- Mr. Lesnick and Councilors John Murtagh, Sandy Annabi and Dee Barbato -- for delays in the project and urged them to ''join in securing the financial future of the city of Yonkers, the city they were elected to represent.''
 Mr. Lesnick played down the mayor's comments, saying, ''I'm about a solution, not a fight.'' 
 Mr. Murtagh said the goal of the lawsuit was not to block the Ridge Hill project, but to compel the developers to reconsider its scope and take into account concerns that it might lead to an unmanageable traffic nightmare.
 ''Too much of this project was negotiated behind closed doors; it has never been handled properly from the start,'' Mr. Murtagh said. ''Hopefully, the developers will sit down and actually come up with a plan that everybody can live with.''

HEADLINE: Draft Report Said to Give Official Plan For Pandemic

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The federal government will stockpile 75 million doses of antiviral drugs and 20 million doses of vaccine to combat any outbreak of pandemic flu, according to a summary of a draft response plan expected to be unveiled today by the White House. 
 A flu pandemic would severely disrupt the economy, and private businesses and government agencies should assume that up to 40 percent of employees would be absent for up to two weeks at the height of each wave of infections, the undated 17-page draft summary says.
Local police departments and state National Guard units would have primary responsibility for keeping order, but the military would be available to assist.
 The secretary of health and human services will lead the government's response, with the Department of Homeland Security in a supporting role, the summary said.
 An administration official, who was granted anonymity to speak because the plan had not been formally announced, said it would lay out measures that businesses and agencies should take to minimize spread of a virus. 
 The measures include allowing telecommuting, cutting back on the number of meetings, introducing liberal leave policies and staggering employee shifts. 
 The goals include helping make sure that ''people aren't coming and going from a workplace at the same time'' and generally to ''encourage people to stay at home'' if they have any sense they are infected, the official said. 
 ''The main purpose of this implementation plan is to say, 'Department X, you need to be doing the following,' '' he said.
 The plan says, however, that setting up operational logistics will be up to the various departments.
 The first part of the plan was released in November. Under it, the federal government shouldered responsibility for developing a vaccine and stockpiling antivirals, and state and local governments were told to plan for the medical response and quarantine. 
 Many of them soon complained that they had no money and no control over privately owned local hospitals.
 The nation's borders would almost certainly not be closed, the draft summary says, because the virus would enter the country anyway, enforcement would be difficult, and such an action would ''present foreign affairs complications and have significant negative social and economic consequences.''
 The federal government will establish policies for screening travelers for flu symptoms and make recommendations about quarantines. It could also restrict unnecessary domestic travel. 
 In addition to increasing the stockpile of human vaccines and antivirals, the government will increase the stockpile of poultry vaccines to 110 million doses. 
 It will create separate stockpiles of masks, suits, disinfectants and antiviral medication for poultry workers. (American policy now is to avoid vaccination and to kill any infected chickens that may be found, but countries like China and Vietnam began vaccinating when the virus began spreading faster than flocks could be tested and culled.) 
 Under the government's plan for the worst-case possibility, a pandemic flu could cause up to two million deaths in the United States.

HEADLINE: U.S. Makers Facing Glut Of S.U.V.'s As Gas Rises

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 2 

 BODY:
Americans shied away from large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in April as gas prices approached $3 a gallon. With a battery of new S.U.V.'s waiting in the wings, domestic automakers are now facing the very situation they had hoped to avoid.
 Despite gains at Toyota and Honda, declines at General Motors, Ford, DaimlerChrysler and Nissan kept vehicle sales in the United States flat in April, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. General Motors recorded the biggest drop, selling 7.3 percent fewer vehicles than it did last April. 
For the first time, Toyota became the nation's No. 3 car seller for the month, passing DaimlerChrysler. That marks a symbolic victory for Toyota, which occasionally outsells the Chrysler division but had never before outsold all of DaimlerChrysler in the United States.
 The latest surge in gas prices poses a long-term problem for the domestic auto companies, which had been hoping that gas prices would moderate and make S.U.V. sales easier. Now, analysts warn it may be harder to get consumers to buy a gas-thirsty vehicle when the oil market remains so volatile. 
 ''Last fall when we had this first spike, then people could write it off as a one-time deal,'' said Stephen J. Hoch, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''The fact that it spikes twice means it can spike again. Now, this time people will say there's enough evidence that this is going to be a recurring if not frequent phenomenon.''
 Last month, big S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks were among the vehicles that had the sharpest sales drops. The Ford Explorer was down 42 percent compared with April 2005. Sales of the Jeep Grand Cherokee declined 41 percent. Sales of Ford's top-selling F-Series pickup fell about 9 percent last month, as did sales of the Nissan Titan. The Chevrolet Colorado pickup was down almost 30 percent.
 Gas prices aside, the decrease in sales of big S.U.V.'s may signal a realignment of the entire S.U.V. segment. Analysts said that with more auto companies building S.U.V.'s of all sizes and consumer tastes shifting toward smaller vehicles, the heyday of the big truck is over.
 ''I think all truck-based S.U.V.'s are on a downward path,'' George Pipas, Ford's chief sales analyst, said Tuesday. Noting the unabated decline of Ford's large S.U.V.'s, he said, ''It's pretty eye-popping.''
 Since 2004, when the number of light truck sales, which include pickup trucks and S.U.V.'s, peaked at 55.7 percent of vehicle sales in the United States, the American love affair with large vehicles has cooled. Last year, light truck sales fell to 54.9 percent of the market, according to Autodata. For the first three months of this year, light truck sales were down even more, to 53.8 percent.
 That complicates the fortunes of G.M. and Ford. Both companies have begun sweeping overhaul plans, which will eliminate a combined 60,000 jobs and close all or part of more than two dozen factories in North America. 
 But shutting plants and getting rid of employees will not ease all of their woes. So, the two companies are looking to their product portfolios to help accelerate their turnarounds. Especially at G.M., large S.U.V.'s have been assigned a huge role. Already this year, the company introduced new models of its Chevrolet Tahoe, Cadillac Escalade and GMC Yukon. Next month, the Chevrolet Suburban also goes on sale, and will be followed by several new large pickup trucks later this year.
 Despite fuel economy improvements in G.M.'s new S.U.V.'s and pickups, experts warn the vehicles will be a hard sell.
 ''Frankly, the portfolios they have were designed for $1.50-a-gallon gasoline,'' said Walter S. McManus, a scientist with the Transportation Research Institute at the University of Michigan. ''So they're going to have trouble. The longer prices stay high, the harder it will be to sell S.U.V.'s.''
 For now, G.M.'s new S.U.V.'s are selling well. Last month, the company said sales of its Yukon and Tahoe were up more than 30 percent. Escalade sales jumped 127 percent. The success of the new S.U.V.'s helped offset sales declines among other G.M. S.U.V.'s and pickups, which in many cases fell by double digits. Over all, light truck sales at G.M. rose 1.5 percent. Car sales, meanwhile, dropped 18.3 percent.
 G.M. has the newest S.U.V.'s on the market, but later this year it will face more competition. Ford has new models of the Expedition and Lincoln Navigator coming out -- direct competitors to the Tahoe and Escalade -- while Chrysler has the Aspen, a new luxury midsize S.U.V. Chrysler will also introduce a fleet of new Jeeps.
 Competition from foreign makers has already chipped away at the domestic auto companies' share of the pickup and S.U.V. market. In the late 1990's when S.U.V. sales were booming, G.M., Ford and Chrysler sold four out of five S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks in the United States, according to Autodata. By last year, their share had dropped to about two-thirds of the American pickup and S.U.V. market. That drop came as companies like Hyundai entered the S.U.V. market for the first time and Toyota and Honda introduced new light truck models. 
 ''Things have changed,'' said Ron Pinelli, president of Autodata, the New Jersey-based auto sales tracking firm. ''These companies are counting on their new S.U.V.'s as instrumental to their turnarounds, but it's not going to be that easy. It's not the slam dunk it would have been 10 years ago.''


Sales for DaimlerChrysler include Mercedes; sales for Ford include Volvo and Land Rover; sales for General Motors include Saab.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Says Power to Seize Private Land Is Vital to Cities

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Wading into yet another contentious national debate, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg came out vigorously yesterday in support of the government's right to seize property by eminent domain, and said Congressional attempts to limit those powers would have dire consequences for the nation's cities.
 His remarks come in the wake of a 2005 Supreme Court decision establishing the right of localities to seize properties for economic development projects. That ruling set off a firestorm that has spread across the country and in New York, where the potential use of eminent domain has drawn opposition in such projects as the proposed Atlantic Yards complex in Brooklyn. 
''You would never build any big thing any place in any big city in this country if you didn't have the power of eminent domain,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, speaking at a ground-breaking ceremony in Times Square, which was redeveloped in part through government condemnation of private property. ''You wouldn't have a job, neither would anybody else standing here today. None of us would.''
 Of late, Mr. Bloomberg has ramped up efforts to influence a range of national policy issues including immigration and gun control. But on this issue he is taking a position that could be at odds with the feelings of New Yorkers wary of development or suspicious of government efforts to seize private property. 
 The mayor is most concerned that the pending legislation would cut off all federal economic development funds to state or local governments for up to two years if they use eminent domain in private development projects. Bloomberg administration officials warned that passage of the bill in Congress could, at a minimum, mean the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars and almost 100,000 jobs for the city. 
 ''There are some in Albany and Washington,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, who do not ''appreciate the crucial importance of eminent domain to our ability to shape our own future. They mistakenly equate it with an abuse of government power, and ignore the benefits that come to us all from responsible development of formerly blighted areas.''
 The bill, passed last year by the House of Representatives and now pending in the Senate, is one of many federal and state measures aimed at constraining the government's power to seize private property that have been proposed or adopted in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling.
 Since the ruling, which upheld the authority of New London, Conn., to condemn homes to allow for private redevelopment, conservative and liberal members of Congress have joined together to fashion new federal limits on eminent domain seizures. At the same time, lawmakers in nearly every state have advanced bills and amendments, addressing an issue that is often emotionally fraught among their constituents. 
 ''The vast, overwhelming majority of Americans are opposed to using eminent domain,'' said Dana Berliner, a senior lawyer at the Institute for Justice, a leading advocate for curtailing its use. 
 ''There's still in the United States a very strong ethic that you work hard so that some day you or your children can own a home,'' she said, adding that using eminent domain for private development makes a mockery of those aspirations. 
 ''The only people who are really supporting it are government, planners and the developers that take advantage of eminent domain,'' she said. 
 In New York, for example, the proposed use of eminent domain by the developer Forest City Ratner to bring a basketball arena and a swath of residential, office and commercial towers to the Atlantic Terminal area touched off fierce opposition, especially in surrounding neighborhoods.
 The concept, though, proved unpopular elsewhere as well. A New York Times poll in April 2004 found that only 18 percent of city residents favored the construction of a new basketball arena in Brooklyn it if it required the demolition of homes and businesses. (Forest City Ratner is the development partner of The New York Times Company in building its new Midtown headquarters, a project that itself involved government condemnation of private property.)
 To the Bloomberg administration, however, the wheels of economic development would grind to a halt without the use of eminent domain. Low-cost housing developments like the Nehemiah homes in East New York, Brooklyn, and Melrose Commons in the Bronx would not have been built and Times Square would remain ''the poster child for a seedy, dangerous, unattractive, porno-laced place,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.
 City officials also argue that New York State law protects property owners from abusive uses of eminent domain because it requires property to be designated as a blight before it can be seized for private development and because people have access to the courts. But many critics dismiss that argument.
 ''New York's blight designation is a joke,'' Ms. Berliner said. ''You can call anything in the state blighted under New York's definition.''

HEADLINE: Suozzi Unveils Plan to Cut Property Tax and Aid Schools

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., May 2 

 BODY:
Calling it a main theme of his bid for governor, Thomas R. Suozzi outlined a $2.5 billion plan on Tuesday to cut school property taxes and improve troubled schools across the state. 
 In calling for tax cuts, Mr. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, said property tax bills in New York were among the nation's highest. ''They are crushing our communities and forcing residents to leave,'' pushing the elderly from their homes, shutting young couples out of the housing market and driving away business, he said.
 His remarks came a week after State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi reported that the taxes on suburban and upstate homeowners in New York were 73 percent above the national average and have risen much faster than the rate of inflation in recent years. 
 Mr. Suozzi accused his rival and the poll leader for the Democratic nomination, State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, of ignoring the issue. After detailing his own proposal, Mr. Suozzi said, ''I would like to compare it to Eliot Spitzer's property tax plan, but he has no plan.'' 
 Mr. Spitzer's camp defended his record. ''Throughout his campaign, Eliot Spitzer has talked about the urgent need to provide property tax relief,'' said his spokeswoman, Christine Anderson. He has proposed changes to address the underlying causes of high taxes, she said, like reducing Medicaid costs and reviving the upstate economy. Later he will present plans to grant tax relief and reduce expenditures required by the state, she said. 
 She declined to comment on the Suozzi proposal.
 Mr. Suozzi's program for tax relief and new school aid is an extension of his earlier plan to save $5 billion by cutting Medicaid waste and fraud, shrinking the work force, restructuring debt and expanding sales tax collections. He has pledged to devote half those savings to improving the New York City schools.
 Unveiling the rest of his program in a speech at Adelphi University here, Mr. Suozzi promised to give $2.15 billion to reduce school taxes in 43 counties. Two-thirds of that would be concentrated in Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties, where property taxes are among the state's highest. To encourage schools to use the aid to reduce taxes, the plan would require districts to limit budget increases to 5 percent a year and would encourage other economies like joint purchasing.
 The remaining $350 million of the Suozzi program would provide $1,100 per student in every troubled school district outside New York City, mostly in the upstate cities of Buffalo, Niagara Falls, Rochester, Syracuse, Schenectady, Utica, Rome, Elmira, Binghamton and Newburgh. Aid would also go to needy suburban districts like Roosevelt and Hempstead on Long Island
 Mr. Suozzi found himself on the defensive on the subject of abortion on Tuesday when an abortion rights group backing Mr. Spitzer, Naral Pro-Choice New York, called on Mr. Suozzi to disavow the support of James D. Griffin, a Democrat and former candidate of the anti-abortion Right to Life Party. 
 Mr. Suozzi refused to disavow Mr. Griffin's support, said his campaign manager, Kim Devlin. She accused Naral of trying to divert attention from Mr. Suozzi's tax cut plan, and of misrepresenting him as opposing abortion rights when ''he has always said abortions should be legal and safe.'' Naral has criticized him for opposing late-term abortions.

HEADLINE: An Incomplete Peace: Sudan's Never-Ending War With Itself

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, Sudan, May 3 

 BODY:
When northern and southern Sudanese leaders met in a soccer stadium in January 2005 to sign an agreement to end the civil war that had raged for more than two decades, Bush administration officials hoped they were killing two birds with one stone. By solving Sudan's worst conflict, the war in the south, administration officials reasoned that the carnage also taking place in the west, which Mr. Bush would eventually call genocide, would come to an end as well. 
 Under the peace accord, John Garang, the charismatic leader of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, would become Sudan's vice president, joining his old nemesis President Omar Hassan al-Bashir in Khartoum. In order to win peace in the south, Darfur was left out of the negotiations, but peace in Darfur would come as a natural byproduct of this process -- or so the reasoning went. 
A year and a half later, top American diplomats once again find themselves at the center of urgent talks to end a brutal conflict in Sudan, this time in Darfur. If anything, the conflict there has escalated since the agreement with the south -- more than 250,000 people have been chased from their homes in the past three months, and a second, related conflict is brewing in neighboring Chad. 
 The administration's current down-to-the-wire effort to clinch a peace deal for Darfur comes at the end of a long string of confusing and sometimes seemingly contradictory stances from the United States on Sudan. In the end, that may have put peace even farther out of reach. 
 ''Certainly one of the precipitating factors in the in the escalation from political opposition to armed insurrection in Darfur is the fact that Darfurian actors were not given any role in the peace process between the government and southern-based rebels,'' said John Prendergast of the International Crisis Group, which tries to prevent armed conflict. ''They realized the only way their issues could be addressed was if they shot their way into the negotiating room. So this is a case of negotiators actually making matters worse by their interventions.'' 
 For much of its post-colonial history, Sudan has been at war with itself, and much of that conflict has been fought between latitudes. Indeed, the world has long viewed Sudan's problems as beginning and ending roughly at the 12th parallel, between northern, Muslim Arabs and southern, Christian and animist Africans. 
 While the peace agreement between the north and south was being negotiated, diplomats argued that because that conflict had raged for so long, and had cost so many lives, it was proper to find a solution to it first, and then deal with other problems. 
 In terms of the number of people killed, the Darfur conflict is comparable in size to the brutal intertribal struggle that broke out in the south between the Dinka and Nuer tribes in the early 1990's, just one of the deadly interludes of the overall civil war. Hundreds of thousands of people died, mostly from disease and hunger, in this side struggle between the tribes for control over the Sudan People's Liberation Movement. 
 Political factors within the United States doubtless played a role in its approach. Evangelical Christian groups have long focused on the civil war in Sudan, providing much needed humanitarian aid and participating in ''buy-back'' programs to return civilians taken as slaves during the war to their villages. 
 But in the conflict in Darfur, as with a rebellion brewing in the east, the warring groups are all Muslims. Taken together, they help demonstrate that while deep, historical problems exist between Muslims and non-Muslims, Arabs and Africans, nomads and farmers, Sudan's primary conflict is not between the north and south. Instead it is between Khartoum, where all the nation's power lies, and the periphery, where millions of people live on the margins, yearning for a sliver of the power and wealth the center enjoys. 
 The fight between the north and the south was merely a symptom of this, and soothing the symptoms in one region will not cure what ails Sudan, said Adam M. Mousa Madibo, vice chairman of the opposition Umma Party, Sudan's largest political party. ''The agreement between the north and south is an agreement between two non-democratic military parties,'' Mr. Madibo said. ''It does not reflect the ideas of the popular consensus of the Sudanese people. It doesn't change any basic facts about political life in Sudan, so it cannot bring real peace.'' 
 The problem with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, as the deal between the north and the south is known, Mr. Madibo said, is that it is not comprehensive at all. In its quest to maximize the powers of each side as an enticement to peace, it excludes everyone in Sudan other than Mr. Bashir's ruling National Congress Party, which controls 52 percent of the executive and legislative power, and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, which controls the remaining 48 percent. 
 Major political players, like the Umma Party, the north's most broadly popular party, were excluded from the agreement. Darfur, it was decided, would be dealt with separately. 
 ''Frankly, the whole history of the Darfur conflict is a holding back of many actors, some with the best of intentions, who felt there was such a danger of jeopardizing the north-south agreement,'' said Louise Arbour, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, after touring refugee camps in Darfur this week. ''But now dealing with Darfur has become painfully unavoidable.'' 
 Rather than becoming a democratic, open society with a booming economy based on Sudan's oil reserves and other natural resources, as envisioned in the peace agreement, Sudan found itself this week at the top of Foreign Affairs magazine's failed states index. 
 Making matters worse, Mr. Garang was killed in a helicopter crash last August, and the rebel commander who replaced him, Salva Kiir, has not played the central role the United States had hoped Mr. Garang would play. The south, which under the peace deal may decide in a referendum to split from the north after six years, seems increasingly likely to do so. Real peace in Sudan, after the conflicts that have wracked this nation since its independence from Britain in 1954, remains out of reach.
 ''What plagues Sudan is fundamentally a regime at the center which is highly discriminatory,'' Mr. Prendergast said. ''Until you deal with that, we are going to see a continuation of this cycle of sort of half baked agreements with the most heavily armed elements of different regions in Sudan, which will never bring peace to the country.''


CORRECTION-DATE: May 6, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article yesterday about the difficulties of ending the civil conflicts in Sudan misstated the year of the country's independence from Britain. It was 1956, not 1954. The article also misidentified the magazine that publishes the annual Failed States Index, a list of unstable countries, in which Sudan is ranked No. 1. It is Foreign Policy, not Foreign Affairs.
A news analysis article on Thursday about the history of efforts to bring peace to Sudan misstated the timing of the death of John Garang, a rebel leader who was to become a vice president under an agreement with southern rebels last year. Though his death was not confirmed until Aug. 1, it occurred in a helicopter crash at the end of July.

For most of us, there is nothing magical about withdrawing cash from an A.T.M. The money that slides out represents some aspect of our real lives -- our labor, our interest, our savings. But the idea of using an A.T.M. card to withdraw real money from a virtual life -- a fictional online gaming life -- takes some getting used to. On Tuesday, MindArk, the makers of the popular online game called Entropia Universe, announced that it will offer A.T.M. cards that will allow players quick access to cash assets that are being held in an alternate reality. 
 For many people, the real mind-twister here isn't the A.T.M. card. Cash holdings in a game -- where the cash is used to buy upgrades and enhancements -- are no different from cash holdings in an electronic bank. Very few people ever go into a bank and ask to see their money. No, the real puzzle is the creation of an online economy based solely in fictional worlds, in which people invest assets and erect buildings and charge rent and derive real income. Entropia is only one example. Second Life is another. The population -- what else can you call it? -- of these virtual worlds is growing rapidly.
It's natural to think of Entropia players escaping from the real world and disappearing into a more fluid and more gratifying universe. But can it be long before their online avatars within the game begin to resent these intrusions from outside? 
 There you are, an avatar about to close a deal on Calypso, only to discover that your real-world alter ego has drained you dry from an A.T.M. somewhere in Milwaukee. It hardly seems fair.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart on the Hunt for an Extreme Makeover 

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores is sending its strongest signal yet that it no longer intends to do business as usual, by placing its advertising account in review.
 Word of the review, Wal-Mart's first in more than 30 years, comes after months of significant changes to the retailer's longtime marketing approaches. The move underscores Wal-Mart's eagerness to broaden its appeal to upscale shoppers as the chain's revenue growth at stores open for more than a year has lagged its smaller and hipper rival, Target.
Given the size of Wal-Mart's marketing budget, $578 million last year, the move is likely to set off a scramble among agencies. But finding new agencies could prove tricky because shops with retail backgrounds may already work for competitors.
 The review puts a spotlight on the two agencies on which Wal-Mart has relied for many years, Bernstein-Rein Advertising in Kansas City, Mo., and GSD&M in Austin, Tex., owned by the Omnicom Group. 
 Both agencies, which helped Wal-Mart during its many years of rapid growth by marketing its low-cost image, said yesterday that they would take part in the review.
 Wal-Mart is hoping new ad campaigns will help the retailer reach higher-income customers who will stay in the stores to buy more than just household staples like laundry detergent. Wal-Mart is also pushing into urban markets, and wants to attract sophisticated city shoppers.
 Wal-Mart has introduced more stylish merchandise under brand names like Exsto and Metro 7, added more expensive TV sets to the consumer electronics departments and spruced up store interiors.
 Wal-Mart's chief marketing officer, John Fleming, has been searching urgently for a distinct, unified voice for the company's advertising since he was promoted to his post in March 2005 after leading the Wal-Mart online division.
 Under Mr. Fleming, the smiley-faced character that has symbolized Wal-Mart's commitment to low prices, which was created by Bernstein-Rein, has virtually disappeared from mainstream ads. He also has played down campaigns that were centered on actual Wal-Mart customers and employees talking about low prices, convenience and how much fun it is to shop at Wal-Mart.
 Wal-Mart is looking for an agency or agencies that can provide ''great creativity and an understanding of the customer,'' said Gail Lavielle, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart in Bentonville, Ark. She confirmed a report of the review that appeared yesterday on the Web site of the trade publication Advertising Age.
 The review is also intended to ''make sure all of our messages are consistent across all media we use,'' Ms. Lavielle said.
 The review will be led, Ms. Lavielle said, by Julie Roehm, a former senior marketing executive at the Chrysler Group unit of DaimlerChrysler, who was hired in January. Ms. Roehm joined in the new post of senior vice president for marketing communications at the Wal-Mart Stores USA division.
 Although Wal-Mart remains the nation's largest retailer -- dwarfing competitors like Sears, Kmart, Kohl's and Target -- revenue at individual Target stores has been far more robust than at Wal-Mart, which has generally relied on new stores for growth.
 Analysts credit much of those gains to the ability of Target to appeal to more affluent shoppers with upbeat campaigns focused on ''cheap chic,'' which are created by agencies that include Peterson Milla Hooks in Minneapolis. Higher-income shoppers are less affected by economic factors like rising energy prices than are low- and middle-income consumers who are the Wal-Mart mainstays.
 Mr. Fleming's goal has been to persuade upscale customers who rely on Wal-Mart for socks, cereal and soda to also visit the aisles that stock more expensive items like home furnishings, fashion and electronics.
 ''The challenge is to sell more stuff to shoppers with household incomes of more than $100,000,'' said Candace Corlett, a principal at WSL Strategic Retail in New York, a retail consultant. ''Wal-Mart has to get them to put more into their carts.''
 At the same time, Ms. Corlett said, Wal-Mart must not ''make the lower- and middle-income shoppers who are very possessive about Wal-Mart feel like they're not at home anymore.''
 In a series of presentations and speeches, Mr. Fleming has said he is pushing to add merchandise and advertising that appeal to an upscale shopper, which the company calls a ''selective consumer.'' That shopper, unlike low-income Wal-Mart customers, can afford to buy nonstaples like fashion and home furnishings elsewhere.
 Selective consumers shop at Wal-Mart 26 times a year, according to Mr. Fleming's data, far less often than loyalists, who go 57 times a year. 
 Under Mr. Fleming's watch, Wal-Mart introduced its celebrity campaign, which appeared for last year's holiday shopping season, featuring singers like Garth Brooks and Jesse McCartney. He is also directing a campaign that began in March, carrying the theme ''Look beyond the basics,'' which is intended to shine a spotlight on the more stylish products Wal-Mart now sells.
 Bernstein-Rein was founded in 1964 and has more than 320 employees. Its other clients include Bayer Animal Health, Interstate Bakeries and United Online.
 ''We're excited about the direction this marketing team is taking Wal-Mart,'' Steven Bernstein, chief operating officer at Bernstein-Rein, said in a telephone interview. ''We embrace the future and want to be a part of it.''
 His reference was to Mr. Fleming, Ms. Roehm and other new executives like Stephen Quinn, the former chief marketing officer at Frito-Lay, now senior vice president for marketing at Wal-Mart, and Steve Bratspies, the former chief marketing officer at Specialty Brands, now vice president for category marketing at Wal-Mart.
 ''When Sam hired us years ago, he called it a test,'' Mr. Bernstein said, referring to the Wal-Mart founder, Sam Walton. ''The test has worked pretty well for them and for us.''
 ''We have never taken this account for granted,'' he added. ''We have always had to perform at our best. We'll do it today and we'll do it tomorrow.''
 GSD&M was founded in 1971 and has 650 employees. Its other clients include AARP, AT&T, BMW North America and Southwest Airlines.
 ''I would say it is about time'' that Wal-Mart re-examined its agency choices, Roy Spence, president at GSD&M, said in a statement, citing factors like the new marketing team at Wal-Mart and the absence of ''a full agency review in over 30 years.''
 ''GSD&M is all in,'' the statement continued, quoting a lyric from the Willie Nelson song ''Me and Paul,'' to the effect that the agency had ''come to play and not just for the ride.''
 The review does not involve the efforts by Wal-Mart to improve its corporate image and address complaints from community activists and union leaders that it does not pay its employees well enough and harms small local businesses. Those efforts are handled by public relations and corporate communications agencies.
 Adam Hanft, chief executive of Hanft Unlimited, a New York branding and marketing agency, said he believed the new Wal-Mart ad campaigns had failed to elevate the retailer beyond its low-price image, which it has cultivated for 40 years.
 ''Wal-Mart is such a massive presence in the culture that it needs something equally massive to change perceptions of the company,'' Mr. Hanft said. ''You cannot do it incrementally.'' 
 Mr. Hanft dismissed the campaigns to date aimed at higher-income shoppers as ''artless.''

HEADLINE: In New Problem for Palestinians, Banks Reject Transfers

BYLINE: By GREG MYRE

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, May 3 

 BODY:
As the Hamas-led government struggles to raise cash after the suspension of Western aid to the Palestinian Authority, it faces a new and unexpected obstacle: banks here are refusing to accept its money transfers from abroad.
 The United States Treasury last month barred almost all financial dealings with the Palestinian Authority in response to Hamas's rise to power, under a federal law that makes it a crime to provide funds to terrorist groups.
That has rattled local banks, which are tied to the American banking system. The banks abruptly stopped handling even basic wire transfers needed for the authority to receive money donated by foreign countries.
 In recent weeks Arab countries, coordinated by the Arab League in Cairo, have raised more than $70 million. But so far, Palestinian officials say, no bank has been willing to move the money to the West Bank or the Gaza Strip, wary of legal entanglements with the United States. 
 Ismail Haniya, the Palestinian prime minister and a leader of Hamas, said Wednesday that the government could begin paying overdue salaries, which are now two months late, if the money reached the Palestinian Authority's bank accounts.
 ''The problem is not with raising money,'' Mr. Haniya said at a news conference in Gaza City. ''The problem is how to transfer this money to the Palestinians.''
 Mr. Haniya accused the United States of putting pressure on the banks ''so that the money we have collected does not reach citizens or civil servants.'' Hamas says it will not bow to political pressure from Israel or the West. But without money from abroad, it is not clear how the Palestinian Authority can function.
 The European Union joined the United States in suspending all financial assistance for the authority after Hamas took office in late March as a result of its decisive victory in Palestinian legislative elections. Israel has also frozen the roughly $50 million it collects in tax and customs revenues each month on behalf of the Palestinians.
 Now, with the United States Treasury's action, even Arab and Muslim countries that want to assist the authority have not been able to deliver their aid.
 American diplomats say the United States is not directly putting pressure on the banks. But the Treasury has publicized the government's position that Hamas is a terrorist organization and that financial transactions with the Palestinian Authority are barred. There are a few exceptions to the ban, including dealings with the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, who opposes violence against Israel and supports peace talks.
 ''Generally speaking, if an organization or individual is facilitating direct fund-raising for Hamas, they open themselves up to action by the United States,'' said Molly Millerwise, a spokeswoman for the Treasury in Washington.
 On Tuesday, Stuart Levey, the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the Treasury, was in Israel to meet with senior Israeli officials on how to prevent money from reaching designated terrorist groups, the United States Embassy said.
 The Palestinian Authority needs at least $150 million a month just to pay salaries and run essential institutions like schools, hospitals and the police force. On its own the authority raises barely $30 million a month, and it is falling deeper into debt each day.
 Since coming to power, the Hamas-dominated government has missed two paydays for the authority's 165,000 employees. Palestinian nurses and teachers, civil servants and security force officers like Muhammad Burbar, 23, are caught in the middle.
 Mr. Burbar has not received his monthly $333 paycheck since February. He is out of cash, and his wife needs medical treatment. On Tuesday the couple sold a tiny gold bracelet and a pendant they bought for their daughter when she was born last year.
 They received $28 from a gold shop in Ramallah.
 ''We didn't have any other choice,'' Mr. Burbar said. ''I have no idea when I will get paid again, and I'm not optimistic. This could go on for another six months.''
 The shop owner, Khader al-Asbah, said 99 percent of his customers in the last two months sold family jewelry, traditionally held as a form of savings by Palestinian families. 
 Economists and aid groups say the Palestinian economy, ailing since the start of an uprising against Israel in 2000, risks a major contraction if government workers go unpaid for months.
 The United States government lacks legal jurisdiction over financial transactions abroad if no American citizens or institutions are involved. But many Middle Eastern banks have branches in the United States or have business relationships with American banks to handle international transactions.
 Banks here fear they could jeopardize their ties to the United States or put themselves at legal risk if they handle money for the Palestinian Authority, regardless of its origin, said George Abed, governor of the Palestinian Monetary Authority, which effectively serves as the Palestinian central bank. 
 The Arab Bank, based in Jordan, has held the main account for the Palestinian Authority in recent years. Officials there and at other banks have refused to discuss the issue of transactions for the authority.
 But Mr. Abed acknowledged that the Palestinian government and the banks were in an extremely awkward position. ''Banks, being careful as they usually are, have been telling the Palestinian Authority that they can't complete these transactions,'' Mr. Abed said Tuesday in an interview in Ramallah. 
 The Arab Bank, which has branches in the United States, has been subject to American legal action, including a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn by about 50 American survivors or relatives of people killed in suicide bombings or other attacks by Hamas.
 ''No bank wants to risk being cut off from international transactions,'' Mr. Abed said. ''This is oxygen for banks. If you are a bank, and you shut yourself out of the United States and Europe, what are you going to do -- conduct all your transactions in rupees?''
 Though the banks are wary, Hamas says it will not give in.
 One option is to have the Arab League send the donated money directly into the personal bank accounts of Palestinian Authority employees, bypassing the authority. But that may be highly impractical, because money would have to be wired into 165,000 separate bank accounts.
 ''It is being studied, but it does not sound very feasible,'' Hesham Youssef, a senior Arab League official, said in a phone interview from Cairo.
 The United States, the European Union and Israel have demanded that Hamas do three things before they will consider dealing with the group: recognize Israel, disavow violence and accept existing Israeli-Palestinian agreements.
 Hamas has refused, instead appealing to Arab and Muslim countries to replace the lost financing.
 Arab League countries recently renewed a pledge made years ago to provide the Palestinian Authority with $55 million a month, but it has regularly fallen short. Even if the league finds a way to get the money to the Palestinian Authority, it is barely one-third of what the authority needs to pay its monthly bills.

HEADLINE: In Brazil, Anger at Leader's Mild Response to Bolivia's Bold Move

BYLINE: By PAULO PRADA

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, May 3 

 BODY:
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil continued his low-key approach on Wednesday to Bolivia's move to take control of its natural gas and oil industries, drawing a barrage of criticism here for what many consider Brazil's weak response.
 Brazil is Bolivia's biggest natural gas customer, with more than half its supply coming from there, and Brazil's state-controlled energy company, with over $1 billion invested, is the biggest single investor in Bolivia's natural gas industry. But Mr. da Silva, who publicly applauded the rise of a fellow leftist, Evo Morales, to Bolivia's presidency last December, has offered a muted response since Bolivia announced on Monday that it would take control of its energy industry. Bolivia has South America's second largest natural gas reserves, after Venezuela. 
Businesspeople, political opponents and large-scale consumers of natural gas in Brazil, which has South America's biggest economy, say Mr. da Silva was caught flat-footed by Bolivia's move and has been unwilling to parry decisively because of political affinity with Mr. Morales.
 ''Brazil should have seen this coming,'' said Rubens Barbosa, a former Brazilian ambassador to the United States now working as a business consultant in Sao Paulo. ''Because of his ideology,'' Mr. Barbosa said, ''the president was ill prepared to defend Brazil's commercial interests.''
 Aside from securing a guarantee from Mr. Morales that Bolivian gas would keep flowing to Brazil, Mr. da Silva has limited his reaction to saying he would negotiate with Bolivia on Thursday to protect Brazilian interests while respecting the laws of Bolivia. At a speech in Brasilia on Wednesday, Mr. da Silva played down talk of a crisis between the countries, even defending the rights of the ''suffering people'' of Bolivia, South America's poorest nation, to ''claim greater power over the greatest riches they have.''
 At a meeting on Thursday in Puerto Iguazu, Argentina, Mr. da Silva plans to begin negotiations with Mr. Morales in the company of Presidents Nestor Kirchner of Argentina and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. Though Mr. Morales is unlikely to reverse the major points of his decision, which requires all foreign operators to sell oil and gas produced in Bolivia through its state-owned energy company, Brazil hopes the presence of the two other leaders, both sympathizers of Mr. Morales, will help Brazil and Bolivia find common ground.
 Aldo Rebelo, a former minister in Mr. da Silva's government and now an important ally as president of the lower house of Congress, said mutual interests between the two countries should help them work toward a settlement. Bolivian gas, for instance, fuels much of Brazil's industry and a growing number of power plants fired by natural gas. Revenues from those gas exports give Bolivia roughly one-third of its tax revenues.
 ''There are too many interests at stake for Brazil not to find an agreement that both protects our commercial interests and enables Bolivia to implement the goals of a democratically elected government,'' Mr. Rebelo said.
 Many critics contrasted Mr. da Silva's reaction to that of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain, who warned Bolivia not to harm the interests of the Spanish oil company Repsol-YPF S.A. Repsol, one of the biggest oil companies operating in Latin America, is the second largest investor in Bolivia. The biggest is Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., or Petrobras, the Brazilian energy giant whose southern Bolivian oil fields served as the staging ground for Mr. Morales's decree.
 Some political analysts say Mr. da Silva's soft rebuttal to Mr. Morales is calculated. A tougher reaction, they contend, could prompt Bolivia to be more aggressive in increasing its share of the profits as it negotiates new contracts with foreign investors, as stipulated by its decree.
 Though Mr. da Silva has yet to declare his candidacy, as expected, for a second term in presidential elections next October, higher energy prices would not sit well with voters.
 ''There is tremendous concern of a high, short-term increase in gas prices,'' said Christopher Garman, director of Latin American research at Eurasia Group, a consulting firm. ''Brazil wants to work gently toward an acceptable compromise.''

BYLINE: By Jorge G. Castaneda. 
Jorge G. Castaneda, a professor of Latin American and Caribbean studies at New York University, was the foreign minister of Mexico from 2000 to 2003.

 BODY:
THERE are many excellent reasons to salvage the immigration bill that collapsed two months ago in the Senate. But one of the most overlooked lies not in the protests that have filled streets in Los Angeles and Washington, but in the wave of populism that has swept Latin American cities like Caracas, La Paz, Lima and Mexico City. 
 An ultra-nationalist candidate, Ollanta Humala, seems poised to win a runoff this month in Peru's presidential elections. He wants, among other things, to renationalize Peru's natural resources, promote coca cultivation and align Peru against Washington with Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and his Bolivian neighbor, Evo Morales (who on Monday sent soldiers to take control of Bolivia's oil fields and refineries).
Mr. Humala is part of Latin America's new left turn -- the wrong part of the left. Progressive leaders in countries with a long leftist history -- Brazil, Chile and Uruguay -- are economically moderate, ideologically tolerant and internationally open-minded. The other left -- Mr. Chavez, Mr. Morales, Mr. Humala and Nestor Kirchner in Argentina -- springs from a populist past and seeks a populist future: big-time spending, authoritarian governance and militant anti-Americanism.
 The great populist hope of that left is, of course, Mexico City's former mayor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a strong contender in Mexico's presidential race. By background and policies, he clearly belongs to the wrong left. Mr. Lopez Obrador comes from the corrupt authoritarian machinery that governed Mexico for 70 years, just as Mr. Kirchner descends directly from Juan Peron, and Mr. Chavez and Mr. Humala began their political careers with failed military coups against corrupt but democratically elected governments. 
 It is one thing to have populism in power in the Andes; it is quite another to have it controlling a 2,000-mile border with the United States. This is where leadership on immigration reform from George W. Bush and broad-minded Republican senators comes in.
 Nothing could contribute more to the continuity of sensible policies in Latin America than a clear signal from the north that cooperating with Washington, and renouncing America-bashing, pays off, even on an emotional issue like immigration. And few things could offer ultra-nationalist leaders better proof of America's not-so-benign neglect and imperial arrogance as further paralysis on immigration.
 President Vicente Fox of Mexico staked much of his prestige on President Bush's commitment to fix immigration policy. First Sept. 11 got in the way, then Iraq did; and so Mr. Bush left Mr. Fox empty-handed. But immigration reform along the lines of the Senate compromise would still give Mr. Fox a huge boost. 
 It would strengthen support for Mexico's policies of the last decade: economic stability and growth, democratic rule, a mature and responsible foreign policy and an innovative war on poverty. It would allow the United States to encourage that continuity, whoever wins Mexico's July 2 elections, without interfering in its neighbor's political process. 
 Along with all the other good reasons for sensible immigration reform, this one is certainly worth acting on.

HEADLINE: GROWING UNEASE FOR SOME BLACKS ON IMMIGRATION

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3 

 BODY:
In their demonstrations across the country, some Hispanic immigrants have compared the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s struggle to their own, singing ''We Shall Overcome'' and declaring a new civil rights movement to win citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants. 
 Civil rights stalwarts like the Rev. Jesse Jackson; Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia; Julian Bond and the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery have hailed the recent protests as the natural progression of their movement in the 1960's.
But despite some sympathy for the nation's illegal immigrants, many black professionals, academics and blue-collar workers feel increasingly uneasy as they watch Hispanics flex their political muscle while assuming the mantle of a seminal black struggle for justice. 
 Some blacks bristle at the comparison between the civil rights movement and the immigrant demonstrations, pointing out that black protesters in the 1960's were American citizens and had endured centuries of enslavement, rapes, lynchings and discrimination before they started marching. 
 Others worry about the plight of low-skilled black workers, who sometimes compete with immigrants for entry-level jobs. 
 And some fear the unfinished business of the civil rights movement will fall to the wayside as America turns its attention to a newly energized Hispanic minority with growing political and economic clout. 
 ''All of this has made me start thinking, 'What's going to happen to African-Americans?' '' said Brendon L. Laster, 32, a black fund-raiser at Howard University here, who has been watching the marches. ''What's going to happen to our unfinished agenda?'' 
 Mr. Laster is dapper and cosmopolitan, a part-time professor and Democratic activist who drinks and dines with a wide circle of black, white and Hispanic friends. He said he marveled at first as the images of cheering, flag-waving immigrants flickered across his television screen. But as some demonstrators proclaimed a new civil rights movement, he grew uncomfortable.
 He says that immigrant protesters who claim the legacy of Dr. King and Rosa Parks are going too far. And he has begun to worry about the impact that the emerging immigrant activism will have on black Americans, many of whom still face poverty, high rates of unemployment and discrimination in the workplace.
 ''I think what they were able to do, the level of organization they were able to pull off, that was phenomenal,'' said Mr. Laster, who is also a part-time sociology professor at a community college in Baltimore. ''But I do think their struggle is, in fundamental ways, very different from ours. We didn't chose to come here; we came here as slaves. And we were denied, even though we were legal citizens, our basic rights.''
 ''There are a still lot of unresolved issues from the civil rights era,'' he said. ''Perhaps we're going to be pushed to the back burner.'' 
 This painful debate is bubbling up in church halls and classrooms, on call-in radio programs and across dining room tables. Some blacks prefer to discuss the issue privately for fear of alienating their Hispanic allies. But others are publicly airing their misgivings, saying they are too worried to stay silent.
 ''We will have no power, no clout,'' warned Linda Carter-Lewis, 62, a human resources manager and the branch president of the N.A.A.C.P. in Des Moines. ''That's where I see this immigrant movement going. Even though so many thousands and thousands of them have no legal status and no right to vote right now, that day is coming.''
 Immigrant leaders defend their use of civil rights language, saying strong parallels exist between the two struggles. And they argue that their movement will ultimately become a powerful vehicle to fight for the rights of all American workers, regardless of national origin.
 ''African-Americans during the civil rights movement were in search of the American dream and that's what our movement is trying to achieve for our community,'' said Jaime Contreras, president of the National Capital Immigration Coalition, which organized the April 10 demonstration that drew tens of thousands of people to Washington.
 ''We face the same issues even if we speak different languages,'' said Mr. Contreras, who is from El Salvador and listens to Dr. King's speeches for inspiration. 
 Mr. Jackson, who addressed the immigrant rally on Monday in New York, echoed those views. He noted that Dr. King, at the end of his life, focused on improving economic conditions for all Americans, regardless of race. And he said the similarities between African-Americans and illegal immigrants were too powerful to ignore.
 ''We too were denied citizenship,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''We too were undocumented workers working without wages, without benefits, without the vote. ''We should feel honored that other people are using tactics and strategies from our struggle. We shouldn't say they're stealing from us. They're learning from us.''
 Mr. Jackson said corporate employers were fueling the tensions between blacks and immigrants by refusing to pay a living wage to all workers. John Campbell, a black steel worker and labor activist from Iowa, agreed.
 ''This is a class issue,'' said Mr. Campbell, who has been disheartened by black critics of the immigrant marches. ''We need to join forces. We can't improve our lot in life as African-Americans by suppressing the rights of anyone else.''
 But blacks and immigrants have long had a history of uneasy relations in the United States.
 W.E.B. DuBois, a founder of the N.A.A.C.P., and other prominent black leaders worried that immigrants would displace blacks in the workplace. Ronald Walters, director of the African-American Leadership Institute at the University of Maryland, said blacks cheered when the government restricted Asian immigration to the United States after World War I. And many Europeans who came to this country discriminated against blacks. 
 Blacks and Hispanics have also been allies. In the 1960's, Dr. King and Cesar Chavez, the Mexican-American farm labor leader, corresponded with each other. And when Mr. Chavez was jailed, Dr. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, visited him in jail, Mr. Walters said. In recent years, blacks and Hispanics have been influential partners in the Democratic Party.
 A recent poll conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center captured the ambivalence among blacks over immigration. Nearly 80 percent said immigrants from Latin American work very hard and have strong family values.
 But nearly twice as many blacks as whites said that they or a family member had lost a job, or not gotten a job, because an employer hired an immigrant worker. Blacks were also more likely than whites to feel that immigrants take jobs away from American citizens.
 Mr. Walters said he understood those conflicting emotions, saying he feels torn himself because of his concerns about the competition between immigrants and low-skilled black men for jobs. In 2004, 72 percent of black male high school dropouts in their 20's were jobless, compared with 34 percent of white and 19 percent of Hispanic dropouts.
 ''I applaud them moving out of the shadows and into the light because of the human rights issues involved,'' Mr. Walters said of illegal immigrants. ''I've given my entire life to issues of social justice as an activist and an academic. In that sense, I'm with them.
 ''But they also represent a powerful ingredient to the perpetuation of our struggle,'' he said. ''We have a problem where half of black males are unemployed in several cities. I can't ignore that and simply be my old progressive self and say it's not an issue. It is an issue.''

HEADLINE: Red States, Blue States: New Labels for Long-Running Differences

BYLINE: By Hal R. Varian. 
Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
THE red state-blue state division has captured the pundits' imaginations, leading to much armchair theorizing about how political constituencies in the United States are evolving.
 According to some, the country is splitting into two opposing camps, with political divisions becoming more polarized and more spatially segregated than they have been in the past.
A recent working paper, ''Myths and Realities of American Political Geography,'' by two Harvard University economists, Edward L. Glaeser and Bryce A. Ward, challenges this conventional wisdom. The paper can be downloaded from http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract--id=874977. 
 The economists examined a number of contemporary and historical data sources on cultural, religious, economic and political attitudes and compared these responses across states.
 They found that differences in political attitudes across states are nothing new: the Civil War and Roaring Twenties had much larger geographic variation in political views than we do today. Though dispersion in political attitudes has generally declined over the last 60 years, the last four years have brought a small uptick.
 Though views have become somewhat less associated with geography in the 20th century, they still show strong differences. The fraction of the voters in a given area who vote Republican correlates well with the fraction who voted Republican in the last election.
 Furthermore, America is not becoming more polarized. Of course, Republicans have a more positive view of the Republican Party than the Democratic Party, and vice versa, but attitudes have hardly changed since 1978. It is fair to point out, though, that attitudes seem to have become somewhat more partisan in the last few years.
 The most remarkable phenomenon is the rise of religion in politics. Thirty years ago, income was a better prediction of party affiliation than church attendance, but this is no longer true. Religion also played a big role in politics a century ago, so we may well be returning to the historical norm.
 Cultural and religious attitudes play a big role in voting behavior. For example, the fraction of the population who agreed with the statement ''AIDS is God's punishment for immoral sexual behavior'' was highly correlated with whether the state was red or blue, according to surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center. The differences in religious attitudes between Vermont and Mississippi are huge.
 These cultural divisions have been around for a long time. In the 1936-37 Gallup poll, residents of New England and the Middle Atlantic states were far more likely than citizens elsewhere to support federally financed health measures aimed at venereal disease, to support a free press and to be willing to vote for Catholic or Jewish candidates.
 Consumption patterns seem to be correlated with cultural attitudes. For example, the states with the largest level of wine consumption per capita also tend to have the most liberal political and social attitudes. In vino veritas?
 Another peculiar connection is the strong correlation between religiosity and militarism. Respondents to Pew's survey who agree that ''prayer is an important part of my daily life'' also agree that the ''best way to ensure peace is through military strength.''
 So why are these cultural and political divisions so persistent? The authors offer both some simple correlations and some more elaborate theories. It turns out that the degree of industrialization 85 years ago is an ''astonishingly good predictor of Democratic support'' among today's voters, as is the fraction of the population that is foreign-born.
 But the biggest effect seems to be the correlation between religion and Republicanism. Among white voters who attend religious services at least once a week, 71 percent voted Republican in the last election, according to the Pew survey.
 Republicans have traditionally appealed to those with higher incomes. The genius of Republicans, beginning with Ronald Reagan and continuing with Karl Rove, was to bring the religious vote into their party, forming a winning coalition of Main Street businessmen, the very wealthy and evangelical Christians. Strange bedfellows, to be sure, but they win elections.
 Mr. Glaeser and Mr. Ward offer some speculation about why religion is such an attractive theme for politicians. According to their theory, direct appeals to voters on issues like abortion are tricky, because strong positions inspire groups on both sides of the issue, who then cancel each other out in votes. The trick is to send ''coded messages'' to different groups of voters. Strong opponents of abortion, for example, may react positively to certain religious allusions that appear innocuous to mainstream voters.
 The Economist magazine characterizes American politics as a contest between the incompetence of Republicans and the incoherence of the Democrats. But there is a reason for the Democrats' incoherence: they are feverishly trying to assemble their own collection of strange bedfellows, and no one quite knows what it is. 
 Ultimately, both parties face the same challenge: how to keep the support of their cultural and political extremists without giving them so much power that they alienate the middle-of-the-road voters.
 In this sort of game, the incumbents tend to have an advantage, unless they are perceived as having messed up so badly that even their most fervent supporters desert them. Hey, maybe the Democrats have a chance after all.

HEADLINE: Strong Economic Data Put Fear in Market

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks dipped yesterday after strong economic data renewed concerns about rising interest rates and an outlook by Procter & Gamble missed expectations.
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 16.17 points, or 0.14 percent, to end at 11,400.28. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.36 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,307.85. The Nasdaq composite index declined 5.87 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,303.97.
Exxon Mobil was among the biggest drags on the S.& P. 500 after crude oil futures for June delivery fell 3 percent, or $2.33, to settle at $72.28 a barrel in New York. Exxon Mobil shed 1.4 percent, or 90 cents, to $63.77. Shares of ConocoPhillips fell 2.4 percent, or $1.68, to $67.50. 
 The Commerce Department reported that factory orders in March rose a stronger-than-expected 4.2 percent. The Institute for Supply Management's services index rose to 63.0 in April, from 60.5 in March, confounding economists' estimates for a slowdown to 59.2.
 On the economic front, the pace of activity in the service sector accelerated more than expected in April, according to the institute. In addition, new orders at factories rose amid strong demand for transportation equipment, electronic products and machinery.
 The data added to worries about inflation and rising global interest rates. ''There's no question investors have an eye on interest rates and that interest rates are an issue that creates nervousness among investors,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at Johnson Illington Advisors.
 After the economic data, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 7/32, to 95 3/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 5.14 percent, from 5.11 percent on Tuesday. 
 The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday, but the outcome of the Fed's June interest rate meeting is less certain. Interest rate futures showed a less-than-even chance of a June rate increase.
 A disappointing forecast by Adobe, the software maker, added to the weaker tone of the market yesterday. Adobe warned Tuesday that its second-quarter profit and revenue would fall at the low end of a previous forecast because of weakness in Europe and North America. In yesterday's regular session, Adobe shares fell 8.6 percent, or $3.29, to close at $35.06.
 Procter & Gamble shares fell 3.3 percent, or $1.89, to $56.22 after its revenue missed expectations and it gave a weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter forecast. The stock was the Dow's biggest decliner and was a major drag on the S.& P. 500 as well.
 Procter & Gamble's results, however, came at the end of a mostly stronger-than-expected corporate reporting period. More than 70 percent of S.& P. companies beat estimates, compared with about 66 percent a year ago.
 Earnings for S.& P. 500 companies are forecast to rise 13.5 percent for the first quarter, up from an estimate of 12.5 percent last week, according to Reuters Estimates.
 Shares of Microsoft fell 3.5 percent, or 84 cents, to $23.17, after reports that the company had held discussions to buy a stake in the Internet company Yahoo to compete against Google.
 Volume was active on the New York Stock Exchange, where about 1.74 billion shares changed hands, above last year's average daily volume of 1.61 billion. On Nasdaq, about 2.17 billion shares traded, above last year's average daily volume of 1.80 billion shares.
 Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones about seven to five on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Facing Neighbors' Concerns, City Kills Huge East Harlem Project

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration has canceled plans for a $1 billion development project in East Harlem that featured a new shopping district, condominium towers and a bus depot, acting because of community opposition that included concerns that the project would aggravate the area's high asthma rate. 
 The plan, known as Uptown New York, is a rare case in which the Bloomberg administration has rescinded one of its large development projects. The decision was announced this week by the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, and City Councilwoman Melissa Mark-Viverito, who were among the project's chief opponents.
Critics had complained that the city's Economic Development Corporation had drawn up plans for the two-million-square-foot project without any community participation. ''Obviously, there has to be development in East Harlem, but it has to be done with a more comprehensive approach,'' Mr. Stringer said. ''People want to be engaged, they want to know what's going on.''
 Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the Economic Development Corporation, thanked the community and its elected officials in a statement for ''helping us to reach a consensus on this project.'' The city will seek new bids on the site later this summer, she said. 
 The project had been planned for an area of mostly vacant city-owned lots bounded by 125th and 127th Streets and Second and Third Avenues, near the foot of the Triborough Bridge.
 Although it had first been proposed in 1999 as a modest retail center on one block of land, the final project included 700,000 square feet of commercial development; 1,500 housing units, including four condominium towers of more than 25 stories; 1,000 new parking spaces; and an underground Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus depot. 
 The developer, Urban Strategic Partners, which built the Harlem USA shopping mall, had also proposed a Latin theater and restaurants at the site to fit in with the character of the predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood. Urban Strategic Partners did not respond to telephone calls and e-mail messages seeking comment.
 Uptown New York was one of several large commercial developments planned for East Harlem in recent years, including the 475,000-square-foot East River Plaza, which is being built several blocks to the south on the former Washburn Wire Factory site. That project will have a Home Depot and a Costco.
 Although it is still one of the poorest neighborhoods in Manhattan, East Harlem has seen a recent spate of market-rate condo and co-op construction, and there were concerns that Uptown New York would drive up the real estate market.
 The project's developer had proposed that 80 percent of the residential units would be sold or rented at market rates, while 20 percent would have been more affordable housing, said Robert J. Rodriguez, the vice chairman of the local community board. He also noted the high child asthma rate in the community.

HEADLINE: In a Debate of Newark Mayoral Candidates, Some Agreement and a Lot of Discord

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
In a freewheeling debate of Newark mayoral candidates, Cory Booker and State Senator Ronald L. Rice traded barbs last night over their professional credentials, their roots in the city and their ability to combat crime, balance the budget and improve schools. 
 The debate -- the campaign's only televised contest, broadcast live in New Jersey on News 12 -- came less than a week before the nonpartisan election on Tuesday. 
Mr. Booker, 37, and Mr. Rice, 60, both Democrats, were joined by two lesser-known candidates, David Blount, a community activist, and Nancy Rosenstock, a Socialist Party candidate, but the back and forth between Mr. Rice and Mr. Booker overshadowed all else.
 The most heated exchanges between Mr. Booker and Mr. Rice focused on their experience. Mr. Rice cited laws he helped pass during 16 years as a member of the Newark Municipal Council and 20 years as a state senator -- protecting children with mandatory window guards and bringing money to Newark for affordable housing -- as proof of his ability to govern. He said Mr. Booker could not compete. 
 ''It's easy to say what you're going to do,'' he said, ''but I've done it.''
 Mr. Booker responded that Mr. Rice, a deputy mayor under Mayor Sharpe James until he resigned a few weeks ago to start his campaign, should be held accountable not for what he has done, but what he failed to stop. 
 Mr. Booker criticized Mr. Rice for failing to oppose the mayor's plan to build a $310 million hockey arena downtown, for failing to speak out against land sales to developers ''for pennies on the dollar,'' and for staying silent when the Municipal Council set aside $80 million for redevelopment projects without rules on how the money would be spent. 
 ''Ron Rice was the deputy mayor right next to Mayor James during all the fiscal scandals,'' Mr. Booker said. And when Mr. Rice countered by noting that his deputy mayor position ''is pretty much ceremonial,'' Mr. Booker said that if he is elected, ''the first thing I will cut is the ceremonial deputy mayor who makes $80,000 to say nothing and do nothing.'' 
 At times, Mr. Booker and Mr. Rice agreed on policy. They both said that the Police Department should be reorganized, with more officers on the streets. Mr. Rice called eminent domain a ''necessary evil,'' while Mr. Booker said he would rarely use it. 
 Mr. Rice adamantly opposed the idea of offering a needle-exchange program to fight AIDS, while Mr. Booker supported it.
 But for much of the hour-long debate, Mr. Rice and Mr. Booker seemed mainly concerned with their opponent's supporters.
 Mr. Booker, who was ahead in the latest polls about a month ago, hammered Mr. Rice for being too close to Mayor James, who has led the city for 20 years with a mix of boosterism and take-no-prisoners machine tactics. Mr. Rice suggested, as he has for weeks, that Mr. Booker was a proxy for outsiders and Republicans who sought to exploit Newark. 
 When given a chance to ask any candidate a question, for example, Mr. Rice turned to Mr. Booker, listed several places outside New Jersey where Mr. Booker's contributors could be found, and asked: ''Who really are you? Who do you really represent?''
 When Mr. Booker heard similar remarks a day earlier at a candidate's forum at the Newark campus of Rutgers University, he rolled his eyes and said that he was proud to have Republican leaders and people like Oprah Winfrey support him. On Wednesday, he repeated that refrain. 
 ''It's a good thing to have a mayor with a larger scope and a larger vision,'' he said. 
 Both candidates, along with Mr. Blount, went out of their way to emphasize their roots in the city. Mr. Rice repeated the boast he often makes on the campaign trail about living in Newark for 51 years, raising his family here and serving on the Newark police force. Mr. Blount listed his work with churches and community groups, offering several thoughtful responses about fighting gangs that Mr. Rice in particular agreed with. 
 In his opening statement, Mr. Booker's said that he has spent his entire professional life in Newark, arriving in 1995.
 The comments seemed to offer a nod to how much civic loyalty means here in this struggling city, which is only now beginning to recuperate after decades of declining population and a shrinking economy. And it served as a reminder of the tactics successfully employed by Mr. James four years ago. 
 In that campaign, the mayor defeated Mr. Booker, 53 percent to 47 percent, after questioning his legitimacy in Newark, calling him a carpetbagger who was not black enough to understand the city, let alone become its chief executive.
 Mr. Booker, who has spent the past four years working as a lawyer and with a nonprofit foundation he founded, has been battling those charges ever since, in part because Mr. Rice has made use of the same arguments. 
 But last night Mr. Booker -- a former Stanford football player who later developed a reputation for oratorical swiftness while at Yale Law School -- was the one who seemed to come closest to Mr. James's bullying style. 
 When Mr. Rice had tied his own tongue in knots with legislative jargon, insisting that public housing be kept ''in perpetuity,'' and fumbling through the word ''interpretation,'' Mr. Booker pounced and made fun of the gaffe. 
 ''I'm not going to focus on interpretation or interpolation or whatever,'' Mr. Booker said. ''I'm going to focus on actions.''

HEADLINE: Fixing Holes in the Health Care Net

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Medicare for all has great appeal, but Paul Krugman doesn't answer his final question: ''Why don't we just do it?'' I can think of at least three good answers: 
One, it would be a one-time fix at best. Costs have been rising nearly as rapidly for Medicare as for private insurance, so there can be no long-term cost solution without also restraining medical inflation.
 Two, Medicare for all might not increase total national health expenditures at first, but it would certainly shift the burden of paying for the half now covered by employment-based insurance to the federal government. Without some major changes in the system, taxes would have to increase.
 Three, the proposal would meet ferocious opposition from the private insurance industry, probably also from drug and device manufacturers, and from providers as well. The latter groups would fear price controls through government buying power. 
 Shouldn't Medicare for all be tied to some sort of prepayment system to control rising costs? Can fee-for-service survive much longer?

HEADLINE: Bush Renews Veto Threat on Spending Bill 

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3 

 BODY:
President Bush prodded Congress over tax cuts on Wednesday and renewed his threat to veto a bill that would pay for the Iraq war and Gulf Coast recovery if the Senate measure's price tag was too high.
 Even as the president issued his warning, lawmakers added special requests to the bill, ratcheting up its cost to $109 billion, well over Mr. Bush's ceiling of $92.2 billion for the war and hurricane recovery, with an additional $2.3 billion to prepare for a flu pandemic.
 Mr. Bush, who has not vetoed any bill, accused ''some here in Washington with trying to load up that bill with unnecessary spending.'' 
 ''The Congress needs to hear me loud and clear,'' Mr. Bush said in a speech to the American Council of Engineering Companies. ''If they spend more than $92.2 billion plus pandemic flu emergency funds, I will veto this bill.'' 
 Mr. Bush also made his case for the economic benefits of tax cuts as Congressional negotiators closed in on a $70 billion deal to extend lower tax rates on investments until 2010 while taking steps to shield some taxpayers from the effects of the alternative minimum tax. 
 The Senate did not seem deterred by the veto threat, adding $289 million at the request of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, to compensate emergency workers who might be injured by experimental flu vaccines. 
 That action followed approval of an extra $1.6 billion for levees in Louisiana, $30 million for Gulf Coast election assistance and $30 million for forest projects. 
 Senate conservatives tried, but failed, to strip the measure of spending that they argued was unnecessary and did not qualify for treatment as an emergency. The critics were able to eliminate just a $15 million seafood-promotion campaign, leaving a significant gap among the overall spending targets of the Senate, Mr. Bush and House Republicans, who this year approved a $91.9 billion emergency bill.
 This week, House Republican leaders accused the Senate of embarking on a ''huge spending spree'' and backed Mr. Bush in his veto threat, raising the likelihood that negotiations on a final measure would be tough.
 ''The American people don't deserve a special-interest shopping cart disguised as a supplemental,'' Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the majority leader, said in a joint statement, using the legislative term for the emergency spending bill.
 Lawmakers in the House and Senate say they anticipate that the spending will be pared in negotiations.
 ''I can't believe the Republican Congress is going to send the president a bill he would veto,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. ''It would be extremely foolish of us, especially when he is right and we are wrong.''
 After months of talks, negotiators tried to wrap up the details of a tax cut package desperately sought by Mr. Bush and Congressional Republicans who want to record a legislative success as they prepare for midterm elections.
 Under the agreement, the 15 percent maximum tax rate on capital gains and dividends would be extended to 2010. The exemption on the alternative minimum tax, originally created to make sure that the affluent paid some income taxes, would be raised to protect millions of middle-income taxpayers from being affected by it.
 ''These lower rates have allowed millions of taxpayers to keep more money in their pockets to spend in the economy or add to their savings through reinvestment, rather than give it to the federal government to spend,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 
 The deal does not include a Senate-passed plan that would have generated more than $4 billion from major American oil companies through a required accounting change. The tax accord would be incorporated in a measure that would be protected from a filibuster in the Senate under special budget rules. 
 Before signing off on the deal, Mr. Grassley sought assurances that other expiring tax breaks, including one for research and development and another for teachers who buy their school supplies, would be extended in a separate measure.
 Mr. Bush said uncertainty about the future of the tax breaks was stifling investment.

Broadway

* 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoe Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

* 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'FESTEN' An intensely staged, indifferently acted production of David Eldridge's adaptation of a 1998 Danish film about a grim family reunion, which was a big hit in London under the same director, Rufus Norris. While the mise en scene remains unsettlingly stark, the Broadway cast (which includes Michael Hayden, Julianna Margulies, Jeremy Sisto and Ali MacGraw) registers the tension and testiness of people suffering from a collective bad hair day. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of cliches set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)

'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'LESTAT' A musical sleeping pill, adapted from Anne Rice's ''Vampire Chronicles'' and featuring songs by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, that could well give the makers of Ambien a run for their money. Dare to look upon this tale of the undead and keep your eyelids from growing heavier and heavier and heavier (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, near 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' (2:30). In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotes from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka)

'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)

'THE CONTRAST' Royall Tyler's slender 1787 romantic comedy -- one of the first professional American plays ever produced -- should be of more interest to historians than to theatergoers (2:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)

'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)

'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Scott Ellis's underpowered production of Joe Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which stars Alec Baldwin in a comedy sketch of a performance, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!' The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Hunka)

'GUARDIANS' Peter Morris's play juxtaposes the moral decline of two disparate characters caught up in the destructive tailwinds of the American invasion of Iraq: a cold-blooded tabloid journalist in London and a soldier in the United States Army. Lee Pace and Katherine Moennig give persuasive performances as the sleazy hack and the scapegoated grunt, but Mr. Morris's play is more flashily provocative than truly thoughtful (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Isherwood)

* 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plotline -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Neil Genzlinger)

'THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST' Lynn Redgrave is an unusually vigorous Lady Bracknell in Sir Peter Hall's new production of Oscar Wilde's peerless comedy from 1895. A satisfactory production that works effectively as a romantic farce but more erratically as a vehicle for Wilde's paradox-perfumed wit. (2:25) Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. (Isherwood)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY' This terrific revival, directed by Michael Greif, identifies the unbearable wistfulness of being in John Guare's delirious heartbreaker of a comedy from 1977. The top-flight cast is led by Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott as sisters -- one living, one a singing ghost -- who move in and out of a lyrical and sordid world where tabloid prurience has become a religion. Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)

'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'SORE THROATS' Howard Brenton's scabrous 1979 drama about the bilious aftermath of a British marriage. Laila Robins and Bill Camp are a middle-aged, newly divorced couple warring over the past and the future. The play's insights into the irreducible conflict between human needs and the constraints of civilization are a little murky (2:10). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'STUFF HAPPENS' Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Off Broadway

'ADVENTURES OF CAVEMAN ROBOT: THE MUSICAL' A disjointed but vivid homage and musical parody, by Jeff Lewonczyk and Debby Schwartz, of comic books and superheroes. Sloppy and long, too (2:10). Brick Theater, 575 Metropolitan Avenue, at Lorimer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 907-3457. (Hunka)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)

'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.( Lawrence Van Gelder)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'MACRUNE'S GUEVARA' The Young Mirror arm of Mirror Repertory revives John Spurling's odd 1969 play about an artist who left behind a wall full of drawings of Che Guevara, and the man who saw something profound in them. Parts of the play read today like a funny sendup of art critics who see too much brilliance in outsider-art gibberish; other parts seem a bit like gibberish of their own (2:15). St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing Wednesday. (Genzlinger)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'AKEELAH AND THE BEE' (PG, 112 minutes) Eleven-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's mother (Angela Bassett) objects to her daughter's obsession with what she considers a ''game.'' The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is, in essence, a formulaic picture into something more satisfying: an underdog tale that manages to inspire without being sappy. (Dana Stevens)

* 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Stephen Holden)

* 'THE DEATH OF MR. LAZARESCU' (R, 154 minutes, in Romanian) This Romanian film follows the grueling final hours of an ailing, alcoholic 62-year-old man in Bucharest, as he is shuttled among four city hospitals. A sustained triumph of ensemble acting, the film seems so absolutely real that it absorbs you into its world in the same way that a documentary like Frederick Wiseman's ''Hospital'' seeps into your consciousness.(Holden)

'GUYS AND BALLS' (R, 106 minutes, in German) In the German soccer comedy ''Guys and Balls,'' a baker's son (Maximilian Bruckner) who is gay forms an all-gay team to defeat his hometown homophobes. Groaning with double-entendres and flaming gay stereotypes, the movie's climactic game offers some of the most sustained -- and literal -- gay bashing in movie history, even if the outcome is no more surprising than that of any other underdog comedy. Adam Sandler is probably already in training.(Jeannette Catsoulis)

'HOW I KILLED A SAINT' (No rating, 82 minutes, in Macedonian and English) Set in Macedonia during the 2001 civil conflict with the country's ethnic Albanians, ''How I Killed a Saint'' views the crisis through the eyes of two deeply troubled siblings. Filmed in a covert, voyeuristic style that's virtually devoid of close-ups, the movie successfully conveys the pervasive anxiety of a country teetering on the brink of civil war. (Catsoulis)

'ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN' (PG, 93 minutes) Creative exhaustion haunts ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' as the characters from 2002's ''Ice Age'' face global warming and the submersion of their valley. While the animals head for safety in a giant, arklike boat, the director, Carlos Saldanha, indulges in biblical imagery and bad science. Over all, a flat and uninspired follow-up to a vastly superior movie. (Catsoulis)

* 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Manohla Dargis)

'LADY VENGEANCE' (R, 111 minutes, in Korean) Park Chanwook completes his ''vengeance trilogy'' with this kinder, gentler exercise in pulp pyrotechnics and empty virtuosity. (Nathan Lee)

* 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jeremie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes -- what invests their work with such terrific urgency -- is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis)

'THE LOST CITY' (R, 143 minutes) Andy Garcia's ode to the Havana of pre-Communist Cuba is a romantic epic manque that swoons across the screen for nearly 2 1/2 hours without saying much beyond the fact that life sure was peachy before Fidel Castro came to town and ruined everything. (Holden)

* 'THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE' (R, 91 minutes) With the help of her charmingly enthusiastic star, Gretchen Mol, the director Mary Harron unwraps the great 1950's pinup queen Bettie Page, who for years was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a web of expertly tied rope. (Dargis)

'SCARY MOVIE 4' (PG-13, 83 minutes) This parasitic franchise is back to feed on last year's disposable distractions, proving, if nothing else, that there's a laugh or two left in ''Brokeback Mountain'' parodies and Viagra overdoses. (Lee)

'RV' (PG, 102 minutes) Nowadays, no family movie is complete without a values-oriented agenda and a bountiful supply of fecal matter, and ''RV'' supplies both. Robin Williams is an overworked executive trying to reconnect with his family on a mobile-home vacation. Barry Sonnenfeld directs with one eye on the production and the other on the clock, producing a movie that feels as clapped-out as the titular vehicle itself. (Catsoulis)

'THE SENTINEL' (PG-13, 108 minutes) The question is why: why would a star of Michael Douglas's stature and obvious intelligence attach himself to a Washington thriller as deeply ridiculous, suspense-free and potentially career-damaging as ''The Sentinel''? (Holden)

* 'SIR! NO SIR!' (No rating, 84 minutes) In this smart, very timely documentary, the filmmaker David Zeiger revisits one of the memorable and least revisited chapters of the Vietnam War, the antiwar movement inside the military.(Dargis)

* 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy cliches and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Lee)

'SUITE HABANA' (No rating, 80 minutes, in Spanish) Fernando Perez tracks a day in 10 ordinary lives in Havana. It may not be a representative portrait of the city, but its most compelling subjects, especially a widower and his disabled son, linger in the mind. (Neil Genzlinger)

'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis)

* 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis)

'THE WHORE'S SON' (No rating, 86 minutes, in German) Michael Sturminger's unsentimental German-language debut feature fearlessly plumbs the depths of an intense mother-son relationship, in which Ozren (appearing at ages 3, 8 and 16) becomes more aware, as the years pass, that his beloved mother, Silvija, is a high-class prostitute. (Laura Kern)

'THE WILD' (G, 94 minutes) Filled with softness and texture, ''The Wild'' follows Samson the lion (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) as he escapes from the zoo to rescue his cub, who has stowed away on a ship bound for Africa. With inspired voice work from Eddie Izzard as a pukka koala and William Shatner as a menacing wildebeest, the movie also finds time to explore the travails of single fatherhood and the evils of oppression. (Catsoulis)

Film Series

(Gates)

THE FILMS OF MIKIO NARUSE (Through Wednesday) BAMcinematek's tribute to Naruse (1905-69), the Japanese realist filmmaker, continues this weekend with three films.

BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)

REDISCOVERING ROSCOE: THE CAREER OF FATTY ARBUCKLE (Through May 15). The Museum of Modern Art's 54-film retrospective of the acting and directing career of the scandal-ridden Arbuckle (1887-1933) continues this weekend with a program of silent films directed by Arbuckle, including ''Fatty's Reckless Fling'' (1915) and a program of four 1917 films starring Arbuckle and Buster Keaton. (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

BAMBOOZLE (Tomorrow and Sunday) Somehow it is appropriate that this two-day festival, a cluster of a few dozen bands with a big presence on MySpace.com, is taking the form of a huge, flat sprawl in the Meadowlands parking lots: an endless web of fans and bands blending together. Fall Out Boy headlines tomorrow, followed by, among many others, All American Rejects, Hawthorne Heights, Thursday, Mewithoutyou, Minus the Bear, Motion City Soundtrack, Relient K, Armor for Sleep, Keating, the Killing Sequence and Streetlight Manifesto. On Sunday, Taking Back Sunday headlines, with AFI, Captured by Robots, From Autumn to Ashes, Him, Moneen, Saves the Day, Panic! at the Disco, Say Anything, Poison the Well and the festival's token hip-hop star, Method Man. At 11:30 a.m., Meadowlands Sports Complex, Routes 3 and 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900 or (212) 307-7171; $32 both days. (Ben Sisario)

BLACK LIPS, SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE (Tonight) Fresh from their appearances opening up for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs at the cavernous Roseland, the Black Lips, from Atlanta, have a gig that is more their size. The band plays a grisly version of 1960's garage rock that sounds deliberately damaged. With Soldiers of Fortune -- which includes members of the garage-metal-experimental band Oneida, Jah Division and the countryish Oakley Hall -- and Mountains of Mattalama. At 10, Place, Norman and Kingsland Avenues, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, www.toddpnyc.com; $8. (Sisario)

* THE BOOKS (Tonight) Nick Zammuto and Paul de Jong of the Books make beguiling electronic collages out of seemingly incongruous elements: disembodied vocal samples, a few plucks from a banjo or another string instrument, and unclassifiable noises that fade in and out like traffic. Part of the pleasure of listening to their music is trying to figure out just why it all works so wonderfully and wittily. Their performance will incorporate video as well as audio, and their opening act is the always adventurous violinist Todd Reynolds, of the string quartet Ethel. At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; sold out. (Sisario)

BRIAN JONESTOWN MASSACRE (Wednesday) This tuneless headache of a band, modeled on the jangly psychedelic rock of Britain and Los Angeles in the mid-1960's as well as the self-destructive persona of Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones, was on its way into obscurity when, two years ago, it was featured in a hit documentary, ''Dig!,'' and a legend was created. Since then the band has toured widely, to large audiences who wait for its leader, Anton Newcombe, to lash out in paranoia and, as he did in the film, kick a fan in the head. With the Lilys. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20. (Sisario)

CLEM SNIDE (Tomorrow and Monday) With a homely, nasal tenor and a few lonesome strums on his guitar, Eef Barzelay, the lead singer and chief songwriter of the band Clem Snide, can picture heartache and regret in trompe-l'oeil precision or, if the mood strikes him, simply goof off. In one song on his new solo album, ''Bitter Honey'' (SpinArt), he takes on the persona of a woman whose rear end makes an appearance in a video: ''It was on screen for a second but was kind of hard to miss.'' With Elvis Perkins, a band from Rhode Island that borrows Clem Snide's spacious sound without Mr. Barzelay's quirks. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. Monday at 8 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Sisario)

CONCRETES (Monday) This eight-piece group from Stockholm specializes in the kind of breezy, nostalgic chamber-pop popularized by Belle and Sebastian, with hummable and carefully orchestrated hymns to innocence and sunshine. Opening the show is the Australian singer and songwriter Sally Seltmann, performing under the stage name New Buffalo. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sisario)

EVAN DANDO (Tonight) Mr. Dando, the lead heartthrob of the Lemonheads -- who by many reports did a surprisingly credible job singing with the reunited MC5 two years ago, though most fans had none of it -- plays a solo show. With the Hymns. At 8, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $15. (Sisario)

* FAUN FABLES, BARBEZ (Tomorrow) On a bed of ghostly acoustic folk, Faun Fables's Dawn McCarthy and Nils Frykdahl build an astonishing and unpredictable kind of pop theater, at once grandiose and nightmarish and silly. Their new album, ''The Transit Rider'' (Drag City), is a creepily obsessive song cycle about the commuting life, which the band will perform in costume, with films and a cast of four. Barbez, from New York, finds an enticing middle ground between Kurt Weill's cabaret, droning avant-garde rock and the twinkling perpetual-motion pieces of Erik Satie. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario)

PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK MUSIC (Tomorrow and Sunday) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Mr. Green offers an extensive rock curriculum at his school in Philadelphia, teaching youngsters the canon as well as the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. For three weekends this month, his students will visit CBGB to show off their mastery of the classics. The residency begins with the music of Frank Zappa, which received a spirited reading in the film. (Next are the Beatles and AC/DC.) 4 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; $10. (Sisario)

INXS (Tonight) Last year ''Rock Star: INXS,'' the reality series on CBS, picked a new singer for the onetime hit makers of INXS, whose original singer and only recognizable member, Michael Hutchence, died in 1997. The winner was one J. D. Fortune, a former Elvis impersonator who became -- this was reality TV, remember -- a Michael Hutchence impersonator. At 8, Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171; $49.50 to $79.50. (Sisario)

YUNGCHEN LHAMO (Tonight) Long exiled from Tibet, Ms. Lhamo sings tender and mournful prayers about struggle and forgiveness, set to a soothing New Age sound that incorporates foamy electronics, electric guitars and assorted world-music instruments, like the African kora. Tonight she appears with some guests from her new album, ''Ama'' (Real World), including the British singer Joy Askew. At 8, Lerner Hall Theater at Columbia University, Broadway at 115th Street, Morningside Heights, (866) 468-7619; $25; $21 for members of Tibet House; $17 for students and Tibetans. (Sisario)

* LIGHTNING BOLT (Sunday) At first it is hard to believe that all the glorious chaos of Lightning Bolt -- a stalwart of the big noise-punk scene in Providence, R.I. -- is being made by only two people, the bassist Brian Gibson and the drummer and vocalist Brian Chippendale. But as the sound comes into focus, a playful give-and-take becomes clear, as Mr. Gibson and Mr. Chippendale toss back and forth gigantic metal riffs and giggly high notes, creating rainbows of dissonance. This concert, before the band goes on a European tour, is a benefit for Tarantula Hill, a performance space in Baltimore that was recently damaged by a fire. Also on the bill are the Brooklyn sludge-rockers Double Leopards, the Baltimore duo Nautical Almanac and Kites, a one-man noise factory from Providence. At 7 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, near Richards Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007; $10. (Sisario)

MASTERS OF INDIAN MUSIC (Tonight) U. Shrinivas is not only a virtuoso on the electric mandolin but also a clever innovator: he made modifications on his instrument to adapt it for the Carnatic classical style of southern India. Born in 1969, he has long bridged classical and pop styles, first as a prodigy at jazz festivals and later with John McLaughlin and his group Remember Shakti. He appears in a World Music Institute concert with his brother U. Rajesh, who also plays the mandolin. At 8, Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, (212) 545-7536; $30; $15 for students. (Sisario)

MATMOS (Tonight) M. C. Schmidt and Drew Daniel of the San Francisco electronic group Matmos make music out of almost any found sounds: playing cards being shuffled, the slurping of liposuction, even melting ice. The effect can be lighthearted and playful or eerily disconcerting, as on one track on the group's latest album, ''The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of the Beast'' (Matador), in which robotic voices discuss ''pain in someone else's body'' over the mechanical ticking of typewriters. At 7, Whitney Museum of American Art, (800) 944-8639; free with pay-what-you-wish museum admission, but a $75 season pass to the Whitney Live series guarantees a seat. (Sisario)

MINDLESS SELF INDULGENCE (Thursday) Bands merging high-adrenaline industrial rock with a carnival-of-freaks theatricality had a pretty good run in the 90's, the era of Ministry, My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult and Marilyn Manson. But fans are not ready to put away their black lipstick just yet, if the grass-roots success of this New York group is any indication. This show kicks off four nights at Avalon, two already sold out. 8 p.m., 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario)

THURSTON MOORE (Wednesday) Mr. Moore, one of the guitarists in Sonic Youth and an eternal symbol of casually omnivorous eclecticism, plays two sets of improvisations, the first solo and the second with unnamed guests. 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; $10 per set. (Sisario)

NORTEC COLLECTIVE (Tonight) A loose confederation of musicians and visual artists, the Nortec Collective is devoted to the cutting, rearranging and pasting of norteno -- the vibrant border style of accordions and oompah brass known on this side of the border as Tex-Mex. At midnight, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario)

* PELICAN, MONO (Tuesday) It's almost a misnomer to call Pelican a metal band. This four-piece instrumental group does indeed play loud, chunky power chords in the Melvins tradition, but with a sense of tragic drama that keeps the songs at a slow, reflective pace. With Mono, an instrumental group from Japan that flies from light turbulence into magnificent storms of noise. 8 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or (212) 307-7171; $15 in advance, $16 at the door. (Sisario)

PINBACK (Tuesday and Wednesday) This band from San Diego, centered on Zach Smith and Rob Crow, makes modesty a virtue. Its songs move at deliberate speed with glimmers of twanged guitar or electronic blips; its vocals are conversational, full of disappointment and wistful hopes. With Pleaseeasaur. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; sold out. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $16 in advance and $18 at the door. (Jon Pareles)

* JOSH RITTER, HEM (Tonight) A guileless, boy-next-door voice is the first clue that Mr. Ritter doesn't need a lot of fancy tricks to make a point. Powerfully minimal songwriting is another. But there is no limit to the depth and ambition of his songs, whether he is confessing a simple crush or following his thoughts on a long, Whitmanesque incantation, as he does for more than nine minutes on ''Thin Blue Flame'' from his new album, ''The Animal Years'' (V2). Hem plays somewhat prosaic alt-country, but in such delicate, sensuous arrangements that it doesn't matter. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario)

SAW DOCTORS (Thursday) The Saw Doctors sing earnest, folk-rocking anthems of small-town life ''for those who feel they've been mistreated/Discriminated, robbed or cheated.'' In Ireland their populism has brought them a huge national following; even in New York City, there should be plenty of voices with brogues singing along. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $26.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles)

OBIE TRICE (Tuesday) Obie Trice emerged a few years ago as a solid protege of Eminem; 50 Cent made his appearance around the same time, though, and most of the world forgot about Eminem's other proteges. But Mr. Trice has remained a good soldier. His new single, ''Snitch,'' is a humorless warning to a stool pigeon: ''This act is not permitted.'' Gulp! 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario)

Cabaret

Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

* KAREN AKERS (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) This regal cabaret singer and the brassy songs of Kander and Ebb that she is offering in her new show may not be an obvious fit. But Ms. Akers locates the heart inside the brass and sass. At 9 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; cover, $60, with a $20 minimum; $60 prix fixe dinner required on Thursdays and at the early shows tonight and tomorrow. (Stephen Holden)

BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. At 2 p.m., the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $58, including brunch at noon. (Holden)

BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden)

ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. At 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden)

MEMORIAL FOR DEREK BAILEY (Through May 31) The iconoclastic guitarist Derek Bailey had originally intended to perform with many of the artists he assembled for this monthlong run, which now serves as a fitting tribute. Highlights in the coming week include a percussion duo of Cyro Baptista and Billy Martin (tomorrow), an evening with the noise-rock guitarist Thurston Moore (Wednesday) and a group called Audible Means, led by the bassist Lisle Ellis (Thursday). At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Nate Chinen)

ANDY BEY (Through Sunday) Intimacy is a hallmark of Mr. Bey's vocal style, which alternates between a rich baritone and a burnished falsetto. He's also a fine pianist, as he'll demonstrate with this quartet featuring the guitarist Paul Meyers. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25 and $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

BISHOP-CLEAVER-FLOOD (Wednesday) As on his new album, ''Time and Imaginary Time'' (Envoi), the saxophonist Andrew Bishop engages in a communicative exchange with the drummer Gerald Cleaver and the bassist Tim Flood, expanding compositional frames and exploring open space. At 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)

GERALD CLEAVER'S VIOLET HOUR (Tomorrow) Mr. Cleaver's suggestive pulse as a drummer has served him well in both conventional and experimental settings. His less heralded compositional vision guides this project, with the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt, the saxophonists J. D. Allen and Andrew Bishop, the pianist Ben Waltzer and the bassist Chris Lightcap. At 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

KRIS DAVIS QUARTET (Sunday night) As on her new album, ''The Slightest Shift'' (Fresh Sound/New Talent), Ms. Davis applies her keyboard playing and compositions to a group consisting of Tony Malaby on tenor saxophone, Eivind Opsvik on bass and Jeff Davis on drums.

At 8 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)

DAVE DOUGLAS QUINTET (Through Sunday) The trumpeter Dave Douglas always seems on the verge of forming a new band, but this one -- with Uri Caine on piano and Fender Rhodes; James Genus on bass; and Clarence Penn on drums -- has been a solid entity for several years. Here they celebrate a new album, ''Meaning and Mystery'' (Greenleaf), and a valuable new member, the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; tonight and tomorrow, $25; with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

SCOTT FEINER'S PANDEIRO JAZZ (Tomorrow) Mr. Feiner treats the pandeiro, a tambourinelike Brazilian hand drum, as an expressive jazz instrument; he sets out to prove his point in this ensemble, with the saxophonist Joel Frahm, the guitarist Freddie Bryant and the bassist Doug Weiss. At 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $15. (Chinen)

FLY (Tuesday through May 14) The tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Jeff Ballard make up this collaborative trio, which eschews the usual horn-plus-rhythm hierarchy in the service of an elastic group ideal. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; Friday and Saturday, $25; with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

VINCENT GARDNER-NICHOLAS PAYTON QUINTET (Tuesday through May 14) The John Coltrane album ''Blue Trane'' serves as conceptual fodder for this hard-bop ensemble, which features Mr. Payton on trumpet, Mr. Gardner on trombone and Walter Blanding Jr. on tenor saxophone. Leading the rhythm section is the capable pianist Marc Cary. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)

KENNY GARRETT QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Garrett is a bulldozer on the alto saxophone, which he applies to blazing post-Coltrane calisthenics; he's also an introspective artisan on the soprano, with which he investigates East Asian folk timbres. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30 and $40 , with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

DAVID GILMORE GROUP (Tomorrow) Mr. Gilmore favors the clean guitar tone of George Benson, but his playing tends more toward an African rhythmic concept and a slippery melodic sense. He works with players equal to the task: Ravi Coltrane on tenor and soprano saxophones, Luis Perdomo on piano, Brad Jones on bass and Terreon Gully on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $15; members, $10. (Chinen)

STEFON HARRIS AND KENNY BARRON (Wednesday) Mr. Barron is the leading practitioner of an elegant, economical piano style that thrives in any mainstream setting; Mr. Harris is a firecracker of a vibraphonist with a brightly dynamic style. They should make for fascinating duet partners. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330.; $25. (Chinen)

FRED HERSCH AND NANCY KING (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Hersch, the pianist, has worked memorably with the elite jazz vocalists of our era; Ms. King isn't reflexively included in those ranks, but that's certainly through no fault of her own. This duo engagement, coming on the heels of a new MaxJazz album, should bring out the best in both of them. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25. (Chinen)

JESSICA LURIE ENSEMBLE (Tuesday) Playing saxophone, flute and accordion as well as singing, Ms. Lurie wears many hats in this exploratory but often melodic group.

At 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)

KATE McGARRY (Monday) Ms. McGarry is a quiet but potent singer who recasts jazz and folk material alike with a quavering sincerity. She works here not only with a fine trio led by the pianist Bruce Barth, but also with a tap dancer, Joseph Wiggan. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $15.(Chinen)

NEW ORLEANS: CONGO SQUARE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Jazz at Lincoln Center concludes its city-hopping season with a focus on New Orleans, a place that had deep resonance for the organization long before Hurricane Katrina. In the Rose Theater, Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra present new music inspired by Congo Square, with help from the African percussionists Yacub Addy and Odadaa. In the Allen Room, the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon plays spirituals and gospel tunes. At 7:30 in the Allen Room, 8 in the Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $105.50 and $135.50. (Chinen)

WILLIAM PARKER'S INTRASCOPIC MUSIC ENSEMBLE (Sunday) Mr. Parker is a pillar, musically and morally, of modern avant-garde jazz culture; he plays bass and a small arsenal of flutes and percussion in his Intrascopic Music Ensemble, which also includes several drummers, a tuba player and a visual artist.

PAUL SHAPIRO'S MIDNIGHT MINYAN (Tuesday) As on his new album ''It's in the Twilight'' (Tzadik), Mr. Shapiro, a tenor saxophonist, transforms the ritual of a Friday night Shabbat service into a rollicking downtown jam. His co-conspirators are Steven Bernstein on slide trumpet, Peter Apfelbaum on tenor saxophone, Brian Mitchell on piano, Booker King on bass and Tony Lewis on drums. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)

MCCOY TYNER TRIO WITH SAVION GLOVER (Tuesday through May 14) The rumbling sweep of Mr. Tyner's piano playing provokes a strong response from Mr. Glover, the paragon of rhythmic tap dance. It also interacts powerfully with the accompaniment of Charnett Moffett on bass and Eric Kamau Gravatt on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $45 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $30 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

 Opera

* 'LOHENGRIN' (Tomorrow) The revival of Robert Wilson's 1998 production is not the same show that earned the director lusty boos at its premiere. The abstract sets, with luminous bars of white light against a mystical blue backdrop, are as haunting as ever. But this time the singers seem far more comfortable with the glacial movements and stylized hand and arm gestures, which have been simplified. The German tenor Klaus Florian Vogt, in his Met debut appearances, sings the title role, taking over for Ben Heppner. The charismatic soprano Karita Mattila, as Elsa, is in glorious voice. The conductor Philippe Auguin draws pulsing and incisive playing from the Met orchestra. 7:15 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $150 and $220 tickets remaining.(Anthony Tommasini)

'RIGOLETTO' (Tuesday) Though Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon, the opera world's hottest soprano-tenor couple, have moved on to other things, Verdi's ''Rigoletto'' is still with us at the Met, but with an entirely new cast from the one that sang it earlier this season. Paolo Gavanelli sings the title role, with Norah Amsellem as Gilda and Roberto Aronica as the Duke, Italian opera's most caddish character. Asher Fisch conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175.(Tommasini)

* 'TOSCA' (Tonight, Monday and Thursday) Deborah Voigt will not be everyone's idea of a Tosca. Her bright and penetrating singing recalls the Nordic sound and temperament of Birgit Nilsson's in the role. But Ms. Voigt invests the character with personal touches, bringing out Tosca's vulnerability, and sings with daring abandon during the intense confrontation with the villainous Scarpia, here the veteran bass James Morris, who sounds terrific. The tenor Franco Farina is an ardent if sometimes bellowing Cavaradossi. (On Thursday, Eduardo Villa takes over for Mr. Farina and Greer Grimsley replaces Mr. Morris.) Carlo Rizzi conducts. Tonight at 8, Monday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $205 tonight, with limited availability; sold out Monday; $100 and $175 tickets remaining on Thursday. (Tommasini)

(Jeremy Eichler)

* IAN BOSTRIDGE AND LEIF OVE ANDSNES (Tomorrow) In a series of EMI recordings together, the British tenor Ian Bostridge and the Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes have proved to be a remarkably eloquent team, and of course, they have done wonders on their own as well. In this joint recital, they share the spotlight, with Mr. Andsnes opening the program with Beethoven's Sonata No. 31 and then joining Mr. Bostridge for a selection of Schubert songs. Mr. Andsnes is also giving a recital -- the same Beethoven sonata, as well as works by Schumann, Mendelssohn and Mussorgsky -- as part of the Peoples' Symphony Concerts series on Sunday afternoon. Mr. Bostridge and Mr. Andsnes perform tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; sold out.

CAMERATA SALZBURG (Sunday) Sir Roger Norrington and his Camerata Salzburg offered a provocative Beethoven symphony cycle at Alice Tully Hall in 2003.

* EMERSON STRING QUARTET (Thursday) Among the great composers of the 20th century, Shostakovich was the most inscrutable. But in his 15 string quartets he came closest to showing his hand. These works are like entries in a diary and he never imagined that they would become as popular as they are today. The Emerson Quartet plays these seminal works compellingly and has recorded them complete. They are performing them all, in chronological order. The fourth of five programs offers Nos. 10, 11 and 12. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $60. (Tommasini)

(Kozinn)

* NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, Tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Sir Colin Davis returns to the New York Philharmonic with some of the composers that have long been his calling cards. Tonight and tomorrow the program is split between Mozart (the overture to ''La Clemenza di Tito,'' the Piano Concerto No. 26 and the aria ''Ch'io mi scordi di te?'') and Sibelius (''Luonnotar'' and the Third Symphony). Mitsuko Uchida, the pianist, and Soile Isokoski, the soprano, are the soloists. On Wednesday, David Zinman takes over the podium to lead Bartok's Rhapsody No. 1, John Adams's ''Naive and Sentimental Music'' and the Beethoven Triple Concerto. The soloists are Yo-Yo Ma, cellist; Jonathan Gandelsman, violinist; and Joel Fan, pianist.

* RICHARD MOVE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Move, fresh from his appearance as Martha Graham and his duet with Desmond Richardson at the Graham Dance Company gala, presents ''The Show (Achilles Heels).'' This mega-hip take on things Greek will offer Deborah Harry (a k a Blondie), as Athena, singing live songs, and Rasta Thomas in the title role, originally performed by Mikhail Baryshnikov in the piece's out-of-town White Oak Dance Project premiere in 2002. The cast also includes Katherine Crockett from the Graham company. Arto Lindsay did the score. At 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, ext. 11 or thekitchen.org; $20.

 Museums

* American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. Few exhibitions this size (35 pieces) present quite such a vivid and rewarding picture of artistic assimilation and transformation. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

* BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' through June 11. Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Grace Glueck)

* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000.(Glueck)

* Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. (See above.) (Smith)

DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'Stories to Tell: Masterworks from the Kelly Collection of American Illustration,' through May 21. During the Golden Age of Illustration -- the 1880's to the 1930's -- images made by painters for magazines and books captivated the collective American psyche. Original works by some of the best of those artists, including J. C. Leyendecker, N. C. Wyeth and Charles Dana Gibson, are included in this extensive and well-selected exhibition. 580 Madison Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Ken Johnson)

* FRICK COLLECTION: 'GOYA's LAST WORKS,' through May 14. This compact show is sublime. The most humane portraits are mixed with sketches, like diary entries, in which society is an irredeemable mob of lunatics and murderers. In exile in Bordeaux, Goya spent his last days in physical misery, lamenting man's essential evil while experimenting with the new medium of lithography and inventing the most exquisite, luminous paintings on tiny chips of ivory. Like the late works of Titian or Rembrandt, Goya's late works achieve a whole new level of freedom and depth, haunted by death but exalted. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Michael Kimmelman)

* FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' (See above.) (Glueck)

* Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. (212) 423-3500.(Holland Cotter)

* International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)

* Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,' through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this celebratory exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or themorgan.org. ( Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter)

* The Museum of Modern Art: 'Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking,' through May 22. This excellent group show considers what ''Islamic'' means in the work of several contemporary artists, and it means many things, none simple. Just to see the uses made of calligraphy by Shirazeh Houshiary, Rachid Koraichi and Shirin Neshat is to understand the lesson in variety put forward here. At the same time, the show is far from didactic. It's beautiful, sexy and, in the case of Raqib Shaw's painting and Kutlug Ataman's video of Sufi meditation, ecstatic. (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)

NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)

* The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)

Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Kimmelman)

Galleries: 57th Street

* 'Great Pots: The Vessel as Art, 1900 to 2000' This extraordinarily rich and varied lobby show presents 164 works by 143 artists from the Newark Museum's famed ceramics collection. It focuses on utilitarian vessels -- vases, bowls, pots, mugs and platters -- but covers an enormous amount of aesthetic territory, taking in Pueblo Indian, Arts and Crafts, classical Japanese, European Modernist, Pop, funk and much more. The show includes great craftsmen like George Orr, Beatrice Wood, Peter Voulkos and Ron Nagel. The UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 51st Street, (212) 713-2885, through May 19. (Johnson)

Galleries: SoHo

'The Garden Party' This crowded group show on the theme of the erotic garden looks as if it were produced by a college fraternity for its spring festival. It includes high-profile artists like Vanessa Beecroft, Olafur Eliasson and Yoko Ono. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, near Greene Street, (212) 343-7300, through May 13. (Johnson)

Hanna Liden: 'Hairfaces, Scapegoats, Birds, Bloodsuckers, Squareheads & a Few Deaths' A Swedish artist who is in this year's Whitney Biennial, Ms. Liden produces staged color photographs that resemble stills from a low-budget gothic horror movie. With young people in tribal masks menaced by black shrouded figures of death in beautiful wilderness settings, they suggest a meeting of Ingmar Berman and ''The Road Warrior.'' Rivington Arms, 4 East Second Street, East Village, (646) 654-3213, through May 14. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

Ed Clark: 'Rebirth' Mr. Clark, who turns 80 on May 6, uses push brooms to sweep great quantities of paint across medium-large canvases, creating bold, suave and sensuous Abstract Expressionist evocations of oceanic flux. G. R. N'Namdi, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 929-6645, through May 11. (Johnson)

* Lisa Ruyter: 'I Am a Camera' This painter, known for colorful, photo-based, psychedelic cartoons, takes an exciting turn to black, white and many shades of gray in a series of large, psychologically resonant, finely outlined self-portraits. The nearly 16-foot-wide portrait of the artist, doubled in a mirror against an arboreal background, is a knockout. Team, 527 West 26th Street, (212) 279-9219, through May 13. (Johnson)

Robert Sholties: 'Evolution' A Pennsylvania postal worker with no formal art training, Mr. Sholties paints intensely detailed fantasy landscapes populated by wild and domestic animals and people who are often in South American costumes. Magical, allegorical and apocalyptic events occur, and themes of religion and ecological disaster are addressed in these visionary pictures. Ricco Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4819, through May 13.(Johnson)

Davor Vrankic With impressively skillful application of graphite on paper, this Paris-based Croatian artist creates darkly comical images of big-eyed, E.T.-like monsters who appear to be undergoing some terrible psychological suffering. The Proposition, 559 West 22nd Street, (212) 242-0035, through May 13. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

'An American Abroad: Sandra Fisher and her School of London Friends' Fisher, who was married to the painter R. B. Kitaj, was an American who lived in London until her death in 1994 at age 47. This show of more than 60 drawings and paintings, mostly portraits or nudes, reveals a modestly talented traditionalist with a deft, painterly touch and a down-to-earth affection for her subjects. Also included are some portraits of Fisher by artists like Frank Auerbach, Avigdor Arikha and Mr. Kitaj. New York Studio School, 8 West Eighth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-6466, through May 13. (Johnson)

Ken Butler: 'Instrumental Desire: Strings Attached' Trained as a classical musician and as a painter, Mr. Butler is a performance artist who produces electronically amplified music on unlikely stringed instruments that he constructs himself out of found objects and parts of real instruments. This jam-packed exhibition presents 79 instruments made from things like a rifle, an old sled, a leaf rake and a metal detector. Sideshow, 319 Bedford Avenue, at South Second Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 486-8180, through May 14. (Johnson)

Last Chance

* ECHOES FROM THE STEPPES: MONGOLIAN 17TH-, 18TH- AND 19TH-CENTURY BRONZES AND PAINTINGS The bronzes represent the four styles of Mongolian religious sculpture, but the main event is the 77 sakhuis paintings -- small, finely wrought, richly colored portraits of Buddhist priests and protective or wrathful deities that the nomadic Mongols wore, framed in silver, as amulets. E. & J. Frankel, 1040 Madison Avenue, at 79th Street, (212) 879-5733; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL' This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. (212) 708-9400; closes on Monday. (Because of the popularity of the show, museum hours will be extended tomorrow to 8 p.m.) (Glueck)

James Harrison: 'The Future is in the Past' Densely worked, visionary paintings and drawings like the ones in this fascinating show have made Harrison (1925-90) a figure of cultlike devotion for certain local artists. Luise Ross, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 343-2161; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)

Gedi Sibony and Josh Smith These cool, dry hipsters provoke a mildly irate perplexity. Mr. Smith roughly paints his own name in large, blocky letters on collages and stretched store-bought fabric. Mr. Sibony has placed sheets of cardboard, plywood, sheetrock and perforated metal around the gallery; removed part of a gallery wall; and covered part of one room with nondescript carpet. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, at Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 206-1290; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)

Amy Sillman With sensuous verve Ms. Sillman mixes a number of different painterly languages in her appealing but uncertainly focused paintings: Abstract Expressionism, Cubism, Constructivism and primitivistic image-making. Sikkema Jenkins, 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2262; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)

HEADLINE: Dresden Is Debt-Free After $1.2 Billion Sale to U.S. Investor

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: DRESDEN, Germany, April 28 

 BODY:
Ingolf Rossberg is the mayor of this majestic eastern German city. But watching him stride around his ballroom-size office, wreathed in smoke from his cigarillo, one could mistake him for a European real estate tycoon.
 Yet he is that after a fashion. Mr. Rossberg reached a deal in March to sell Dresden's entire stock of 48,000 city-owned apartments to an American private equity firm, the Fortress Investment Group, for $1.2 billion. In a single stroke, Dresden wiped out its burdensome public debt.
''We had to move fast,'' he said, ''because if you had 10 German cities selling their property, it would be a buyer's market.'' 
 That may soon be the case. German cities are lining up for a mammoth wave of foreign investment in their property. Lured by a German real estate market that is the most stagnant in any major European country, and a vast supply of well-kept public housing, American and other foreign companies have already snapped up dozens of projects in Berlin, Bremen, Essen and other German cities. 
 Affordable public housing is a pillar of the German welfare state, and the prospect of vast pieces of it falling into the hands of pinstriped financiers from New York or London has unsettled many people here. In Dresden, 45,000 of them signed a petition opposing the sale.
 ''When a new owner is profit-oriented, it brings changes,'' said Peter Bartels, the chairman of the Dresden renters' association. ''We're not sure yet what kinds of changes. But we know there will be changes.''
 Foreign private equity investors, mostly American and British, have already spent $25 billion since 2003 on apartments owned by German cities and companies. With the owners hungry to raise even more money, analysts forecast that 750,000 additional units will be sold over the next five years.
 The acquisitions have not been limited to residential real estate. A property fund owned by Goldman Sachs paid $4.7 billion in March for a controlling stake in the real estate holdings of KarstadtQuelle, Germany's largest department-store chain. 
 ''The heavy money in London and New York sees a lot of money in German real estate,'' said Allan Saunderson, managing editor of Property Finance Europe in Frankfurt. ''We are at the beginning of a long process that will see a large chunk of Germany's public-sector housing sold.''
 The foreign appetite dovetails nicely with Germany's needs: virtually every major German city is awash in debt. And with the limited health of a convalescing German economy, they have had few other ready ways to raise funds. Thanks to its sale, Dresden can promote itself as the first debt-free major city in the country.
 Mayor Rossberg, who selected the Fortress bid after cutting a list of 83 bidders to three finalists, said, ''We found that the interests of Fortress were parallel to the interests of Dresden.''
 Not everyone agrees. The tenants who opposed the sale said they feared that Fortress would raise rents or even throw people out on the street. They question how a private equity firm, with its need for hefty returns, could own public housing without squeezing the people who live there.
 ''These investors have no social conscience whatsoever,'' said Thilo Kluge, 45, a tenant in a city-owned apartment who campaigned against the sale. ''They have a single interest: Make my bank account fatter.''
 Some German politicians have tried to capitalize on such fears. 
 During last year's election campaign, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Franz Muntefering , who is now the labor minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel's broad-based governing coalition, referred to private equity firms as locusts, plundering German assets and exploiting the locals.
 Fortress, based in New York and run by bankers formerly at Goldman Sachs and the asset management firm BlackRock, seems aware of the possibility of such resentment. It has taken pains to assure tenants that it will be socially responsible.
 ''We want to cooperate over the next decades,'' Robert I. Kauffman, the head of Fortress European operations, said at a news conference on March 10 to announce the deal. The head of its German business, Matthias Moser, ruled out an ''aggressive strategy to raise rents.''
 Fortress declined to comment for this article.
 The residents will be protected by an agreement, known as the Social Charter, that Fortress had to sign to stay in the bidding. The contract limits its ability to raise rents -- including those that are below market rate -- and protects tenants from being evicted. People over 60 or with severe disabilities are guaranteed lifelong tenancy.
 Moreover, Fortress must hold on to 34,000 of the apartments for 10 years before it sells them. And when it does, it must offer existing tenants a 15 percent reduction from the market price. Finally, it cannot renovate the apartment complexes into luxury condominiums.
 Analysts say the rights granted to the residents are not much different from those that govern Germany's highly regulated rental market. But that raises a question: How will Fortress recoup its billion-dollar investment?
 The company has said it wants to reduce the vacancy rate in the apartments, currently 17 percent. To do that, experts predict, Fortress will have to lower rents to attract new tenants. ''That would be friendly for the tenants,'' Mr. Bartels of the renters' association said, ''but it would cause problems for the city.'' 
 Dresden, he noted, has tens of thousands of apartments owned by cooperative associations. If the rent on the Fortress apartments were to decline, it would put other cooperatives under pressure to match the lower rents.
 Mayor Rossberg, who is a member of the pro-market Free Democratic Party, said he would welcome a problem like that. And anyway, he noted, with 40,000 vacant apartments in the city -- a legacy of the westward migration of East Germans after the fall of the Berlin Wall -- people already have the flexibility to move from one apartment to another.
 If Fortress can increase occupancy rates, analysts said, it would probably be content to wait a decade to sell the apartments. Much of its capital, Mayor Rossberg said, comes from state pension funds in the United States, which he said allowed Fortress to be a patient investor.
 ''The rule of thumb is that the firms only put in 25 percent of their own money,'' Mr. Saunderson of Property Finance Europe said. ''The rest is bank financing. You take out your 25 percent in a few years, and you have a rolling program of sales. People grow old and die, or leave the apartments.'' 
 Given the timetable involved in these investments, the foreigners also appear to be betting on the local economy. Dresden, with a jobless rate of 14.6 percent, would seem to be an unpromising market. But Mayor Rossberg said the city's population had begun to grow again, as its strengthening commercial base attracted people from elsewhere in eastern Germany.
 In general, Germany looks less risky than it did three years ago, when the early speculators arrived.
 As the atmosphere brightens, analysts say that German consumers will begin to spend money again. ''Germany is a very wealthy country, but their problem is that they don't know it,'' said Philippe Tannenbaum, the head of research at EuroHypo, a German bank that finances property deals.
 The question is whether they will start buying real estate. Home ownership has only limited popularity in Germany, which has one of the highest percentages of renters of any advanced economy. And professional German investors have turned up their noses at their home market.
 ''Germans think seaside condominiums in Florida are a good thing to buy,'' Mr. Saunderson remarked, ''at the same time that Americans are bailing out of what they view as a frothy market.''
 To some extent, the rush into German real estate merely reflects that lack of other good options. Real estate prices in the United States, Britain, France and Spain have risen at torrid rates for the last few years, making Germany look like a bargain.
 Berlin, for example, has had a vast auction of state- and city-owned apartments. In 2004, Goldman Sachs and Cerberus, a New York-based hedge fund, bought 66,000 units for $2.5 billion. Gagfah, a state-owned company, sold 80,000 apartments to Fortress for $4.4 billion.
 In the largest transaction to date, Terra Firma, a private equity firm based in London, paid $8.8 billion last year for 138,000 units owned by a subsidiary of E.On, the German utility company.
 Not every German city is cashing in on the gold rush. After Fortress acquired a stake in some apartments in Munich through the Gagfah deal, the city bought out the company. The mayor of Munich, Christian Ude, said he did not want to sell public housing to foreign investors.
 In Dresden, Mayor Rossberg said the opposition to the Fortress deal was more sound than fury. While 45,000 people signed the petition, out of a population close to 500,000, there are 70,000 residents in the city-owned apartments alone. That suggests, he said, relatively thin opposition.
 By wiping out its debt, the mayor said, Dresden would save nearly $100 million a year in interest payments, freeing money for schools, cultural programs and urban development.
 Mr. Kluge, the tenant who intensely opposed the sale, said he hoped he could stay in his place, a small, tidy apartment with a burbling fish tank in the living room. He has lived there since 1998, supporting himself and his family with unemployment checks and other payments.
 ''People are just resigned to these things happening,'' he said.

HEADLINE: As Energy Prices Rise, It's All Downhill for Democracy

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
In case you haven't noticed, all the oil-rich bad guys seem to be having a fine and dandy time these days.
 Iran, awash in oil money, thumbs its nose at U.N. demands for it to desist in its nuclear adventures and daily threatens to wipe Israel off the map. President Vladimir Putin of Russia, awash in oil money, jails his opponents at home and cozies up to America's opponents, like Iran and Hamas, abroad. Sudan, awash in oil money, ignores the world's pleas to halt its genocide in Darfur. Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, awash in oil money, regularly tells America and his domestic opponents to take a hike.
 And Nigeria, Uzbekistan, Angola, Saudi Arabia, Chad and Syria, all flush with oil or gas, are comfortably retreating from even baby steps of democratization. 
 There is a pattern here. Many people assumed that with the fall of the Berlin Wall, we were going to see an unstoppable wave of free elections and free markets slowly spread across the globe. For a decade that wave seemed, indeed, to be real and powerful.
 But as the world has moved from an oil price range of $20 to $40 per barrel to a range of $40 to $70 a barrel, a very negative counterwave has arisen. 
 What I would call ''petro-ist'' states -- highly dependent on oil or gas for their G.D.P. and having either weak institutions or outright authoritarian systems -- have started asserting themselves. And they are weakening, for now at least, the global democratization trend.
 Economists have long taught us about the negative effects that an overabundance of natural resources can have on political and economic reform in any country: the ''resource curse.'' But when it comes to oil, it seems that you can take this resource curse argument a step further: there appears to be a specific correlation between the price of oil and the pace of freedom.
 I call it the ''First Law of Petropolitics,'' and it posits the following: The price of oil and the pace of freedom always move in opposite directions in petro-ist states. 
 According to the First Law of Petropolitics, the higher the price of global crude oil, the more erosion we see in petro-ist nations in the right to free speech, a free press, free elections, freedom of assembly, government transparency, an independent judiciary and the rule of law, and in the freedom to form independent political parties and nongovernmental organizations. Such erosion does not occur in healthy democracies with oil. 
 Conversely, according to the First Law of Petropolitics, the lower the price of oil, the more the petro-ist countries are forced to move toward a politics that is more transparent, more sensitive to opposition voices, more open to a broad set of interactions with the outside world and more focused on building the legal and educational structures that will maximize the ability of their citizens, both men and women, to compete, start new companies and attract investments from abroad. (For an elaboration of this argument, see the current issue of Foreign Policy magazine, www.foreignpolicy.com.) 
 Yes, many factors are involved in shaping the politics of a country. But is it an accident that when oil was $20 to $40 a barrel, Iran was calling for a ''dialogue of civilizations,'' and when it hit $70 a barrel, Iran was calling for the destruction of Israel? 
 When a barrel was $20 to $40, we had ''Putin I.'' That's when President Bush looked Mr. Putin in the eye in 2001 and said he'd found ''a sense of his soul.'' If Mr. Bush tried to get a sense of Mr. Putin's soul today -- the soul of ''Putin II,'' the Putin of $70-a-barrel oil -- he would see down there the huge Russian energy company Gazprom. Mr. Putin's regime has swallowed Gazprom, along with a variety of once-independent Russian media outlets and institutions. 
 While these increasingly bold petro-authoritarians don't represent the sort of strategic or ideological threat that communism once posed to the West, their impact on global politics is still quite corrosive. Some of the worst regimes now have more oil money than ever to do bad things for a long time -- and many decent, democratic countries have to kowtow to them to get oil and gas. 
 Given the inverse relationship between the price of oil and the pace of freedom in petro-ist states, any U.S. strategy for promoting democracy in these countries is doomed to fail unless it includes a credible plan for finding alternatives to oil and bringing down the global price of crude. 
 The price of oil should now be a daily preoccupation of the secretary of state, not just the secretary of energy. Today, you cannot be an effective democracy-promoting idealist without also being an effective energy-conscious environmentalist.

HEADLINE: Our Sick Society

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Is being an American bad for your health? That's the apparent implication of a study just published in The Journal of the American Medical Association.
 It's not news that something is very wrong with the state of America's health. International comparisons show that the United States has achieved a sort of inverse miracle: we spend much more per person on health care than any other nation, yet we have lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality than Canada, Japan and most of Europe.
But it isn't clear exactly what causes this stunningly poor performance. How much of America's poor health is the result of our failure, unique among wealthy nations, to guarantee health insurance to all? How much is the result of racial and class divisions? How much is the result of other aspects of the American way of life? 
 The new study, ''Disease and Disadvantage in the United States and in England,'' doesn't resolve all of these questions. Yet it offers strong evidence that there's something about American society that makes us sicker than we should be. 
 The authors of the study compared the prevalence of such diseases as diabetes and hypertension in Americans 55 to 64 years old with the prevalence of the same diseases in a comparable group in England. Comparing us with the English isn't a choice designed to highlight American problems: Britain spends only about 40 percent as much per person on health care as the United States, and its health care system is generally considered inferior to those of neighboring countries, especially France. Moreover, England isn't noted either for healthy eating or for a healthy lifestyle.
 Nonetheless, the study concludes that ''Americans are much sicker than the English.'' For example, middle-age Americans are twice as likely to suffer from diabetes as their English counterparts. That's a striking finding in itself.
 What's even more striking is that being American seems to damage your health regardless of your race and social class.
 That's not to say that class is irrelevant. (The researchers excluded racial effects by restricting the study to non-Hispanic whites.) In fact, there's a strong correlation within each country between wealth and health. But Americans are so much sicker that the richest third of Americans is in worse health than the poorest third of the English. 
 So what's going on? Lack of health insurance is surely a factor in the poor health of lower-income Americans, who are often uninsured, while everyone in England receives health care from the government. But almost all upper-income Americans have insurance.
 What about bad habits, which the study calls ''behavioral risk factors''? The stereotypes are true: the English are much more likely to be heavy drinkers, and Americans much more likely to be obese. But a statistical analysis suggests that bad habits are only a fraction of the story. 
 In the end, the study's authors seem baffled by the poor health of even relatively well-off Americans. But let me suggest a couple of possible explanations.
 One is that having health insurance doesn't ensure good health care. For example, a New York Times report on diabetes pointed out that insurance companies are generally unwilling to pay for care that might head off the disease, even though they are willing to pay for the extreme measures, like amputations, that become necessary when prevention fails. It's possible that Britain's National Health Service, in spite of its limited budget, actually provides better all-around medical care than our system because it takes a broader, longer-term view than private insurance companies.
 The other possibility is that Americans work too hard and experience too much stress. Full-time American workers work, on average, about 46 weeks per year; full-time British, French and German workers work only 41 weeks a year. I've pointed out in the past that our workaholic economy is actually more destructive of the ''family values'' we claim to honor than the European economies in which regulations and union power have led to shorter working hours.
 Maybe overwork, together with the stress of living in an economy with a minimal social safety net, damages our health as well as our families. These are just suggestions. What we know for sure is that although the American way of life may be, as Ari Fleischer famously proclaimed back in 2001, ''a blessed one,'' there's something about that way of life that is seriously bad for our health.

HEADLINE: Conflicting Loyalties as Republicans Confront High Gas Prices 

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4 

 BODY:
Under pressure to deal with high gasoline prices, President Bush and Republican leaders in Congress are struggling to marry a newfound zeal for energy conservation with their traditional loyalty to big cars and Big Oil.
 In one sign of the awkward straddle, the Bush administration proposed on Wednesday to overhaul fuel-economy requirements for cars while also saying that it opposed ''perverse incentives for manufacturers to produce smaller and more dangerous vehicles.''
 In another sign, House Republicans moved to slap oil companies with one hand while trying to help them with the other.
 Voting 389 to 34, the House approved steep new penalties for oil companies convicted of ''price gouging,'' a crowd-pleasing but largely symbolic measure. Republicans then tried but failed to rush through a bill long sought by the oil industry that would speed regulatory approval for new refineries. 
 The uneasy balancing act is proving difficult. Conservatives worry that Republicans are interfering too much in the marketplace and embarking on a misguided effort to subsidize favored industries.
 ''Republicans are capitulating to pressures to do something, even if they would be doing things that make no sense,'' said Kevin A. Hassett, a senior economist at the American Enterprise Institute. ''The proper course is to let the remedy for high prices be high prices. If it turns out that biofuels are more economical, then you don't need government subsidies.''
 But that view has not stopped Republican lawmakers and the Bush administration from circulating proposals for more tax breaks for hybrid cars, more subsidies for renewable fuels and more government-financed research for areas like battery technology.
 Even so, supporters of conservation and alternative fuels, including some within the Republican Party, are unsatisfied.
 ''It isn't enough,'' said Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert, Republican of New York, a champion of higher fuel-efficiency requirements.
 Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers are also renewing their wish list for the oil industry -- opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for exploration and drilling, as well as millions of additional acres in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic Coast. They are also blocking calls for a windfall profits tax on the major oil companies.
 The political pressures created by soaring gasoline prices have pulled Republicans in Congress and the administration in different directions. While blocking higher taxes on the oil industry, for example, the While House and Senate Republicans are likely to try to eliminate or at least cut back on $2 billion in tax incentives for oil and gas drilling that Congress passed less than a year ago. 
 But the greatest challenge lies in formulating a consistent policy that would help reduce the demand for imported oil. 
 Almost all Republicans, along with many Democrats, are adamantly opposed to higher taxes on gasoline, seeing it as a political loser despite support from economists who argue that painful as it might be in the short run, a stiffer gas tax would be the most effective way to encourage Americans to drive more fuel-efficient cars. 
 At the same time, unlike Democrats, Republican lawmakers have repeatedly defeated proposals for higher fuel-economy requirements on passenger cars. Indeed, in the 2004 presidential election, they ridiculed such proposals as job-losing Democratic ideas.
 Now, with gasoline prices above $3 a gallon, Mr. Bush is asking for new authority to modify the current requirements, an average of 27.5 miles to the gallon, but only in a way that the White House says would not hurt domestic companies whose greatest strength has been in big cars and sport utility vehicles.
 Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta told members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday that Congress should not impose an ''arbitrary'' standard on its own. Rather, Mr. Mineta said, it should let the administration develop ''size based'' rules that would impose different requirements for big cars and small cars.
 ''A size-based system eliminates the perverse incentives for manufacturers to produce smaller and more dangerous vehicles, instead of introducing fuel-saving technologies,'' Mr. Mineta said. 
 That was good news to the Big Three automakers in Detroit whose businesses are heavily dependent on sales of big S.U.V.'s and light trucks.
 Mr. Mineta refused to say how strict the new mileage requirements might be or even if they would be higher than the current standards. He also predicted that the administration would not be able to devise new rules for two years, and that the rules would apply only to cars produced in 2009 and later.
 This week, 10 states, including New York, sued the administration over a set of new fuel-economy rules for light trucks and sport utility vehicles. The states contend that the rules are too weak and disregard the full environmental benefits of stricter standards.
 ''If the light truck standard is any indication, it's hard to believe the administration is serious about upgrading,'' said William R. Prindle, deputy director of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a policy research and advocacy group in Washington. 
 Mr. Boehlert, a liberal Republican who is chairman of the House science committee, expressed similar skepticism.
 ''If we just give the administration authority, we know what will happen,'' Mr. Boehlert told members of the Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday. ''We would produce a long rule-making and probably tepid results.''
 Yet almost any Republican discussion about higher fuel-economy requirements represents a big change in tone if not substance.
 In five years, House Republicans have defeated three bills to raise the average fuel efficiency of cars to 33 miles a gallon, from 27.5.
 During the 2004 presidential campaign, the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, warned that Sen. John F. Kerry's support for tougher rules would cost Michigan 100,000 jobs in the automobile industry. 
 Vice President Dick Cheney said, ''You can rely on President Bush to fight to keep auto jobs where they belong -- right here in America.''
 The automobile industry, though it counts many Democrats as powerful supporters, has contributed three times as much to Republican candidates as to Democrats. Oil and gas producers have even closer ties to Republicans in general and Mr. Bush in particular. 
 The industry's political action committees have given $1 million to Republican candidates and groups in the last 18 months, eight times what they gave to Democrats, according to PoliticalMoneyLine, which monitors political donations. 
 ''Their desire to do corporate America's bidding has run squarely up against public outrage over Big Oil ripping off America,'' said David J. Sirota, a Democratic strategist and the author of ''Hostile Takeover,'' a new book on corporate influence here. ''In reaction, they have made a U-turn.'' 
 To be sure, Mr. Bush and Republican leaders have stepped up support for alternative fuels. Last August, Mr. Bush signed a sweeping energy law that offered big new subsidies for ethanol and more than $2 billion in tax breaks for hybrid cars, renewable fuels and energy conservation.
 ''We have an opportunity to re-invent the car,'' said Representative Bob Inglis, Republican of South Carolina, who has voted for higher fuel-economy standards and is pushing for more government support for hydrogen-powered cars.
 ''We Republicans have a conservationist heritage,'' he added, ''and we really should rediscover it and display it.''

HEADLINE: Strong Rebuke For the Kremlin From Cheney 

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 4 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney on Thursday delivered the Bush administration's strongest rebuke of Russia to date. He said the Russian government ''unfairly and improperly restricted'' people's rights and suggested that it sought to undermine its neighbors and to use the country's vast resources of oil and gas as ''tools of intimidation or blackmail.''
 ''In many areas of civil society -- from religion and the news media, to advocacy groups and political parties -- the government has unfairly and improperly restricted the rights of her people,'' Mr. Cheney said in a speech to European leaders in Lithuania's capital, Vilnius. ''Other actions by the Russian government have been counterproductive, and could begin to affect relations with other countries.''
Mr. Cheney's remarks, which officials in Washington said had been heavily vetted and therefore reflected the administration's current thinking on Russia, appeared to lay down new markers for a relationship that has become strained and could become significantly more so in the months ahead. 
 The remarks, in a transcript released by the White House, came in the midst of an international confrontation over Iran's nuclear programs, where the United States has tried to enlist Russia's help in putting pressure on or punishing Tehran. Mr. Cheney's criticisms would seem to complicate those efforts, but they could also reflect a growing impatience with Russia's unwillingness to back stronger measures, including sanctions, against the Iranians.
 Mr. Cheney did not mention Iran in his speech, which was devoted mostly to a triumphant celebration of the expansion of democracy in Europe since the end of the cold war. A senior administration official said the speech emphasized the desire of the White House to continue working with Russia in many areas, including Iran, even as it voiced its concerns. The official requested anonymity because he did not want to be seen as speaking for Mr. Cheney.
 Asked if the remarks risked alienating the Kremlin at a crucial moment in negotiations on Iran at the United Nations Security Council, the official said in a telephone interview, ''There's never a good time.''
 Mr. Cheney's remarks also previewed what is shaping up as a tense meeting between President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin at a gathering of the Group of 8, the leading industrialized nations, in St. Petersburg in July. Some in Washington, notably Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, have called on Mr. Bush to boycott the meeting as a signal of displeasure with Mr. Putin's anti-democratic course, though Mr. Cheney did not address that matter on Thursday.
 Dmitri S. Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, disputed Mr. Cheney's remarks, calling them unfounded and ''completely incomprehensible.'' At the same time, he discounted Mr. Cheney's message, saying it would cloud neither the coming meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin nor their relationship generally.
 ''The relations between the two presidents are much more constructive than these statements,'' Mr. Peskov said in a telephone interview. ''And they are more oriented to the future.'' Indeed, the two men spoke by telephone just this Monday, and they agreed then on the need to cooperate closely on the Iranian issue, the White House said. 
 Stephen Sestanovich, who served as a senior Russia policy official in the Clinton administration, said the speech was likely to infuriate Mr. Putin and his circle of advisers, adding to the strains between the countries. 
 ''However much you try to sound hopeful notes, the folks around Putin are likely to say this is proof of Washington's hostility and say, 'How dare they tell us to be more democratic?' '' said Mr. Sestanovich, now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, based in Washington.
 While Mr. Cheney has always voiced greater skepticism toward Russia than his boss, Mr. Bush, his remarks underscored a deepening rift that has emerged since Mr. Bush famously said in 2001 that he had looked into President Putin's eyes and ''got a sense of his soul.'' In many areas now, the United States and Russia have rarely seemed more at odds since the cold war ended.
 The Bush administration's relations with Russia have largely followed the arc of Mr. Putin's presidency, from cooperation and personal closeness after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 to growing concerns about Mr. Putin's centralization of political and economic control. The downward slide began with the prosecutorial assault on Yukos, once the country's largest private oil company, and has continued through what many in Washington view as the Kremlin's effort to reassert its authority in former Soviet republics like Ukraine and Georgia.
 In Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, the two countries, if not their leaders, seem to square off on opposite sides more often than they cooperate. In Ukraine, Mr. Putin openly sided against the Western-oriented politician Viktor A. Yushchenko during the public protests of electoral fraud in 2004 that ultimately swept him into the presidency.
 Last December, in what was seen as an effort to discredit Mr. Yushchenko before crucial parliamentary elections, Moscow briefly shut off gas supplies to Ukraine when it balked at Russia's demand that it pay world prices -- about four times what it had been paying. 
 On Thursday Mr. Cheney said: ''No legitimate interest is served when oil and gas become tools of intimidation or blackmail, either by supply manipulation or attempts to monopolize transportation. And no one can justify actions that undermine the territorial integrity of a neighbor, or interfere with democratic movements.''
 The last remark was a clear reference to Georgia and Moldova, both former Soviet republics with unrecognized separatist enclaves abetted by Russia, as well as to Ukraine. Mr. Cheney spoke at an international conference on democracy in the former Soviet republics, held in Vilnius, which drew leaders of nine former Soviet republics or Warsaw Pact satellites along Russia's western border, as well as the United States, the European Union and NATO. Russia was not invited, an omission its Foreign Ministry was quick to point out.
 ''It would be desirable that a country as big and influential as Russia would appear there not as a subject or object of critique, but as an important, positive factor in international politics,'' the deputy foreign minister, Grigory Karasin, said during a news conference.
 Mr. Cheney has routinely taken a leading role in voicing administration policy, most notably in the weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks and regarding the war in Iraq, but usually in domestic venues. His foreign visits have typically involved high-level discussions, and it is unusual for him to deliver a major public address overseas. 
 The bulk of the vice president's speech was a celebration of the democratic progress these countries have made since the Soviet sway over Europe began to collapse in 1989. And Mr. Cheney sounded very much like a triumphant cold warrior. He evoked Ronald Reagan, Pope John Paul II and the dissident leaders of the Soviet bloc who threw off ''the stagnation of imperial dictatorship.''
 Mr. Cheney did not mention Mr. Putin by name. And he said that Russia was not ''fated to be an enemy'' and that it ''can be a strategic partner and a trusted friend.'' But he urged that Russia follow the course embraced by its former subjects in the Soviet bloc. He added that the meeting in St. Petersburg would be an opportunity for Mr. Bush and the other Group of 8 leaders to make that case.
 ''Russia has a choice to make,'' he said.
 Mr. Cheney also reiterated the administration's strong condemnation of Belarus, where President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko was elected to a third term in a vote denounced as a fraud. He said that he had planned to meet Mr. Lukashenko's leading opponent, Aleksandr Milinkevich, in Vilnius, but that Mr. Milinkevich's arrest last week prevented it. He called for his release.
 ''There is no place in a Europe whole and free for a regime of this kind,'' he said, calling Mr. Lukashenko's government ''the last dictatorship in Europe.''
 Russia, by contrast, has praised Mr. Lukashenko's victory, most recently when Mr. Putin met the Belarussian leader last week.
 Mr. Cheney's speech was barely mentioned in Russia's state-owned or controlled media, but nevertheless set off a torrent of criticism here.
 ''The United States has to deal with an absolutely different Russia today -- a Russia that has restored its real sovereignty in many areas,'' Andrei A. Kokoshin, a member of the lower house of Parliament, told the Interfax news agency.
 His remarks reflected an increasingly confident view of Russia's status that is widely held here. It is a view that has required the Bush administration to calibrate its criticism over democratic backsliding with the realization that Russia's growing economic might, largely fueled by oil and gas, make it an indispensable player.
 But Mr. Sestanovich said the speech marked a turning point of sorts, saying it ''definitely reflects a scaling back of expectations of the relationship with Moscow. For the vice president to say Russia can be a strategic partner is already to imply that it isn't.''

THE WAYS OF WASHINGTON -- The rise and fall of the Republican $100 rebate as a way to address a spike in gasoline prices is a window into how Washington sometimes works in a slapdash way, featuring in this case Congressional aides who misread the political climate and lawmakers desperate to keep their jobs. [Page A1.] 


CONFLICTED IN CONGRESS -- Under pressure to deal with gasoline prices, President Bush and Republican leaders in Congress are struggling to marry a newfound zeal for energy conservation with their traditional loyalty to big cars and Big Oil. [C1.]

NEW AOL SERVICE -- In a new twist on services that allow calls between regular phones and PC's, AOL is preparing to offer the 41 million users of its instant messaging system a free phone number that will allow people to call while they are online. [C1.]

DRUG PATENT RULING -- In a closely watched lawsuit, a federal jury in Boston ruled that Eli Lilly & Company infringed a patent covering drugs that work through one of the body's basic biological pathways. Lilly was ordered to pay $65.2 million in back royalties to Ariad Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company. [C1.]

TALKS ON ENERGY -- Four South American leaders met to defuse an energy crisis set off by Bolivia's decision to nationalize its energy reserves. But the leaders of Bolivia, Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina walked away with little more than an agreement to negotiate natural gas prices, and to keep talking. [A3.]

GERMANY DRAWS INVESTORS -- German cities are lining up for a wave of foreign investment in their property. Lured by a German property market that is the most stagnant in any major European country, and a vast supply of well-kept public housing, American and other foreign companies have already snapped up dozens of projects. [C1.]

DON'T BLINK -- Decades ago, General Electric and its advertising agency joined to create a half-hour weekly television series, ''General Electric Theater''; for most of its run, the host was an actor named Ronald Reagan. Today a G.E. campaign made for new media will introduce a series in a shorter format: ''G.E. One Second Theater.'' Stuart Elliott, Advertising. [C8.]

LATE EASTER HELPS RETAILING -- American retailers reported their best monthly sales results in two years, buoyed by a later-than-usual Easter that nudged purchases of items like dresses and hams from March to April. Sales at Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer and one that caters to low-income customers, rose 6.8 percent. [C3.]

TAX CUT SAVINGS -- The tax cut bill that Senate and House leaders have generally agreed upon is expected to save middle-income taxpayers an average of $20 each, according to the Tax Policy Center, a research organization. The top tenth of 1 percent, whose average income is $5.3 million, would save an average of $82,415. [C11.]

CHANGES AT DRUG MAKER -- Johnson & Johnson told employees it was dividing its pharmaceuticals group into three major disease or therapeutic clusters, sending a strong signal that it wants to revitalize the pharmaceutical side of the company. [C3.]

HEADLINE: Stronger Canadian Dollar Not Totally Welcome Up North 

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA, May 4 

 BODY:
The Canadian dollar has risen to levels not seen since the 1970's but that has brought little joy to J. Robert S. Prichard at Torstar, which publishes romance novels and newspapers. 
 At the company's annual meeting this week, Mr. Prichard, Torstar's chief executive, said earnings had been cut in half largely because of the exchange rate, which has hurt results at its export-dependent Harlequin Enterprises novel unit.
After bottoming at 62 cents in 2002, the loonie, the popular name for Canada's $1 coin that features a loon, closed at 90 cents to the United States dollar on Tuesday -- the highest since 1978 -- and has stayed in that range. That may not be the end. 
 Some economists and traders are forecasting parity between the currencies, something that has not happened in 30 years.
 In some ways, the loonie's rise is an endorsement of the track that the Canadian economy has taken. Canada has posted 10 consecutive years of balanced federal budgets, its debt-to-G.D.P. ratio is one of the world's lowest; employment levels are high; and soaring commodity prices, particularly for oil, have brought good times to many of the country's resource-based industries.
 But as the experience of Torstar, which also publishes The Toronto Star, indicates, the service and manufacturing companies that depend on exports priced in American dollars are being hurt by their currency's buoyancy. 
 Benjamin Tal, a senior economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto, estimates that the stronger loonie cost about 120,000 manufacturing jobs last year. This year another 100,000 are likely to be eliminated, he said. Employments gains in retailing and construction industries have more than made up for the losses.
 ''There's nothing wrong with a strong Canadian dollar,'' Mr. Tal said. ''It's the speed of the change that's the problem. This is much too difficult to swallow for a manufacturing sector that has relied on this subsidy for decades.''
 Currency traders' newfound fondness for the Canadian dollar is, of course, also partly a result of a growing dislike for the American dollar and the record United States trade deficit. 
 While the United States economy remains robust, Clement Gignac, the chief economist at National Bank Financial, said that was increasingly being offset by concerns over the country's budget deficit, the impact of high energy prices and the instability surrounding major corporations and industrial sectors like automobiles.
 ''Over the last month or so it seems to have been more of a U.S. dollar story,'' he said.
 Indeed, the American dollar has also fallen to 0.79 euro from 0.82 in the last month.
 But when he looks back over a longer time frame, Mr. Gignac notes that the Canadian dollar has been gaining on the euro and other currencies, a sign that its strength is more than just a reflection of the weakness of the American dollar.
 Last fall, Mr. Gignac surprised some by suggesting that the Canadian and American currencies would reach parity by 2010. He has now moved the date forward to the fall of next year.
 ''The stars aligned much more quickly than I initially thought,'' he said.
 Few others share his view.
 Speaking to a committee of Canada's Senate this week, the Bank of Canada governor, David Dodge, said that the spike in the Canadian dollar was not justified by market forces and he predicted that it would not last.
 ''Markets often tend to overshoot, but in our experience market analysts are prone to much greater overshooting than markets themselves,'' Mr. Dodge said. ''You'll recall that when the Canadian dollar was sitting at 62, 63 cents U.S., the analysts were all saying '50 is next stop'. ''
 Mr. Tal agrees that parity is unlikely but not because the conditions are not at hand for a rise to parity.
 ''It won't go to parity not because the potential isn't there,'' Mr. Tal said, ''but because the Bank of Canada won't let it happen.''
 While Canadian manufacturers have actually increased output, if not maintained employment, during the dollar's rise to date, Mr. Tal said that another 10-cent increase would be too much for them to handle. As a result, he anticipates that the central bank will either back away from its current pattern of raising interest rates or even drop rates if necessary.
 It will nevertheless be a trying time for manufacturers, who export about 60 percent of their product with about half of that going to the United States. And regardless of its final destination, most Canadian exports are priced in American dollars.
 ''It's been like a 50 percent cut in sales for major exporters' sales already,'' said Jayson Myers, the chief economist for Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, a trade group. ''A lot of Canadian companies are now asking, Does it make sense to keep manufacturing here?''


CORRECTION-DATE: May 10, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about the increase in the value of the Canadian dollar misstated the share of its manufactured goods that the country exports to the United States. Canadians export about 60 percent of their product; the part going to the United States is 80 percent of that, not 50 percent.

HEADLINE: Productivity And Wages Showed Gains In Quarter

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
American workers were more productive in the first three months of this year than in the preceding quarter, the Labor Department reported yesterday, and they were paid more as well.
 Bucking a recent trend, the report showed that workers' hourly compensation increased at an annual pace of 5.7 percent in the first quarter; adjusted for inflation, compensation rose 3.6 percent. In the last three months of 2005, compensation fell 0.3 percent after inflation.
Productivity, a ratio of output to hours worked, increased 3.2 percent as output surged 5.8 percent and hours worked rose 2.5 percent. 
 Some of the increase in productivity appears to reflect a recovery from the fourth quarter, when the number fell 0.3 percent because of declines related to the hurricanes that swept through the Gulf of Mexico.
 Still, more than four years into the current expansion, economists said that businesses continued to find ways to improve their efficiency. Productivity growth, which eased from 4.1 percent in 2002 to 2.7 percent in 2005, typically slows as experienced workers become harder to find, wages rise and corporate cost-cutting ends.
 The increase in compensation indicates that recent job growth is starting to tilt the balance of power from businesses to workers. Unit labor costs, a ratio of hourly compensation to output, rose 2.5 percent in the first quarter.
 ''There has been a definite tightening in the labor market, so there is greater competition for labor,'' said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics, a research firm based outside Cleveland. 
 The increase in labor costs could stoke growing concerns about inflation. Federal Reserve officials have said that they will raise short-term interest rates if they believe that inflation will flare because of rising wages and energy prices.
 Higher compensation does not have to set off inflation, especially if workers are more productive, Mr. Mayland said. But if labor costs rise at the same time that productivity and economic growth slow, as most economists believe will happen in the coming months, they can drive up inflation.
 ''There is a tendency, as expansions mature, for productivity growth to slow,'' he said.
 But it is not completely clear if most workers are making more. The labor cost statistics in yesterday's report conflict with those in other recent reports that show far more modest increases in wages and employment costs.
 Last week, the Labor Department said its employment cost index increased 2.8 percent in the first quarter from the year-earlier period. And hourly earnings increased 3.4 percent in March from a year ago. 
 Some of the discrepancies may reflect differences in the design of various government statistics. For instance, the employment cost index does not include the cost of exercising stock options. And economists said the sharp rise in labor costs seen in yesterday's report might also be skewed by big annual bonus payments to white-collar and management workers. The Labor Department's hourly earnings data, by contrast, is based on production and nonsupervisory workers' wages.
 ''Labor is gradually getting an increasing share of gains from output,'' said David Kelly, an economist at Putnam Investments, the mutual fund company based in Boston. But ''one thing that has been true for most of this expansion is that wages have been running below inflation,'' he said.
 Separately, the Labor Department reported that state unemployment insurance claims increased last week by 5,000, to 322,000.
 There were 2.5 million claims outstanding as of April 22, about 5.5 percent less than a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Going Online for Savings

BYLINE: By JENNIFER A. KINGSON

 BODY:
The offers sound almost too good to be true: ''Earn more than 5x the national average,'' screams the envelope from ING Direct, advertising the Orange savings account; ''The best rate, no fees, no risk,'' shouts a similar offer from HSBCdirect.com.
 High-yield savings accounts, offered exclusively through the Internet and paying rates at or above 4 percent, are the flavor-of-the-month product in the banking industry. Clearly they are a bonanza for consumers, who have been eagerly funneling spare cash into them. 
A different issue, however, is whether the dozens of banks that have recently begun offering these products can actually profit from them. The interest they are paying, up to 4.69 percent, is so much higher than the average yield on an ordinary savings account, 0.54 percent, that they must keep customer acquisition and service costs at a bare minimum to come out ahead.
 Banks have trod a similar path before. In the late 1990's, they introduced stand-alone Internet banks that paid high rates on checking accounts; the premise, then and now, was that the higher rates were affordable because the Internet took various costs out of the equation. 
 Those efforts crashed and burned, in part because people had not yet fully embraced Internet banking. Some analysts also fault the banks for leading with the primary checking account, which people are reluctant to switch; by contrast, people have no problem opening a new savings account that pays a high rate. 
 ING Direct led the newest initiatives in the United States in 2000, when it introduced the Orange account, and until recently it had little competition. In 2005, Emigrant Savings Bank of New York and the United States unit of HSBC dived in, as did various smaller banks around the country, all of them viewing the product as a low-cost way to bulk up by collecting deposits nationally. 
 In March, Citibank, a unit of Citigroup, introduced a high-yield savings account -- one of the few with a checking component -- along with a vow to offer one of the highest rates in the land. Citibank Direct's e-Savings account pays an annual yield of 4.5 percent and does not require a minimum balance. ''We are going to maintain the rate'' at a very high level, said Catherine D. Palmieri, managing director for Citibank.com. ''When the Fed increases rates, we will go up as well.''
 The Federal Reserve's interest rate increases are indeed a major reason for the spate of high-yield accounts. Rising rates are bad news for people with adjustable-rate mortgages, but great news for people with cash to invest in liquid, federally insured accounts. Banks have adjusted their strategies accordingly, winding down in home loans and revving up in basic accounts.
 ''Cash investments are back on the investor's radar screen,'' said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com, which keeps a running comparison of rates paid on financial accounts. ''This is an effort to attract deposits in a more cost-effective way than just by building more branches.'' 
 Amassing deposits is an inherently good thing for banks to do. Although deposits are liabilities, since they can be withdrawn at any time, banks use them to make loans, which are considered assets because the interest on them produces revenue. Banks also earn money by investing depositors' cash in financial instruments.
 It is the selection of those financial instruments -- and the performance of them -- that can determine whether a bank profits from high-yield savings accounts, bankers and industry analysts say. 
 For instance, they say, institutions that invest in fixed-rate assets like mortgage-backed securities could wind up in trouble if the Federal Reserve continues to bump up interest rates, while institutions that invest in floating-rate assets, which are more flexible, will be better able to swing with the punches.
 And that is just one reason that high-yield accounts can be a risky or questionable product for some banks, industry analysts say. Another is that customers might come to expect higher rates all around.
 ''Obtaining a material amount of deposits requires being near the top of the list of rates offered at any given time,'' said James M. McCormick, president of the First Manhattan Group, a banking consultancy.
 These accounts appeal to banks for many reasons. They are a powerful deposit-grabbing tool, spread a bank's brand name to places it has no branches, and help sell more products and services. 
 ''Potentially, this allows us to grow into a national direct financial services provider,'' said Kevin Newman, head of personal financial services at HSBC Bank USA.
 HSBC Direct, which was introduced in late 2005, is on track to amass 250,000 customers by the end of 2006, Mr. Newman said, adding, ''the money we are drawing is coming from other financial institutions.'' 
 Unlike credit card users, who freely hop from one product to the next to get a better rate, savings account holders tend to be more loyal, Mr. Newman said. Thus, he said, HSBC Direct does not feel compelled to offer the very highest yield. HSBC Direct did top the list until recently with a 4.8 percent yield, but that was a special offer that expired April 30; the rate then went down to 4.5 percent (which, perhaps not coincidentally, is the same as Citibank's).
 Other banks are crowding into the field. Among the bigger players, Washington Mutual introduced a pilot in November, and Wachovia is ''strategically evaluating a number of high-yield offerings online in a way that makes sense for our brand and our business model,'' a spokesman, Doug Caldwell, wrote in an e-mail message.
 Ms. Palmieri said that Citibank had forecast that the market for online savings accounts would be $250 billion this year and $600 billion by 2010. And some banking analysts say that more banks will join in, if only for defensive reasons.
 Howard P. Milstein, chief executive of Emigrant, likes to note that his bank had $4.5 billion in deposits the day it introduced Emigrant Direct in January 2005. ''In our first year of Internet banking, we raised approximately $6 billion,'' he said. ''That's the power of the Internet.''

HEADLINE: An April Easter Helps Retailers Post Best Sales Gain in 2 Years

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Sky-high gas prices met their match in April: the Easter holiday. And Easter won.
 American retailers reported their best monthly sales results in two years yesterday, buoyed by a later-than-usual Easter that nudged purchases of items like dresses and hams from March to April.
Results for stores open at least a year rose an unusually high 6.7 percent compared with the period a year ago, according to Goldman Sachs. 
 Several retailers, including Target (up 10.4 percent), Kohl's (up 13.4 percent) and American Eagle Outfitters (up 19 percent), posted sales gains nearly twice their monthly average for the year. 
 The International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group, heralded the arrival of an ''energized Easter bunny'' in April, as consumer spending hit its highest level since March 2004, when sales rose 7 percent. 
 But retail analysts cautioned that April's buyers might not deliver with the same vigor in May. Michael P. Niemira, chief economist at the trade group, credited at least 1.5 percentage points of April's sales increase to Easter holiday spending and he foresaw a far less rosy picture for May. 
 ''The sharp rise in energy prices in recent weeks is likely to catch up'' with consumers, he wrote in a research report that predicted retail sales would rise 3 percent to 3.5 percent in May. 
 Retailers have battled rising energy prices all year but had hoped for relief this spring in the form of warmer weather and, with it, lower home heating bills. Instead, higher heating bills have been replaced by higher prices for gasoline.
 Ken Perkins, research analyst at Retail Metrics, expects May's sales increase ''to be more moderate.''
 Just how late was Easter this year? Twenty-one days, to be exact. It fell on April 16 this year, compared with March 27 in 2005. The resulting April sales bump stretched across the industry, from discounters to department stores 
 Sales at Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer and one that caters to low-income customers, rose 6.8 percent -- with the greatest gains at its namesake stores, where sales rose 7.3 percent. Sales rose 3.8 percent at its Sam's Club unit. 
 With 130 million Americans shopping at it stores every week, Wal-Mart is viewed as a strong barometer of consumer sentiment, and its robust performance indicated that shoppers splurged in April.
 Thomas M. Schoewe, the chief financial officer at Wal-Mart, said ''rising fuel costs were overshadowed by the customers' response to merchandise'' like toys and candy, two Easter staples. 
 Target, citing brisk sales of toys and children's apparel, said sales increased 10.4 percent, once again besting its rival, Wal-Mart. Robert J. Ulrich, chief executive of Target, said the results ''reflected the effect of this year's later Easter.''
 Kohl's, whose monthly sales have grown, on average, 6.8 percent in 2006, posted a 13.4 percent gain in April.
 Talbot's, with average gains of 0.5 percent this year, said sales grew 10.8 percent last month.
 And Dillard's, which averaged increases of 2.7 percent this year, reported a 10 percent jump.
 Strong Easter sales are not unusual. In fact, some retailers suggest that March and April sales results be averaged to reflect underlying consumer demand rather than the impact of holiday spending. 
 For several long-suffering retailers, however, April did not provide much of a lift. 
 At Gap, the nation's largest specialty clothing retailer, sales fell 3 percent, better than usual, but hardly a stellar performance. In addition, executives warned that efforts to clear leftover spring merchandise with heavy markdowns in May could erode profit margins. 
 Saks, the luxury retailer, said sales rose 2.2 percent, well below those of its rival Neiman Marcus, which had a 9.5 percent increase for the month.
 Sales dropped 0.8 percent at Federated Department Stores, owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, beating a company prediction that sales would fall at least 2.5 percent. The retailer said the sluggish performance, in part, reflected the shift of an annual promotional event at Macy's from April to May.
 The teenage clothing sector, a hit- or-miss market that swings up and down every month depending on which tank top or pair of distressed denim pants is hot, swung up in April. Sales rose 17 percent at Abercrombie & Fitch, slightly below the performance of American Eagle. 
 Richard E. Jaffe, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said American Eagle forecast all the right spring trends for April, favoring a cleaned-up version of last year's ragged torn denim pants, for example, and T-shirts emblazoned with large graphics. ''Eagle,'' he said, ''is getting it right.''

HEADLINE: Shares Gain as Oil Prices Decline Further 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose and the Dow Jones industrial average set a six-year high yesterday after oil prices dropped, retailers posted the biggest monthly sales increase since 2004 and corporate earnings generally beat Wall Street expectations. 
 Tyco International, Starbucks and Whole Foods Market all gained after reporting profits that exceeded Wall Street projections.
The Dow average gained 38.58 points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,438.86, the highest since January 2000. The S.& P. 500-stock index added 4.40 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,312.25. The Nasdaq composite index rallied 19.93 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,323.90.
 Two stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.72 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board.
 Better-than-expected quarterly earnings results have spurred a rally this year. Still, record oil prices and signs of buoyant economic growth have reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve may raise borrowing costs to restrain inflation, limiting gains in equities. 
 Retailers advanced on the drop in oil prices and a report that showed April sales climbed as warm weather and the Easter holiday spurred demand for spring clothing. The International Council of Shopping Centers said April sales rose 6.6 percent, the most since March 2004.
 Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, lost 29 cents, to $46.40. Wal-Mart said sales this month would probably climb 2 percent to 4 percent at its stores open for at least a year.
 Tyco gained 98 cents, to $27.92. Second-quarter profit excluding some items was 45 cents a share. Among other industrial issues, General Electric added 40 cents, to $34.80.
 Starbucks, the world's largest coffee shop chain, rose $1.44, to $38.79. The company raised its profit forecast for the fiscal year to as much as 72 cents, from an earlier estimate of up to 70 cents.
 Whole Foods jumped $8.27, or 13 percent, to $70.42 for the best performance in the S.& P. 500. Profit climbed to 36 cents a share on new store openings.
 Electronic Arts, the video game maker, fell $5.95, or 11 percent, to $48.55 for the steepest loss in the S.& P. 500. For the fiscal year ending in March 2007, the company forecast a loss of 15 cents a share to a profit of 15 cents.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note yielded 5.15 percent, up from 5.14 percent Wednesday. The price fell 2/32, to 95 1/32.

Crude Oil Price Falls Below $70
By The Associated Press
 Oil prices sank more than $2 a barrel for a second day yesterday, falling below $70, as traders focused on government data that showed gasoline supplies grew last week.
 Light sweet crude for June delivery settled at $69.94, a decline of $2.34 in New York trading. Prices had plunged $2.33 Wednesday after the Energy Department released its weekly report showing a supply rise as refineries increased output.
 Many analysts say they believe the data point to a consumer response to pump prices that exceed $3 a gallon in many parts of the country.

HEADLINE: Lawyer Confronts Informer In Subway Bomb Plot Case

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
A defense lawyer for the Pakistani immigrant who is accused of plotting to bomb the Herald Square subway station played more than a dozen snippets of secretly recorded conversations yesterday that he contended showed that a paid police informer cajoled his client into the conspiracy.
 Martin R. Stolar, one of the lawyers for the accused man, Shahawar Matin Siraj, 23, used the recordings to cross-examine the 50-year-old informer, suggesting to the jury that he insinuated himself into Mr. Siraj's life as a father figure and was the driving force behind the plot. 
The informer, Osama Eldawoody, an Egyptian-born nuclear engineer who at the time was living on Staten Island, worked with a Police Department Intelligence Division detective in 2003 and 2004, collecting information at mosques in Brooklyn and Staten Island, and eventually focused on Mr. Siraj.
 During the summer of 2004, on more than two dozen occasions, he secretly recorded Mr. Siraj, who then worked at an Islamic bookstore in Brooklyn. The recordings captured a number of conversations in which Mr. Siraj talked about detailed plans to bomb the subway station at West 34th Street -- and several others -- along with other plots to blow up bridges and police precinct station houses on Staten Island.
 Mr. Stolar conceded in his opening argument that Mr. Siraj -- whom he has sought to portray as a foolish dupe -- took part in the conspiracy. But he contended that he was entrapped by Mr. Eldawoody, a man who failed in a number of different jobs and who, he said, became an informer for the money, eventually earning roughly $100,000 over his two years and nine months working with the police.
 Prosecutors played several portions of the tapes last week, focusing on conversations in which Mr. Siraj talked about the plot and his desire to bring down the mall above the subway station and other targets. But he said a number of times that he wanted to avoid killing people and sought only to cause economic damage.
 The conversations that Mr. Stolar highlighted yesterday, his fourth day cross-examining Mr. Eldawoody, included recordings in which Mr. Siraj called the informer ''big brother,'' Mr. Eldawoody called Mr. Siraj his son, and several in which, Mr. Stolar contended, the informer acted as a mentor or teacher and encouraged Mr. Siraj in the plot.
 Mr. Stolar also played several recordings in which Mr. Siraj expressed concern about Mr. Eldawoody's health -- he had been suffering from cirrhosis of the liver and hepatitis C, along with other ailments. In one tape, made on July 28, 2004, Mr. Siraj told his older friend that only death ''can make us separate.''
 ''Doesn't that indicate that there is some kind of special relationship?'' Mr. Stolar asked.
 ''This is normal conversation in my culture -- we say this all the time,'' Mr. Eldawoody replied, using an explanation he returned to several times during Mr. Stolar's questioning to explain statements he made to Mr. Siraj.
 Mr. Stolar's questions seemed to wear down the witness, a fidgety black-haired man who has been on the stand for eight days. Several times, after listening to a question, he turned toward the jury to answer, sometimes gesturing with a ballpoint pen in his right hand.
 Mr. Stolar also played for the jury tapes on which Mr. Eldawoody gave brief tutorials to Mr. Siraj, who came to America from Karachi with his family in 1999. According the informer's testimony, Mr. Siraj had asked Mr. Eldawoody if he had the knowledge to build a nuclear bomb or to obtain materials for a dirty bomb.
 On one tape, recorded on June 28, Mr. Siraj asked if there was a difference between atom and nuclear bombs, and the engineer tried to explain a nuclear chain reaction. Mr. Eldawoody also talked about how to destroy a nuclear power plant.
 ''Then you go on to teach him how to destroy a nuclear power plant, don't you?'' Mr. Stolar asks.
 ''It is clear I was answering him,'' Mr. Eldawoody said.
 About Mr. Siraj's questions, Mr. Stolar asked, ''It never occurred to you that maybe he wasn't thinking properly, that maybe it was a bit grandiose and infantile?''
 Mr. Eldawoody responded by saying, ''I'm here witnessing, not talking about thinking.''
 At one point, Mr. Eldawoody acknowledged that he ''cursed America'' to play a role, but said he was not seeking to incite Mr. Siraj, and that everyone in the mosques he visited hated America, though no one talked about taking violent action.
 Mr. Stolar played one tape that the government did not. On it, Mr. Eldawoody talked to Mr. Siraj's co-defendant, James Elshafay, who has pleaded guilty.
 In response to a question, from Mr. Elshafay, he said that he did not think Osama bin Laden was responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks and suggested that the United States itself was. He also said, ''if you knock down the entire World Trade Center a hundred times without killing people, I, I personally would definitely agree with them.''

HEADLINE: Asian Finance Ministers Seek Common Currency 

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

DATELINE: HYDERABAD, India, May 4 

 BODY:
Finance ministers from China, Japan and South Korea announced tentative steps on Thursday to coordinate their currencies in ways that could ultimately produce a common regional currency like the euro.
 The ministers, speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank here, said that they would work toward closer coordination of their foreign-exchange policies.
They also pledged to enhance an existing framework to defend regional currencies against speculators and work toward the development of Asian bond markets. 
 South Korea, Japan and China will ''immediately launch discussions on the road map for the system to coordinate foreign exchange policy,'' the ministers said in a joint statement. ''We agreed on further study of related issues, including the usefulness of regional currency units.''
 Although an Asian monetary union is a distant goal, the Asian Development Bank has been pushing the idea of an Asian currency unit, or A.C.U., over the past year. The unit's value would be set by an index of participating currencies.
 The idea has gained popularity among several Asian finance ministers as a step toward harmonizing regional monetary policies.
 The development bank's Japanese president, Haruhiko Kuroda, a supporter of an Asian monetary union, had pledged to propose the creation of an A.C.U. at the meeting in Hyderabad, but reportedly held back in light of opposition from Washington.
 ''From the Americans there was an outcry, seeing it as a danger to the dollar,'' Volker Ducklau, the Asian Development Bank's executive director for Germany and Britain, told Emerging Markets, a newsletter published during bank meetings.
 The United States and Japan are the two largest shareholders in the bank, each with a 12.85 percent stake.
 Senior Treasury officials denied that the United States had expressed concern about Asian currency linkage.
 ''We don't oppose it,''' said Timothy D. Adams, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs. ''I have no concerns about this issue.''
 The Asian currency unit initiative is now backed by the so-called Asean Plus 3 grouping, which comprises the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, Japan and South Korea. The Hyderabad statement was issued after a meeting of Asean Plus 3 finance ministers.
 Though billed as a small step, the idea of an Asian currency unit mirrors early moves made toward the euro. First, European countries devised a valueless measurement unit reflecting relative currency fluctuations. They then began aligning exchange rates and altering monetary policy to keep those rates in line, a process that took decades. The euro finally emerged as a currency in January 2002.
 The announcement on Thursday came as the United States appeared increasingly isolated from Asian and European nations on a related issue: whether, and how quickly, China should let its currency appreciate. Washington accuses Beijing of keeping the yuan artificially undervalued to subsidize its exports while deterring imports.
 ''Let markets work,'' Mr. Adams, the Treasury official, said during a meeting on trade imbalances here, arguing that Beijing should allow the yuan to float freely as soon as possible.
 But senior finance officials from Japan and Germany appeared to echo the Chinese view that structural reform, rather than quick-fix currency changes, offered the only real answer to global trade imbalances. They saw high savings rates and inefficient use of capital in Japan and China, ballooning fiscal deficits in the United States and languishing European demand as more significant problems than the value of the Chinese currency.
 Currency disputes ''might distract our attention from fundamental structural problems,'' said Japan's finance minister, Sadakazu Tanigaki.

HEADLINE: New View of Antitrust Law: See No Evil, Hear No Evil 

BYLINE: By Stephen Labaton

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to many kinds of antitrust enforcement, Bush administration officials call to mind Abba Eban's observation about the Palestinians: They don't miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.
 The administration, following its Democratic and Republican predecessors, continues its unsurprising policy of aggressively combating cartels and price-fixing. (Who, after all, would be in favor of cartels and price fixers?)
 But in other areas of antitrust law, the administration has taken the most relaxed and least aggressive approach since the last years of the Reagan presidency. 
A few weeks ago, the Justice Department cleared Whirlpool's $1.7 billion acquisition of Maytag even though the new entity would have a dominating share of the marketplace, controlling about three-quarters of the market for some home appliances. 
 The department justified its decision by a combination of evidence and law. That included confidential commercial information that the department says it cannot make public; a very broad definition of the marketplace to include foreign companies, some of which have yet to make a bigger push in the United States; and an expansive reading of the economic efficiency defense for permitting such deals. 
 The decision demoralized the career ranks of the antitrust division at the Justice Department, officials there have said. And it left private antitrust practitioners in Washington wondering whether, in light of the decision and the flurry of corporate dealers, there are could really be any mergers that this administration would challenge.
 In the coming months, everyone expects that the government will approve AT&T's proposal to buy BellSouth with very few conditions, just as the government has approved almost every other big telecommunications deal in the last few years.
 American antitrust officials have become gun-shy in recent years, in part because of two setbacks in the courts in 2004 -- a defeat of the Federal Trade Commission's effort to block Arch Coal's acquisition of Triton Coal, and a loss by the Justice Department in its effort to stop Oracle from buying PeopleSoft. 
 And there are other signs of the federal government's lack of interest in antitrust enforcement these days. Despite the wholesale deregulation of some industries and the widespread consolidation of others, no one can remember a major case under the Sherman Antitrust Act against a company for acting as a monopolist since the Clinton administration's pursuit of Microsoft. 
 The administration is also threatening to undermine an effort by the Federal Trade Commission as it pursues what it says are abusive efforts by major pharmaceutical companies to keep generic drugs off the market. (The F.T.C. is an independent agency, led by Democrats and Republicans appointed by the president.)
 The commission has asked the Supreme Court to reverse a decision in a case the agency brought against Schering-Plough for paying a generic drug maker, Upsher-Smith Laboratories, to delay the generic company from bringing a rival drug to the market. The commission has complained that such agreements violate both Section 1 of the Sherman Act and the Hatch-Waxman Act, which Congress passed in 1984 to accelerate the development of lower-cost generic drugs.
 Two weeks ago, the commission released a study showing a sharp increase in deals between brand and generic pharmaceutical makers, which some officials say are having the effect of reducing competition for high-cost drugs. 
 The study found that in fiscal year 2005, of the 16 settlements between brand and generic makers over patent issues, 3 involved payments to the generics along with a commitment to delay the entry to market. And in the current fiscal year, which began last October, 7 out of 10 deals between brand drug companies and generic makers included a payment and a delay.
 Jon Leibowitz, one of the five members of the commission, has criticized the trend toward settlements that keep generic drugs off the market.
 ''These settlements do deny consumers potential access to potentially major savings,'' he said in a speech two weeks ago before drug company lawyers in Philadelphia. He cited as an example a potential $2 billion savings that was lost to consumers when Cephalon, the brand manufacturer of Provigil, a sleep-disorder medicine, settled claims in recent months with four generic makers.
 ''By settling with all generic applicants, a brand firm ensures that consumers never have a chance to see those savings,'' Mr. Leibowitz said.
 On the other side of the debate is the industry, which has been led by Billy Tauzin, the former Republican representative from Louisiana. Mr. Tauzin, who helped regulate the drug industry as head of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is the president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a lobbying organization for brand-name drug companies.
 His main argument is that the settlements do not violate antitrust law because they resolve costly and vexatious litigation. It is an argument that was adopted by the appeals court that ruled for Schering-Plough and seems to be prevailing at the Justice Department
 ''I don't know how you don't allow two litigants to settle their case if they want to,'' Mr. Tauzin told a trade publication, The Drug Industry Daily, two weeks ago. He called the commission's argument a ''a very spurious claim.''
 The counterargument is that the costs of the lawsuits often pale in comparison to the potential savings of consumers, and in fact there are settlements that courts have found to be contrary to public policy. 
 Mr. Tauzin's view seems to have traction within the administration. The Justice Department notably did not sign the Supreme Court brief filed by the Federal Trade Commission last year. Since then, the justices have asked the administration to provide its opinion in the case, and officials predict that the Justice Department will soon come out against the F.T.C. 
 Mr. Leibowitz says a court filing by the Justice Department could kill the case, although he suggested the agency would continue to find other cases to challenge agreements between generic and branded drug companies that limit competition. 
 Still, the pursuit of such cases has become rare in Washington these days, a prospect that has disheartened the die-hard supporters of antitrust law.
 ''They don't even seem to think that monopolies are bad,'' said Albert A. Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a research organization. ''Big is efficient and efficient is good. This is a story about how ideology has taken over the law enforcement process.''

HEADLINE: A Gloomy W.T.O. Chief Says Time Is Brief for Saving Talks 

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: MUNICH, May 4 

 BODY:
Having missed a crucial deadline last weekend for achieving progress toward a global trade agreement, the head of the World Trade Organization, Pascal Lamy, said Thursday that he was increasingly worried that the five-year talks would end in failure.
 ''We obviously are in the red zone,'' Mr. Lamy said in an interview after speaking at a business conference here. 
Saying that only 30 percent of the necessary work had been done by the April 30 deadline, Mr. Lamy did not invite trade ministers to the organization's headquarters in Geneva this week to work out an agreement reducing agricultural tariffs and subsidies and opening markets to industrial products.
 ''Having an acrimonious and unsuccessful ministers' meeting would pose an even bigger risk to the negotiations,'' he said.
 Now, Mr. Lamy said, negotiators from the 149 members of the W.T.O. have five or six weeks to agree on a framework for cutting tariffs. After that, he said, the approach of elections in the United States and other countries would make it difficult to achieve breakthroughs.
 A comprehensive agreement on trade rules has to be reached by the end of the year for President Bush to submit it to Congress before his special negotiating authority expires.
 Despite the many countries and issues involved, the dispute has boiled down to a three-way standoff involving the United States, the European Union and a group of developing countries like Brazil and India; the issues are tariffs and subsidies on both farm and industrial goods.
 Mr. Lamy met with the departing United States trade representative, Rob Portman, in Geneva this week, and urged him, as he has before, to improve the American offer on cutting subsidies to farmers. Mr. Portman has indicated that Washington will be flexible, but only if the developing countries improve their proposals on market access for American agricultural products.
 ''We're not saying different things,'' Mr. Lamy said of Mr. Portman. ''It's a matter of proportion.''
 Mr. Lamy said he was putting pressure on the European Union to improve its proposal to reduce tariffs on agricultural imports -- something the United States has also sought. And he wants the developing countries to offer better market access for industrial goods.
 Mr. Lamy, a skillful former European Union trade negotiator, is struggling to focus the minds of the participants. The pace of agreement on technical points has accelerated in recent days, he said.
 ''Negotiators are starting to understand that if this fails,'' Mr. Lamy said, ''what's been put on the table already disappears.''
 The current round of talks, which began in Doha, Qatar, in 2001, has survived several missed deadlines. But its prospects turned murky in recent weeks, in part because the Bush administration named Mr. Portman, a former congressman, as director of the Office of Management and Budget -- a move regarded by some as a downgrading of its ambitions for trade.
 Mr. Lamy said he did not view the move that way, adding that Mr. Portman could still exert influence from the White House. The administration, he noted, was now well stocked with former trade negotiators, including Robert B. Zoellick, the deputy secretary of state.
 For his part, Mr. Portman said on Wednesday in Geneva that he would be involved in the talks for a few more weeks, while the Senate takes up his nomination as budget director, as well as that of Susan Schwab, now the trade deputy, to be trade representative.
 ''So we are not only not missing a beat,'' he said, ''we are doubling up for a while here.''

Warning From U.S. Business
 WASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters) -- A coalition of more than 200 American business groups warned world trade negotiators Thursday that they would not support a trade agreement that failed to open new markets significantly.
 ''In our eyes, such an outcome would constitute a wasted opportunity,'' the group, the American Business Coalition for Doha, said in a letter sent to the World Trade Organization. ''A final package that misses the mark would draw little support from agriculture, business or consumer interests, making it likely to fail in Congress. If members do not work to break the current impasse, the round will instead make history as the first of its kind to end in failure.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Hiring Propels Increase in Jobs in the New York Region

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
A surge in hiring on Wall Street is driving the economy of New York City and the surrounding region, but the pace of growth still lags behind the national rate, the federal Department of Labor said yesterday. 
 In March, more than one of every five jobs created in the city was in the high-paying financial sector, which recorded its first streak of adding more than 12,000 jobs in each of three consecutive months, said Michael L. Dolfman, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 ''We're seeing financial services come back strongly, and when you consider that Wall Street is New York's hometown business, this is an extremely positive event,'' Mr. Dolfman said. He added that the financial sector accounted for more than one-third of the wages paid in the city, though it provides just one of every seven jobs.
 Over all, the number of jobs in the New York metropolitan region rose to 8.34 million in March, up 98,100, or 1.2 percent, from a year before. More than half of the new jobs, 58,200 of them, were created in the city and 12,400 of those were in the banking, brokerage and insurance businesses. Those doing the hiring ranged from giant companies like Citigroup and Merrill Lynch to the small unregulated investment firms, known as hedge funds, which are proliferating.
 The other industries contributing to the gains included education, health care, hotels and restaurants. Manufacturing jobs continued to disappear at a fast pace, with the city losing 5,200 such jobs last month. 
 In the surrounding areas -- northern New Jersey, Long Island and Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties -- the job market was uneven last month, the bureau reported. The fastest suburban job growth came in the northernmost parts of New Jersey, while employment in the Newark area remained flat.
 The region's job growth has been faster this year, at a rate of at least 1.1 percent each month, than in the last five months of 2005, when it ranged from 0.7 percent to 0.9 percent. But it was still slower than the national rate of job growth, which was 1.6 percent last month.
 Executives on Wall Street are gradually responding to the revival of the stock and bond markets after the sharp downturn that followed the bursting of the tech-stock bubble and the effects of the Sept. 11 attack, Frank A. Fernandez, chief economist for the Securities Industry Association, said. They have largely held to their custom of being quick to fire and slow to hire, he said. But, he added, ''We did less overhiring and less overfiring in the last cycle than we did in previous cycles.''

HEADLINE: Mayor's Budget Limits Increases In Spending

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
With booming tax revenues giving the city a $3.4 billion surplus, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg presented a $52.7 billion budget yesterday that kept spending in check as he warned that the city would soon have to cope with slower growth in employment, housing prices and Wall Street profits.
 In presenting the fifth budget of his mayoralty, Mr. Bloomberg adhered to the message of fiscal restraint that he has preached since taking office. But this year, freed from the political considerations of a re-election campaign, he went further in moving to ensure the city's long-term fiscal stability. 
He set aside $1.8 billion to shore up future budgets. The bulk of that, $1.4 billion, would go toward reducing long-term costs by setting aside a trust fund to pay for city retirees' health benefits; paying for capital projects immediately without long-term borrowing; and restructuring the city's share of the nationwide tobacco settlement. In addition, he unveiled a plan to set aside a further $350 million to retire some city debts early. 
 Those decisions drew applause from fiscal watchdogs. 
 ''It's certainly prudent, when revenues are coming in strongly, to reserve them for when times aren't so good,'' said Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the city's Independent Budget Office, who said the mayor was wise to avoid the temptation to add services or cut taxes.
 But City Council leaders faulted the mayor for slashing funds for discretionary programs like libraries, cultural organizations and charities. 
 The surplus, driven by higher-than-expected revenue from real estate, corporate and personal income taxes, would have reached $5.2 billion this year without the set-asides. The remaining surplus, $3.4 billion, is being applied to the fiscal year that starts on July 1. Counting that surplus, the mayor is actually proposing spending up to $56.1 billion next year.
 ''Over the past four years, we have made the difficult but responsible budget choices that brought New York City back,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''The result has been an economic recovery that has taken us farther, faster, than anyone thought possible. If we continue to act wisely now, we can keep our city on track for long-term growth and stability.''
 Mr. Bloomberg warned that the growth in ''noncontrollable'' expenses -- for Medicaid benefits, pensions, health insurance and debt service -- was quickly outpacing discretionary spending and posed a long-term threat to the city's fiscal stability, a theme he has echoed repeatedly.
 ''We are forecasting multibillion-dollar deficits for fiscal 2008 and beyond,'' he said. The city now projects deficits of $3.6 billion, $4.2 billion and $3.6 billion for the 2008 to 2010 fiscal years.
 Despite the dire warnings, Mr. Bloomberg's newest spending plan is not nearly as austere as the budgets he presented in his first two years in office, when the city was reeling from the 9/11 attack and an ensuing decline in the stock market and he was forced to raise property taxes. 
 The executive budget proposed yesterday includes $872 million in new agency spending for this year and next, beyond what the mayor had proposed in his preliminary budget on Jan. 31. The new spending includes one-time subsidies this year of $385 million for the Health and Hospitals Corporation and $100 million for the Housing Authority.
 The mayor noted that hospitals everywhere, including private and voluntary ones, were struggling and said he was determined to invest in the city's public housing system ''while other cities are blowing it up and destroying it.'' But the Housing Authority has also moved recently to raise rents and fees. 
 The budget drew mixed reviews from the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who has vowed to exert a larger role in the budget process. While generally expressing support for fiscal restraint, Ms. Quinn criticized the omission of $337.7 million worth of discretionary programs from the budget. Year after year, mayors have proposed withdrawing money from such programs, only to restore most of them at the last minute when the Council adopted the final budget each June. 
 Ms. Quinn, who has called the annual ritual a waste of time, said she was ''very disappointed'' that the mayor did not restore the programs, as she had urged. ''It is an attempt to keep us stuck in a dysfunctional budget dance, a process we are very committed to ending,'' she said.
 Mr. Bloomberg did accede to two of Ms. Quinn's budget requests. He agreed to provide $12 million over the next two years to buy 18,000 bullet-resistant vests for police officers. Earlier this week, the mayor also agreed to start providing more details about agency spending in future budgets, starting with the one he will unveil next January.
 ''Disagreement does not mean that we are now in a battle,'' Ms. Quinn said. 
 Intentionally or not, Mr. Bloomberg echoed Ms. Quinn yesterday when he referred to the need for fiscal caution by saying, ''President Kennedy once said that the time to mend the roof is when the sun is shining.'' Ms. Quinn used the same line on April 6, in her own speech outlining the Council's budget priorities.
 The Council is scheduled to begin a second round of hearings on the budget on May 17. The city is required to adopt a budget by June 30. 
 Other officials applauded the mayor's budget plan. ''Mayor Bloomberg has taken a creative, proactive approach to addressing the city's short- and long-term needs by setting aside resources to be available for future years, which are expected to be saddled with considerable budget gaps,'' said Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. The public advocate, Betsy Gotbaum, called the purchase of the bullet-resistant vests ''a smart investment.''
 Among the spending increases in next year's budget that were not announced in the mayor's preliminary budget in January are $224 million for the school system, whose budget has grown markedly under the Bloomberg administration; $82 million to pay for foster care and adoption services by the Administration for Children's Services; $38 million for higher energy costs; $26 million for overtime expenses at the Fire Department; and $17 million to help district attorneys prosecute gun offenses and white-collar crimes.
 Also included is $21 million to add 800 officers and 400 civilian employees to the Police Department, a plan the mayor announced in March.

HEADLINE: Job Growth Was Weak in April, but Hourly Wages Increased

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Job growth slackened in April, the government reported yesterday, but the hourly wages of ordinary workers jumped, and their pay is finally rising faster than inflation.
 The nation's employers added only 138,000 jobs, well below the average of 210,000 a month since last November. The unemployment rate, however, held at a low 4.7 percent. The contradictory numbers left economists unsure whether the weaker April job growth was a hiccup or early evidence of a slowdown in the economy.
''I am inclined to say that the weak April report is noise in the numbers,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, ''but I'm not certain. We may be getting an early, ambiguous signal that the economy is weakening. Turning points sometimes start this way.''
 Wall Street saw in the April jobs report a justification for policy makers at the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates after doing so one more time at their next meeting, on Tuesday. Reflecting this sentiment, the Dow Jones industrial average soared, as it often does when stocks seem to promise a better payoff than interest-bearing securities. 
 The Dow closed at 11,577.74, up 138.88 points for the day. That was its highest level since January 2000, the month in which the bubble market of the late 1990's finally ended, peaking at 11,722.98. Some interest rates fell yesterday for the same reason that stock prices rose. 
 ''There is still a substantial minority on Wall Street who say there is a reasonable chance that the Fed will raise rates in June,'' Mr. Shepherdson said, ''but stock market investors focused on what they view as the reduced risk that the employment numbers suggest.'' 
 Speaking for the Bush administration, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow made no mention of the weak April employment number. In a statement, he focused instead on ''32 straight months of job growth'' and average hourly earnings ''that have risen 3.8 percent over the past 12 months -- their largest increase in nearly five years.''
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics, in its monthly employment report, measures the average hourly wage of white-collar and blue-collar workers below the rank of supervisor. These hourly workers represent about 80 percent of the nation's jobholders. Although the recovery is now nearly four and a half years old, the average wage had lost ground to inflation until last fall, when the unemployment rate finally fell below 5 percent and stayed there.
 ''The labor markets are reasonably snug -- I wouldn't say tight, but snug -- and as a result we are seeing some acceleration in wages,'' said Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers.
 With workers more in demand, wage growth gradually accelerated, and in April the hourly average jumped 9 cents, to $16.61, after having risen 5 cents in March. Over the 12-month period ended in April, the hourly wage was up 3.8 percent. The increase was 3.6 percent in March, just enough to exceed the annual rise in the Consumer Price Index by two-tenths of 1 percent. 
 Some economists argued that the accelerating wage growth might produce a wage-price spiral in which companies raised prices to cover rising labor costs and workers countered by demanding higher wages -- unless the Fed cut off this dynamic by continuing to raise interest rates until the rising cost of credit finally slowed the economy and cut back hiring. 
 The April rise in hourly wages ''assuredly has some Fed members shaking in their boots,'' Richard Yamarone, director of economic research for the Argus Research Corporation, said in a newsletter yesterday. He argued that the surge in hourly earnings ''will shelve any notion of a Fed pause'' in rate increases.
 Mr. Yamarone's concern is a frequent one on Wall Street, but a growing number of forecasters who usually share Mr. Yamarone's view now argue that profit margins are unusually strong today, and that dilutes the pressure on corporate managers to raise prices to protect profits. 
 ''If you think that rising wages are squeezing profit margins and pushing companies to raise prices, you are thinking something for which there is no evidence,'' said James Glassman, senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan Chase & Company. ''If companies are more profitable, they are able to pay workers more generously without being inflationary.''
 Rising productivity has also taken the pressure off wages. When workers produce more each hour, the additional revenue from this output can feed into raises without shrinking profits. Productivity grew in the first quarter at a brisk annual rate of 3.2 percent, the bureau reported Thursday. That was almost enough to cover the 3.8 percent rise in the hourly wage.
 The bureau yesterday also revised its earlier estimates of job growth in February and March, subtracting a total of 36,000 jobs.
 Job growth in April was spread widely, with financial services, health care and education among the leaders. There were two surprises: in manufacturing and in retailing.
 Manufacturing employment, which has fallen most of the time during this recovery, jumped by 19,000 last month, with most of that rise taking place in the auto industry. That seemed to reflect stepped-up hiring among foreign-owned manufacturers, while Ford and General Motors as well as Delphi, G.M.'s chief parts supplier, have not yet carried out their announced layoffs.
 Retailers, in contrast, shed 36,000 jobs, despite strong consumer demand. The 36,000, like all the numbers in the monthly report, was adjusted for seasonal variations, and the seasonal impact of retail hiring during the month that includes Easter is famously difficult to pin down. 
 The swing in retail hiring, from a rise of 24,000 in March to a loss of 36,000 in April suggested to Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute, that the unexpectedly weak employment report was not likely to be repeated in May.
 ''The April numbers certainly do not comport with economic growth of just under 5 percent in the first quarter,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''So let's hope it was a hiccup.''

HEADLINE: Straight to DVD

BYLINE: By Robert W. Cort. 
Robert W. Cort, a film producer, is the author of ''Action!,'' a novel.

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
COMING soon: conversing cars; psychic superheroes; sinking ships. This week's release of ''Mission: Impossible III'' kicked off Hollywood's summer movie season, and once again filmmakers have spun enough dazzling fantasies and futuristic visions to keep moviegoers feasting until Labor Day.
 But when it comes to futuristic visions for the movie business, Hollywood is extraordinarily timid. During my three decades in the industry, I've seen film executives try to shun every innovation from VCR's to digital editing. Ultimately, they've accepted and profited from these new technologies but, by waiting years longer than they should have, left a lot of money on the table. And now studios are committing a far costlier error by refusing to release DVD's and downloads of movies at the same time they make their premieres in theaters. 
 Hollywood's skittishness has a long, painful history. In the early 1950's, the booming popularity of television led to a significant drop in theater admissions. Studio chiefs might have embraced this new medium -- after all, here was a revolutionary distribution system that desperately needed content, and the studios could have controlled television by feeding it. 
 Instead, the industry tried to starve TV to death. Studios and producers would not create original programming for the networks and even refused to license any of their films to television stations. 
 This strategy failed: the television industry, supported by advertisers, created shows that were beloved by audiences, and annual theater admissions declined from five billion in 1948 to barely half that by 1956. 
 Eventually the novelty of TV wore off and people found they still loved a Saturday night out at the movies. The film studios did begin producing programs and offering their libraries, but they'd lost their leverage -- and untold billions of dollars. 
 To paraphrase William Goldman, no one in Hollywood seems to learn anything. Nowadays, the studios are waging a fierce effort to prop up the status quo by denying consumers the choice of how, when and where to see movies. During this year's Academy Awards, presenters admonished the audience for not going to the multiplexes, as if watching movies at home was somehow anti-American. And at the industry's recent ShoWest convention, studio chiefs stood side by side with theater owners to reaffirm that movies would be released in theaters at least three months before becoming available on DVD or for download. 
 This stance is anti-consumerist and illogical -- and as hopeless as the industry's attempt to annihilate TV. 
 The collective experience of going to the movies has been a powerful part of the American experience for a century, but nowadays, a trip to the theater can feel like a rip-off. Ticket prices have, for the last decade, outpaced inflation. As you bristle at how much you just paid for drinks, candy and popcorn, you're forced to watch 20 minutes of the same commercials you see at home. Theater owners get away with this gouging because the studios have ensured them an early monopoly on film distribution. 
 The problem for the rest of us is that a monopoly like this one, without any underlying economic rationale, distorts the marketplace and hurts consumers. It will not hold in the face of democratizing technology. 
 Over the next year, the studios will market new forms of high definition DVD that look even more astonishing than the current generation on home entertainment systems. In effect, they are further enticing moviegoers to stay home even as they exhort and extort them to come to the movies. 
 Hollywood's continued insistence on a theatrical release window does not make economic sense. DVD's bring in well over 50 percent of the total revenue on an average movie -- almost double theatrical. It's the DVD sales that must be protected, not box office, from which few movies recoup their costs.
 The release window is costly and self-defeating -- after all, it forces studios to market their products twice. When the movie hits theaters, they pay for exorbitant advertising campaigns to build awareness; then, months later, they spend additional money to promote the DVD. 
 Exclusive theatrical releases also expose the studios to huge losses from piracy, which has already damaged the music business. A study by the Motion Picture Association of America this week revealed that piracy was nearly double what the studios had estimated -- costing Hollywood more than $6 billion a year. The major factor contributing to this piracy is that consumers know they can have content immediately, but are being denied it by the industry; hence a black market has inevitably sprung up. 
 Today's consumers want their entertainment when they want it -- witness the success of TiVo, iPods and Netflix. They buy cinema tickets only for those movies they deem worth the extra cost. As in the early days of television, the films that will fare best will probably be the spectaculars, like this summer's ''X-Men: The Last Stand'' and ''Superman Returns,'' or those with pre-sold buzz like ''The Da Vinci Code.'' Moviegoers wait for everything else to come out on DVD but by then the hype is gone or has been overtaken by negative word-of-mouth, so viewers end up skipping many movies altogether. 
 Why then do smart executives keep defending the sanctity of the theatrical release? Maybe it's sentimentality about the big screen, or the complicated and long-standing symbiosis between the film industry and theater exhibitors. Many in Hollywood do genuinely fear that a multiplatform release would destroy cinemas completely. 
 I don't believe that closing the release window would mean apocalypse for theaters. Yes, attendance in multiplexes would dip as some moviegoers watched from home, but many would still choose cinemas, as they did in the 1950's. Yes, exhibitors would have to adapt and compete -- but maybe you'd be able to get popcorn for less than a 5,000 percent mark-up. 
 If movies were released simultaneously online, on DVD and in the cinemas, consumers would have more choices, filmmakers would share their stories with more viewers and studios would greatly increase their profits. Hollywood is best off when the biggest possible audience shows up on opening night, whether they're sitting in front of a computer, a television -- or a big theater screen.

HEADLINE: It Really Has Been Tough to Make Money Lately 

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
AS the oldest baby boomers near retirement, the profits to be had from American financial markets seem to be shrinking.
 A new set of indexes measuring the size and return of the stock, bond and short-term financial markets in the United States was introduced this week by Dorchester Capital Markets, which hopes the indexes will be used for mutual funds and derivatives.
They show that the total value of measured securities climbed to a record $28.2 trillion last month, or about $95,000 for each of the nearly 300 million people living in the United States. 
 The indexes are not quite comprehensive. They include only the 2,000 largest stocks, although those account for about 94 percent of the total value of all stocks. And they do not include junk bonds or municipal bonds. But because they go back to 1980, they provide some insights into trends of returns and the relative popularity of markets.
 The most recent five years, through the end of April, show an overall return of just 1.6 percent a year over inflation. Bonds -- including only investment-grade issues -- did the best with a real annual return of 3.3 percent. Stocks returned only 1.8 percent and short-term investments failed to keep up with inflation, losing 0.2 percent a year.
 During the 1980's and 1990's, investors in all markets made money at a good clip, with stocks doing the best. But so far in this decade, returns on stocks and short-term investments have trailed inflation. Bonds, an asset class deemed hopelessly boring when stocks were hot, have been the leaders, producing a solid 5 percent a year over inflation.
 The chart showing the share of assets held in each area indicates that at turning points, the class that has gained the most popularity is likely to do the least well for its investors.
 In the summer of 1982, when interest rates were sky high and the stock market was in the doldrums, money market investments amounted to nearly a third of all investments. But those who owned them were not well positioned for bull markets that were about to begin in stocks and bonds.
 During the 1980's, bonds gained popularity -- at least as measured by the market value of all the bonds outstanding, peaking in 1992 at more than 42 percent of all securities. That move reflected rising prices as interest rates fell, but it also reflected soaring supply as budget deficits in the Reagan administration led to a sharp increase in the issuance of Treasury bonds.
 The 1990's, as all who lived through the bubble can attest, was the decade of stocks. Not only did they produce outsize returns, but the combination of rising prices and a boom in initial public offerings caused the total market share of stocks to peak at nearly two-thirds of the market in April 2000. That was also the month that the bond market share hit its low, of just over one-fifth of securities outstanding. Few liked bonds then, but since then they have been the best-performing asset class.
 Perhaps that, too, is changing. So far this year, it is stocks that have done the best. Bond market investors have lost money, even before considering inflation.

HEADLINE: Consumer Pace Of Borrowing Slows Slightly 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Borrowing by American consumers rose in March but at the slowest pace in four months as Americans charged less on their credit cards. 
 Consumer credit, or nonmortgage loans to individuals, increased $2.5 billion, or at an annual rate of 1.4 percent, to $2.161 trillion in March, the Federal Reserve said yesterday. The increase was the smallest since November, when consumer credit declined. In February, consumer debt increased by $4.5 billion.
Economists said Americans might be reluctant to spend more on big-ticket items including automobiles as interest rates rise and higher gasoline costs take a larger piece of their incomes. Homeowners may also be relying more on home equity borrowing, which is not tracked by the Fed's report.
 ''Many credit cards are tied to the prime rate, which has gone up 200 basis points the past year,'' said Chris Rupkey, senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. ''It's more and more costly for consumers to rely on credit to make their purchases, and there's been a general pullback.''
 Economists had forecast a $4.1 billion rise in March consumer credit after a previously reported $3.3 billion increase in February, according to the median estimate of 28 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
 Borrowing has become more expensive because the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates since 2004. 
 Next week, Fed officials are expected to raise their benchmark overnight bank lending rate a quarter percentage point, to 5 percent. It would be the 16th consecutive increase. The federal funds rate is used to set other lending rates by financial institutions.

HEADLINE: Financial Plan: Don't Graduate Without One 

BYLINE: By M. P. Dunleavey

 BODY:
THE college commencement season is upon us, raising an always tricky question: What's the best gift for a new graduate? A trip abroad, a new car, the basement studio you'd been hoping to rent out to a paying tenant?
 Parents who understand the financial hurdles their young adult is about to encounter might be tempted to answer, ''all of the above.'' But whatever largess parents extend, these days there's one thing no student should leave college without, and that's a financial plan. 
I wouldn't actually utter the phrase ''financial plan'' around anyone under 25, myself, but that shouldn't stop parents from using common sense and stealth to help new graduates cope with the fiscal realities they'll soon be facing. 
 Many young people embark on their postcollege lives burdened with student loan and credit card debt. Some graduates have little knowledge of how to stretch an entry-level salary to cover all their expenses -- assuming they are lucky or industrious enough to land that first job soon after graduation.
 According to Tamara Draut, author of ''Strapped: Why America's 20- and 30-Somethings Can't Get Ahead'' (Doubleday, 2006), graduates are more in debt today than ever, in part because the skyrocketing cost of college has forced many more to borrow than in the past. Graduates today carry an average of $20,000 in student loan debt, ''and about a quarter owe more than $25,000,'' said Ms. Draut, who is also the director of the economic opportunity program at Demos, an economic policy and advocacy group in New York. 
 On top of that, about 25 percent of students use credit cards to help cover college costs; according to the student loan provider Sallie Mae, in 2004 graduating students carried an average credit card balance of nearly $3,000.
 The job market itself can pose problems, Ms. Draut said. ''The hottest job markets are generally clustered in the major cities, where the cost of living is higher -- which puts young professionals in even more of a bind.''
 According to an online survey conducted by the Quarterlife Crisis Web site (quarterlifecrisis.com), which calls itself a resource ''for twentysomethings transitioning to life in the 'real world,' '' 61 percent of respondents had moved home for at least a year between the ages of 21 and 25.
 Even if your graduate doesn't lack for money, all young adults can benefit from basic directions to help them on the road to financial independence.

DISCUSS THE BIGGER PICTURE -- After a successful college career, many graduates are demoralized when their career plans don't gel quickly and bills loom large, said Abby Wilner, co-author of ''The Quarterlife Crisis'' (McGraw Hill, 2005). ''Rather than being critical, it helps if parents can talk about these hurdles with their kids.''

DO A FINANCIAL REVIEW -- Many seniors take a short test to prepare them for paying back student loans, Ms. Draut said, but it's still important to sit down with your new graduate and go over what they owe, what the payments are and what they need to earn to cover expenses.

EXPLAIN THE WEIRD WORLD OF CREDIT CARDS -- Many young people get their first credit card in college and build up debt before they understand basic concepts like how interest works, or the fact that it would take many years of making minimum payments to pay off the balance. Explaining how credit really works can keep them from using cards as their backup plan.

START A SAVINGS PLAN -- Young people juggling adult responsibilities for the first time may be inclined to make savings their last priority, but it's the parents' job to enforce the ''pay yourself first'' rule, said Michael Masterson, author of ''Automatic Wealth for Grads'' (Wiley, 2006) and the father of three sons, ages 17, 22 and 25. By working a side job a few hours a week, Mr. Masterson suggested, a determined saver could salt away $3,000 a year. ''They can put that money into a tax-deferred account, and they will become wealthy automatically,'' he said.
 Mr. Masterson recommends putting the money in a no-load index fund, like those offered by Fidelity or Vanguard.
 Again, I'd be careful with phrases like ''tax-deferred account,'' but Mr. Masterson says that most young people will respond well to the concept of building up millions without having to think too hard.
 And with any luck, parents who help graduates take these steps will reap their own windfall when they can, in the end, rent out that basement studio to a paying tenant.

HEADLINE: Gain of 138 Puts Dow at a 6-Year High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks rose sharply yesterday, sending the Dow Jones industrials up 138 points to a six-year high after a report of modest job growth bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve would end its interest rate increases. 
 All three major indexes finished the week with gains.
Investors saw a slowdown in April employment growth as the latest sign of a softening economy, a reason for the Fed to stop raising interest rates. That countered worries over rising wages, which followed an upswing in employers' labor costs on Thursday. 
 Jack Caffrey, an equities strategist for J. P. Morgan Private Bank, said the market appeared to be focusing on recent positive data. 
 ''People are taking the weaker job creation, the stability in the unemployment rate and the uptick in jobless claims and spinning that into a hope the Fed will move to the sideline sooner than later,'' Mr. Caffrey said. ''It's almost a hope-for-relief rally instead of a 'the Fed is done, things are slowing down' mentality.''
 Falling oil prices in recent days also helped stocks. Some analysts say higher gasoline prices will pressure consumer spending and keep the economy from overheating.
 The Dow rose 138.88 points, or 1.21 percent, to 11,577.74, its best showing since the Dow reached its record of 11,722.98 on Jan. 14, 2000. The Dow is now just 145.25 away from setting a record.
 Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 13.51, or 1.03 percent, to 1,325.76, its highest level since Feb. 15, 2001; the Nasdaq composite index advanced 18.67, or 0.8 percent, to 2,342.57. Advancing issues led decliners by a robust 3 to 1 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where preliminary consolidated volume of 2.4 billion shares trailed the 2.46 billion shares traded Thursday.
 The light trading volume was indicative of the market's continuing uncertainties about interest rates and the ability of stocks to press past multiyear highs, said Christopher Piros, director of investment research for the Strategic Investment Research Group at Prudential. The jobs data left the inflation riddle unanswered, he said.
 ''We are at a point where inflation expectations are still rising, and the Fed is faced with a dilemma of whether they've done enough to cap inflation, but not enough to roll over the economy,'' Mr. Piros said. ''I haven't seen real signs of a pickup in core inflation, although it's been ticking up slowly.''
 For the week, the Dow was up 1.85 percent, the S.& P. climbed 1.16 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0.86 percent.
 The Labor Department said United States employers added 138,000 jobs in April; the estimates were for a 200,000 gain. Average hourly earnings jumped 0.5 percent, above the consensus target of 0.3 percent. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.7 percent.
 Bonds recouped recent losses, with the 10-year Treasury note gaining 12/32, to 95 13/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, falling to 5.10 percent from 5.15 percent late Thursday. The dollar sank against the Japanese yen and was flat against European currencies, while gold prices topped $680 an ounce.
 Crude oil futures edged up after a three-day decline spurred by government data showing improving supplies of gasoline and flat demand. A barrel of light crude oil rose 25 cents to settle at $70.19 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The Warner Music Group reported a loss for the latest quarter amid declining revenue from its music publishing business. Music sales, however, rose 9 percent, led by a threefold jump in digital sales. Warner Music's stock rose 66 cents, to $29.40.
 Medco Health Solutions posted a 66 percent slide in first-quarter profit, hurt by a $100 million charge to settle three legal matters. Still, Medco rose $1.99, to $52.76.
 The luxury home builder Toll Brothers rose $1.21, to $30.85, although its signed contracts tumbled 29 percent last quarter. The company also lowered its forecast for full-year deliveries of new homes.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrials were up 210.60, or 1.85 percent. The S.& P. 500-stock index gained 15.15 points, or 1.16 percent. The Nasdaq rose 20 points, or 0.86 percent.

HEADLINE: Trimming Down to a Less Costly Design at Ground Zero 

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
First of all, substitute plastic pipes for stainless steel pipes in the World Trade Center memorial and you may save $8 million. Good. Now, only $164 million more in savings is needed before reaching the newly declared budget limit of $500 million for the ground zero memorial.
 What other savings can be found? Will the fundamental design of the memorial have to be radically revised? And how did costs get so high in the first place? These questions were swirling around the disclosure this week of the most authoritative estimates yet. 
Bovis Lend Lease, the construction manager for the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, has put the cost of the memorial and memorial museum at $672 million, out of a total for the whole memorial setting -- cooling plant, underground roadways, a stabilized slurry wall, police dispatch center, sidewalks, utilities -- of $973 million (not including an $80 million visitors' orientation and education center).
 Perhaps the most radical notion going around involves a reorientation of the memorial. As designed by Michael Arad, the names of victims would be inscribed on low parapets in galleries 30 feet below street level, surrounding the enormous sunken pools and waterfalls that mark the voids where the twin towers stood.
 Eliminating those galleries and moving the commemorative parapets above ground, surrounding the pools at plaza level, is one cost-saving possibility that has been discussed by executives of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg floated his own idea yesterday, suggesting that the 9/11 museum and the visitors' center might be put in the base of the Freedom Tower. As currently planned, the museum would be adjacent to the memorial within the twin towers' foundations.
 The Freedom Tower would be a ''perfect place'' to ''display artifacts or have places to teach kids about what happened at the site,'' the mayor said on his weekly radio program. ''Do it there. It's a good use of that lobby. It's going to be a building that the Port Authority is going to own anyway, and it's two less buildings that you have to build.''
 Other possibilities include eliminating the waterfalls or the contemplation room planned in the north tower footprint, although Gretchen Dykstra, the president of the memorial foundation, said yesterday, ''I haven't heard anybody, on any side of any fence, say that they want to disrupt the beauty and dignity of Michael Arad's reflecting pools.''
 No final design choice is likely to be made soon. First, government officials and foundation executives have to agree on what the actual costs are likely to be.
 ''I haven't said no to any alternative,'' said John P. Cahill, Gov. George E. Pataki's chief of staff and the state's top downtown redevelopment official. ''But until you know the extent of the problem, both on the construction side and the operation side, it would not be fair to make any firm suggestion of what would be the final result.''
 The current design evolved from Mr. Arad's stark original entry to the 2003 memorial competition. It had no aboveground buildings, underground museum or even trees.
 The jury chose a more verdant proposal in January 2004, after Mr. Arad was joined by the landscape architect Peter Walker. That month, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation said it would add an underground artifact center to the memorial and build a cultural building.
 That building, designed by Snohetta, has since been transformed into a much smaller visitors' orientation and education center. Snohetta is also designing the museum entrance pavilion, which was cited by the foundation as one of the ''largest drivers'' of the new cost estimate, having added $22 million to the cost.
 No matter where savings are found, the trade center site imposes its own challenges.
 It occupies a 70-foot depression in landfill at the edge of the Hudson River, a sort of reverse bathtub that must resist tremendous pressure. When the towers stood, their basement floor slabs provided the needed lateral bracing for the foundation walls, also known as slurry walls. Without floors to buttress them, the slurry walls are temporarily being held in place by cables.
 To make the point that the memorial and the museum were not exorbitant, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation asked the consulting firm Faithful & Gould to estimate how much it would cost to build a generic structure -- no museum and no memorial -- simply to close up and reinforce the 70-foot pit.
 Thomas R. Jaske, a vice president of the firm, said his estimators assumed the structure would largely be unoccupied and need only minimum utilities; that it would have three main floors and a rooftop at plaza level, with columns every 35 feet; that it would be made of steel and concrete; and that it would permit access by the public to the slurry wall and column remnants.
 Such a structure alone, he said, would cost about $370 million.

HEADLINE: Hearing on Liquor License Bill Draws Crowd

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
Liz Glass says that she and her children cannot sleep at night. The trouble, she says, is a noisy bar that operates in the courtyard of her East Village co-op. ''Our lives have become a hellish nightmare,'' said Ms. Glass, 37, who lives on East 11th Street above the Boxcar Lounge. ''My 2-year-old's first words were 'there are people in the backyard.' ''
 Doug Griebel, too, has had difficulty sleeping lately, but for different reasons. Mr. Griebel, who owns four restaurants in Manhattan, among them Rosa Mexicano and City Grill, is worried that legislation recently introduced in the State Assembly will stifle growth in New York's fabled food and beverage industry. ''This law is punitive,'' he said. ''It's going to hurt so many mom and pop entrepreneurs.'' 
Restaurateurs, tavern owners and nightclub impresarios are in a state of near panic over the proposed measure, which would severely limit the supply of new liquor licenses in New York, especially in downtown commercial districts throughout the state and in densely populated swaths of Manhattan. 
 Introduced last month by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the bill would amend the state's liquor laws and eliminate exemptions to the so-called 500-foot rule, which prohibits more than three licensed establishments from operating within 500 feet of one another. In certain quarters of New York City -- among them Restaurant Row, vast stretches of the Upper East Side and the meat-packing district -- dozens of bars, lounges and restaurants serving alcohol can be found vying for business along a single block. The average crosstown block in Manhattan, for example, is about 260 feet long. 
 Mr. Silver held public hearings on the bill yesterday in Manhattan, which brought out scores of anxious business owners who oppose the measure and an even larger number of residents desperately seeking relief from what they say is a plague of noisy night life establishments and their inebriated clientele. Mr. Silver, who represents the Lower East Side, was clearly motivated by a constituency that has become highly vocal in the battle against the proliferation of places serving alcohol. 
 ''People have a right to a good night's sleep free of excessive and overt disturbances,'' he said. ''They have a right to neighborhoods that are not being continuously scarred by vandalism, mischief and obscenity, and they have a right to walk down their neighborhood streets without being accosted every few feet by someone who is out of control.''
 Opponents of the bill said that troublesome bars should be dealt with through existing laws or restrictive zoning. They pointed to the night life industry's contribution to the New York tourist economy -- $22 billion in revenues, 330,000 people employed -- and said restricting new licenses would chase away business and have a chilling effect on the city's financial well-being.
 ''This law is overkill,'' said Albert Capsouto, who helps run a neighborhood improvement group called the TriBeCa Organization and who also owns Capsouto Freres, a restaurant on Washington Street. ''You're not allowing good operators to open simply because a small number of establishments in a certain area are behaving badly.'' 
 Under existing law, the State Liquor Authority can overlook the 500-foot rule if an applicant shows that the business provides a public benefit. In many cases, the authority's members cite the jobs and tax revenue generated by a bar or restaurant when it waives the rules. Over the past few months, the authority reviewed 22 exemption requests in Manhattan and granted 21 of them, according to Mr. Silver. 
 The authority, however, says that when it comes to exemptions challenged by the community, it often sides with the opponents. Daniel B. Boyle, the authority's chairman, said that so far this year in Manhattan, the agency had rejected 7 of 10 applicants who faced local opposition.
 Mr. Silver, one of the most powerful men in Albany, acknowledged that his bill is draconian, but he suggested that it could be a starting point for negotiations with the restaurant and night life industry. Compromises, he said, could include new categories of liquor licenses that would differentiate between restaurants that would close at midnight and dance clubs that would stay open until 4 a.m. The latter category, for example, might have more stringent requirements, he said.
 He also floated the idea of giving members of the New York City Council the power to approve or reject new liquor licenses in their districts. ''I don't want to inhibit any New Yorker's dream of owning and operating a nightclub,'' he said, ''but among the competing interests in each and every community, a balance must be struck.''

HEADLINE: All Smoke, No Fire in Bolivia

BYLINE: By William Powers. 
William Powers is the author of ''Blue Clay People'' and the forthcoming ''Whispering in the Giant's Ear: A Frontline Chronicle from Bolivia's War on Globalization.''

DATELINE: La Paz, Bolivia 

 BODY:
OUT for a stroll here this past Monday, I stopped in my tracks. Bolivian soldiers had surrounded my local gas station, where a banner read, ''Property of the Bolivian State.'' They were among several thousand soldiers posted at the more than 50 oil fields and refineries around this landlocked nation, which holds the continent's largest natural gas reserves after Venezuela. Latin America's newest populist leader, President Evo Morales, had just issued a decree nationalizing Bolivia's petroleum.
 In reaction to the news, the European Union warned that the move could tighten global energy supplies and increase prices at the pump. Other international analysts have expressed concern about a resurgence of dangerous ''energy nationalism.'' However alarming Bolivia's move might appear on the surface, though, there is surprisingly little in it to worry the United States and the West. 
This is simply the way democracy sometimes works. Oil and gas nationalization has been the main political issue in Bolivia for the last several years. Mr. Morales, an Aymara Indian farmer, won a landslide victory in December on a promise to nationalize the gas industry. Now he's delivering on that promise he made to the country's nine million citizens. 
 And when viewed from a Bolivian perspective, this is less of a nationalization than a return to constitutionality. Mr. Morales has a strong legal argument that the privatization that took place in the mid-1990's was unconstitutional. Under the Bolivian Constitution, the contracts that gave control to private companies were supposed to be approved by Congress, and they were not. 
 Add this to resentment on the street over Bolivia's Transparency International corruption ranking last year (placing its leaders among the world's most dishonest) and a long history of swindles where natural resources like gold, silver, timber and petroleum have been ''privatized'' into the global economy to the sole benefit of a few very wealthy Bolivians. 
 Nor is this a classic nationalization in the sense of the confiscations that took place in the region in the 50's and 70's. In those days, Latin American governments expropriated everything and kicked out the companies the next day. This time Bolivia will exert greater control over the companies, including significantly higher taxes and 50 percent-plus-one state ownership, but Mr. Morales has pledged to create an environment conducive to private profit-making, and the government has repeatedly stated that it is a ''nationalization without confiscation,'' with no expulsion of foreign companies nor expropriation of their assets. 
 Then why did Mr. Morales send in the army? In a word, politics. His dramatic televised decree -- delivered in a hard hat from a Tarija oil field -- was necessary to placate masses of radicalized Bolivians who demand ''confiscation without compensation'' to the companies. The majority of Bolivians support nationalization out of acute frustration over two decades of failed ''neoliberal'' policies by the International Monetary Fund, which tied sorely needed loans to privatization, debt reduction and relaxation of labor standards.
 Bolivia was one of the first Latin American countries to adopt this approach back in the mid-1980's. State-owned companies were sold off. Government spending and regulation was scaled back. Foreign capital was courted. All on the promise of a new dawn of well-being. 
 Twenty years later the average Bolivian is worse off than before. Exports have declined. Bolivian incomes are stagnant, and half of the population lives on less than $2 a day. The rest of Latin America has experienced similar results from neoliberalism, leading to a general disillusionment that has given rise to leftist-populist governments. 
 Even so, some continue to insist that Bolivia's new nationalization policy only makes things worse by scaring off future investments. This does not appear to be true. Although the principal companies invested here -- Brazil's Petrobras, Spain's Repsol and Britain's BG Group -- have predictably denounced the nationalization, they are not about to pull up stakes. The companies will still profit under the new rules; they won't see the huge profits they enjoyed under lax Bolivian control and the global rally in commodities prices, but they will make money. Shell, which owns 25 percent of an oil and gas pipeline company here, already broke with the other companies by announcing that it remains interested in continuing to ''participate in Bolivia's hydrocarbon sector.'' 
 The principal danger in Bolivia is that Mr. Morales could go beyond his democratic mandate and detour into a more extreme resource nationalism hostile to democracy that then spreads among Bolivia's energy-rich neighbors. But the world can only hasten such an outcome by trying to punish Mr. Morales. 
 The world, such as it is, needs gas and oil, and Bolivia and its neighbors need to sell it. Bolivia is just struggling for a way to make markets work.

HEADLINE: Producing More. Earning More. Spending More. 

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
MASSES of illegal immigrants took a day off on Monday to demonstrate their contribution to the American economy. The nationwide protest closed some businesses, but did not succeed in significantly slowing the economy, as some organizers had hoped. But then, as the latest batch of statistics suggest, nothing seems to be slowing the economy.

MIXED SIGNALS -- American workers' productivity -- a ratio of output to hours worked -- resumed its climb in the first three months of the year, increasing by a robust 3.2 percent. But, unusual in recent times, workers got more than the full benefit of their productivity, as hourly wages rose at an annual rate of 5.8 percent -- or 3.2 percent after adjusting for inflation.
The Labor Department reported that unemployment claims rose last week, but only modestly. There were 2.5 million claims outstanding as of April 22, about 5.5 percent fewer than a year ago, although another report showed that employers created a net 138,000 new jobs last month, fewer than the 150,000 needed to keep pace with population growth and far fewer than the 185,000 monthly average in the first quarter. The unemployment rate was steady at 4.7 percent. 
 Those signals from the job market fanned concerns that inflation may accelerate soon, leading the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further to slow it. For now, however, inflation is slow. Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose at a 2 percent rate in March, the Commerce Department said. That was up from 1.8 percent from the month before, but still tame by historical standards. Including food and energy, prices rose at a 2.9 percent rate, the same pace as in February. 
 The Fed's rate-setting policy makers will meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss whether to raise short-term interest rates. Many traders expect a quarter-point increase.

EARN AND SPEND -- If consumers were worried about higher interest rates, or even stubbornly high gasoline prices, it was difficult to detect it at the nation's shopping centers.
 Retailers, paced by Kohl's (up 13.4 percent) and Target (up 10.4 percent), reported their best monthly sales results in two years. Results for stores open at least a year rose an unusually high 6.6 percent, compared with the period a year ago.
 The biggest gains were at stores focused on teenagers, including American Eagle Outfitters (up 19 percent) and Abercrombie & Fitch (up 17 percent). Sales at Gap, by contrast, fell 3 percent. Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer, said its sales rose 6.8 percent.
 The International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group, predicted a far less rosy picture for this month, as high gasoline prices are expected to damp spending in stores.

GAS PAINS -- Energy costs have already crimped sales in one area: autos.
 General Motors, Ford and Chrysler all reported declines in April. G.M. and Ford were each down 7 percent compared with April last year. The Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler reported an 8 percent decline.
 Carmakers with a variety of economical smaller cars, meanwhile, said their sales rose -- nearly 9 percent for Toyota and 7 percent for Honda.
 Paradoxically, a bright spot for G.M. was its lines of new S.U.V.'s. Sales of its Yukon and Tahoe models rose more than 30 percent last month, while the Cadillac Escalade S.U.V. jumped by 127 percent. 
 G.M. will face stiffer competition in coming months as Ford and Chrysler begin to sell updated models of their S.U.V.'s as well, analysts said.

LABOR PAINS -- Almost before G.M. could enjoy the small bit of good news about its S.U.V. sales, it received a troubling message from the United Automobile Workers. That labor union asked its 24,000 members working at Delphi, G.M.'s biggest parts supplier, to authorize a strike. A walkout at Delphi could force G.M. to file for bankruptcy protection, analysts say.
 Union leaders sought the strike vote less than a week before Delphi, which is operating under bankruptcy court protection, was scheduled to ask a bankruptcy judge to let it close 21 of its 29 factories in the United States, eliminate 20,000 of its 34,000 hourly jobs and unilaterally impose sharply lower wage and benefit rates on the remaining workers.
 U.A.W. members are scheduled to vote on the strike before May 14. Delphi's court date is May 9.

SURE BETS -- If anyone had a rougher week than the people at Delphi, it might have been the people at Comverse Technology, a telecommunications software company in New York.
 The week began with the unexpected resignations of its founder, Kobi Alexander, and two other top executives. A few days later, the other shoe dropped: Comverse disclosed that it had received a subpoena from the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn seeking information on how the company decided when to grant stock options to its senior officers.
 Comverse had recently come under scrutiny for the remarkably lucky timing of its executives, who regularly received large stock option grants just before the company's stock began to rise. The coincidence supercharged the value of those options; investigators are now looking into whether the grants were illegally backdated to guarantee that extra pop.
 More subpoenas may be coming because other companies have stepped forward to say that their stock-option programs have also come under federal scrutiny.

HEADLINE: Bush Gives a Lift to Retail Sales Data

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5 

 BODY:
President Bush, looking for a folksy way to highlight the economy's strength, talked up the newest job numbers on Friday as he bought toys and treats for his dog at a small hardware store here.
 ''I just spent some of my hard-earned money on Barney,'' Mr. Bush said as he stood in the garden department of Frager's Hardware on Capitol Hill. ''I bought him a couple of toys to chew on -- but don't let him know until I get over there, because it's a surprise.''
Mr. Bush's team chose the hardware store as a backdrop for remarks Friday about the latest economic news. And he used the opportunity to highlight labor data showing the economy added 138,000 new jobs in April and that unemployment was at 4.7 percent. 
 ''One thing we've got to make sure is that we keep the people's taxes low to keep this economy growing,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Raising taxes will hurt small businesses; raising taxes will hurt consumers; raising taxes will particularly affect working people, now that the price of gasoline has gone up.''
 But the visit was also in keeping with the administration's efforts to highlight what it says it considers one of Mr. Bush's biggest assets -- his regular-guy personality -- and to show that he is not cloistered in the White House as his approval ratings remain low.
 John Weintraub, an owner of the hardware store, said the president had looked at everything the store had to offer. 
 ''Our manager took him down and showed him all the tools, and we went back into our nut and bolt room,'' Mr. Weintraub said. ''He liked our fastener selection.''
 But in the end, Mr. Weintraub said, ''He wanted stuff for Barney -- we have a small pet area -- and he bought a couple of chews.''
 Sure enough, when Mr. Bush walked out of the front door of the hardware store, he was holding a plain plastic bag from which he pulled a white dog bone. It had a bar-coded price tag affixed to it.
 It was just such a bar code price tag that created something of a stir for his father during a visit to a grocers conference in 1992. News media reports portrayed President George H. W. Bush as being amazed by an ordinary grocery scanner -- an assessment the White House vigorously denied.
 There was no such issue on Friday -- reporters were not present inside the store when the president bought his dog treats.
 But Mr. Weintraub said the president paid with his own cash, about $8 in all, ''like any customer.'' (He said the bones cost $1.99 each)
 Mr. Bush did not buy any dog toys for the other White House terrier, Miss Beazley. But a spokeswoman said, ''there was no slight'' because the dogs ''share all their treats.''

In Defense of Bernanke
 WASHINGTON, May 5 (Reuters) -- President Bush said in an interview on Friday that the new Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke did not have a credibility problem.
 Asked if the rising price of gold, increasing bond yields, a falling dollar and a report that Mr. Bernanke had been misinterpreted when he delivered testimony to Congress last week meant that the Fed chief had a credibility problem, Bush told CNBC television, ''No.''
 ''This guy's sound, he's smart, he's capable,'' Bush said in the interview with Larry Kudlow of CNBC. ''You might remember, when I first nominated him, he was well received by most accounts as being a sound thinker who will be independent from the politics of Washington.''

HEADLINE: Spitzer Is Cool to Pataki's Plan for a Rail Link to Kennedy

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Eliot Spitzer said yesterday that Gov. George E. Pataki's pet transportation project, a $6 billion rail link between Lower Manhattan and Kennedy Airport, would not be a top priority if he became governor.
 In his first major speech on transportation, Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat who is the state attorney general, cast doubt on whether a direct train to Kennedy was a sensible use of public resources, and he did not include it among what he called ''the top priorities for Albany's funding of major new transportation expansion projects in the metropolitan region over at least the next five years.''
His short list of priorities, he said, consists of a subway line along Second Avenue, a Long Island Rail Road connection to Grand Central Terminal and the replacement of the Tappan Zee Bridge across the Hudson River. 
 Governor Pataki has made the airport link a priority, presenting it as a vital component of the revitalization of the downtown financial district. Late last year, he persuaded the Bush administration and Republicans in Congress to allow $2 billion of Sept. 11 aid to be used for the project.
 New York governors have significant influence over which major transportation projects are built because they hold sway over public authorities. The remarks from Mr. Spitzer, who leads all polls on the governor's race, signal that the rail link could have a cloudy future.
 In his speech, at the Waldorf-Astoria before the Regional Plan Association, Mr. Spitzer made only passing mention of the airport link, saying that more study was needed ''so that we can better evaluate the cost of the project as well as the expected economic benefits.'' 
 He also blamed ''a dysfunctional transportation planning process'' and poor management of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the New York State Thruway Authority for the slow progress on the projects he favors.
 The transportation authority, he said, is ''simply not a well-run agency.'' If elected, he said, he would ''appoint individuals to executive and board positions based on professional excellence and experience, not patronage.''
 A spokeswoman for the transportation authority declined to respond to Mr. Spitzer's criticism. But Anthony R. Coscia, the chairman of the Port Authority, who was in the audience for the speech, seemed unperturbed and said he had no quarrel with anything Mr. Spitzer said.
 Mr. Coscia said he agreed that it was important to set priorities for the big projects because, to some degree, they all were in competition for money from the same sources: the federal and state governments and the Port Authority. His favorite is a commuter-rail tunnel under the Hudson between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan that could cost $6 billion.
 Mr. Spitzer said yesterday that he supported Port Authority spending of $1 billion to $2 billion on that tunnel, as long as the agency contributed an equal amount to a New York project like the Second Avenue subway, the Long Island Rail Road connection to the East Side or the link to Kennedy.
 Mr. Coscia said it was premature to discuss what role the Port Authority might play in the airport rail link, but he said he would not rule out the possibility that the agency would invest in a New York City subway project. 
 ''The Port Authority's job is to be an aggressive, robust investor in the region's transportation infrastructure, and we shouldn't eliminate or red-line any particular type of investment,'' Mr. Coscia said.
 Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, who is challenging Mr. Spitzer for the Democratic nomination for governor, said he was not ready to spell out his ideas on improving transportation in the region, but he criticized his rival for not specifying how he would pay for his plan.
 ''These are all wonderful programs,'' Mr. Suozzi said in an interview. ''The problem is we're tens of billions of dollars shy of having the money we need for them.''
 Transportation analysts who heard Mr. Spitzer's speech said they were impressed that he had studied the subject closely and seemed to be eager to speed the pace of building. 
 ''I would be surprised if I ever again sit in a room with a gubernatorial candidate who says that much about what he wants to do on transportation,'' said Jon Orcutt, executive director of the Tristate Transportation Campaign, which pushes for mass transportation. ''It's important for New York to make those clear statements now because we have had this eight years of sort of a morass with all of these big projects going nowhere.''
 Mr. Orcutt added that he considered it ''definitely significant'' that Mr. Spitzer had less to say about the Kennedy rail link than about the Second Avenue subway, the East Side rail project or the Tappan Zee. 
 Mr. Spitzer said he believed that the Tappan Zee must be replaced with a bridge that had some mass-transit component on it, but he said he had no opinion yet on whether that should be commuter rail or dedicated lanes for buses.
 He said he was open to all ideas on how to pay for a new bridge, which would cost at least $5 billion.
 Among the possibilities, he said, is some form of public-private partnership that would use toll revenue to cover much or all of the construction costs.
 He said he also supported the proposed extension of the No. 7 subway line to the Far West Side of Manhattan, which would be financed by the city.

HEADLINE: Cheney, Visiting Kazakhstan, Wades Into Energy Battle

BYLINE: By ILAN GREENBERG and ANDREW E. KRAMER; Ilan Greenberg reported from Almaty for this article, and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow.

DATELINE: ALMATY, Kazakhstan, May 5 

 BODY:
A day after chastising Moscow for its use of oil and natural gas as ''tools for intimidation and blackmail,'' Vice President Dick Cheney visited Kazakhstan on Friday to promote export routes that bypass Russia and directly supply the West. 
 With his comments, Mr. Cheney waded into a messy geopolitical struggle for energy and influence in the countries of the former Soviet Union, rapidly becoming one of the world's largest-producing regions. 
The United States backs efforts to weaken Russia's grip by building new export routes for the enormous energy reserves of Central Asia, much of which now must cross Russian territory to reach ports in the Black Sea or pipelines to Europe. 
 Mr. Cheney's visit to Kazakhstan, on Russia's southern rim, highlighted the balancing of United States interests, trying to counter Russian dominance in energy matters by cozying up to states like Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan that have spotty human rights records and limited democracy -- and plenty of oil. 
 ''The United States is trying to strike a difficult balance,'' said Tanya Kostello, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a New York risk consultancy. ''It is trying to encourage the regime in Kazakhstan to move toward democracy while maintaining the economic ties.''
 The Kazakh president, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, won a third six-year term in December 2005, with 91 percent of the vote in an election that international observers said was flawed. Two opposition politicians have been murdered in six months, raising the specter of instability. 
 Kazakhstan produced 1.2 million barrels of oil a day last year but is expected to pump 3 million a day by 2015. 
 On Friday, Mr. Cheney met privately with officials from the Kazakh government, ending the day with a dinner with Mr. Nazarbayev in Astana, the Kazakh capital, according to American officials.
 Asked afterward his opinion of democracy in Kazakhstan, the vice president endorsed the Nazarbayev government without qualification. ''I have previously expressed my admiration for what has transpired here in Kazakhstan over the past 15 years,'' he said, ''both in terms of economic development as well as political development.''
 In Russia, reaction to Mr. Cheney's speech on Thursday was sharp. Kommersant, a major daily, called it ''the beginning of a second cold war,'' this time in a struggle over energy and competing spheres of influence rather than ideology. 
 In an echo of the 19th-century Great Game scramble for colonial possessions in Central Asia, the United States is seeking to weaken Russia's control over oil and natural gas while also keeping China from stepping in to the breach. It is also encouraging export options that avoid Iran, another longstanding rival for regional influence. 
 Meanwhile Gazprom, the Russian natural gas monopoly, is growing increasingly reliant on Central Asian natural gas as its fields in the Arctic decline. Turkmenistan, wedged between Iran and Kazakhstan, has some of the world's largest reserves of natural gas. 
 Because Kazakhstan borders China and Russia, and shares the Caspian Sea with Iran to the south, Mr. Nazarbayev has many options. Under several proposed pipeline routes, Kazakh oil and gas would be sent through Russia, Turkey, Iran, China, Pakistan and even Afghanistan. 
 On Thursday, Kazakhstan's energy minister cheered the United States and Europe by saying he was interested in building a gas pipeline westward to Azerbaijan and then to Turkey, bypassing Russia and loosening Gazprom's lock on this trade. But that same day, Kazakhstan's national pipeline operator issued a guarantee to Russia to ship Russian oil to China through its new Atasu-Alashankou oil pipeline. 
 In this seesaw struggle for influence, the United States is set to score a victory this fall with the opening of pipelines carrying oil and natural gas from the Caspian Sea to Turkey, again bypassing Russia.
 With those pipes in place, American officials like Assistant Secretary of State Richard A. Boucher, who is traveling this week with Mr. Cheney, have called for Kazakhstan to commit to transporting more of its oil along this westward route. 
 Some modern players of the Great Game argue that energy sales to China paradoxically serve American interests, because oil that China pumps from Kazakhstan is oil that it will not buy on the spot market in the Persian Gulf, purchases that could push up world prices. 
 The United States is also concerned about maintaining its military presence in Central Asia. The need became acute after Uzbekistan reacted to American criticism of its violent suppression of a demonstration last summer by expelling the Americans from an air base supporting operations in Afghanistan. 
 The United States' other Central Asian base, in Kyrgyzstan, also seems to be on wobbly foundations, with the government there demanding higher rent payments and discussing whether to expel the Americans -- cheered on by Russia and the Chinese, analysts say. 
 Kazakhstan is the largest and, many say, most stable country in the Caspian Sea region. The entire basin contains roughly 10 billion barrels of oil, much of it in Kazakhstan territory. Kazakhstan is second only to Russia in oil reserves among the countries once part of the Soviet Union.
 Mr. Cheney's visit was the latest high-level United States delegation in Kazakhstan, where support for Mr. Nazarbayev's energy policies are balanced with careful criticism of his autocratic rule. 
 Opposition leaders say they are emboldened by Mr. Cheney's pointed comments on Thursday in the speech in Lithuania, when he praised democratic advances in former Soviet states like Georgia and Ukraine, in spite of resistance from Russia. 
 Mr. Cheney said President Bush, who is to meet with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, in July, ''will make the case, clearly and confidently, that Russia has nothing to fear and everything to gain from having strong, stable democracies on its borders.''
 Opposition leaders here were to meet with Mr. Cheney for an hour after lunch on Saturday, just before Mr. Cheney's departure to Croatia, the final leg of his three-country tour.
 ''We're going to try to explain the deplorable situation in this country,'' Oraz Jandosov, co-chairman of the Democratic Party of Kazakhstan, said in an interview. ''After Cheney's speech yesterday, it will be difficult for him to be unsympathetic to us.''
 Still, Mr. Jandosov said several colleagues would miss the talks because the authorities had prevented them from traveling to the capital.


CORRECTION-DATE: November 1, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about Lithuania's political dispute with Russia over oil rendered incorrectly a word in a quotation from Vice President Dick Cheney, who had commented on Moscow's use of energy exports as a political tool. He said oil and gas were ''tools of intimidation or blackmail'' -- not ''and blackmail.'' (The error also appeared in articles on May 6, May 14, June 29 and July 15.)

HEADLINE: Despite a Sound Economy, Many Feel the Pinch of Daily Costs

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: BRANDON, Fla., May 2 

 BODY:
As a rule, when Americans feel financially pinched, the causes are clear: high unemployment, soaring interest rates, depressed home values and a wilting stock market. 
 But many Americans now say they are feeling squeezed in the absence of these factors. Their concerns are instead centered on a combination of high gasoline prices, creeping insurance costs and the pressure of a large number of adjustable-rate mortgages, now jumping to market rates, that helped to fuel one of the largest housing booms in American history.
Though they may not fear for their jobs or worry about long-range financial health -- national polls show a general satisfaction with the economy -- their kitchen-counter economy is an increasing source of everyday anxiety.
 In Brandon and other suburbs of Tampa, where gas prices are among the highest in the nation and home insurance rates have risen since last summer's hurricanes, residents say they have had all they can take. 
 ''We're really worried about a lot of things,'' said Nancy Tuttle, co-owner of a vending machine business in the suburbs here. ''The cost of gas, the cost of house insurance, the cost of medical insurance, it's just everything.'' 
 The increase in prices, particularly of gasoline, is taking a political toll on President Bush, even in a Republican area like these suburbs. A recent nationwide CBS News poll found that only 33 percent of those surveyed approved of Mr. Bush's job performance and that 74 percent disapproved of his handling of the gasoline issue. 
 ''We went from totally believing in Bush to really having our doubts,'' said Wayne Toomey, who owns a house with Ms. Tuttle in the nearby suburb of Parrish. ''It comes down to his lack of care about gas prices.''
 Ms. Tuttle, 51, and Mr. Toomey, 58, have each gotten smaller cars and have cut some household costs. ''It's a total struggle,'' said Mr. Toomey, who owns the vending machine business with Ms. Tuttle. ''You would have to have your head in the sand to think things are going well in the United States.''
 Further, millions of Americans who have financed their homes with adjustable-rate short-term mortgages -- some of which require interest-only payments -- are starting to see their monthly payments rise as low introductory rates expire and market rates kick in.
 ''I just cringe every time I get that bill,'' said Mindi Davis, 35, who took out an adjustable-rate second mortgage two years ago for the home she shares with her husband and two children here. The bill, which was $100 a month in May 2004, is now $219 a month and climbing. ''I anticipated an increase,'' Mrs. Davis said, ''just not this much that quickly.''
 Brian Wrage, who lives in Tampa, said he had begun to unload his investment properties in part because of the adjustable-rate mortgages attached to them. ''My second mortgage on one property started at 5.7, and by the time we sold it three years later it was 9.9,'' Mr. Wrage said. ''It was eye-opening: adjustable rate means up.''
 The rising costs have contributed to a 38 percent increase nationally in home foreclosures in the first quarter of this year over the same period in 2005. Florida had the second-largest number of foreclosures in the nation during that period -- 29,636 -- behind Texas, which had 40,236. Of the Florida foreclosures, 195 were in Brandon.
 ''Normally, nothing is a better predictor of foreclosures than high unemployment and credit card delinquencies,'' said Rick Sharga, a vice president of RealtyTrac Inc., an online foreclosure marketplace, which tracked the foreclosure data. ''But what most people are talking about isn't any of that now. We think adjustable-rate increases coupled with a slowdown in the price appreciation and the demand of houses is why we are starting to see a fairly significant increase in the foreclosure rates generally now.''
 Foreclosure rates have been at historic lows since 2002 because of low interest rates and high housing demand. But soaring home prices and flat wages are now causing trouble for many families, especially those who took out below-market introductory mortgages a few years ago and are now paying the piper. 
 This is true even in a place like Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa and most of its suburbs, where the unemployment rate trails the national average, job growth remains strong and business costs are among the lowest in the nation.
 Further, following a requirement three years ago by the federal comptroller of the currency to raise minimum monthly payments on credit cards, some banks have recently gone as far as to double those payments. 
 ''People who are living beyond their means are going to have a harder time making ends meet than ever in history,'' Mr. Sharga said.
 [Economic data released Friday showed that hourly wages had risen slightly faster than inflation over the last year, though they have basically matched the inflation rate since 2002. Although the consumer confidence index compiled by the Conference Board reached a four-year high last week, other polls, including one released by Ipsos on Friday, showed confidence sinking.]
 And then there is the story of gasoline, which in Florida now averages $3 to $3.45 a gallon. 
 ''I don't even like my job, but I can't face lowering my pay'' because of rising gas costs, said Nia Baker, 37, who sells home health products. ''I used to fill my car up once a week for $25, and now I fill up twice a week for $40. I feel like the economy is pretty bad, the way these gas prices are going up. ''
 Denise Meicher, 50, gets by on her pension from a former career and her job as a customer service specialist. But high gasoline prices have caused her to curtail her activities and close her pocketbook a bit more. 
 ''It is 60 miles round trip to visit my family,'' Ms. Meicher said. ''It costs me a half a tank of gas and maybe $15 when it used to be $8. I give it a second thought now when the family says, 'Let's do this or that.' We are real close, but now I feel like I am saying 'yes' maybe two out of every three times these days.''
 Gasoline prices also have a ripple effect. Debi Martinez said her husband's homebuilding business had been hurt as contractors passed on costs. 
 ''The guy who does his septic tank wants $500 more because of gas prices,'' said Ms. Martinez, 49. ''There was a $75 increase on the man who does the wallboard. We are no longer a seller's market.''
 In Florida, insurance companies have increased rates as much as 40 percent in coastal areas, after a bruising hurricane season in 2005 left many insurers liable for billions of dollars in claims. Residents in other states have also been affected; in New York, Allstate recently said it would drop 28,000 policyholders in eight counties, citing risk. 
 ''Our homeowner's insurance went up $400 a year within the last year due to the hurricanes,'' Ms. Baker said.
 Not everyone, however, sees the same shadow over their personal economy. Steve Adams was a rare bird in the strip mall here, a person who thinks people should stop complaining about gasoline prices, which have been high in other countries for years, and about mortgages that are attached to homes that have soared in value.
 ''The key thing about this area is there is a lot of opportunity,'' said Mr. Adams, who is a project manager in an accounting firm and lives with his wife and two small children. ''The job market here is great, the costs are relatively low, and my property value has gone up $100,000. Compared to the European economy, where gas prices have also been sky high, well, welcome to the whole world.''

HEADLINE: Pressure Builds to Revive Wind Farm Plan for Nantucket Sound

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
The Bush administration and the senior members of the Senate energy committee are urging Congress to revive a proposal for the nation's first large offshore wind farm, in Nantucket Sound south of Cape Cod. 
 Last month, a Senate-House conference committee inserted a provision in the Coast Guard budget bill to give the governor of ''the adjacent state,'' Massachusetts, veto power over any wind farm in the sound.
The governor, Mitt Romney, a Republican who will step down at the end of this term, opposes the wind farm, as do most candidates running to succeed him.
 In a letter on Thursday, the under secretary of energy, David K. Garman, said the provision would ''inhibit the development of this clean, domestic, renewable energy resource.'' Mr. Garman noted that President Bush had endorsed wind energy.
 Mr. Garman said New England power suppliers were counting on the project and added that singling it out ''could have a chilling impact on the continued investment and growth of this promising renewable energy resource.''
 The senior senators, Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and the panel's ranking Democrat, Jeff Bingaman, also of New Mexico, told Senate leaders in a letter Wednesday that unless the provision was deleted they would seek to prevent a vote on the Coast Guard bill as a whole. 
 They said it would be ''unwise for the Congress to intervene statutorily'' in reviews for energy projects. 
 ''It is particularly objectionable to subject the development and implementation of national energy policy on submerged federal lands to the caprice of an individual state governor,'' they said. 
 The site, 24 square miles between Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, is unusual in that it is federal land surrounded by state waters. The project, proposed by Cape Wind Associates, a private business, would have 130 turbines in a grid. Each tower, with its turbines and blades, would rise 420 feet above the water. 
 Cape Wind says that the project could generate three-quarters of the electricity now used on the cape and islands and that the plan has won the support of many environmental groups and lawmakers.
 But many Massachusetts politicians of both parties have long objected to the plan. They say Nantucket Sound, a major attraction in a tourism-based economy, is a poor site for a large industrial installation. Other critics argue that nothing so elaborate should be allowed on federal waters until the government had established better regulations. Charles Vinick, president of the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, which formed to oppose the plan, said in an interview that the question was not whether wind power should be pursued but rather whether the sound was the right place for it. 
 Mr. Vinick said the towers would pose risks to boat and air traffic and would interfere with fishing.
 ''It is an inappropriate site for a project of this nature,'' he said, ''and that is what is holding back wind energy. What we need is a project we can all rally behind because it is a good project.''

 BODY:
LAST week, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, testified before Congress that the Fed might pause after the next rate increase even if the economy heated up a bit. The markets, as markets do in the short term, went nuts and traded stocks up on the assumption that the Fed was planning to suspend rate increases indefinitely.
 Last Saturday, Maria Bartiromo of CNBC ran into Mr. Bernanke at the White House Correspondents Association dinner, and casually asked him whether the market reaction was appropriate. He said it was not, and Ms. Bartiromo reported it. The markets, as markets do in the short term, went nuts and traded stocks down on the assumption that rate increases would continue indefinitely. 
But Mr. Bernanke never said what the markets apparently thought he said. News reports and a video, at www.house.gov/jec/archived.ram, showed him to have said that there was ''the possibility that if there is sufficient uncertainty, that we may choose to pause, simply to gain more information to learn better what the true risks are and how the economy is actually evolving.''
 Minutes after the testimony, Greg Robb of MarketWatch (marketwatch.com) reported that Mr. Bernanke ''stressed that a pause might not signal the end of rate hikes'' after the expected quarter-point increase next week.
 After so many years of the inscrutable Alan Greenspan, a little overreaction to Mr. Bernanke's relative plainspokeness is not surprising. But in the wake of Ms. Bartiromo's ''scoop,'' it was not stock traders who came in for criticism, it was Ms. Bartiromo. ''It is not her job to move markets,'' one anonymous CNBC staffer wrote to the TvNewser blog at mediabistro.com. As for Mr. Bernanke, ''A Fed chair who blabs at parties needs to stop going to parties,'' decided Duncan Black, keeper of the Eschaton blog at atrios.blogspot.com.
 James Hamilton, an economics professor at the University of California, San Diego, offers a perspective on his blog at econbrowser.com. Imagine, he writes, that Mr. Bernanke were simply an unknown economic analyst:
 ''My reaction, in that hypothetical, would be: (1) this guy is really sharp and knows exactly what he's talking about; and (2) he's honestly calling attention to the uncertainties in forming a forecast and policy prescription as to what comes next.''

DOWN AND OUT IN TORONTO -- This week, Jan Wong, a columnist for The Globe and Mail of Toronto, taking a page from the author Barbara Ehrenreich, wrapped up a month of working as a maid for less than Ontario's minimum wage while living with her children in a low-rent apartment. Her four-part series is available, with pictures and a discussion section, at globeandmail.com.
 The series starts in a filthy bathroom of a professional couple in Toronto and ends with Ms. Wong seeking treatment for the carpal tunnel syndrome that she, like 80 percent of professional cleaners, has developed. In between, she meets people -- ''jerks,'' she calls them -- who seem incapable of seeing maids as human beings. She also encounters people, most of them fellow low-income earners, who can only be described as heroic. 
 Response has varied, she writes in her final column. One woman thought she recognized herself as a particularly odious client depicted in the series, and fired the maid service Ms. Wong worked for. ''Yet,'' she writes, ''I also know readers have spontaneously given out raises, offered tips and thoughtfully cleared their counters of clutter. They've started saying thank you.''

BACK TO BERNANKE -- The Columbia Business School's spring follies created a video spoof (youtube.com) of the classic Police song ''Every Breath You Take.'' An actor portrays R. Glenn Hubbard, the dean, who was passed up for chairman of the Federal Reserve. Like Sting, ''Hubbard'' is creepily obsessed -- not with a girl, but with Ben Bernanke. ''When demand then dips/and the yield curve flips'' go the lyrics, ''I'll be watching you.''
 The video is ''the best economics humor ever,'' declared Steven D. Levitt on freakonomics.com/blog. DAN MITCHELL

HEADLINE: Big Builder of Luxury Homes Says Business Is Off 29% 

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, May 5 

 BODY:
Toll Brothers, the builder of luxury homes, said on Friday that signed contracts for its homes fell 29 percent in the second quarter and that home deliveries for the year would be 200 lower than expected as the housing market began to slow. 
 After five years of explosive growth, the housing market is in the grip of a slowdown prompted by rising mortgage rates and higher inventories.
''It's pretty much what we had thought,'' said William Mack, a home building analyst for Standard & Poor's. ''Things are slowing and at a pretty rapid rate.'' 
 But shares of Toll Brothers and other home builders rose yesterday because a weaker-than-projected jobs report for April was seen on Wall Street as giving the Federal Reserve less incentive to raise interest rates. That would slow the rise of mortgage rates.
 While sales of new homes rose 13.8 percent nationally in March, the median price of homes sold dipped 2.2 percent as builders cut prices. Sales of existing homes edged up in March, but the backlog of unsold homes hit a record high, according to the National Association of Realtors.
 Even Toll Brothers, whose well-heeled customers are less vulnerable to economic winds, is not immune.
 For the second quarter, Toll said signed contracts came in at $1.56 billion, down from last year's $2.2 billion. Its backlog rose 3 percent to $6.07 billion from $5.87 billion in 2005. The biggest declines in signed contracts were on the East Coast.
 Toll predicted it would deliver 9,000 to 9,700 homes in fiscal 2006, a decline of 200 homes from its previous outlook.
 Other home builders are feeling the pinch as well.
 On Tuesday, Hovnanian Enterprises lowered its outlook for the second quarter and the year. Hovnanian cited cancellations, slowing sales, higher material costs and increased concessions and incentives.
 Another builder, the Centex Corporation, recently said its new orders fell 11 percent in the fourth quarter. The company also scaled down its earnings forecast for 2007. Pulte Homes and Beazer Homes USA also said new orders fell during the quarter.
 Toll Brothers attributed the drop in contracts and deliveries to fewer speculative buyers, more cancellations from nonspeculative buyers and weaker demand from those worried about the direction of home prices.
 The cancellation rate over the quarter was 8.5 percent, higher than Toll's historic average of about 7 percent.
 ''Speculative buyers are no longer fueling demand,'' said Robert I. Toll, the company's chairman and chief executive. ''Instead, they're putting the homes they've recently acquired back on the market or are canceling contracts in midconstruction.''

HEADLINE: A Summer Idyll (Never Mind the Tonton Macoutes)

BYLINE: By LESLIE CAMHI

 BODY:
IMAGINE Charlotte Rampling as the queen bee in a coterie of middle-aged, single white women enjoying the favors of beautiful Haitian beach boys at a secluded resort outside of Port-au-Prince in the late 1970's. Just beyond its doors, Tonton Macoutes, the Duvalier-era militia, are terrorizing the population. But Ms. Rampling's Ellen and her friends idle away the summer, dreaming of love and paying for it in dollars. On its surface, ''Heading South,'' the latest film by the French writer and director Laurent Cantet, might be mistaken for a tale of sordid sexual exploitation of the poor by the rich. But Mr. Cantet's sympathies are more complex. 
 ''The film doesn't side with the Haitians,'' he said, over a hotel breakfast in Manhattan when ''Heading South'' was being shown in Lincoln Center's Rendez-Vous With French Cinema series this spring. (It opens in New York on July 7.) ''I try instead to show the complicity of needs at work in these amorous relationships. Take Legba'' -- Ellen's 18-year-old favorite, played by Menothy Cesar -- ''outside of the resort, he's treated like a dog. He arrives there, and suddenly these women are tender with him, listen to him, look at him as a man and desire him. For him it's proof that he exists as a human being. And that's much more important than the $10 bills they slip into his pocket from time to time.''
Mr. Cantet prefers to let his images speak for themselves. ''For me, the political side of the film is always present, even in the juxtaposition of bodies,'' he explained. ''Ellen with Legba is such a highly charged image -- all the world's divisions are right there. But you have to figure it out for yourself.''
 ''Heading South,'' which Mr. Cantet and his co-writer, Robin Campillo, adapted from three stories by the Haitian-born Canadian novelist Dany Laferriere, marks something of a departure for Mr. Cantet. Now 44, he earned a reputation as among the most socially aware of young French filmmakers with psychologically astute investigations of the largely masculine worlds of unionized labor and the modern corporate workplace.
 ''Human Resources'' (1999), his first feature, probed the tender spot where class dynamics meet the family romance, as a young business school graduate (Jalil Lespert) becomes a manager in the provincial factory where his father has worked on the assembly line for 30 years, and receives an order to begin laying off employees. ''Time Out'' (2001) followed a recently fired business executive (Aurelien Recoing) who constructs an elaborate tissue of lies to hide his unemployment from his family.
 ''From the very beginning, Laurent has pursued the same obsession, which is that his characters are looking for their place in society and unable to find it,'' said Caroline Benjo, the co-producer on all of Mr. Cantet's features, speaking by telephone from Paris. ''At the same time, he's always questioning the horror of an economic system in which, if you don't perform, whether it's financially, sexually or affectively, you're seen as subhuman.''
 And if Mr. Cantet's earlier films lifted the veil on the world of work, ''Heading South'' charts a similarly under-represented cinematic territory -- the intimate domain of midlife feminine sexual desperation. Karen Young (better known here for her role as Agent Robyn Sanseverino in ''The Sopranos'') plays Brenda, an American who arrives in Haiti freighted with the emotional weight of an affair she had with Legba three years earlier, and stumbles into the surrounding violence.
 ''In an American film,'' Ms. Young said over coffee in New York, ''Brenda would be an object of ridicule or punished for her desires. Instead, she undergoes this incredible transformation.''
 Mr. Cantet first traveled to Haiti in 2001 to visit his parents, retired teachers who were temporarily stationed there as volunteers in a nongovernmental organization. ''I remember feeling that I was the only foreigner, and especially the only white person, who had nothing to do there,'' he recalled. ''And I immediately thought there was a film to be made about the position of the tourist.
 ''There's a scene toward the end of 'Heading South' when a policeman says to Ellen, 'Tourists never die.' It's his way of refusing her any role in the story which has just come to pass. That's what made such a deep impression upon me during that first trip -- that I risked nothing in being there, and that that impunity made it impossible for me to play any role whatsoever in what was happening around me.''
 On the plane back to Paris, he read Mr. Laferriere's 1997 book of stories, ''La Chair du Maitre'' (''The Master's Flesh''), where he found the kaleidoscopic quality of Port-au-Prince reflected.
 ''It's a place where anything can happen at any moment,'' said Mr. Cantet, who returned to the Haitian capital half-a-dozen times for casting and location scouting. ''You leave your hotel one morning and have the most amazing encounter, and the next day people are spitting on you, and the day after, you turn right and people are shooting at each other. And then, there are these magnificent neighborhoods, filled with a languorous atmosphere, and right next door people are living in sordid shacks and dying of hunger. And all of this coexists, without relationship. I wanted the film to have that feeling of a very arbitrary reality.''
 It's a reality that erupted brutally during 10 days of filming in 2004, when Mr. Cantet and his small crew found themselves caught in a crossfire between the police and private militias in downtown Port-au-Prince. (The film's resort scenes were done in the nearby Dominican Republic.) And it's a reality his white characters work hard, albeit unsuccessfully, to ignore.
 ''They're trying to protect themselves from that sense of impotence you have as a tourist,'' Mr. Cantet explained. ''The resort is their little dream world. Of course they're lying to themselves. But I like to risk following characters in all their errors and paradoxes, and little by little, watching those paradoxes crumble.''
 Mr. Cantet's new project is likely to spawn more controversy -- a fiction film starring nonprofessional actors and based on interviews with the survivors of Hurricane Katrina. He recognizes the difficulties for a director of working in foreign territory, but that's part of what appeals to him. 
 ''I'm attracted to what is elsewhere,'' he acknowledged. ''I find it difficult to shoot landscapes -- human landscapes -- or places that feel too familiar to me. I'm always drawn toward what I don't understand.''

HEADLINE: You're Rich? Terrific. Now Pay Up.

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
I GAVE a speech in Orlando, Fla., late last month to some private-equity folks who said that business was great. Then I flew up to Newark and the first-class section of the plane was full, and even had a waiting list. Then I rode into New York City in a blizzard of limousines, and ate dinner with my sister and her husband at a Greek place called Milos, on West 55th Street. Fresh swordfish, and it was heavenly. The place was expensive and packed.
 It was a fine evening, apparently the first in the city for weeks, and men and women were in outdoor cafes, eating, drinking, winking, smiling and flirting. A few were shouting, ''Bueller! Bueller!'' at me as I passed. I walked by a stunning woman in front of the Peninsula who giggled as she saw me. I walked down to the Yale Club on Vanderbilt, where men and women looked happy and assured under the portraits of presidents -- the Bushes and Clinton. 
On my way back, two young men accosted me in front of Rockefeller Center. They told me they were recent Yale graduates who were making a great living working at hedge funds. They told me that their boss made $100 million a year trading currencies, and that there were dozens like him making more money than I could imagine. (I have my doubts, but that's what they said.)
 Suddenly, as the men happily walked away from me, I had a vision. Here we all are under the gorgeous crystal dome of prosperity, drinking, making money, eating swordfish, changing money at the temple, showing off ourselves to others, bragging -- and all of it, every bit of it, is made possible by the men and women who wear the uniform. 
 Every bit of it is done under the protection of the Marines, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Coast Guard, serving and offering up their lives for pennies. And we're also under the protection of the police and the firefighters and the F.B.I., who offer up their lives for nothing compared with what others make trading money on computer screens.
 Something flashed into my mind -- something that my late father used to say, quoting loosely from the economist Henry C. Simons, a founder of the Chicago School of economics: that it is ''unlovely'' to see the extremes of wealth and nonwealth that are evident in contemporary America. 
 We may be able to live with it. Some of us may even be able to prosper amid it. But it's not pretty. The rich should simply not be that much richer than everyone else -- especially those whose lives protect them from terrorism.
 As I thought that, I had a revelation about oil. We all know -- and I mean all, even Congress -- that the oil companies are not fixing prices. We all know that the oil companies are not creating these wild prices out of thin air. 
 The worldwide market is at work, and traders and speculators are driving up the price, based on uncertainty of supplies and inventories, and presumably becoming very rich in the process (at least some of them). That's the market at work. It's not up to the government to set the price or to fix the situation except by opening more space for exploration, and even that may not help. 
 In the same way, even I was startled when I read about the pay of Lee R. Raymond, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, who recently retired. His retirement package was in the neighborhood of $400 million -- a breathtaking sum, even for those of us who admire the job that Big Oil does and think that the industry gets a bum rap. 
 Still, that's between him and his stockholders, not a matter for Congress. And it would not even remotely be addressed by a windfall profits tax -- an idea that has been tried and has failed miserably.
 The real problem is the difference between the rich -- including rich oil people, of whom there are not many, but there are enough -- and the poor. It is up to the government to redress this extraordinary difference in incomes of the rich and the nonrich, even at the margins. 
 What Congress can do, and should do, is address the stunning underpayment of military men and women and the staggering budget deficits that will be a burden on our posterity for decades, by raising the taxes on the rich. It's fine that there are rich people. It's even fine that there are superrich people. 
 But if they are superrich, they derive special benefits from life in the United States that the nonrich don't. For one thing, they can make the money in a safe environment, which is not true for the rich in many countries. It is just common decency that they should pay much higher income taxes than they do. Taxes for the rich are lower than they have been since at least World War II -- that is to say, in 60 years.
 This makes no sense in a world at war, in a nation with so many unmet social needs, in a nation with so many people without health care, in a nation running immense and endless deficits. 
 America is becoming a nation of many rich people. I recently read that there were close to 10 million millionaire households. I read that there were hundreds of thousands who made more than $1 million a year. Good for them. 
 But it's unlovely for them to pay as little tax as they now pay. The real problem in this country is only temporarily about oil. That will right itself, or we'll get used to it and adjust. 
 The real problem is saving a nation that is beset by terrorism, and we cannot do that unless we feel that we are all in the same boat, pulling at the oars together. That includes the rich. 
 Whatever rationale there may have been in 2001 for lowering their taxes is long gone. It's time for them -- us, because it includes me -- to pay their (our) share. 
 It's not about oil. It's about fairness.

We're planning a trip to France. Is it best to arrange to rent a car before we leave or when we arrive? And should we buy our rail passes in the United States or in France? -- Ron and Isabel Lieberman, Kinzers, Pa.
 
 It is always best to book and pay before you leave home when you are renting a car. This can often save you on the standard rate and guarantee price and availability. Shop for advance purchase, holiday packages, weekend rates and fly-drive deals.
Rail passes are typically available only to nonresidents and must be bought in the United States or Canada before you depart. Consider a France Rail 'n' Drive Pass which combines two days' car rental with two days of first-class train travel within a month. You can buy additional car and rail days (but only at the time of booking; you can't do it later in France). Information: www.raileurope.com/us/rail/passes/france--index.htm.
 Price depends on which of six car categories you choose. Neither car rental days nor train travel days need be consecutive. Thus you could take the train from Paris to Avignon, pick up a car on one day and leave the car off in, say, Marseille, where you could spend a few days before moving on. You have unlimited train travel on each rail travel day, and unlimited mileage on each car day. Starting price (with an Avis economy car) for two adults is $450. Each extra day of car rental costs $39, and you can buy up to three additional days of train travel. For maps and driving instructions visit www.viamichelin.fr or www.mappy.fr.
 Rail Europe, a subsidiary of SNCF, the French National Railroad (www.sncf.com), offers an array of options like Paris Visite (unlimited travel on Metro and bus) and the Paris Museum Pass. You may want to consider a France Railpass, which allows you any four days (with an option to buy an additional six days) of unlimited train travel within a one-month period. For first-class travel you will pay $269 and $35 for each extra day. There are senior and youth versions, offering discounts of up to 30 percent. A France Railpass entitles you to reduced fares on international high-speed trains, such as Eurostar and the TGV. 
 You can buy individual country passes (and two-country passes) for rail travel across Europe.

HEADLINE: The Least Affordable Place to Live? Try Salinas

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
IN 2005, the least-affordable place in the country to live, measured by the percentage of income devoted to mortgage payments, was Salinas, Calif.
 The second was the Santa Cruz-Watsonville area of California.
The third? Santa Rosa-Petaluma, Calif.
 In fact, California has the distinction of having the 11 least-affordable metropolitan areas in the country. One would need to go all the way down to 12th place -- and across the country to the New York region's northern suburbs -- to find a non-California metropolitan area on the least-affordable list of 2005.
 Much of California is pretty. It has beaches and the mountains and, of course, the weather. But why are places like Salinas, which is surrounded by agriculture, topping places like Honolulu (No. 17) and Miami (No. 22) on the out-of-reach list?
 There is no one answer, but demographers and public planners who study such trends say that a confluence of factors in California -- both artificial and natural -- have combined to create a particularly acute problem. 
 ''California has both political and geographical constraints on building,'' said Dowell Myers, professor of policy, planning and development at the University of Southern California. ''That drives up prices, and then it snowballs.''
 The geographical limits on developable land are the hills and the coast, while the political restrictions are state and local regulations that prevent building new homes, in response to both environmental and congestion concerns.
 ''One of the key factors here is the basic law of supply and demand,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''California is in marked contrast to Florida, where you can expand without constraint. It's more like the New York suburbs, where too many dollars are chasing too few homes.''
 While many states have regulations on growth, California is a leader, Dean Hughes says.
 California is also in the forefront of population growth, but it is not driven, as might be expected, by envious Easterners and Midwesterners escaping snowbound winters. Nor is it driven by long-term Californians. In fact, census figures show that over the past decade, more people have left California -- emigrating to neighboring states like Nevada and Arizona and farther away, to Texas and Florida -- than have moved in from other parts of the country. 
 The population increase is driven primarily by births and foreign immigration. According to census statistics, from April 2000 to July 2005, California experienced a net natural increase -- taking into account births and deaths -- of 1.5 million people.
 And an additional 1.4 million moved in from other countries.
 While California's birth rate is not the highest in the nation -- Utah's is -- it is near the top.
 ''New York has the constraints but doesn't have the population growth,'' Professor Myers said. ''Florida has the population growth but doesn't have the constraints.'' 
 While it is difficult to build new houses in California, that isn't to say none are going up. According to the California Association of Realtors, there have been increases in the number of housing units built over the past nine years -- from 94,283 in 1996 to 207,154 in 2005.
 That is substantially more than the low in 1993, when California was in the throes of a severe economic recession and only 84,656 units were built. But it's not as prolific as in 1988, when 255,559 went up.
 There are a number of reasons for the restraints on home building, including the fact that many desirable areas in the state are already ''built out'' and the permit process is more complex and drawn out now than it was a few decades ago.
 Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the Realtors group, said the state needs about 250,000 units a year to meet housing demand. ''We've been below that every year over the past 10 years,'' she said.
 The high demand and low supply created a perfect breeding ground for investors and speculators, which became ''the last straw'' in driving housing prices up, said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.
 Another quintessentially California issue is Proposition 13, the 1978 measure that slashed property taxes by more than 50 percent and ignited a national property tax revolution.
 The measure, which was supposed to facilitate home buying, has backfired to some extent; local governments prefer that land be used for retailing rather than housing because they collect more from sales taxes than from property taxes.
 ''Proposition 13 is a big stop sign saying 'no housing needed,' '' said Peter Dreier, professor of public policy at Occidental College in Los Angeles and an author of ''Place Matters: Metropolitics for the 21st Century'' (University Press of Kansas, 2001). ''Every municipality is engaged in a bidding war for retail -- they're battling for Wal-Mart, to keep the libraries open.''
 It is unlikely that will change, Professor Dreier and others say, calling Proposition 13 ''the third rail of government -- it's untouchable.''
 Although it is no surprise that house prices have gone through the roof in places like Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, what is more unexpected is that less-popular areas away from the coast are also topping the list of least-affordable places to live.
 ''There's a huge movement away from L.A. County and from San Francisco and the great beneficiary is the Inland Empire'' in Southern California, and in Sacramento and points east in northern California, said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution.
 The migration is happening both among high-skilled and middle-class residents, as well as low-skilled and lower-class ones, so the cost of housing is exploding even in areas of the state that most people do not think of as traditionally expensive, he said.
 ''Baby boomers are getting older and moving into the higher-income bracket and into the top-dollar markets,'' Professor Myers said. ''Immigrants have high ownership rates at the bottom of the market. It's a recipe for a bubble.''
 These noncoastal communities are no longer simply attached to established cities, but in many cases have become job centers in their own right, Ms. Appleton-Young said.
 The Inland Empire, made up of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, has been in a 30-year transition from a bedroom suburb to a metropolitan area, she said.
 ''People are now working where they live,'' Ms. Appleton-Young said. ''It's not a commuter area.''
 The San Joaquin Valley, in central California, on the other hand, still has a way to go to attract an educated work force and to create a diverse and thriving economy. But Ms. Appleton-Young said it appears to be following in the footsteps of the Inland Empire: ''As we say, jobs follow housing.''
 The final paradox in this state of paradoxes is that traditionally, many Californians are not homeowners; the state ranks 48th, behind only New York and Hawaii, in terms of homeownership, and about 10 percent below the national average. But over the past several years, even as housing prices have increased, more people are buying. 
 Home sales climbed fairly steadily from 1996 through 2005, with only a slight downward blip in 2001, said the California Realtors' association. 
 Hans Johnson, a demographer with the nonprofit Public Policy Institute of California, said, ''It's counterintuitive.'' But apparently typical. Those familiar with home-purchasing trends say that people buy when the market is going up, not when it is going down.
 If houses are so costly, how are people managing to make the leap and become homeowners? 
 In some cases, they use methods of financing that were not previously available, Mr. Johnson said. Instead of fixed-rate 30-year mortgages, they take, for example, variable-rate interest-only loans, which have lower monthly payments. 
 In many cases, he said, homeowners are paying far more on mortgages than the 30 percent of income recommended by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
 A study by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 40 percent of all households in California, the most anywhere, exceeded this recommended threshold. ''In some cases, they're even paying more than half,'' Mr. Johnson said.
 New homeowners are buying smaller homes or condominiums; according to the study, only 15 percent of long-term homeowners in California live in multifamily housing units, like condominiums, while 26 percent of recent buyers do.
 ''In some ways it's good, because people own a house and have equity,'' he said. ''In other ways it's bad,'' he explained, because ''if interest rates go up, there will be a large increase in monthly rates.'' 
 ''If there's a bubble that bursts or slowly leaks,'' he added, overextended owners may not be able to sell and recover enough to pay off the loan. 
 Professor Dreier of Occidental College said he also blamed state government and business leaders for failing to support the creation of moderate-priced housing -- not just for low-income residents, but also for middle-class people, like teachers and nurses, who cannot buy into the overheated housing market.
 When he was a city official in Boston, the state government, businessmen and bankers ''understood that affordable housing was part of a healthy work force,'' Professor Dreier said. ''In California, businesses and the Chambers of Commerce have not embraced housing issues like they have embraced other issues, such as health care. We won't see the political will to solve the housing crisis until the organized business community weighs in and says it's unacceptable.''
 The big question now is whether the housing market will deflate while the economy stays strong, which would enable more Californians to buy. The answer seems as elusive as predicting the next earthquake. 
 The signs point toward a slowdown: interest rates are going up, and investors and speculators, who drove up prices by buying and selling houses, seem to be pulling back in hot markets nationally. But everyone, even those who study the subject, knows it is dangerous to predict. 
 Ask Professor Myers of U.S.C., who sold his house in Los Angeles last year. ''I was convinced it was going to peak,'' he said. ''After I sold, it rose another 15 percent.''

HEADLINE: One Family, Two Jobs and Homes in Separate Cities

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
FOR most couples, the idea of a second home evokes images of walks on the beach or mountain vacations. But sometimes, making the decision to acquire a second piece of real estate has nothing to do with leisure and everything to do with work. 
 When couples see their careers move along divergent paths, and sometimes to different cities, the hard choices begin. And at a time when both partners are likely to have jobs that are personally rewarding and financially necessary, uprooting one to accommodate the other is often not an option.
The solutions are seldom easy -- and children only complicate the issue -- as couples confront both the emotional strains of spending time apart and the burden of additional housing costs, often in expensive urban markets. Some choose to play it safe by renting a small apartment in the new city, while others see the relocation as an investment opportunity. 
 Dick Senechal, an architect, moved to New York City from Plano, Tex., a suburb of Dallas, in March 2005, to take a job as senior vice president of facilities for Loews Hotels, a job in which he oversees design, construction and renovation of hotels. He rented a 650-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment on East 56th Street. His wife, Mary, decided to stay in Plano, in their 6,000-square-foot, five-bedroom home, with five bathrooms, two half baths and a swimming pool. 
 When he took the job with Loews, the Senechals calculated the carrying costs on a medium-size Manhattan apartment or suburban house, and they found that they would have been about the same as the combined carrying costs of their house in Texas and a more modest New York rental.
 ''For twice what we had in our house in Texas, we were looking at small one-bedroom apartments in New York or two-bedroom houses in Westchester or New Jersey, starter houses, far out,'' Mr. Senechal said. ''It turned out to be more economical to keep the house in Texas and rent a small place in the city and go back and forth.'' 
 Now, the Senechals are buying a one-bedroom apartment in a co-op building on East 71st Street for $490,000. Mr. Senechal said the apartment has about 750 square feet of space, with a nice kitchen and a functional layout, two things that are important to him. He said they decided to buy now that he has settled into his job and has come to enjoy living in New York (he likes being able to walk to work). He has been paying about $2,900 a month to rent. The monthly mortgage and maintenance payments for the new apartment will be virtually the same. 
 The Senechals' real estate agent, Lew Schneider of Bellmarc Realty, said that part of his job was to familiarize the couple in a short time with the New York market, including pricing variations between neighborhoods and the intricacies of the co-op application process.
 ''They needed to be educated, what I call my Real Estate 101,'' Mr. Schneider said. 
 To remain close despite the distance, it is important for the Senechals to see each other often. He estimates that he is in Texas every third weekend, while Mrs. Senechal comes to New York about once a month, for about 10 days at a time. They go to shows and museums together. 
 ''This has been a real adventure for us in our advancing years,'' said Mr. Senechal, who is 58. Mrs. Senechal said she enjoys her life in Plano, going to the nearby country club and playing tennis. She said she didn't want to downsize to a New York apartment, although she acknowledged that the long-distance arrangement was ''not perfect.'' 
 ''If we were much younger and had small children, I wouldn't do this,'' she added. ''But with retirement down the road and me not wanting to relocate to New York completely, this works. We're making it work.''
 Kimberly Howard and Edison Peinado bought a one-bedroom apartment on Golden Gate Avenue in the North Panhandle neighborhood of San Francisco last June for what she described as ''$650,000, an arm and a leg and our first born.'' 
 But Ms. Howard, a marketing director at Infonetics Research, a market research firm in Campbell, near San Jose, has spent far more time in the apartment than her husband. Mr. Peinado has spent the last year and a half in Farmington, N.M., studying to become a commercial pilot. He completed his studies in December, took a job with the Mesa Air Group in February and next month will start flying routes from Chicago. 
 ''I get so many people telling me, 'This must be so hard on you; I feel so sorry for you,' '' Ms. Howard said. ''And I say, it's actually kind of nice.'' Ms. Howard said that both she and her husband have an independent streak that makes them appreciate time spent apart. 
 ''For us it works great,'' she said. ''His schedule will be four days on, four days off or a week on, a week off. If you're not around each other every day, those little things like putting the cap back on the toothpaste or putting the toilet seat down or taking the garbage out, those things don't matter as much.''
 Ms. Howard, 38, and Mr. Peinado, 32, pay about $3,100 a month in mortgage and property taxes on their San Francisco apartment, which she found with the help of Allison Kalhammer, a friend and a real estate agent with Pacific Union GMAC Real Estate. 
 While Mr. Peinado was in school, he shared a two-bedroom apartment in Farmington, with his part of the rent about $270 a month. He and his wife had initially expected that each would travel to visit the other regularly, but they both love San Francisco, so it was mostly Mr. Peinado who went back and forth, usually returning home for a couple of long weekends a month. 
 Even with the relatively low cost of housing in Farmington, Ms. Howard said that because they were living on a single income, maintaining two households while Mr. Peinado was in aviation school presented a challenge. But it was a sacrifice that will now start to pay off. ''I just look at it as his salary will be a bonus,'' she said.
 Once Mr. Peinado begins to work out of Chicago, Ms. Howard said, he will rent what pilots and flight attendants call a ''crash pad,'' a kind of communal rental, where airline crew members typically pay about $150 to $200 a month for a bed in a house or apartment near the airport. 
 Eventually, Ms. Howard said, they would like to buy a residence in Chicago, or wherever Mr. Peinado may be based in the future. That will give him a comfortable place to stay, and they could also rent the property out, crash pad style, to other crew members. 
 Karen V. Peterson and her husband, Richard C. Peterson, spent about two years trying to balance a life split between two careers and two homes. In 2000, the Petersons were living in Bernardsville, N.J., when Mr. Peterson began working for Banco Popular and spending much of his time at the bank's offices in Chicago. The next year, he was promoted to a position as head of community banking and the company asked him to relocate to Chicago.
 But their son, David, was happy in school in New Jersey and Ms. Peterson had a successful career as a real estate agent. So Mr. Peterson, who is an executive vice president, began commuting home on weekends. 
 They considered buying a house or apartment for him in the Chicago area, but they were unfamiliar with the market and concerned both about the direction that prices were headed and the impact on their finances of adding a second mortgage. Instead of buying or renting an apartment, Mr. Peterson stayed at hotel-like guest rooms at the Union League Club. 
 But Ms. Peterson said that while they worked hard to adjust to the new arrangement, it inevitably became a strain. Even the one-hour time difference between New Jersey and Chicago caused problems. 
 ''He would call just as we were settling down for the evening and I was exhausted from work and being a single parent and whatever responsibilities I had,'' she said. ''You're tired and don't feel like connecting on the phone and we did. But then it starts to get a little more challenging. You just don't have the energy it takes for a long-distance relationship.''
 After two years, the couple decided they would be happier if they were together full time. ''We came to the decision it would ultimately take its toll on the marriage or the family,'' she said. 
 In September 2002, Ms. Peterson and their son moved to Chicago. 
 After a couple years to settle in, the Petersons are now pleased with their choices. Ms. Peterson has now resumed her career, working as a real estate agent for Coldwell Banker in its Gold Coast office in Chicago, where she sometimes finds herself assisting couples who are relocating because of work. 
 ''It helps to understand the emotional upheaval in their lives as they're looking for another home in a new city,'' she said. 
 Greg Warren was keenly aware of the potential for emotional pitfalls when he moved to New York in late March to take a job as an executive vice president for MediaVest, a marketing and advertising-buying company. Mr. Warren and his partner, Hector Gonzalez, already owned a three-story house with a yard in the Lincoln Square neighborhood of Chicago. They bought the house seven years ago and live there with two dogs, Labradors named Max and Diego. 
 Mr. Warren and Mr. Gonzalez, a project director for Lapiz, a marketing agency in Chicago, spent a frenetic cold day in February house hunting in New York with Ellie Lavi, a broker with the Corcoran Group, before choosing a one-bedroom rental in a new condo building in Chelsea. To make it feel more like home, Mr. Warren and Mr. Gonzalez painted the apartment in a similar color scheme to their Chicago house: sage green, chocolate brown and beige.
 Mr. Warren said he carefully considered the financial aspects of the change before agreeing to take the job. The rent for Mr. Warren's New York apartment is $41,000 a year, and they estimate they will spend about $7,200 a year on air fare flying back and forth to visit each another. Despite the added cost, Mr. Warren's new job pays more than his old one, so the move made financial sense. 
 So far the transition has worked well, Mr. Warren said, with one exception. He gets to talk to Mr. Gonzalez every day. But you can't hug a dog by telephone.

Iraq's Kidnapping Industry
Kidnapping is a growing industry in Iraq and has evolved into a tangled mix of lucrative criminal enterprises and brutal sectarian violence. Between 5 and 30 people are abducted every day according to figures maintained by the American Embassy in Baghdad, though Iraqi and American officials acknowledge that any estimate is merely guesswork since most kidnappings go unreported. 1

A British military helicopter crashed in Basra, apparently after being hit by a rocket, drawing crowds of cheering locals who threw stones and Molotov cocktails, Iraqi officials said. 
As many as five service members were killed, witnesses said. 12

Crash Kills 10 U.S. Soldiers
Ten American soldiers were killed when their helicopter crashed Friday in eastern Afghanistan, the United States military said. 12

Corruption Fears Roil Vietnam
A gambling scandal in Vietnam has led to the resignation of a top official. Along with other cases, it has raised such a ruckus that the leader of the nation's Communist Party has said that corruption ''threatens the survival of our system.'' 8

A Gypsy Rights Movement
Some Gypsy leaders in Europe, modeling their struggle on the civil rights effort of black Americans, are going to court to secure equal rights among the new East European members of the European Union and those trying to join. 14

Calls for Blair to Step Down
Dissidents within the Labor Party of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, not satisfied by a radical reshuffling of the government, continued to demand that he set a timetable to hand over power to his heir and rival, Gordon Brown. 10

C.I.A. Choice Signals Changes
The choice of Gen. Michael V. Hayden of the Air Force as the new director of the Central Intelligence Agency is only a first step in a planned overhaul intended to permanently change the mission and functions of the legendary spy agency, American intelligence officials said. 1

As the C.I.A. undergoes its latest round of turmoil, legislators and former intelligence officials say that serious gaps in the United States' knowledge of Iran are among the most critical problems facing a new director of the spy agency. American spy agencies remain severely handicapped in their efforts to assess its weapons programs and its leaders' intentions. 26

Democrats Look to Ohio
For the Democratic Party, the road back to power in Washington begins in Ohio. But as long-dominant Ohio Republicans struggle with a corruption scandal, economic distress and rising voter unease, Democrats face a challenging task in making the state a launching pad to seize control of Congress and the White House. 1

HEADLINE: How to Improve Your Credit Score 

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
DO you know your credit score? If you do -- and if you don't, you should -- you may be able to improve it in just a few months. 
 ''The credit score is a significant factor used by lenders to determine both the interest rate and type of loan program a borrower is eligible for,'' said Oded Ben-Ami, a senior loan officer for Sterling National Mortgage in Great Neck, N.Y. ''And there are circumstances in which even one point either way can make a difference.''
The credit score, which ranges from 300 to 850, is basically a quantification of an individual's creditworthiness. Generally, people with scores below 620 are considered poor risks, and those with scores above 680 are considered acceptable risks. The median score in the United States is 723; typically, the higher the score, the lower the mortgage rate a consumer will pay. 
 The Fair Isaac Corporation, a Minneapolis data management company, developed the formula that is applied to raw data in consumer credit files of the three large credit-reporting bureaus: Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. The result is known as the FICO score. 
 Craig Watts, the public affairs manager for Fair Isaac, said the factors considered include whether debts are paid on time, what type of credit has been granted in the past, how much of the available credit has been used, and whether there are any judgments, foreclosures, bankruptcies or liens. 
 While a FICO score is based upon several years of credit history, consumers may be able to raise their scores fairly quickly. Gerri Detweiler, a spokeswoman for an online consumer financial service called EverydayWealth.com, said the first step is to get a current credit report from each of the three bureaus. ''If there are mistakes that are damaging your credit, you have a right to get them off'' by writing to the company that issued the report, she said. 
 For example, Ms. Detweiler said, late-payment information more than seven years old should not be included. (Bankruptcies, tax liens and court judgments are not subject to the seven-year limit.) 
 Another way to improve a score is to reduce the balance on credit cards that are near their limit. And while the most improvement will result if the balance is actually paid down, it may be possible to improve your score by transferring some charges to a card with a low balance. 
 Those considering taking out a mortgage in the next few months should avoid making substantial charges to credit cards, even if they plan to pay the full balance. 
 ''What the report shows is a snapshot of a specific moment in time,'' Ms. Detweiler said. If the report is issued before the balance is paid, it could make you appear less creditworthy than you actually are. 
 Another strategy that may increase a credit score is ''piggybacking.'' Consumers who do not have much of a credit history will not have a good credit score, Ms. Detweiler explained, even if the history they do have is good. But if they are added as an authorized user on a card issued to someone else -- a parent, perhaps -- the credit history of that card may be reflected on the user's credit report as well. 
 Mr. Watts of Fair Isaac said that one thing consumers should avoid in trying to improve their scores is to close old accounts. Since the FICO formula takes into consideration how long a consumer has had a particular credit account, closing a longstanding account could damage the score. And since the formula factors in the ratio of used credit to available credit, closing an account will increase that ratio and could reduce the score.
 Once a year, consumers can obtain a free copy of their credit report from each bureau by going to annualcreditreport.com. The FICO score based on a specific credit report, along with a copy of that report, is available for $14.95 from myfico.com, a Fair Isaac Web site.

Not His Finest Hour

Q. I read recently that Winston S. Churchill was almost killed by a car in Manhattan. Where and when?

A. One of history's close calls occurred Dec. 13, 1931, on Fifth Avenue between 76th and 77th Streets. Churchill, 57, had sailed to the United States to give a series of lectures on ''the Pathway of the English-Speaking Peoples''; one was scheduled for the next night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. About 10:30 p.m., he set out to visit his friend Bernard M. Baruch, the financier, at 1055 Fifth Avenue.
Traveling north in a taxi (Fifth Avenue was two-way in those days), Churchill became confused about the building numbers. The taxi driver, who was new to Manhattan, turned around. Churchill got out on the Central Park side, walked a few paces north and then tried to cross the avenue against the light. 
 Used to traffic that keeps to the left, Churchill looked to his right, saw no one coming and kept walking. A car driven by an unemployed mechanic named Mario Contasino, moving about 30 miles an hour, dragged Churchill several yards and flung him into the street, bruising his right chest, spraining his right shoulder and cutting his forehead and nose.
 Churchill took full responsibility, and the police absolved Mr. Contasino of any blame. Churchill invited the man for a visit in the hospital. 
 ''I do not understand why I was not broken like an eggshell or squashed like a gooseberry,'' Churchill wrote later.
 Churchill suffered an attack of pleurisy in the hospital. To avoid alarming his friends, he ordered that no details of his ailments be given out, and reports described his injuries as slight. In fact, he suffered a severe aftershock and depression.
 After more than two weeks in the hospital and additional weeks of recuperation, he finally gave his Brooklyn lecture on Jan. 28.
 The era being Prohibition, his American doctor, Otto C. Pickhardt, wrote a note for him: ''This is to certify that the post-accident concussion of Hon. Winston S. Churchill necessitates the use of alcoholic spirits especially at meal times.''

Alternate-Side No-No

Q. When did it become customary to double-park opposite the side of the street being cleaned that day? Is it legal?

A. Absolutely not. If it were legal, you wouldn't find people sitting in their cars waiting for the no-parking period to expire. (Even if the street sweeper has passed, you still cannot park on the restricted side until the end of the posted time.) There is no special dispensation for double-parking on alternate-side days.
 The practice probably started a few minutes after the alternate-side rule went into effect in August 1950 on the Lower East Side.

The Fountains in Winter

Q. On a late-winter vacation to Paris, I was stunned to find all the city fountains running, even though icicles were hanging from the sculptures. Why does New York display its fountains in full bloom only half the year when Paris runs its own year round?

A. Because New York is colder. Warner Johnston, a Parks Department spokesman, wrote in an e-mail message: ''While we would love to be able to run our fountains year round, we do deal with one main difference -- namely, temperature. From December through February, Paris's average low is in the 40's -- well above freezing. By contrast, New York's low during that time of year is in the high 20's.
 ''Essentially, we need to turn off the water to prevent pipes from freezing and bursting.'' MICHAEL POLLAK

HEADLINE: Land of the Free

BYLINE: By AARON GELL

 BODY:
IT was a gray Wednesday morning, and the weekly Democratic Meeting of the Brooklyn Free School had been called to order. In a bare-bones classroom in a Methodist church on 16th Street in Park Slope, two dozen students, ranging in age from 5 to 16, sat in a circle on mismatched folding chairs, along with their three teachers, a couple of volunteers and Alan Berger, the school's 49-year-old founder and director.
 The agenda turned to a crucial issue.
''I've had a bunch of people come up to me and say, 'I'm so bored, I need something to do,' '' began Sophie Danish-Brown, a dark-haired 14-year-old who for some mysterious reason was wearing a pair of silvery fairy wings. ''And I've felt it myself. So I just wanted to open it up for discussion, ways to, basically, alleviate boredom.'' 
 This was no small matter for a place where boredom is not so much a minor annoyance as a pedagogical imperative. The Brooklyn Free School, which winds up its second year of operation next month, is arguably New York's most radical center of learning, a romantic gamble on the idea of laissez-faire education and an audacious repudiation of the regimented curriculums and high-stakes tests that increasingly dominate the city's public school system.
 In theory, students at the Brooklyn Free School can go for weeks, even years, without ever laying eyes on a No. 2 pencil or one of those fearsome grids of ovals used to identify answers in standardized tests. Students are not graded or ranked in any way. The only homework they are likely to get is the kind their nervous parents take it upon themselves to assign. 
 What's more, students are not required to attend classes -- ever. Instead, they are encouraged to design their own education, or not, the idea being that real learning occurs only when it is self-directed and ''noncoercive,'' as free-school disciples put it, rather than imposed from on high. This can make for some long and tedious days as children figure out how to fill the hours. 
 Mr. Berger views the approach as particularly well suited to the information-age economy. ''Kids going out with an education like this will be more creative, more inventive, and more adaptive and flexible, which is going to be a big thing as the economy changes,'' he said. ''People with standard credentials figure, 'I'm set.' But what happens when your job is outsourced and you have to figure out what to do next?''
 In the eyes of others, the Brooklyn Free School represents, at the least, pedagogical pie in the sky.
 ''There's a certain kind of student and family that will thrive in the free-school environment,'' said Victoria Goldman, who with Catherine Hausman wrote ''The Manhattan Family Guide to Private Schools and Selective Public Schools.'' ''The right kid will do beautifully. But if you don't come from an intellectual home or a reading family where the parents are true professionals, this thing is not going to be good. I don't think every kid needs to be whipped, although, dare I say, most do.'' 
 And E. D. Hirsch Jr., founder of the Core Knowledge Foundation and the author of ''Cultural Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know,'' added in an interview: ''The public school approach isn't very benighted. But that doesn't mean that this providential approach to education, where by some natural process the child will end up being educated, is going to work either. It may work for children from well-educated homes, but it doesn't work for children who haven't had those advantages.''

Plato and Flying Socks
 Bold, visionary institutions tend to have eccentric figures at the helm. Think of Stanley Bosworth, the irrepressibly outspoken founder of Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn Heights. The city's last free school, Fifteenth Street School in Park Slope, which closed in the 1980's, was led by a blacklisted actor, Orson Bean. By contrast, Mr. Berger seems almost religiously self-effacing. Tall and lanky, with a monkish haircut and a soft-spoken manner, he began his teaching career 10 years ago at Murry Bergtraum High School for Business Careers in Lower Manhattan. 
 ''I was really idealistic,'' said Mr. Berger, a former cable company manager who took up teaching after becoming disenchanted with the business world. ''But it turned out the education system was the same: a big, dehumanizing bureaucracy. Instead of profits, the bottom line was G.P.A. and test results.''
 In 2001, Mr. Berger was promoted to assistant principal at Murry Bergtraum. Shortly after, he read an article about a free school in Woodstock, N.Y. ''It just grabbed me to the core,'' he said.
 Free schools, which trace their lineage to the work of progressive educators like John Dewey and Maria Montessori, had their heyday in the 1960's after the publication of A. S. Neill's best-selling book ''Summerhill: A Radical Approach to Child Rearing.'' The philosophy is predicated on the theory that the less quantifiable benefits of the child-centered learning -- self-reliance, enhanced critical thinking and social awareness -- will more than offset the lack of traditional skills. For Mr. Berger, the appeal was powerful.
 In October 2003, he outlined his idea for a free school in the newsletter of the Park Slope Food Co-op, a nerve center of hummus-and-sprouts Brooklyn liberalism. Less than a year later, the Brooklyn Free School opened for business in the bottom two floors of the Brooklyn First Free Methodist Church on 16th Street with 30 children, three teachers and a provisional charter from the state. 
 Most of the students are from middle-income families -- a number of the parents are teachers, struggling artists or former hippies -- and most live in Brooklyn. Tuition is $9,500, administered on a sliding scale; fewer than half of the families pay full tuition, and one struggling parent just slips Mr. Berger $20 now and then. The school, which has an annual budget of $200,000, is $20,000 in debt, scraping by on grants, donations and the occasional good-will gesture. 
 Any child can apply and visit the school for a five-day orientation, after which the admissions committee (made up of students, teachers and parents) must vote unanimously to admit a child based on two criteria: whether the parents and child all want the child to attend the school, and whether the school has the resources to work with the child.
 Many students go there to escape the stress of more conventional settings. And no one would accuse the Brooklyn Free School of being conventional. Children make soap and study Japanese. Mr. Berger has taught classes in cheese-tasting -- last year, the students sampled more than 80 varieties, learning some geography, biology and chemistry in the process. An active book club spent a month discussing ''America (The Book)'' by Jon Stewart.
 There are seminars in philosophy (Plato's ''Euthyphro,'' anyone?), psychology, sociology, video making, astrology, business, storytelling and circus arts, many of them initiated and sometimes conducted by the students themselves. A course on Tibet, taught by Nick Gulotta, 15, is among the most popular offerings.
 There is also fair amount of sword fighting, wandering around and napping. One morning, a visitor narrowly escaped getting beaned by a tube sock, collateral damage in a game called Asoxination in which participants assassinate their opponents by walloping them with athletic socks. But all of it, Mr. Berger insisted, is learning, all of it valid. ''We try not to pass judgment,'' he said.

The Upside of Boredom
 Student empowerment at the Brooklyn Free School is not limited to how children spend their days. To a large degree, they run the institution themselves through the weekly Democratic Meetings. At these sessions, nearly every element of the school's day-to-day management -- from behavioral issues to admissions criteria -- can be debated, and everyone, from the youngest child to the director, has an equal vote. 
 One of the more hotly contested issues was the playing of video games on school computers. Over several months, a Talmudic set of guidelines evolved. One mandated that games be played only on particular terminals. Another limited play to certain times of day. When it was decided that scholarly research should take precedence over more frivolous uses, a new regulation was adopted allowing gamers a three-minute grace period before getting kicked off. 
 Running the Democratic Meeting that gray Wednesday was the budding Tibet scholar, Nick, who has a riotous tangle of black hair and a goth-inspired wardrobe. Although attendance at this meeting, unlike attendance at classes, is mandatory, paying attention is not. Three inseparable little girls -- Sienna, Winnie and Lila -- drew pictures and slurped cantaloupe during the proceedings. A pair of 11-year-old twins played quietly with a set of wooden train tracks, something they had been doing for the better part of each day for weeks, to the consternation of their mother. 
 Nick put the issue of boredom on the table for discussion, and hands shot up. ''Contrary to popular belief, boredom is self-inflicted,'' suggested Silvan Carlson-Goodman, at 15 one of the school's elder statesmen. ''The best cure is to just force yourself to do something, anything. Go for a walk, choreograph a musical, anything. Just do something.''
 David Easton, a 26-year-old instructor and self-described refugee from the New York Teaching Fellows program, added: ''There's nothing wrong with being bored. In fact, it's actually the first step in figuring out what you really want to do.'' 
 Nick turned to Sophie, the 14-year-old. ''So, is there a proposal, or did you just want to open the discussion?'' he asked.
 ''Well,'' she replied, ''I guess I would propose we come up with a list of things to do, suggestions for when someone's bored that we can post on the wall.'' 
 ''A bored board!'' someone chimed in. The motion carried by a wide margin. 

But Does It Work?
 Another example of what the Brooklyn Free School aspires to was on display one recent afternoon among the younger children in the Dolphin group, who are usually supervised by Kristen Palmer, a sunny 31-year-old with cat's-eye glasses and a bright smile. While Ms. Palmer showed a visitor the project her charges had been working on -- a car fashioned from a big cardboard box -- the children packed themselves into a fort made of foam squares. 
 ''Hey, guys,'' Ms. Palmer suggested. ''What if we made a poster about how we built the car?'' It was a valiant attempt at redirection, but while it got them out of the fort and over to the table where Ms. Palmer had set out pens and paper, the plan fizzled: Oren, a bright-eyed 6-year-old, had a different idea. 
 ''Hey, look how I make weird shapes,'' he announced as he folded a piece of construction paper, made a few random cuts, and with a bit of fanfare, unfolded the paper to reveal a pattern of stars. ''Cool!'' the others shouted as they dived for paper of their own. Ms. Palmer flashed a grin.
 But can cut-out stars, Platonic dialogues, Asoxination and fancy cheese take the place of times tables and test prep? Mr. Berger thinks they can. While acknowledging that students in more traditional schools might be more proficient at certain skills, he added: ''There's no reason a child of 7, 8, 9 needs to know the particular content they're being drilled on. If you learn how to learn, you can always pick up the content later.''
 Even among the school's parents, there is not total agreement on this point. A few of them, concerned about how their children will fare in an increasingly competitive world, have hired outside tutors to make sure the basics are covered.
 After some of the older children started worrying about how they would get into college absent grades and transcripts, one teacher began holding a weekly discussion group called ''Life After B.F.S.'' designed to explore the transition to jobs and college.
 ''I don't really know what they're doing academically,'' said Joe Gilford, a screenwriting teacher whose son, Jacob, 15, enrolled at the Brooklyn Free School this year after having trouble at Bay Ridge Prep. ''I just have my fingers crossed.'' 
 Randi Karr, an administrator with the state Office of Mental Health, whose 11-year-old son, David, is a student, agreed. ''Honestly,'' she said, ''I think sometimes he plays most of the day.'' 
 Mr. Berger's ex-wife, Tokie Ozaki-Berger, is another critic. Ms. Ozaki-Berger, a receptionist in a doctor's office, was so upset when the couple's 14-year-old son, Alex, chose the Brooklyn Free School over La Guardia High School that she reported her ex-husband to the city's Department of Social Services, accusing him of educational neglect. 
 ''I tried every angle to put Alex back in a regular school,'' Ms. Ozaki-Berger said. ''I'm very worried about his future.'' 
 Nick Gulotta, who used to attend the Brooklyn School for Global Studies, is in many ways the ultimate Brooklyn Free School student: free-thinking, politically astute and so self-motivated that along with preparing his weekly seminar on Tibet he is taking three classes at the New School and working in a bookstore.
 But even he is not sure that freedom is all it's cracked up to be. ''I think I was really fortunate to go to a public school and get what I needed to pursue my interests,'' he said. ''If these kids were in a regular school, they'd do writing and math every day. Here, they can play and stuff, but what happens when they want a real education?''

A Walk in the Park
 The school is still recuperating from early growing pains. Eleven of the original 30 children drifted away during the first year; some parents withdrew their children in order to home-school them, while in other cases, the families left the city. The original three teachers also left.
 But there are bright spots as well. Mr. Berger says that the three new teachers have more experience than their predecessors. After determining that the Brooklyn Free School was indeed a legitimate educational institution, Mr. Berger said, the Department of Social Services determined that he was not guilty of educational neglect. (A spokeswoman for the department declined to comment.) 
 The school's financial situation is also rosier: a direct-mail campaign netted $10,000, and enrollment is now up to 37.
 But the Brooklyn Free School will never be just another place of learning, as was obvious one unseasonably warm day when Ms. Palmer tried to take the Dolphin group out to play.
 In a free school, this is not exactly a simple matter. 
 ''Who wants to go to the park?'' she asked four little ones who were making car noises as they pushed big stuffed animals down the hall. ''Not me!'' came the reply. 
 In response, Ms. Palmer clasped her hands and called a meeting. As the children flopped down on a pair of beanbag chairs, she tried again. ''How about we just go for a second, for a breath of fresh air?'' she asked. ''We can run around, play tag. '' 
 In a conventional school, they would have been hunting for their jackets and dutifully lining up in single file. Here, they simply shook their heads and with self-satisfied giggles rushed back to their game. 
 As they dashed off, Mr. Easton poked his head in from the corridor. ''What's up?'' he asked. 
 ''I have no idea,'' Ms. Palmer replied. ''All I know is, I just got steamrolled.''

HEADLINE: Why Prices at the Pump May Have Little Bite 

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
AS the summer driving season approaches, gas prices have been soaring -- a national average of $2.92 a gallon on Friday, up from $2.22 a year ago, according to the American Automobile Association. But the steep prices don't seem to be curbing the enthusiasm of American consumers. 
 Same-store sales at Wal-Mart, those for stores open at least a year, rose a solid 6.8 percent in April. Last week, the Conference Board reported that the consumer confidence index for April hit its highest level since May 2002. ''The rising prices on the pump didn't have an impact on consumer confidence at all,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center. 
These data point to the enormous resilience of the consumer. But they also bring into focus a truism lost in the miasma of media coverage and political rhetoric surrounding energy: while the price of gasoline may be highly visible and symbolic, filling up the tank simply doesn't eat up that much of most families' budgets. 
 How much will Americans spend this year to satisfy their gasoline habit? It's hard to know precisely. But there are clues in government data. In the Consumer Price Index, the inflation gauge, gasoline has a weighting of 4.15 percent, according to Patrick Jackman, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In other words, about four pennies of every American's consumer dollar wind up in the gas tank. (The weighting is revised every two years.) 
 Based on data collected in the bureau's consumer expenditure surveys in 2004, consumer expenditures per household averaged $43,395; spending on gasoline and motor oil, with gasoline accounting for virtually the entire sum, were 3.7 percent of that, or $1,598. 
 Since then, this amount has certainly risen with the price of gasoline, but so has average income. John Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute in Washington, estimates that in 2006 the average household will devote $2,150 of its $46,302 in consumer expenditures to gasoline -- or 4.6 percent.
 ''This proportion is certainly up from recent years, but it is something that most households can cope with,'' said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at Deloitte Research. The difference in spending on gasoline from 2004 to 2006, then, is an extra $10.62 a week, about the cost of going to a movie. In 2004, for comparison, the typical household spent significantly less on gasoline than on discretionary things like entertainment ($2,218), or food away from home ($2,434), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 Drill down a little further, and it becomes apparent why rising gas prices may not be as economically damaging as has been assumed. A person with a comparatively low income who has to drive long distances -- say, a sales clerk in Wyoming who commutes 100 miles -- will be hurt a great deal, especially if she drives a gas-guzzling pickup. But for people with high incomes who don't drive much -- say, an actress in Los Angeles who drives her Toyota Prius hybrid to the studio lot, or a hedge fund manager who commutes from Greenwich, Conn., to Manhattan by train -- higher gas prices won't factor into spending decisions. 
 These may be extreme examples. Still, income and gasoline use vary widely by geography. In New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority carries 7.7 million passengers a day in its subway, bus and train systems, more than the combined populations of South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Nebraska.
 What's more, consumers with a greater ability to absorb the pain of higher gasoline prices buy a disproportionately large amount of the stuff. In 2004, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 26.4 percent of households with more than $70,000 in annual income bought about 40 percent of all gasoline and motor oil. The 41.4 percent of households that earned more than $50,000 accounted for 58.4 percent of total expenditures. Even at the higher prices, these comparatively better-off households -- which account for 64 percent of overall consumer spending -- are still devoting only a small fraction of their total spending to gas.
 Maybe that is why prices near $3 a gallon haven't put a significant dent in Americans' overall gasoline use. (Mr. Felmy of the American Petroleum Institute said total gasoline consumption rose about 0.5 percent in the first quarter.) Compared with switching from a car to a commute by bus or train, or undertaking the expense of buying a new, more fuel-efficient car, paying more for gas is a minor inconvenience for many consumers. 
 That doesn't mean Americans should be complacent. Expensive gas is a burden for those at the lower end of the income scale, whose wages have generally stagnated during this expansion. Ms. Franco of the Conference Board noted that consumer confidence fell in April among households making less than $35,000.
 Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, says that people who worry about the impact of expensive oil shouldn't look just at the prices at the local Mobil station. When a spike in a crucial commodity evolves into a long-lasting plateau, the higher costs can spill over into a wide range of other products and services.
 ''We haven't seen the high price of oil show up in the prices of chemicals, plastics, paint and rubber yet,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''But when it happens, it is going to drive up the cost of a lot of goods.''

HEADLINE: Between the Lines In Chapter 11

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Directorship magazine.

 BODY:
THERE is an art to taking a company through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, says Peter Spratt, a principal in the corporate advisory and restructuring arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers. Here are excerpts from a conversation:

Q. How many chief executives will take their companies into bankruptcy this year? 


A. It was low last year, with about 80 public company bankruptcies, the lowest since 1994. This year, we're predicting about 95, so that's a nearly 20 percent increase. It looks like the wave of bankruptcies is going to be picking up, but it will still be relatively modest. There's an awful lot of liquidity in the private equity firms and hedge funds, and that's helping companies with financial difficulties get refinancing.

Q. Why is there an increase in the number of bankruptcies?

A. We're at a stage of the economic cycle when some people might say that lending has gotten a little carefree. People are needing to place a lot of money in the market, and some people are therefore lending on terms that are going to come back to bite them when the economy begins to tighten. Also, interest rates have been steadily creeping higher, and that looks likely to continue. Oil prices are dramatically increasing, and that has a knock-on effect through costs of materials for a lot of products. In a number of industries, particularly airlines and autos, you've got a cost of labor that's been well reported.

Q. To what extent are structural problems leading to bankruptcies?

A. It's structural if we take the auto industry. The cost of manufacturing cars in the United States is a multiple of what it is in Japan or China and the like. And the airline industry has about 30 percent of its costs in labor.

Q. Over all, are chief executives using the bankruptcy tool well?

A. You have to ask, ''What am I using it for?'' There could be two possibilities: Am I using bankruptcy simply to re-engineer the financial balance sheet, or am I also using it to re-engineer the operational side and become a viable company again? In the first instance, yes, I think the C.E.O.'s and their advisers are using the bankruptcy process very effectively. You can just look at the increased number of prepackaged bankruptcies, which is where you go into bankruptcy and you know exactly what your plan is for coming out. You can turn around a prepackaged bankruptcy within 32 hours, which is the record.
 But are companies using Chapter 11 for proper operational turnaround? Less so. There's a huge financial pressure from the hedge funds and the private equity funds to be continuing to lend to companies. Arguably, people aren't taking enough time to re-engineer the underlying operations.

Q. Which companies aren't restructuring well?

A. You have some companies ending up in what we call a Chapter 22 or even a Chapter 33. Chapter 22 is when the company re-emerges from its first Chapter 11 and finds itself filing again within a 12- or 24-month period. And you have some companies that go through a second Chapter 11, then emerge and end up in a third Chapter 11. TWA, admittedly an old name, went through three Chapter 11's. US Air is going through its second, as are many auto parts companies.

Q. Can the Chapter 11 process save the auto parts suppliers?

A. The multitiered structure of the whole automotive sector inevitably puts the most pressure on the lowest tier. Those producing the parts tend to be at that end. The larger manufacturers can negotiate the terms in a very one-sided manner.
 When you have a Toyota opening up in the U.S. in a very different cost structure than the U.S. manufacturers, what are you going to do? What are you going to compete with? The only thing you can compete with is to reduce your own cost base. And the cost they can reduce quickest and easiest is parts suppliers.

Q. Have any chief executives actually cut their compensation as they go through bankruptcy?

A. Absolutely. The new bankruptcy code has put in place some protections to stop what was perceived of as the practice of lining their own pockets after a bankruptcy.

Q. In the case of United Airlines, the chief executive and other top managers sought a piece of the company, right?

A. Yes. Taking a piece of the equity is often a way of aligning their interests with the interests of the stakeholders. If you're going to be doing a debt-for-equity exchange, which means that some lenders that are underwater accept shares in exchange for their loans, you have alignment of interests. That's the rationale. In this case, it was overreaching. If you give yourself too much equity, then a greed factor creeps in.

Q. At the auto parts maker Delphi, which is in bankruptcy, wasn't top management criticized as trying to get extra compensation?

A. They were trying to get ongoing pay from the Employee Retention Plan. The new bankruptcy code is intended to avoid those sorts of things. To the extent that their historical payments are being accelerated or protected, some of the creditors may well criticize those sorts of arrangements.

Q. So the recent law that touched on consumer bankruptcies also changed the bankruptcy law for corporations?

A. Another significant change is that the exclusive period for management to come up with a reorganization plan has been cut. The maximum period is now 18 months, whereas previously companies could reapply to the court to extend their exclusivity period and go on and on and on. Now they've got to come up with a plan within 18 months. Failing that, the creditors themselves can come up with a plan. That is a major shift in the way the United States approaches bankruptcy.

 CORRECTION:
The Armchair M.B.A. column on May 7, about chief executives who have taken their companies through Chapter 11 bankruptcies, misstated the status of US Airways. The company emerged from bankruptcy reorganization last September; it is no longer in bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: A Fifth Week of Gains for the Dow

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market surged last week, taking the Dow Jones industrial average within 150 points of its record, 11,722.98, which was set on Jan. 14, 2000. 
 It was the fifth consecutive week of gains for the Dow. Both the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index rose during the week as well.
On Friday, a Labor Department report showed that 138,000 jobs were added in April -- less than what was expected on Wall Street -- and many traders concluded that the Federal Reserve would soon stop raising interest rates.
 Boeing, which gained 6 percent, and Caterpillar, which rose 5.6 percent, were the best weekly performers in the Dow. Procter & Gamble, which fell 4.3 percent, and Intel, which dropped 2.4 percent, were at the bottom of the list. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 210.60 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 11,577.74. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 15.15 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,325.76. The Nasdaq composite index rose 20 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,342.57.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond climbed to 5.10 percent, from 5.05 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Someone Has to Pay for TV. But Who? And How?

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS. 
Randall Stross is a historian and author based in Silicon Valley. E-mail:ddomain@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THEY will take my remote control away only when they pry it from my cold, dead hands.
 This thought followed my first reading of a patent application for a new kind of television set and digital video recorder recently filed by a unit of Royal Philips Electronics at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The design appears to threaten the inalienable right to channel-surf during commercials or fast-forward through ads in programs you've taped.
A second, calmer reading of the patent application revealed that the proposed design would uphold the right to avoid commercials, but only for those who paid a fee. Those disinclined to pay would be prevented from changing channels during commercials. If the viewer tried to circumvent the system by recording the program and skipping the ads during playback, the new, improved recorder would detect when a commercial segment was being displayed and disable the fast-forward button for the duration. 
 As a business proposition, the concept appears dead on arrival: what consumer would voluntarily buy a television designed to charge fees for using it? When I spoke last week with Ruud Peters, the executive in charge of intellectual property at Philips, to learn how it would be pitched to consumers, he explained that the patent application had no connection to any Philips products in the pipeline. And, he explained, the notion of temporarily crippling the remote control to protect advertising is already out there and did not originate with his company. 
 But limiting remote controls is a possibility that could be realized in a new technical standard -- M.H.P., for multimedia home standard -- that the television industry is contemplating for the future. Neither broadcasters nor television manufacturers, whose joint cooperation would be necessary, have yet to adopt the standard. If the television industry embraced M.H.P., broadcasters could insert special signals to immobilize the remote control during commercials. If this came to pass, Mr. Peters said the Philips technology would ''give consumers the freedom of choice'' -- ''freedom'' defined as exercising the option to pay a fee in order to regain the use of the remote control.
 Philips's pay-to-surf proposal may be the first of its kind, but we should expect to see other ideas that would not have appeared in days past, when advertising-based television thrived. Today, the digital video recorder is slowly, but surely, tunneling through the television industry's foundation. Ten million homes had DVR's in 2005, according to Forrester Research; the number is expected to jump to 15 million this year, 30 million next year and 42 million in 2010. Scientific-Atlanta, which supplies set-top boxes to all the major cable companies, reports that fully half its boxes going out today are equipped with DVR's. 
 What this means for traditional advertising can be divined in data collected by TiVo, which has 4.4 million subscribers. Davina Kent, a TiVo vice president, said that when its customers watch recorded programs, they skip 70 percent of the commercials.
 This has not escaped the notice of advertisers. Josh Bernoff, a principal analyst at Forrester, predicted that ''next year, you'll see significant decline in TV ad spending as a result of digital video recorders.''
 The television industry has not figured out how best to respond. Four years ago, Jamie Kellner, then head of the Turner Broadcasting System, remarked in an interview in CableWorld magazine that viewers who used DVR's to fast-forward past commercials were committing ''theft,'' then a moment later described it as ''stealing the programming.'' He did allow trips to the bathroom as a noncriminal exemption.
 The remarks brought instant criticism outside the industry. But he anticipated the adoption curve for DVR's when he said in the same interview that broadcasters needed to come up with a ''new model'' for collecting revenue from consumers who used recorders to skip commercials.
 CBS OnDemand, which rents commercial-free episodes for a modest fee as low as 99 cents, but which must be viewed within 24 hours of downloading to a PC, is one experiment. (Those CBS downloads reveal just how much time commercials occupy in the traditional broadcast: with commercials stripped out, a 60-minute program may run as short as 41 minutes.) The abundant network program offerings at iTunes, which cost $1.99 but do not go poof after a set time, is a work in progress, too. An industrywide hardware standard that could immobilize remote controls, and the related Philips pay-to-surf proposal, are also in the mix of possible responses to the industry's quandary.
 I have not paid close attention to the online offerings of single television episodes because my DVR works well and the fast-forward function on my remote works very, very well. (The button I've programmed to perform a 30-second skip is holding up beautifully, even though it is pressed as emphatically as a hospital button connected to a morphine pump.) Why would I ever buy what the DVR effortlessly records at no cost? Even if I were to feel a twinge of concern that by skipping ads, I am violating an implicit contract that Mr. Kellner asserted exists between broadcaster and viewer of ad-supported television, I take comfort in the knowledge that no such contract exists. 
 James Boyle, a law professor at Duke University, said that broadcasters offer a program knowing that only a fraction of the audience watches the commercials. Advertisers, he added, buy nothing more than ''an option on a probability,'' and the viewer is no more obligated to watch every commercial than a driver is obligated to read every billboard.
 The trickiest legal issue posed by DVR's is not ad-skipping, but something even more basic: the right to freely make a copy of a program for personal use in the first place. My assertion of an inalienable right to fast-forward through commercials would be rendered moot if the creators of the program that I am racing to rejoin were permitted to fully exercise the protections of copyright and impose control over the copying of their creative work. 
 Since the dawn of the videocassette recorder designed for home use in the mid-1970's, we have copied copyrighted television programs with impunity, enjoying the ''fair use'' exemption granted for this, a private, noncommercial purpose. The legality of home copying based on ''fair use'' was enshrined in a Supreme Court decision, Sony Corporation v. Universal City Studios Inc., handed down in 1984. 
 That decision addressed copying with a Betamax videocassette recorder, and it remains the key decision that protects copying with DVR's today. But the more one looks at how the court arrived at its decision in the Sony case -- a 5-to-4 squeaker -- and at how recording technology has changed and new business opportunities have opened since then, the more difficult it is to see how a majority of the court could possibly uphold the same position today.
 The courts uphold ''fair use'' only when it doesn't harm the commercial value of the copyrighted work. At the time the suit was brought, skipping ads during playback on a clunky tape machine was hardly worth the considerable trouble. At the trial, survey data showed that only about 25 percent of recorded ads were skipped. In the face of testimony by Fred Rogers of ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' on PBS, who welcomed home copying of his program, the movie studios that brought the lawsuit failed to convince the judge that VCR copying of televised movies was hurting their business.
 WOULD indisputable evidence that DVR's facilitated ad-skipping make a difference if the Sony case were decided today? Paul Goldstein, a professor at Stanford Law School, thinks that it might. ''If you were working with a clean slate, and everything was the same except for the ad-skipping rate -- that's a compelling fact that could have made a difference,'' he said. 
 Randal C. Picker, a law professor of the University of Chicago, pointed to the commercial availability of network programs at places like iTunes as another enormously important change to be considered by the court if a case like Sony were litigated today.
 How to pay for free television is the overarching but unanswered question, Professor Picker said. Speaking as a viewer, he said: ''I want the other guy to watch advertising. But we can't all not watch.''

HEADLINE: Finding Comfort (and New Friends) in Gold 

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: Sharon, Conn. 

 BODY:
IT'S a splendid spring day in Connecticut's horse country and James E. Sinclair, perhaps the best-known gold speculator of his era, is sitting before his trading terminal, contemplating the upward thrust of gold on his trader's chart.
 The sun, bursting through the bay windows, catches the glint of gold that is everywhere in Mr. Sinclair's home office: on the coins near his computer, on his chunky Rolex watch, on the rings on three of his fingers, on the cuff links on his monogrammed shirt, and -- could it be? -- a hint of it in his one working eye.
''I love gold, O.K.?'' he said, his voice rising in excitement. ''Gold has made me wealthy. It feels nice. It's exchangeable. It's money.''
 On his television set, which is tuned to CNBC, news breaks of a terrorist attack in Egypt, the price of oil pushes higher and traders continue to sell the dollar, which is approaching a one-year low against the euro. 
 With gold trading at $683.80 an ounce, a 25-year high, it's a good time to be a gold bug like Mr. Sinclair, especially if, like him, you own a gold exploration company (his is in Tanzania) and were a buyer when the metal sank as low as $250 an ounce in 2001. Now Wall Street, traditionally a laggard when it comes to making the investment case for gold, has jumped on Mr. Sinclair's bandwagon. 
 Investment banks like J. P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs are putting out bullish research notes, retail investors are heavy buyers through exchange-traded funds and hedge funds; and the trading desks of investment banks have been piling into the market, especially in the last week.
 For Mr. Sinclair, who rode the last bull market in gold to its peak, in 1980, the surging price of his beloved metal is sending out clear signals that take him back to the 1970's, when inflation, a weak dollar and an oil spike driven by turmoil in the Middle East propelled gold to a high of $875 an ounce, or more than $1,800 in current dollars after adjusting for inflation. His ultimate price target now is not far from that: $1,650 an ounce, assuming that things become really bad.
 ''Gold is a barometer of the common stock of a country, and right now gold is sniffing out weakness in the management of the United States as a business,'' said Mr. Sinclair, 65, a lifelong Republican who twice voted for President Bush. ''Iran is becoming a nuclear power. The chairman of the Federal Reserve is on a puppet string controlled by the White House, and there is no such thing as a strong-dollar policy when the dollar is heading south.''
 For more than two decades, the apocalyptic lament of Mr. Sinclair and other gold bugs has been largely dismissed as the United States has experienced -- aside from a few hiccups -- a 25-year bull market in a range of assets, from stocks and bonds to real estate and art. 
 Sustained by a continuing flood of liquidity, these assets have continued their mighty climb, even as crucial gauges of economic health in the United States -- the budget and current account deficits -- have continued to worsen. But now, with gold making a run for $700, dedicated gold investors are getting a wider hearing. 
 THEIR passion notwithstanding, gold bugs tend to be small-time investors. Gold's recent surge has instead been underpinned by a rush of mainstream investors, including hedge funds, commodity-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. 
 For these investors, gold is less a way of life than it is hedge against inflation and a prudent measure of diversification during an increasingly worrisome time. The extent to which this new wave of capital remains invested in gold will determine if the recent spike is just another anomaly or the onset of the second coming of the great gold bull market that the true believers have been calling for since the price of gold crashed a quarter-century ago. 
 Of course, many investors say that given gold's sharp recent climb, a correction would not be surprising. It's another asset bubble, they say, the latest investment fad. But for Mr. Sinclair and a small clutch of other self-exiled Wall Streeters, the metal's recent climb is just deserts for their unwavering, if not mystical, devotion to gold as an investment, an adornment, a means of exchange and, more than anything else, a moral bulwark in a corrupting sea of paper money, credit and what they see as insidious financial instruments.
 Mr. Sinclair, who in the 1970's ran his own trading firm, achieved his renown by selling 900,000 ounces of gold at an average price 0f $810 in early 1980. That was when the metal was capping a decade-long bull market that commenced in 1971, when President Richard M. Nixon severed once and for all the dollar's link to gold. 
 In addition to selling his hoard, Mr. Sinclair sold his trading business, took his total net gain of $18 million and retreated here to the Connecticut countryside where he built his own private Shangri-La. It is indeed, as Mr. Sinclair likes to call it, ''the house that gold built.'' 
 On the outskirts of Sharon, a village at the foot of the Berkshires, the sprawling 38-acre estate includes an indoor swimming pool and pistol range, horse stables and a specially equipped garage that once housed his collection of racing cars. It's a lot of property for a solitary man -- his wife of 40 years died in a car crash in India two years ago. Now, he uses his Web site (jsmineset.com), books, DVD lectures and cartoons that he commissions to proselytize about the virtues of gold and the depredations of central bankers.
 ''This will be my last great ride,'' he said of the current spike in gold prices. ''Everybody loves to be right.''
 In Spain, they call the obsession of some people to dig large holes in the ground to search for the elusive ounce of gold ''mal de piedra,'' or the sickness of rocks -- one way, perhaps, to describe the condition that affects Mr. Sinclair and his coterie of gold investors.
 With their missionary zeal and weakness for conspiracy theories, gold lovers can seem a touch afflicted. They also collect and pass around offbeat, brain-teasing findings. One is that the dollar has lost 98 percent of its value since 1913, when the Federal Reserve System was established. Another is an assertion by the American Institute for Economic Research, an obscure research outfit in Great Barrington, Mass., that since 1945, inflation has eroded $15.8 trillion from the savings accounts of United States citizens.
 Both findings underscore their benchmark precept: that a currency not tied to gold becomes debased when central banks print money and governments spend freely. Perhaps Alan Greenspan, who before his run as chairman of the Federal Reserve was highly regarded in gold-bug circles, captured this point best. ''In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation,'' he wrote in 1966, when he was an economic consultant. ''Gold stands in the way of this insidious process.''
 The great liquidity explosion that occurred under Mr. Greenspan has made him a turncoat in the eyes of the gold-bug crowd. But his successor, Ben S. Bernanke, or ''Helicopter Ben'' as they call him, inflames its passions all the more. To this group, Mr. Bernanke's passing allusion -- before he became Fed chairman -- to a helicopter dropping money over a recession-bound economy confirmed its deepest fears that a monetary system not anchored by gold was essentially inflationary if not downright immoral.
 All the same, most mainstream economists accept that a return to the gold standard and its restrictive covenants would be not only unfeasible but also deflationary. Gold bugs may cry, and be correct, about the creeping impact of inflation, but it is also true that the same climb in prices, aided by the great liquidity boom, has made some of them millionaires, as houses they bought for less than $100,000 in the 1960's are now worth millions. 
 Like Mr. Sinclair, William J. Murphy III is also a Wall Street refugee. After a one-year stint in 1968 as a wide receiver for the New England Patriots, he began a career as a commodities trader, working for a number of firms, including Shearson and Drexel Burnham. Convinced that the price of gold was being suppressed by an unholy alliance between the central banks and major investment banks, he formed the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee, known as GATA, that seeks to publicize facts and assertions that support his point, namely that the gold reserves in central banks are significantly overstated.
 GATA for the most part is a one-man show -- Mr. Murphy, dressed in his sweatsuit, perched in front of the computer in his home in suburban Dallas. With his excitable manner and his outre theories about gold, he is generally thought to exist on the outer fringe of the gold-bug movement.
 Indeed, his central thesis -- that Goldman Sachs and other banks have conspired to keep a cap on the price via short sales to back the government's strong-dollar policy, especially while a former Goldman senior partner, Robert E. Rubin, was Treasury secretary in the late 1990's -- is far-fetched.
 With the price of gold surging, Mr. Murphy is convinced that Goldman Sachs, J. P. Morgan and others are frantically buying now to cover for the gold they sold short over the years. Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan declined to comment about their gold trading positions or strategies.
 ''What a day,'' Mr. Murphy said one day last week as gold broke through $670. Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan were big buyers that day on Comex, the division of the New York Mercantile Exchange where gold contracts trade. Sputtering at the joy of it all, Mr. Murphy could well have been a prospector hitting the Mother Lode. ''These guys are short, and they are panicking to get out of their positions,'' he said. ''They are sweating bullets, and it couldn't happen to a nicer bunch of guys.''
 There is a kernel of truth to what Mr. Murphy says. Central banks have been aggressive sellers of gold, especially in the late 1990's, when gold was touching record lows. But most economists say that there was no grand design involved, just a badly timed attempt to shift into higher-yielding assets like bonds. 
 As for investment banks, they are sellers and buyers of any given asset at any given time. But it is also true that they have hardly been enthusiastic advocates for gold as an investment, especially when the stock market was king. Even now, as they have issued positive reports about the metal, their price targets seem oddly out of sync with its relentless rise. 
 Goldman's forecast for a year-end price is $625 an ounce; J. P. Morgan's target, which is currently under review, is $560, and Morgan Stanley's is $550. 
 Compared with Mr. Murphy and his boylike excitability, James Turk speaks with an assured gravity consistent with his background as a commercial banker at Chase Manhattan. But his views about gold as the ultimate store of value in a financial world on the verge of collapse are no less doctrinaire. 
 Indeed, Mr. Turk has established his own online payment system, GoldMoney.com, through which he and his fellow gold bugs may enjoy the thrill of buying goods and services via gold, not cash.
 IN some ways, it is a symbolic exercise. While the payment system is supported by $100 million worth of gold, no merchants have agreed to take bullion as payment, although Mr. Turk hopes that day may come. More than anything else, the site demonstrates his disdain for the dollar and all other forms of paper money -- a view that he often heard from his parents, who experienced the ravages of hyperinflation in Austria in the 1920's.
 ''It's not gold going up; it's the dollar going down,'' Mr. Turk said by phone from Australia, where he was speaking at an investment conference. Gold has held its value much better than the dollar against commodities like oil, he said. 
 With oil hitting new highs -- it has hovered around $70 a barrel for weeks -- Mr. Turk foresees a return to the 1970's, when high inflation and a volatile Middle East drove gold to its peak. ''If we get close to $850 this year, it's most probable that we will see a four-digit gold price in 2007,'' he said. Four-digit gold -- an ounce of bullion selling for $1,000 or more -- is the gold bugs' equivalent of a visit from the Messiah. 
 But for the growing number of hedge funds that are piling into the commodity, gold is less a virtuous investment than it is a mercenary one.
 China and India are buying more gold. Iran is becoming more bellicose in its stand toward the West. And, most important, liquidity is making a broad shift to commodities and out of stocks.
 ''Do I think that gold is God? No,'' said Monty Guild, who runs Guild Investment Management, a hedge fund in Malibu, Calif. ''I'm a gold opportunist. When it's good, we like it; when it's not, we stay away. Gold does well during wars, and we believe there will be more wars.''
 And for those not in gold, or any other highflying commodity, for that matter, the feeling can be lonely. William H. Miller III, portfolio manager of the $19 billion Legg Mason Value Trust, which has beaten the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for 15 consecutive years, has no gold in the fund. His view is that inflationary expectations, if not prices themselves, remain quiescent, and that gold -- like oil, emerging markets and small-cap stocks before it -- has become the latest investment craze, propelled upward by a wave of hot money, a term for speculative short-term capital. 
 ''Gold certainly looks extended from here,'' said Mr. Miller, whose fund is currently trailing the S.& P. 500 for the year. ''It's easy to make money when you are trend-following,'' he added. ''But if you are worried that the end is near, the last thing I want is gold because of all the hot money.''

HEADLINE: The Mystery of the Stock Price and the Strike Price

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
SO many options traders lose money that they have grown to suspect they are not operating on a level playing field. A recent academic study provides them with some potentially powerful ammunition. 
 The study, ''Stock Price Clustering on Option Expiration Dates,'' appeared last October in The Journal of Financial Economics. Its authors are Neil D. Pearson and Allen M. Poteshman, both finance professors at the University of Illinois, and Sophie Xiaoyan Ni, a Ph.D. student there. A version is at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=519044.
The researchers focused on unusual trading patterns of stocks when options on them were expiring. They found an increased likelihood that a stock would close on the options expiration day at or very near the strike price of one of its expiring options. 
 A strike price, of course, is the price at which an option's owner can buy the underlying stock (if the option is a call) or sell the stock (if the option is a put). A stock typically has options with many different strike prices, set at regular intervals -- every $5, for example. Options also vary by month of expiration; all of a given month's options expire on the third Friday.
 In effect, the researchers found that the closing prices of stocks that have options were not randomly distributed on expiration days, but instead tended to cluster around the strike prices of certain of their options. 
 Consider how often a stock closes within 12.5 cents of one of its option's strike prices. On all days other than the expiration date, the researchers found, this happens about 10.5 percent of the time. But on option expiration days, this frequency jumps a full percentage point, to around 11.5 percent. That suggests that option strike prices are acting like magnets, drawing stock prices toward them.
 This clustering may not seem a big deal, but the researchers say they are confident that it can't be attributed to chance. And the dollars involved are substantial. Some investors' portfolios will increase in value on the expiration day because of the clustering, while others' portfolios will suffer. The researchers estimate that for the average option expiration day from 1996 through 2002, these portfolio shifts totaled at least $9.1 billion. On an annual basis, this amounts to more than $100 billion.
 Could the cause of this clustering have nothing to do with options expiration? The researchers believe not, since they were unable to find a similar pattern among stocks for which no options exist. They also examined what happened to these stocks when and if options began to be traded on them. They found that clustering generally appeared almost immediately in these stocks' trading patterns on expiration days.
 This clustering does not automatically mean that these stocks are being manipulated, the researchers say. It could also be caused by straightforward hedging transactions that are regularly undertaken by market makers on options exchanges. Marty Kearney, senior instructor at the Options Institute, the educational arm of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said he believes that these market makers' hedges cause the bulk of any price clustering on options expiration day. 
 The study's authors don't disagree that market makers play a large role. But they found that the market makers' activities could not fully explain the clustering. They say it is likely that manipulation is also taking place.
 Who would have an incentive to manipulate stocks this way? One group would be those who sell options short, known as option writers. Traders in this group in effect are betting that the options' underlying stocks will rise (in the case of puts they have sold short) or fall (in the case of calls). They could lose big if these stocks move too far in the wrong direction.
 You would need to be a very wealthy investor indeed to be able to buy or sell enough shares of a stock to move its price in a given direction. But the researchers believe that some would qualify. They focused special attention on a group known as firm proprietary traders, which includes employees of large investment banks who are trading options for those banks' accounts. The researchers argue that these traders would be in a position to manipulate stock prices by selling large numbers of shares whose prices they wanted to keep from rising and by buying other shares whose prices they wanted to support.
 The researchers say that it is impossible to identify any particular firm that may have engaged in manipulation because they had access only to aggregate data for firm proprietary traders as a whole.
 Even if they did have data for individual firms, it would still be hard to prove that any one of them specifically engaged in deliberate stock manipulation, which would be illegal. Such proof would depend on demonstrating what the firm's traders were intending to do when buying or selling stocks on expiration day. And there is no shortage of plausible explanations that those traders could provide for their behavior.
 In an interview, Lawrence E. Harris, a former chief economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission and now a finance professor at the University of Southern California, says the difficulty in proving manipulation is probably an inherent feature of modern markets. ''Because the markets are so complex,'' he said, ''it is relatively easy for traders engaged in manipulation to offer alternative explanations for their behavior that would make it difficult to successfully prosecute them.''
 Professor Harris nonetheless said that ''when presented with the data suggesting manipulation by firm proprietary traders, it's reasonable to expect that the S.E.C. would consider investigating the matter further.'' The S.E.C. had no comment on the researchers' study.
 At least two major lessons can be drawn from the study, according to Professor Harris. First, he said, ''there are limits to what the S.E.C. can do to protect you from the actions of clever traders who arrange their trades to put you at a disadvantage.'' The second, he said, is this: ''Unsophisticated traders should be wary of trading options.''

HEADLINE: The Other Immigration

BYLINE: By Christopher Caldwell. 
Christopher Caldwell is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
If you were to set out to design a story that would inflame populist rage, it might involve immigrants from poor countries, living in the United States without permission to work, hiring powerful Washington lobbyists to press their case. In late April, The Washington Post reported just such a development. The immigrants in question were highly skilled -- the programmers and doctors and investment analysts that American business seeks out through so-called H-1B visas, and who are eligible for tens of thousands of ''green cards,'' or permanent work permits, each year. But bureaucracy and an affirmative-action-style system of national-origin quotas have created a mess. India and China account for almost 40 percent of the world's population, yet neither can claim much more than 7 percent of the green cards. Hence a half-million-person backlog and a new political pressure group, which calls itself Immigration Voice. 
The group's efforts will be a test of the commonly expressed view that Americans are not opposed to immigration, only to illegal immigration. Immigration Voice represents the kind of immigrants whose economic contributions are obvious. It is not a coincidence that the land of the H-1B is also the land of the iPod. Such immigrants are not ''cutting in line'' -- they're petitioning for pre-job documentation, not for post-job amnesty. And people who have undergone 18 years of schooling to learn how to manipulate advanced technology come pre-Americanized, in a way that agricultural workers may not.
 But Immigration Voice could still wind up crying in the wilderness. As the Boston College political scientist Peter Skerry has noted, many of the things that bug people about undocumented workers are also true of documented ones. Legal immigrants, too, increase crowding, compete for jobs and government services and create an atmosphere of transience and disruption. Indeed, it may be harder for foreign-born engineers to win the same grip on the sympathies of native-born Americans that undocumented farm laborers and political refugees have. Skilled immigrants can't be understood through the usual paradigms of victimhood. 
 The economists Philip Martin, Manolo Abella and Christiane Kuptsch noted in a recent book, ''As a general rule, the more difficult it is to migrate from one country to another, the higher the percentage of professionals among the migrants from that country.'' Often this means that the more ''backward'' the country, the more ''sophisticated'' the immigrants it supplies. Sixty percent of the Egyptians, Ghanaians and South Africans in the U.S. -- and 75 percent of Indians -- have more than 13 years of schooling. Their home countries are not educational powerhouses, yet as individuals, they are more highly educated than a great many of the Americans they live among. (This poses an interesting problem for Immigration Voice, which polices its Web forums for condescending remarks toward manual laborers.) 
 So how are we supposed to address the special needs of this class of migrant? For the most part, we don't. The differences between skilled and unskilled immigrants are important, but that doesn't mean that they are always readily comprehensible either to politicians or to public opinion. When high-skilled immigrants who are already like us show themselves willing to become even more so, jumping every hoop to join us on a legal footing, it dissolves a lot of resistance. But it doesn't dissolve everything. It doesn't dissolve our sense that people like them are different and potentially even threatening.
 If we consider our own internal migration of recent decades, this will not surprise us. You would have expected that big movements of people between states -- particularly from the North to the Sun Belt and from Pacific Coast cities to Rocky Mountain towns -- would cause increasing uniformity and unanimity. But that didn't happen. Instead, this big migration has coincided with the much harped-on polarization between ''red'' and ''blue'' America. 
 Georgians take up jobs on Wall Street and New Englanders unload their U-Hauls in Texas. The sky doesn't fall -- but neither do cultural or political tensions between respective regions of the country. Consider the diatribes that followed the last election, in which ''red'' America stood accused of everything from ignorance and bloodlust to knee-jerk conformity. Or consider North Carolina. As the state filled up with new arrivals from such liberal states as New York and New Jersey, political pundits predicted the demise of its longtime ultraconservative senator Jesse Helms. But Helms won elections until he retired in 2002, largely because many of those transplants voted for him enthusiastically. The sort of Yankees who moved to North Carolina had little trouble adopting the political outlook of their new neighbors. But you didn't notice North Carolinians begging for more of them.
 While Immigration Voice looks like an immigrant movement that Americans can rally behind, its prospects are mixed. A recent measure sponsored by Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania to nearly double the number of H-1B visas was passed through committee, then killed and then revived. The fate of skilled immigrants hinges on public opinion, and that is hard to gauge. Even an employer delighted to sponsor an H-1B immigrant for a green card might have no particular political commitment to defending the program, or to wringing inefficiencies out of it. The arrival of skilled individuals arguably makes America a more American place. But not necessarily a more welcoming one.

HEADLINE: 13 Ways of Looking At an Ivory-Billed Woodpecker

BYLINE: By JACK HITT. 
Jack Hitt is a contributing writer. His last article for the magazine was about abortion in El Salvador.

 BODY:
If I wanted to, I could claim something that fewer than two dozen people on the planet right now can: I have seen an ivory-billed woodpecker. It was only a year ago that history was made when it was announced that this legendary woodpecker -- also known as the Lord God Bird for the excited cry said to accompany a sighting -- was not extinct, as had been widely believed, but had been positively identified in a swamp called the Bayou de View in Arkansas. On Feb. 26, I visited the bayou with Bill Tippit, a friendly bear of a birder. We were expecting to spend the day in the swamp with an expert guide, but in the chime of a cellphone, we found ourselves suddenly guideless, standing there with our waders, a canoe and a big desire. ''I'm game,'' he said in his slow, deep twang. So we put in and spent the day drifting around the primeval beauty of Arkansas's most famous bottom-land swamp. 
Even though I grew up among South Carolina's cypress swamps, I had never seen cypress trees this huge and haunting. Towering beside them was the ancient tupelo, like some Devonian Period beta version of ''tree.'' These thousand-year-old senator trees are large enough at the base to garage a car, and then they suddenly narrow like a wine bottle before shooting up into a regular tree. Tippit and I spent the day paddling into swampy cul-de-sacs and just hanging there, strictly quiet, for half an hour at a stretch. 
 ''You can't find the bird,'' Tippit said. ''The bird has to find you.'' By late afternoon, the swamp had come to life with a dozen birdsongs. Blue herons flapped through the trees, while above, the canopy was a rush hour of swallows and sweeps. At times, the dimming forest could be as chatty as a crowded cocktail party, filled with the call of the pileated woodpecker. A relative of the ivory-bill, the pileated is common and often mistaken -- very often -- for its more renowned cousin.
 Then: ''Ivory-bill!'' Tippit urgently whispered from the back of the canoe. I looked ahead but saw nothing. I turned to see precisely where he was pointing. I whipped back around to see the final movements of a large dark bird disappearing like a black arrow into the dusky chill of the swamp. 
 I knew the drill. To confirm the sighting, I asked Tippit to report to me precisely what he saw. As with any witness, it's important to set the interview down on paper as soon as possible. Tippit called out: ''Two white panels on the back of the wings! It lit on that tree. It was large. Also saw it flying away from me with flashes of white.'' 
 Since that February afternoon, I have been able to say, ''I saw an ivory-billed woodpecker,'' yet I have not said it. It turns out it's not an easy sentence to utter, and not only because all I really saw was a distant flash of black feathers. I got a better sense of the difficulty of this claim when I attended the Call of the Ivory-Billed Woodpecker Celebration in February in nearby Brinkley (formerly Lick Skillet), Ark. The town had so gussied itself up in midwinter woodpecker boosterism that I fully expected to see a parade led by Robert Preston sporting an ivory-bill haircut (available at Penny's Hair Care for $25). A modest motel is now the Ivory Billed Inn. Gene's Restaurant and Barbecue offers an ivory-bill cheeseburger. There's even ivory-bill blue: I bought a T-shirt that reads, ''Got Pecker?'' And yet talk of seeing the bird was curiously absent. It's hard to describe, but it's like saying you've walked on the moon or been anointed by the Dalai Lama. It's a boast of immense magnitude, frightening to claim, and here's why: In the weeks after the initial sighting, Cornell University's Lab of Ornithology flew down dozens of scientists to comb the swamp, and the Nature Conservancy intensified its efforts to secure large swaths of the habitat. Even the Department of the Interior got involved. The gravitas of powerful institutions and eminent professionals now looms over every claim. 
 During the question-and-answer period after a talk given by Sharon Stiteler, a perky, witty, smiling blonde who is the host of www.birdchick.com, I cut off a back-and-forth about bird feeders to ask her, ''Have you seen an ivory-billed woodpecker?'' It was as if I'd dropped a glass on the floor. The room went weirdly silent. The smile on Stiteler's face flickered away quick as a chickadee. ''I am not allowed to comment on that,'' she said. ''I was out with Cornell in December and had to sign a lot of confidentiality agreements.''
 Soon after the original declaration of the discovery was made last April, controversy broke out, and it quickly got nasty. The ugliness derives from something deep in the heart of birding. Most people think of birding as either a science worthy of a word like ''ornithology'' or a harmless hobby pursued by rubber-faced old men in porkpie hats. But the act of birding, ultimately, is an act of storytelling. For instance, if someone said to you, ''I saw this cardinal fly out of nowhere with yellow tips on its wings and land on the side of a tree,'' even the least experienced amateur would counter that cardinals don't have yellow wingtips and don't cling to trees but rather perch on branches. Each bird is a tiny protagonist in a tale of natural history, the story of a niche told in a vivid language of color, wing shape, body design, habitat, bill size, movement, flying style and perching habits. The more you know about each individual bird, the better you are at telling this tale. 
 Claiming to have seen rare birds requires a more delicate form of storytelling and implies a connoisseur's depth of knowledge. Saying ''I saw an ivory-bill's long black neck and white trailing feathers'' requires roughly the same panache as tasting an ancient Bordeaux and discoursing on its notes of nougat and hints of barnyard hay. 
 If you don't pull it off, then people presume that you are lying or stupid. And this is where birding gets personal. Telling a rare-bird-sighting story is to ask people to honor your ability as a birder -- to trust you, to believe you. To say I saw an ivory-bill -- and Tippit says we did -- would put me in one camp; on the other hand, to say that I'm not sure totally disses my canoe partner's integrity. And I came to like and trust Bill Tippit quite a lot. He pointed out about a dozen birds to me that afternoon that I never would have seen without his keen eye. I don't want to deny him. So I cagily keep myself suspended between two potential truths, which is where a lot of birders now find themselves.
 The ivory-billed woodpecker is, essentially, Schrodinger's cat, the famous physics paradox in which a cat in a box is neither dead nor alive until you open the box. By keeping my mouth shut (about as rare an experience as an ivory-bill sighting), the bird is both extinct from the planet and nesting in the swamps of Arkansas. 
 But this is not one of those crummy stories that ends with some annoying riff about ''ambiguity.'' Birding is not philosophy. Birding is storytelling, and ivory-bill birding is the most exquisitely nuanced yarn of them all. It requires that you consider the different facets of the ivory-billed woodpecker from every angle. (My experience with Bill Tippit and this philosophical mumbo jumbo are but two.) There are, with some editing, 13 ways of looking at the ivory-billed woodpecker, and there is an answer to the burning question Did I see the damn bird or not? Here's the thing -- I'm not able to give the answer. It's a birding story. Only you can.
 The fantastic story of the bird's rediscovery begins with the first confirmed sighting. Tim Gallagher, editor of Living Bird magazine, published by Cornell University's ornithology lab, was writing a book, ''The Grail Bird,'' a history of the search for the ivory-bill. He intended to interview every living person who had seen one. It turns out that there's a whole subcategory of bird aficionados known as ghost-bird chasers, who look for birds presumed to be extinct. Gallagher himself was one, and over his years of searching, he met Bobby Harrison, a photography professor at Oakwood College in Alabama, who was also in this game. 
 The two men were made for the Chautauqua circuit, which they're now in fact on, sometimes together, sometimes solo, telling the tale of their sighting. Their appearance before an awestruck audience capped the Brinkley celebration. Gallagher is a tall 55-year-old with white hair and a pleasantly restrained Yankee demeanor who introduced himself in Arkansas by confessing amiably that he'd always thought the South was weird and that he considered Harrison his ''interpreter and guide.'' Harrison, a fun guy with a head like a mortar shell, had his own schtick, like saying that he didn't know ''damn Yankee'' was two words until he was 20 years old. The audience laughed wildly at their tale, which was, like the best sightings, a great adventure story full of snakes, mayhem, missteps, mud, bugs and a bird.
 In early 2004, Gallagher was alerted to an online posting by another Southerner, a kayaker named Gene Sparling, who reported that he'd seen an unusual woodpecker in the Bayou de View. Gallagher and Harrison each interviewed him and were convinced. They rushed to Arkansas and put in. The second day they were there -- Feb. 27, 2004 -- the two saw something burst into the sunshine. ''Look at all the white on its wings,'' Gallagher shouted. ''Ivory-bill!'' they both screamed. And it was gone. They wrote down their notes and drew sketches. Gallagher had a new ending for his book. Bobby got on the phone to his wife, Norma, and sobbed.
 Back at Cornell, Gallagher told John Fitzpatrick, the head of the school's lab of ornithology, and Fitzpatrick was persuaded by Gallagher's description. After quietly deploying a few pros (and then a lot of them) to poke around Arkansas, Fitzpatrick decided to throw the lab's prestige and best resources into the search. Meanwhile, Gene Sparling, the kayaker, had contacted the Nature Conservancy, the environmental group best known for buying undeveloped land. According to Scott Simon, the conservancy's state director, the group had helped save some 120,000 acres of this part of Arkansas, known as the Big Woods, a good bit of the habitat where the bird might be. 
 ''A few days after Feb. 27, Fitzpatrick called me,'' Simon told me, ''and we danced around trying to find out what the other knew.'' When they discovered that they knew the same thing, Simon became a partner and agreed to supply aerial photographs.
 ''Fitz emphasized the need to keep it quiet,'' Simon went on to tell me. ''They wanted to get in one full year of research uninterrupted and focused. For 14 months we did that. We called it the Inventory Project, and we talked about it in code.'' Eventually, when all the necessary groups were brought in, the Inventory Project had a 16-person management board. ''And it was really fun,'' Simon said. ''These people met on a conference call every Tuesday night at 8:30 p.m., Central Time.'' The ivory-bill was now the subject of the greatest supersecret mission in the history of ornithology.
 Cornell's swamp operation moved swiftly into place in Arkansas in the spring of 2004, and it is still there today. ''We have 36 people on the ground at any one time,'' the field supervisor, Elliott Swarthout, told me. ''Twenty-two are paid staff; 14 are volunteers.'' There are 28 Autonomous Recording Units, or A.R.U.'s, stationed at strategic flyways in the swamp. Hundreds of hours of audio recordings are routinely flown back to Cornell, where they are computer-searched for the patterns of the ivory-bill's two most famous sounds. There is the ''kent'' call, a funny bweep that sounds like a kid's toy horn. And there is the double knock -- two heavy bill blows into a tree, so close together they almost register as one sound.
 Scattered throughout the forest, time-lapse cameras are mounted on trees. The ornithologists have also drawn up grids and transepts and are systematically moving through the area with human eyes to conduct regular bird counts and spot roost holes. They have flown as many as four ultralight aircraft low over the swamp canopy to flush out ivory-bills. By the end of the first year of searching, Cornell had registered seven brief sightings of the bird. 
 In April 2004, a compelling piece of evidence came in. A computer scientist named David Luneau was videotaping in the swamp when his camera, fixed in the canoe and focused on his colleague, captured a large black-and-white woodpecker in the background. The woodpecker was half-hidden by a tree and was startled before making an out-of-focus escape into the swamp. The tape lasts four seconds. Fitzpatrick and 16 colleagues slowed down the tape and concluded that the fuzzy white patches appeared in the right places. 
 Fitzpatrick waited a full year, studying the habitat, before taking the discovery public. On April 28, 2005, the peer-reviewed 17-author paper was published with much fanfare by Science magazine on its Science Express Web site. Cornell and the Nature Conservancy launched www.ivory-bill.com and provided the media with easily downloaded images. The lab's marketing department fired off electronic press releases to 1,000 members of the media. Cornell's press office beefed up its presence in Washington and assisted in the media rollout of news items: 43 radio shows, 174 television programs and 459 newspaper articles. Overnight, the ivory-billed woodpecker became a generally accepted scientific fact.
 But not for long. Within weeks, both professional ornithologists and amateur birders were starting to have doubts. Four world-class bird specialists, led by Richard Prum of Yale University (who is a neighbor of mine) and including a renowned ivory-bill expert named Jerome Jackson, prepared a peer-reviewed paper, arguing that the Science magazine material did not rise to the standard of scientific evidence. It was a heavy charge. 
 But then last summer, as the authors prepared for publication, Cornell sent them some fresh and exciting evidence: recordings of kent calls and double knocks. Prum was temporarily won over, publicly stating that the ''thrilling new sound recordings provide clear and convincing evidence that the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct.'' The authors pulled their paper. 
 But as the months passed and no new evidence materialized, the doubters were heard from again. In January, Jackson published a direct attack on Cornell's science in The Auk, a respected bird publication. He charged, among other things, that Gallagher's original sighting suffered from what might be called ''story creep.'' Gallagher's book, published in May 2005, estimates his distance from the bird at ''less than 80 feet.'' In the July 2005 issue of Audubon magazine, his wife wrote that it was ''less than 70 feet.'' In an interview on ''60 Minutes'' in October, Gallagher said the bird was ''about 65 feet away.'' At one news conference, Fitzpatrick observed that if Gallagher and Harrison had not shouted, the bird ''might even have landed on the canoe.'' Jackson wrote: ''Observations can become more and more 'real' with the passing of time, as we forget the minor details and focus inwardly on the 'important' memory.'' He characterized Cornell's science, memorably, as ''faith-based ornithology.''
 The video has always been held out by Cornell as the most solid proof. After all, the pileated has white on the front undersides of the wings; the ivory-bill's wing is distinguished by a lot of white on the top trailing feathers. But in March of this year, David Allen Sibley, the author of ''Sibley's Guide to Birds,'' issued a frame-by-frame analysis of the video. (I know Sibley and have been in the woods with him on a few occasions.) Sibley's critique (which Cornell quickly rebutted) offered a completely different interpretation of the video. As Sibley saw it, the bird pushed back from the tree and rotated its wings furiously, scooping the air to gain initial flight. In other words, the ''topside trailing feathers'' you could see were actually the underside feathers of a wing strenuously wrenched backward in the act of getting airborne. The most famous ivory-billed woodpecker of the 21st century looked to David Allen Sibley like a pileated flying away.
 Early last month, I was back in the swamp, this time with Bobby Harrison, the ivory-bill rock star. If you're going to spend a day in a swamp, there is no one better to spend it with than Harrison. He had a nearly silent trolling motor, so we were able to penetrate the darkness of the swamp this time without a peep, except when we were beating off cottonmouth snakes with our paddles or portaging the whole rig over frustrating logjams. After three miles we came into an area called Blue Hole, and we puttered up the way just past a visible A.R.U. when suddenly: bam-bam. ''Did you hear that?'' Harrison said. I had. No question. We pulled the canoe onto a mud bank and stepped out. Visibility was becoming limited, not because of light but because the forest was in early bud. Leaves seemed to grow bigger by the hour, making the distant vistas close right up around us. As Harrison and I stood there, a large black-and-white bird came from behind us and soared into the green. ''Did you see that?'' he said. I did. His eyes tightened with disappointment. ''I couldn't tell,'' he said. Me either. 
 The problem with double knocks is that they are not that distinctive a sound. As Fitzpatrick himself told me: ''There are certain double-knocky sounds that come from wood ducks flapping wings on the water or running into each other.'' Two branches banging in the wind can make that sound, as well as a distant truck running over a manhole cover.
 When I was out in the canoe with Bill Tippit in February, we were disturbed by some amateur birders nearby, loudly discussing their dinner plans. Tippit hammered the side of our canoe twice with his paddle: bam-bam. The woods went so totally quiet that I might have been able to hear the birders scratching down the notes of their encounter if it hadn't been for Tippit's chuckling. 
 The first sentence of Gallagher's book reads, ''I think I've always been the kind of person who gets caught up in obsessive quests, most of which seem to involve birds.'' This sentiment of deep longing grips all those now on the prowl in Arkansas. ''It's been a fixation since early childhood,'' Fitzpatrick told me. If you accept the thinking of Jackson and Sibley, then it's possible to reread Gallagher's book not as a birder's adventure of discovery but as a fanatic's confession of self-delusion. He sometimes seems to undermine his own claims. Gallagher confesses to be prone, for example, to ''quixotic quests.'' The code name used for the bird during the Inventory Project was ''Elvis,'' an unusual choice given that Elvis is now someone seen by true believers but who is, well, extinct. In Gallagher's book, you can find Harrison's initial reaction to Luneau's video: ''It makes a bad Bigfoot movie look good.'' 
 Gallagher also tells the story of a ghost-chaser named Mary Scott, who had an Arkansas sighting a year before Gene Sparling, the kayaker, and was the first person to alert Gallagher to Sparling's account. Scott is a former lawyer who in midlife took up residence in a yurt near her parents' house in Long Beach, Calif. On one birding expedition, Scott took along a friend who knew an ''ivory-bill whisperer.'' With the clairvoyant on the cellphone, the search party learned that the bird wanted to be seen but was troubled by the group's ''energy.'' Scott eventually wandered off by herself and, she says, saw the bird. In fact, Scott has seen the bird quite a lot, so much so that she is openly scorned by other birders. ''I must admit,'' Gallagher nevertheless writes, ''I had come to believe strongly in her sighting.'' 
 Trace back the involvement of the Department of the Interior, Cornell University, the Nature Conservancy and a half-dozen other groups on the ground, and you'll find that all of them, arguably, owe their presence in Arkansas to a tent-dwelling courthouse dropout taking her guidance from an ivory-bill whisperer on a cellphone. 
 From the moment the Inventory Project began, according to Scott Simon, environmental organizations carefully laid out a fund-raising strategy. The Nature Conservancy immediately went to work raising money to buy or option some 18,500 more acres. ''Because 18,500 acres is about $28 million,'' Simon said, ''we went to about seven or eight key donors who have supported other projects. We shared everything with them, like you would with a board member.'' Simon contacted people like Marshall Field, the department-store owner; Roger Sant, a founder of AES Corporation; and John Norris of Lennox Corporation. They were briefed on the ivory-bill after being asked to sign confidentiality agreements. 
 The conservancy was raising millions. Cornell, meanwhile, had committed itself to an extensive ground research operation costing, Fitzpatrick told me, ''between half a million and a million dollars a year.'' At the time of the 2005 announcement of the discovery, Gale Norton, then the secretary of the interior, pledged more than $10 million in federal funds to help secure the bird's habitat. She called it the Corridor of Hope. 
 In his article in The Auk, Jackson describes the pressure this put on the bird sightings: ''How many major donors, how many granting agencies, how many government officials would contribute to the more than $10 million associated with this effort, if the message had been only, 'There might be ivory-billed woodpeckers out there'?'' The ivory-bill suddenly looked less like Audubon's stately woodpecker and more like Hammett's Maltese falcon. 
 The one sturdy argument on behalf of the ivory-bill is that there were repeated sightings, all by the Cornell team, during the secret mission. After Cornell got Gallagher's first sighting report, the ornithology lab excitedly sent down another experienced birder. He didn't see anything, but he returned with enough enthusiasm to inspire a half-dozen more birders to head down. Expanding the clique while still incubating the secret, Fitzpatrick dispatched ever-larger contingents.
 ''For me, it was just a recipe for misconception,'' Sibley told me recently. He and other birders believe this expanding pool of people being let in on a secret sighting may well have fed a kind of groupthink, leading to wishful sightings. But could such a thing happen among birders? Actually, it turns out, it does happen. A lot. In Sibley's introductory book, ''Sibley's Birding Basics'' (published long before these sightings), he warns against ''the overexcited birder'' and ''group hysteria.'' Sibley cites ''one very well documented case in California'' in which ''the first state record of the Sky Lark (a Eurasian species) was misidentified for days, and by hundreds of people, as the state's first Smith's Longspur.''
 ''There is a long list of well-studied effects,'' Sibley told me. ''There is peer pressure, the expectation of what they were there to do, as well as the authority effect of finding what the boss wants you to find.'' Most of the Cornell sightings occurred in the surge of joy immediately following Gallagher's return to Cornell. Since then, they have come less frequently. At the ivory-bill celebration in Brinkley, the organizer got up on the big night and said, ''We were hoping that tonight we'd be making news with a big announcement from Cornell, but apparently we won't be.''
 These two opposing views in birding now exist side by side. Each day more birders join the Prum-Jackson-Sibley side. But the Gallagher-Harrison-Sparling view is not yielding any ground. In March, I was invited to attend the annual dinner of the Explorers Club, at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York. The group is a grown-up version of the Boy Scouts, minus the solemnity of tying knots. In the hotel's Grand Ballroom, there was a visit from a llama and, of course, a march of penguins. The ivory-bill trio were onstage in black-tie to receive the coveted President's Award for Conservation. Around a banquet table loaded with exotic appetizers -- ''Sweet-and-Sour Bovine Penis Braised, With Testicular Partners'' and ''Mealworms With Durian Paste, on Toastettes'' -- the chat was about the thrill of the ivory-bill's rediscovery. Reports of Sibley's critique were still in the newspapers, yet there was not a peep of dissent to be heard near the ''Kangaroo Balls Bourguignon.'' 
 The bird was both seen and unseen. ''The Arkansas ivory-bill,'' Prum later told me, ''is the W.M.D. of ornithology.'' 
 One morning last month in Arkansas, a Fish and Wildlife clerk named Karen, sporting ivory-bill earrings, winked at Harrison, handed me a map of the swamp and told us she'd been hearing about an area called the George Tract. 
 The ground there was not exactly swamp -- just wet, full of sinks and little bogs. We didn't find much. We were just chatting when I asked Harrison if he could remember when he first got bit by ivory-bill fever.
 ''Oh, sure,'' he said, without pausing. ''It was after reading Don Moser's article in Life magazine in 1972. I was 17 years old.'' 
 I had been hearing about this article -- an account of a search for the ivory-bill -- since the festival in February. Gallagher had mentioned it in his talk, and I noticed how often it came up in lunchtime chats with visiting birders. ''I remember reading that Life magazine article,'' Fitzpatrick later told me. So I ordered the old magazine. From paragraph to paragraph, Moser's story quivers with melancholy and wistful longing, and as is typically found in Northern writing about the South, the author's prose goes all damp as he contemplates a landscape of things lost and, at twilight, almost found. 
 ''If the question of its existence remains unanswered it will continue to range the back country of the mind,'' Moser wrote of the ivory-bill, ''and those who wish to trail it there can find it in their visions.'' 
 ''It's a funny thing about that magazine,'' Harrison said to me in the bog. ''I cannot tell you how many people I stumble upon out here in the woods, and when we get to talking, I find out that they were inspired by the exact same article.''
 The greatest search for the ivory-bill was a 1935 expedition led by Arthur Allen, who, like Fitzpatrick, headed the Cornell ornithology lab. As Gallagher relates in his book, Allen and his team ventured into some virgin swamp in Louisiana known as the Singer Tract, owned by the company that bought such forests to make cabinets for its sewing machines. Allen not only saw the bird but also filmed it, photographed it and recorded it. Today, when Cornell scientists play the famous kent calls in Arkansas hoping to attract the bird, they are playing Allen's 70-year-old recordings.
 After the expedition, Allen sent his best student, a young man named James Tanner, down South to spend three years observing the bird. Out of that work came a slim book, still in print, and no ghost-bird chaser is without a dogeared copy. 
 The burden of this noble history is undeniable. ''No doubt about it, this is a venerable institution,'' Fitzpatrick said, ''and one of the things I'm doing is sitting in Arthur Allen's chair.'' But that burden carries much more than the reputation of Cornell University. If the ivory-bill is a story, it is one that reaches deep into America's most anguished history. 
 After the Civil War, when the South lay in smoldering ruins with no railroad or economy and with federal troops occupying many of those states until 1877, there were no jobs for the freed slaves or the poor whites living on the land. When Reconstruction ended, the Northern timber companies descended. ''Some 200 million acres of forest were cut in about 30 or 40 years,'' Scott Simon of the Nature Conservancy told me. (At one talk at the festival, a conservationist put up a slide depicting the annihilated ''range of the ivory-bill.'' It was essentially the Confederacy.) These primeval swamps and old-growth forests had been sheared into flat farmland by the time Allen and his party headed South to visit the last stand of virgin woods.
 It's hard to imagine that it's a coincidence that the story of the ivory-bill so often involves a serious Northern expert coming South to hook up with a smart-alecky good old boy from Dogpatch, and these two lighting out for the swamp to find the iconic bird. The stately Gallagher found Bobby Harrison, just as Allen and Tanner found an amusing local lawyer named Mason Spencer and a woodsman named J.J. Kuhn.
 After Tanner returned from his famous study, naturalists undertook a monumental project to save the ivory-bill and its habitat. Chicago Mill, a lumber company that had bought the timber rights to most of the 81,000-acre Singer Tract, expressed some willingness to sell them, since there was no labor to cut the wood at the beginning of World War II. But in 1943, as Phillip Hoose recounts in his book ''The Race to Save the Lord God Bird,'' negotiations with government officials and environmentalists broke down when company executives learned that German soldiers were being held in P.O.W. camps nearby and could be used to cut timber practically free. ''We are just money grubbers,'' the company's chairman explained with a long-lost candor. Despite the intervention of four governors, the last large virgin forest in Dixie was clear-cut by Nazis.
 After that, there has not been a single undisputed sighting of the ivory-bill. Some theorize that the bird, unable to find appropriate habitat, simply died out. Others disagree. ''The bird didn't just die,'' Harrison explained to me. ''He went -- somewhere.'' 
 A lot of birders believe this, and perhaps that is why the recent Arkansas sightings are hardly unique. Ivory-bills have been seen sporadically since the end of World War II. In 1950, Chipola River, Fla. In 1955, Homosassa Springs, Fla. In 1966, Big Thicket, Tex. In 1971, in Atchafalaya Basin, La. In 1975, near Baton Rouge. In Cuba in the 1980's. In 1999, Pearl River Swamp, La. Each sighting had mythic tones, and not just because the iconic bird could never be definitively seen. There was also that repetition of plot that marks the cultural myth -- the friendship of a Billy Yank and a Johnny Reb, the almost-confirmed sighting, talk of resurrection, sometimes a media circus or a fuzzy image. Some of these sightings led to vicious disagreements. The 1966 sighting by a very respected birder, John Dennis, ended brutally: ''Dennis wants to believe he saw something,'' intoned James Tanner himself. ''But he didn't.'' In 1971, George Lowery Jr. came forward with a story that he had befriended a local man who trained his dogs in the swamp. Lowery refused to identify his swamp-loving sidekick, who had given him two fuzzy Kodak Instamatic pictures of an ivory-bill on two different trees. Critics right away noticed that the ivory-bill had the exact same body posture in both pictures. The conclusion was that the bird was stuffed and put up in the tree. Lowery went to his death standing by his mysterious friend and the pictures. 
 ''Am I worried?'' Fitzpatrick mused. ''That if the ivory-bill is never seen again that people will look back and say, 'Fitzpatrick laid an egg'? No. I did the right thing to jump on the story and put resources on the ground. We continue to focus on this as a conservation story whether or not the bird decorates the treetops.'' After the disputed sighting in Texas in 1966, 84,550 acres became the Big Thicket National Preserve. The Nature Conservancy says it will be satisfied if this sighting has a similar ending. ''There may not be an ivory-bill there,'' said Steve McCormick, president of the conservancy, ''but it's a habitat that now and forever could sustain an ivory-bill.''
 The ivory-bill's habitat is this Edenic swamp, an old and majestic forest. The names of the areas where it has been sighted -- the Big Woods of Arkansas, the Big Thicket of Texas -- suggest large and wild habitats, crowded with senator trees and brimming with other life. The swamp's ivory-bill is the storied messenger bird. He is Noah's dove, surviving improbably after a catastrophe to bring us grace. Lord God Bird, forgive us our trespasses.
 Back three miles in the bayou with Bobby Harrison, the swamp air got a bit awkward. ''We heard a double knock,'' he said from the back of the canoe. ''That is so exciting.'' 
 ''Yeah, I heard it,'' I replied. Harrison brought up the double knock a half-dozen times on our way in. He was plumbing my level of enthusiasm. He was listening for that certain tremolo, the true believer's excitement. I was cradling Schrodinger's cat as delicately as possible. 
 ''That is such good news,'' he said. ''It is the first indication all season that I had that tells me the bird is still here.'' We dragged the canoe through a shallow part of the swamp. The sun was setting. ''I feel optimistic,'' he said.
 But the truth is, few of the people involved in the hunt feel all that optimistic anymore. ''It would be a shame if the bird is not there and a marvel if it is,'' McCormick confessed to me one day last month, ''but what I care most passionately about is the integrity of the ecosystem and the fact of its rebounding, even if the bird is not there.'' When I asked Fitzpatrick recently what he had learned after studying the ivory-bill for two years, he said, ''The bird is not that common.'' 
 Harrison attributed Fitzpatrick's slim finding to the Yankees' grids and transepts, which he mocked as a form of intellectual clear-cutting. ''The Cornell method is a bust,'' he told me, adding, ''They had a tiger hunt the other day. You know what a tiger hunt is? When the servants run through the woods banging pots and pans so the maharaja can walk in at the end and shoot the tiger.'' (Fitzpatrick prefers to call them saturation searches: ''Using 30-odd people spaced out in the swamp with G.P.S.'s so that anything that moves that day, we'll find.'') ''It just shows you how desperate they are,'' Harrison added. ''They'll never see the bird if they keep scaring it off.'' Harrison prefers the Tippit method, floating and sitting. Harrison has a camouflage rig that covers all of him and his canoe, leaving only his eyes to poke out of some fake leaves. ''I want to become part of the landscape,'' he said, as much a dream as a strategy.
 Since bird-watching season begins when the leaves fall off the trees, I asked Fitzpatrick if he intended to hit the swamps with the same ground operation this fall. ''The answer is probably no,'' he said. ''We will try to get more robotic. We'll use more technology without human effort.'' 
 The 22 paid staff members of this past winter will most likely be downsized to somewhere ''in the 3-to-5 range,'' he said. But Fitzpatrick affirmed Cornell's commitment to Arkansas. ''We'll be looking for years,'' he said. ''Maybe for the rest of my life.''

The Birth-Month Soccer Anomaly
 If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in next month's World Cup tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy quirk: elite soccer players are more likely to have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the later months. If you then examined the European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and professional ranks, you would find this quirk to be even more pronounced. On recent English teams, for instance, half of the elite teenage soccer players were born in January, February or March, with the other half spread out over the remaining 9 months. In Germany, 52 elite youth players were born in the first three months of the year, with just 4 players born in the last three.
What might account for this anomaly? Here are a few guesses: a) certain astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to have higher oxygen capacity, which increases soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents are more likely to conceive children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania; d) none of the above. 
 Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State University, says he believes strongly in ''none of the above.'' He is the ringleader of what might be called the Expert Performance Movement, a loose coalition of scholars trying to answer an important and seemingly primordial question: When someone is very good at a given thing, what is it that actually makes him good?
 Ericsson, who grew up in Sweden, studied nuclear engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to conduct his own research if he switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly 30 years ago, involved memory: training a person to hear and then repeat a random series of numbers. ''With the first subject, after about 20 hours of training, his digit span had risen from 7 to 20,'' Ericsson recalls. ''He kept improving, and after about 200 hours of training he had risen to over 80 numbers.''
 This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not genetically determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more of a cognitive exercise than an intuitive one. In other words, whatever innate differences two people may exhibit in their abilities to memorize, those differences are swamped by how well each person ''encodes'' the information. And the best way to learn how to encode information meaningfully, Ericsson determined, was a process known as deliberate practice. 
 Deliberate practice entails more than simply repeating a task -- playing a C-minor scale 100 times, for instance, or hitting tennis serves until your shoulder pops out of its socket. Rather, it involves setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome. 
 Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert performers in a wide range of pursuits, including soccer, golf, surgery, piano playing, Scrabble, writing, chess, software design, stock picking and darts. They gather all the data they can, not just performance statistics and biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with high achievers. 
 Their work, compiled in the ''Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance,'' a 900-page academic book that will be published next month, makes a rather startling assertion: the trait we commonly call talent is highly overrated. Or, put another way, expert performers -- whether in memory or surgery, ballet or computer programming -- are nearly always made, not born. And yes, practice does make perfect. These may be the sort of cliches that parents are fond of whispering to their children. But these particular cliches just happen to be true.
 Ericsson's research suggests a third cliche as well: when it comes to choosing a life path, you should do what you love -- because if you don't love it, you are unlikely to work hard enough to get very good. Most people naturally don't like to do things they aren't ''good'' at. So they often give up, telling themselves they simply don't possess the talent for math or skiing or the violin. But what they really lack is the desire to be good and to undertake the deliberate practice that would make them better. 
 ''I think the most general claim here,'' Ericsson says of his work, ''is that a lot of people believe there are some inherent limits they were born with. But there is surprisingly little hard evidence that anyone could attain any kind of exceptional performance without spending a lot of time perfecting it.'' This is not to say that all people have equal potential. Michael Jordan, even if he hadn't spent countless hours in the gym, would still have been a better basketball player than most of us. But without those hours in the gym, he would never have become the player he was.
 Ericsson's conclusions, if accurate, would seem to have broad applications. Students should be taught to follow their interests earlier in their schooling, the better to build up their skills and acquire meaningful feedback. Senior citizens should be encouraged to acquire new skills, especially those thought to require ''talents'' they previously believed they didn't possess. 
 And it would probably pay to rethink a great deal of medical training. Ericsson has noted that most doctors actually perform worse the longer they are out of medical school. Surgeons, however, are an exception. That's because they are constantly exposed to two key elements of deliberate practice: immediate feedback and specific goal-setting. 
 The same is not true for, say, a mammographer. When a doctor reads a mammogram, she doesn't know for certain if there is breast cancer or not. She will be able to know only weeks later, from a biopsy, or years later, when no cancer develops. Without meaningful feedback, a doctor's ability actually deteriorates over time. Ericsson suggests a new mode of training. ''Imagine a situation where a doctor could diagnose mammograms from old cases and immediately get feedback of the correct diagnosis for each case,'' he says. ''Working in such a learning environment, a doctor might see more different cancers in one day than in a couple of years of normal practice.''
 If nothing else, the insights of Ericsson and his Expert Performance compatriots can explain the riddle of why so many elite soccer players are born early in the year. 
 Since youth sports are organized by age bracket, teams inevitably have a cutoff birth date. In the European youth soccer leagues, the cutoff date is Dec. 31. So when a coach is assessing two players in the same age bracket, one who happened to have been born in January and the other in December, the player born in January is likely to be bigger, stronger, more mature. Guess which player the coach is more likely to pick? He may be mistaking maturity for ability, but he is making his selection nonetheless. And once chosen, those January-born players are the ones who, year after year, receive the training, the deliberate practice and the feedback -- to say nothing of the accompanying self-esteem -- that will turn them into elites.
 This may be bad news if you are a rabid soccer mom or dad whose child was born in the wrong month. But keep practicing: a child conceived on this Sunday in early May would probably be born by next February, giving you a considerably better chance of watching the 2030 World Cup from the family section.

ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY
 By Sonia Nazario.
 Illustrated. 291 pp. Random House. $26.95.
We tend to think of the desperate migrants who risk death to make it into the United States as adults. In fact, thousands of children make the journey as well, only instead of seeking work, they come in search of the parents who left them behind.
 The Los Angeles Times reporter Sonia Nazario humanizes these wayward children in ''Enrique's Journey.'' This painstakingly researched book is not just the story of Enrique, a teenager from Honduras whom Nazario first wrote about in a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper series from which this book springs. It is also an anthropology of the peripatetic youth bent on braving the obstacles that stand between their home villages and the North American cities where their mothers moved in search of jobs, money and the chance to better their family's lives back home. ''Enrique's Journey'' explores the unintended, and largely underreported, consequences of those choices. 
 Desperately poor, Enrique's mother left Honduras when he was 5 years old, planning to send money back from America and promising to return quickly. Years passed. Enrique was tossed between family members' homes; he turned to sniffing glue; the memory of his mother became an obsession. After more than a decade of waiting for her, Enrique set out for the North. But reality didn't live up to his expectations. His mother's absence had created a void her presence could never fill.
 Nazario begins, as Enrique did, in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Using her extensive interviews with him as her map, she retraces his steps, telling the story as though she had sat beside him on each step of his journey.
 It's adventure travel for masochists. ''I am not a brave person,'' Nazario writes at the outset. And yet the risks she took to integrate herself into the world of the migrants who ride atop northbound Central American trains -- ''el tren de la muerte,'' the train of death, as one is called -- suggest otherwise. Nazario and her fellow passengers fear rape, robbery and death at the hands of gangs, bandits and Mexican immigration authorities. She illustrates the horror by bringing in stories of other migrants she encountered, like Wendy, a 17-year-old raped by five gangsters, and Carlos Roberto Diaz Osorto, also 17, who lost a leg and a foot trying to jump a moving train.
 Nazario also pays homage to people who have dedicated their lives to aiding migrants. There is Olga Sanchez Martinez, who cares for those who've lost limbs in train accidents; villagers in Veracruz and Oaxaca who rush the trains with packages of food and clothing; a bishop who raises money to create a migrant shelter.
 A remarkable reporter, Nazario has immersed herself completely in this world, giving it depth and texture. In a church soup kitchen, ''two big fans spin to a stop, so everyone can hear grace,'' she writes in a typically vivid description. ''In the still air, the room turns hot, nearly suffocating; perspiration trickles down the migrants' faces and soaks their shirts. . . . Spoons of stew touch lips before bottoms hit the seats.''
 But although Nazario's reporter's instincts have served her well, the book still reads like a newspaper series. Facts, phrases and explanations occasionally echo 10 or 20 pages later, as if she were filling in readers who hadn't seen an earlier segment. The writing tends toward newspaper style: a breathtaking lead paragraph, a quick summation of what's happened so far, a series of statistics. But these stylistic flaws are generally cosmetic, and don't detract from Nazario's main argument. In the tradition of Jacob Riis, the late-19th-century photographer of immigrant life in New York City tenements, Nazario has illuminated the modern immigrant experience; with Enrique, she has given a voice and a face to these migrant children. 
 Nazario is critical of what she calls America's ''schizophrenic'' immigration policies, in which enforcement of immigration laws is weak and ''labor-intensive industries'' like agriculture and construction rely on cheap immigrant labor. Nothing will change, she argues, until we bolster native economies. Parents who migrate without their children and assume they can easily return to claim them are trapped by tightened border security that keeps undocumented workers stuck inside America as much as outside. This, she writes, has contributed to the dissolution of families and the rise of gangs and teen pregnancy. Enrique, like others who were left behind, is deeply resentful of his mother; in America, he continues to struggle with alcohol and substance abuse. He fights constantly with his family. ''You think that filling our bellies is the same thing as love,'' he tells an aunt who left his cousins to work in America. And yet, when Enrique's girlfriend in Honduras gives birth to their daughter, he urges her to leave the child behind and join him in America, repeating the cycle his mother began.

HEADLINE: Contra-Contraception

BYLINE: By Russell Shorto. 
Russell Shorto, a contributing writer, has written for the magazine about the anti-gay-marriage movement and religion in the workplace.

 BODY:
The English writer Daniel Defoe is best remembered today for creating the ultimate escapist fantasy, ''Robinson Crusoe,'' but in 1727 he sent the British public into a scandalous fit with the publication of a nonfiction work called ''Conjugal Lewdness: or, Matrimonial Whoredom.'' After apparently being asked to tone down the title for a subsequent edition, Defoe came up with a new one -- ''A Treatise Concerning the Use and Abuse of the Marriage Bed'' -- that only put a finer point on things. The book wasn't a tease, however. It was a moralizing lecture. After the wanton years that followed the restoration of the monarchy, a time when both theaters and brothels multiplied, social conservatism rooted itself in the English bosom. Self-appointed Christian morality police roamed the land, bent on restricting not only homosexuality and prostitution but also what went on between husbands and wives. 
It was this latter subject that Defoe chose to address. The sex act and sexual desire should not be separated from reproduction, he and others warned, else ''a man may, in effect, make a whore of his own wife.'' To highlight one type of then-current wickedness, Defoe gives a scene in which a young woman who is about to marry asks a friend for some ''recipes.'' ''Why, you little Devil, you would not take Physick to kill the child?'' the friend asks as she catches her drift. ''No,'' the young woman answers, ''but there may be Things to prevent Conception; an't there?'' The friend is scandalized and argues that the two amount to the same thing, but the bride to be dismisses her: ''I cannot understand your Niceties; I would not be with Child, that's all; there's no harm in that, I hope.'' One prime objective of England's Christian warriors in the 1720's was to stamp out what Defoe called ''the diabolical practice of attempting to prevent childbearing by physical preparations.'' 
 The wheels of history have a tendency to roll back over the same ground. For the past 33 years -- since, as they see it, the wanton era of the 1960's culminated in the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 -- American social conservatives have been on an unyielding campaign against abortion. But recently, as the conservative tide has continued to swell, this campaign has taken on a broader scope. Its true beginning point may not be Roe but Griswold v. Connecticut, the 1965 case that had the effect of legalizing contraception. ''We see a direct connection between the practice of contraception and the practice of abortion,'' says Judie Brown, president of the American Life League, an organization that has battled abortion for 27 years but that, like others, now has a larger mission. ''The mind-set that invites a couple to use contraception is an antichild mind-set,'' she told me. ''So when a baby is conceived accidentally, the couple already have this negative attitude toward the child. Therefore seeking an abortion is a natural outcome. We oppose all forms of contraception.''
 The American Life League is a lay Catholic organization, and for years -- especially since Pope Paul VI's ''Humanae Vitae'' encyclical of 1968 forbade ''any action which either before, at the moment of or after sexual intercourse, is specifically intended to prevent procreation'' -- being anti-contraception was largely a Catholic thing. Protestants and other non-Catholics tended to look on curiously as they took part in the general societywide acceptance of various forms of birth control. But no longer. Organizations like the Christian Medical and Dental Associations, which inject a mixture of religion and medicine into the social sphere, operate from a broadly Christian perspective that includes opposition to some forms of birth control. Edward R. Martin Jr., a lawyer for the public-interest law firm Americans United for Life, whose work includes seeking to restrict abortion at the state level and representing pharmacists who have refused to prescribe emergency contraception, told me: ''We see contraception and abortion as part of a mind-set that's worrisome in terms of respecting life. If you're trying to build a culture of life, then you have to start from the very beginning of life, from conception, and you have to include how we think and act with regard to sexuality and contraception.'' Dr. Joseph B. Stanford, who was appointed by President Bush in 2002 to the F.D.A.'s Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee despite (or perhaps because of) his opposition to contraception, sounded not a little like Daniel Defoe in a 1999 essay he wrote: ''Sexual union in marriage ought to be a complete giving of each spouse to the other, and when fertility (or potential fertility) is deliberately excluded from that giving I am convinced that something valuable is lost. A husband will sometimes begin to see his wife as an object of sexual pleasure who should always be available for gratification.'' 
 As with other efforts -- against gay marriage, stem cell research, cloning, assisted suicide -- the anti-birth-control campaign isn't centralized; it seems rather to be part of the evolution of the conservative movement. The subject is talked about in evangelical churches and is on the agenda at the major Bible-based conservative organizations like Focus on the Family and the Christian Coalition. It also has its point people in Congress -- including Representative Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland, Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey, Representative Joe Pitts and Representative Melissa Hart of Pennsylvania and Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma -- all Republicans who have led opposition to various forms of contraception. 
 R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, is considered one of the leading intellectual figures of evangelical Christianity in the U.S. In a December 2005 column in The Christian Post titled ''Can Christians Use Birth Control?'' he wrote: ''The effective separation of sex from procreation may be one of the most important defining marks of our age -- and one of the most ominous. This awareness is spreading among American evangelicals, and it threatens to set loose a firestorm.. . .A growing number of evangelicals are rethinking the issue of birth control -- and facing the hard questions posed by reproductive technologies.'' 
 It is difficult to state precisely when this rethinking began, but George W. Bush's victory in 2000, which was aided mightily by social conservatives, came around the same time that the abortion pill and the emergency contraception pill reached the market, and that convergence of events might be seen as the beginning of a new chapter in the culture war. State legislatures are debating dozens of bills surrounding emergency contraception, or the ''morning-after pill'': whether pharmacists have the right to refuse to fill orders; whether it should be made available over the counter; whether Catholic hospitals may decline to provide it to rape victims. To the dismay of many public-health officials, and following the will of conservative Christian organizations, the Bush administration has steadily moved the federal family-planning program in the direction of an abstinence-only-until-marriage program. Some conservative groups and some Republicans in Congress have waged a campaign against condoms in recent years, claiming they are less effective than popularly believed in preventing pregnancy and protecting against sexually transmitted diseases. Important international health experts say the Bush administration has used the government's program for AIDS relief to transmit its abstinence message overseas, de-emphasizing condoms and jeopardizing the health of large numbers of people, especially in Africa. A regulatory challenge has been filed with the F.D.A., and a push by some Republicans in Congress is under way to suspend the sale of the abortion pill (also known by the brand names RU-486 or Mifeprex) on the grounds that it is unsafe. The lead counsel in this challenge, however, admits the underlying motivation is opposition to abortion. Meanwhile, the abortion pill and the emergency contraception pill -- because of their ease of use, the mechanisms by which they work and the fact that they are taken after sex -- have blurred the line between contraception and abortion and have added a new wrinkle to the traditional anti-abortion movement. 
 Many Christians who are active in the evolving anti-birth-control arena state frankly that what links their efforts is a religious commitment to altering the moral landscape of the country. In particular, and not to put too fine a point on it, they want to change the way Americans have sex. Dr. Stanford, the F.D.A. adviser on reproductive-health drugs, proclaimed himself ''fully committed to promoting an understanding of human sexuality and procreation radically at odds with the prevailing views and practices of our contemporary culture.'' Focus on the Family posts a kind of contraceptive warning label on its Web site: ''Modern contraceptive inventions have given many an exaggerated sense of safety and prompted more people than ever before to move sexual expression outside the marriage boundary.'' Contraception, by this logic, encourages sexual promiscuity, sexual deviance (like homosexuality) and a preoccupation with sex that is unhealthful even within marriage. 
 It may be news to many people that contraception as a matter of right and public health is no longer a given, but politicians and those in the public health profession know it well. ''The linking of abortion and contraception is indicative of a larger agenda, which is putting sex back into the box, as something that happens only within marriage,'' says William Smith, vice president for public policy for the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States. Siecus has been around since 1964, and as a group that supports abortion rights, it is natural enemies with many organizations on the right, but its mission has changed in recent years, from doing things like promoting condoms as a way to combat AIDS to, now, fighting to maintain the very idea of birth control as a social good. ''Whether it's emergency contraception, sex education or abortion, anything that might be seen as facilitating sex outside a marital context is what they'd like to see obliterated,'' Smith says. 
 Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, an abortion rights Republican who has sponsored legislation that would require insurance companies to cover contraception, has seen a major change. ''Two decades or more ago, I don't think there was much of a divide on contraception and family planning,'' she says. ''It was one area both sides could agree on as a way to reduce unwanted pregnancies. Now it becomes embroiled in philosophical disputes.'' 
 The Guttmacher Institute, which like Siecus has been an advocate for birth control and sex education for decades, has also felt the shift. ''Ten years ago the fight was all about abortion,'' says Cynthia Dailard, a senior public-policy associate at Guttmacher. ''Increasingly, they have moved to attack and denigrate contraception. For those of us who work in the public health field, and respect longstanding public health principles -- that condoms reduce S.T.D.'s, that contraception is the most effective way to help people avoid unintended pregnancy -- it's extremely disheartening to think we may be set back decades.'' 
 It was a Friday afternoon at the end of August last year, with most of official Washington on vacation, when a press conference was called at F.D.A. headquarters in Rockville, Md. The occasion was a major drug announcement, but no one from the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research was in the room to hear Commissioner Lester M. Crawford declare that ''the agency is unable at this time to reach a decision on the approvability of the application.'' It was for Plan B.
 Plan B, the brand name for the most common form of emergency contraception, has been on the market since 1999 (another form, Preven, came on the market in 1998). The pill, which contains concentrated amounts of progestin, a hormone found in ordinary birth control pills, can prevent a pregnancy most effectively if taken within 72 hours of having sex. (The abortion pill, by contrast, can be taken up to 49 days after the beginning of the last menstrual period and causes the chemical abortion of a fetus.) Plan B's manufacturer applied in April 2003 for permission to sell Plan B over the counter. Reproductive and women's health professionals expected clear sailing for the drug (morning-after contraception has been available in some European countries for more than 20 years). Experts overwhelmingly considered it safe: in December 2003 the F.D.A.'s own joint advisory panel voted 28-0 that it was ''safe for use in the nonprescription setting'' and then voted 23 to 4 in favor of granting Plan B over-the-counter status. 
 The hope many people had for the drug was tied to an ugly number: 21. That is the number of abortions in the U.S. per year per 1,000 women of reproductive age, which puts the country at or near the top among developed nations. Put another way, according to a study released this past week by the Guttmacher Institute, there are 6.4 million pregnancies a year in the U.S., 3.1 million of which are unintended and 1.3 million of which end in abortion. In the seven years since the last such study, the overall unintended-pregnancy rate has remained unchanged; for women below the poverty level it increased 29 percent. If women had quick, easy access to a backup contraceptive, the thinking of Plan B proponents went, those rates -- and thus the abortion rate -- would drop. ''I saw it as a win-win situation, something that everyone on both sides of the abortion issue could support,'' says Dr. Susan F. Wood, who was at the time director of the Office of Women's Health at the F.D.A. ''I still don't get what happened.''
 One thing that happened, which Dr. Wood and many others may have failed to notice, was the change in conservative circles on the subject of contraception. At a White House press briefing in May of last year, three months before the F.D.A.'s nonruling on Plan B, Press Secretary Scott McClellan was asked four times by a WorldNetDaily correspondent, Les Kinsolving, if the president supported contraception. ''I think the president's views are very clear when it comes to building a culture of life,'' McClellan replied. Kinsolving said, ''If they were clear, I wouldn't have asked.'' McClellan replied: ''And if you want to ask those questions, that's fine. I'm just not going to dignify them with a response.'' This exchange caught the attention of bloggers and others. In July, a group of Democrats in Congress, led by Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York, sent the first of four letters to the president asking outright: ''Mr. President, do you support the right to use contraception?'' According to Representative Maloney's office, the White House has still not responded.
 For those who were listening, that silence may have given an indication of what had been going on inside the F.D.A. After the agency's advisory committees voted in favor of over-the-counter status for Plan B at the end of 2003, and after it was further approved at every level of the agency's professional staff, standard procedure would have been for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research arm of the F.D.A. to approve the application. But one member of the F.D.A.'s Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee had reservations: Dr. W. David Hager, a Christian conservative whom President Bush appointed to lead the panel in 2002. (After an outcry from women's groups, who were upset at Dr. Hager's writing that he used Jesus as a model for how he treated women in his gynecology practice, he was shifted from chairman of the panel to ordinary member.) Dr. Hager said he feared that if Plan B were freely available, it would increase sexual promiscuity among teenagers. F.D.A. staff members presented research showing that these fears were ungrounded: large-scale studies showed no increase in sexual activity when Plan B was available to them, and both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Society for Adolescent Medicine endorsed the switch to over-the-counter status. Others argued that the concern was outside the agency's purview: that the F.D.A.'s mandate was specifically limited to safety and did not extend to matters like whether a product might lead to people having more sex. Meanwhile a government report later found that Dr. Janet Woodcock, deputy commissioner for operations at the F.D.A., had also expressed a fear that making the drug available over the counter could lead to ''extreme promiscuous behaviors such as the medication taking on an 'urban legend' status that would lead adolescents to form sex-based cults centered around the use of Plan B.'' In May 2004, the F.D.A. rejected the finding of its scientific committees and denied the application, citing some of the reasons that Dr. Hager had expressed. 
 The drug's manufacturer reapplied two months later, this time for permission to sell it over the counter to women ages 16 and up, seemingly dealing with the issue of youth. Then, last August, Crawford made his announcement that the F.D.A. would delay its decision, a delay that could be indefinite. The announcement made headlines across the country. Dr. Wood, the F.D.A.'s women's health official, resigned in protest. Democrats in Congress asked for an investigation into what they felt was politics -- the anti-birth-control agenda of the politically powerful Christian right -- trumping science. The Government Accountability Office conducted a study of the events and issued a report last November concluding that the decision to reject the findings of the scientific advisory panel ''was not typical of the other 67 prescription-to-O.T.C. switch decisions made from 1994 to 2004.'' Currently, Senators Hillary Clinton and Patty Murray are holding up the nomination of Andrew von Eschenbach as F.D.A. commissioner until the F.D.A. issues a verdict on the drug. 
 The saga of emergency contraception and the F.D.A. is developing into one of the iconic clashes of the Bush era: a story of the entanglement of politics, science and religious beliefs. At the heart of it is the question of whether emergency contraception is or could be a form of abortion. ''The science is very clear that this does not cause an abortion,'' William Smith of Siecus told me. The same clarity exists on the other side. One of the ''common and intended modes of action'' of emergency contraception, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, ''is to prevent the development of the embryo, resulting in his or her death.'' Dr. Gene Rudd, an obstetrician-gynecologist who is associate executive director of the Christian Medical and Dental Associations, advises his group's member physicians that ''those who consider life to begin at fertilization recognize the pills' mechanisms as abortifacient,'' or inducing an abortion. 
 The issue is partly -- but only partly -- one of definition. According to the makers of the emergency contraception pill, it has three possible means of functioning. Most commonly, it stops ovulation -- the release of an egg --or prevents sperm from fertilizing an egg. In some cases, however, depending on where a woman is in her cycle, it may stop an already fertilized egg from attaching to the uterine wall. In such a situation, for those who believe that life -- and thus also pregnancy -- begins at the moment of fertilization, it would indeed function as an abortifacient. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, however, pregnancy begins not at fertilization but at implantation. The medical thinking behind this definition has to do with the fact that implantation is the moment when a woman's body begins to nurture the fertilized egg. The roughly one-half of all fertilized eggs that never attach to a uterine wall are thus not generally considered to be tiny humans -- ensouled beings -- that died but rather fertilized eggs that did not turn into pregnancies. Federal regulations enacted during the Bush administration agree with this, stating, ''Pregnancy encompasses the period of time from implantation until delivery.''
 People are, of course, perfectly within their rights to believe that pregnancy begins when sperm meets egg. And it is reasonable for groups like the Christian Medical and Dental Associations, Focus on the Family and the American Life League to want to alert their members that something billed as contraception might actually have a function that runs counter to their beliefs. But there are two twists. One is that emergency contraception may not actually work as an abortifacient. ''There is no direct evidence that it blocks implantation,'' Dr. Wood says. ''We can't tell for sure because very little research has been done on direct implantation of human eggs. You run into moral problems doing research on a woman's body and a human embryo. And since half of all fertilized eggs do not implant anyway, it would be difficult to know if this was the mechanism responsible.'' Still, if it's even possible for emergency contraception to stop implantation, then it's right for Dr. Rudd of the C.M.D.A. to advise his group's member physicians, ''Regardless of what an assembly of experts define, or fail to define, as the beginning of pregnancy, if a patient retains the moral conviction that life begins at fertilization, she must be made aware of information relevant to that conviction.'' 
 But the other twist is that emergency contraception apparently works in a manner similar to that of the ordinary birth control pill. That is to say, the pill, which contains the hormone progestin, also has three possible means of operation: by stopping ovulation, preventing fertilization or impeding implantation. If emergency contraception is a potential abortifacient, then the same would seem to be true for the pill, which tens of millions of women have taken over the past several decades. Dr. Rudd disputed this. ''The scientific evidence is that emergency contraception is more likely to have a post-fertility effect than the routine birth control,'' he told me. But Dr. James Trussell, director of the Office of Population Research at Princeton University and one of the world's leading experts on contraception, said: ''That is completely wrong. The evidence is about the same for all hormonal methods of contraception. We can't rule out a post-fertility effect for Plan B, and the same is true for the birth control pill.'' 
 What's more, Dr. Trussell added: ''There is evidence that there is a contraceptive effect of breast feeding after fertilization. While a woman is breast feeding, the first ovulation is characterized by a short luteal phase, or second half of the cycle. It's thought that because of that, implantation does not occur.'' In other words, if the emergency contraception pill causes abortions by blocking implantation, then by the same definition breast feeding may as well. Besides that, the intrauterine device, or IUD, can alter the lining of the uterus and, in theory, prevent implantation. 
 Ron Stephens is both a pharmacist and a Republican state legislator in Illinois, one of the states that are currently battlegrounds between pharmacists who claim the right to refuse to fill prescriptions for emergency contraceptives and women's and civil rights groups that argue that pharmacists must fill all prescriptions presented to them. Stephens not only supports the pharmacists' right of refusal but he also refuses to fill prescriptions for emergency contraception himself. He does, however, fill prescriptions for the birth control pill. When I asked him recently to explain his thinking on the two drugs, he said: ''It's the difference between stopping a pregnancy from happening and ending a pregnancy. My understanding of the science is that the morning-after pill can end a pregnancy, whereas birth control pills will make a woman's body believe she is already pregnant so that the egg will not be fertilized.'' And what if studies show that, in fact, both drugs can prevent implantation? ''Everyone has their natural prejudice,'' Stephens replied. ''I'm going to understand it my way, and the issue is that you should not be forced to do something you believe is immoral.'' 
 If the pill and the IUD may prevent implantation, and if implantation is where anti-abortion groups draw the line, why haven't such groups railed against them for decades? Some have, but they got no traction. What happened, over the past 40 years, is that contraception became an accepted fact of life, and those who were opposed to it found themselves residing on the outer fringe. 
 In the current, evolving movement against contraception, therefore, some groups soft-pedal their position. ''Concerned Women for America does not take a position regarding birth control,'' Wendy Wright, president of that influential, 500,000-member, biblically-based organization, told me. She went on to say, however, that C.W.A. does ''educate regarding how certain birth control methods operate.'' Specifically, the group offers a brochure titled ''High-Tech Birth Control: Health Care or Health Risk?'' to those who call seeking guidance. Most methods of birth control can pose health risks. A 2005 World Health Organization study, for instance, found a connection between some forms of the pill and cancer. But the C.W.A. brochure goes well beyond this. Its section on emergency contraception advises that ''its main function is to abort a living human embryo.'' One function of the birth control pill, it states, is to induce ''a chemical abortion.'' The section on the IUD indicates none of its practical benefits (its 99 percent effectiveness in preventing pregnancy, its reversibility) and consists mostly of a litany of health complications, many of which health experts refute. 
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 98 percent of all women who have ever had intercourse have used at least one contraceptive method. Worldwide, about 76 million women currently use the birth control pill. It would be suicide for an organization that hopes to influence public policy to assert outright opposition to contraception. Instead, attacks are mostly around the periphery of the issue: on the health aspects of various forms of contraception, on the mechanism by which they work, on the efficacy of certain methods. 
 Why is this happening? What's the nature of the opposition to something that has become so basic a part of modern life? 
 One starting point is the Catholic Church, and especially Pope John Paul II, whose personal and philosophical magnetism revitalized Catholics around the world, especially the young. A series of reflections the pope gave between 1979 and 1984 on the ''theology of the body'' -- his vision of the integrated physical, mental and spiritual human -- has become a whole method of study within the church. 
 The pope was a trained philosopher, and the actual text of his addresses on the topic can be dense: ''Masculinity and femininity -- namely, sex -- is the original sign of a creative donation and an awareness on the part of man, male-female, of a gift lived in an original way.'' But his words have been unpacked and pored over by theologians and students, and they have shaped a new approach to sex that is, in many ways, old. Kimberly Zenarolla, for one, is applying the theology of the body to the American political sphere. She is the director of strategic development for the National Pro-Life Action Center, a two-year-old organization with 10,000 members that lobbies on abortion, euthanasia, stem cell research and contraception. She's also a single 34-year-old who lives in Washington with, as she put it, ''a group of young professionals who are living the countercultural message of chastity to its fullest expression.'' 
 Zenarolla told me she converted to Catholicism two years ago: ''I tell people I became Catholic because of the church's teaching on contraception. We are opposed to sex before marriage and contraception within marriage. We believe that the sexual act is meant to be a complete giving of self. Of course its purpose is procreation, but the church also affirms the unitive aspect: it brings a couple together. By using contraception, they are not allowing the fullness of their expression of love. To frustrate the procreative potential ends up harming the relationship.'' 
 The Catholic Church sanctions ''natural family planning,'' otherwise known as the rhythm method, but it holds that artificial means of contraception lead people to see the body as an instrument, reducing human dignity and making them slaves to their desires. As Pope Benedict XVI wrote when he was Cardinal Ratzinger, ''Contraception and abortion both have their roots in [a] depersonalized and utilitarian view of sexuality and procreation -- which in turn is based on a truncated notion of man and his freedom.'' American Catholics have overwhelmingly disagreed: a Harris Poll in 2005, for instance, found that 90 percent of Catholics (as compared with 93 percent of all Americans) support the use of contraception. (On April 23, a Vatican spokesman indicated that Pope Benedict XVI would soon issue a new document on condoms, which some people have speculated could for the first time give the church's blessing to the use of condoms to prevent the spread of disease, but not intentionally as a form of contraception. This may seem a fine distinction, but Vatican watchers say that the church could adopt it as a lesser-of-two-evils principle.) 
 Further, the church holds that contraception and in vitro fertilization are two sides of the same coin: both are attempts to manipulate sexuality to serve the selfish demands of the individual. ''I can sympathize with a couple who can't conceive and desperately want a child,'' Zenarolla says. ''But if you examine in vitro fertilization, you begin to see what an objectification of the body it is. Today there are 400,000 leftover frozen embryos. That clump of cells is a human being, with its own DNA. Whenever we take it out of the safe harbor of its mother's womb, it opens up life to manipulation and control: 'I want a boy with blue eyes and no diseases.''' The objectification of the human, she says, then transfers to the child. ''It leads to eugenics,'' Zenarolla told me, ''to wanting to get rid of people who have defects. It's part of the devaluation of human beings.'' 
 From this perspective -- essentially that of the strict Catholic -- this is the dark future toward which secular society is heading. Bishop John W. Yanta of the Diocese of Amarillo, Tex., who oversees an organization founded last year to train priests in the ''Gospel of Life,'' has called contraception ''intrinsically evil'' and ''a big part of the culture of death.'' 
 Some Protestants have come to a similar view recently. Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, explains the evolution of modern evangelical thought on contraception this way: ''When the pill came out, evangelicals were very much a part of mainstream American culture, and like others they saw technology as a gift. There was a vaccine to fight polio. The pill was seen in the same light. I think evangelicals thought, Catholics can't use it, but we can: aren't we lucky?'' 
 But then, from this perspective, the pill began to do terrible damage. ''I cannot imagine any development in human history, after the Fall, that has had a greater impact on human beings than the pill,'' Mohler continued. ''It became almost an assured form of contraception, something humans had never encountered before in history. Prior to it, every time a couple had sex, there was a good chance of pregnancy. Once that is removed, the entire horizon of the sexual act changes. I think there could be no question that the pill gave incredible license to everything from adultery and affairs to premarital sex and within marriage to a separation of the sex act and procreation.''
 That may be a distinctly minority position, but some who work in the public health field acknowledge that the social conservatives have a point. ''I think the left missed something in the last couple of decades,'' says Sarah Brown, president of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, which positions itself as a moderate voice in the heated world of reproductive politics. ''With the advent of oral contraception, I think there was this great sense that we had a solution to the problem of unintended pregnancy. But that is a medical model. I think the thing that was missed was that sex and pregnancy and relationships aren't just a health issue. They are really about family and gender and religion and values. And what the right did was move in and say we're not just talking about body parts.''
 Mohler says the awareness of the damage being caused by what he and others call ''the contraceptive mentality'' is felt most acutely today by younger evangelicals: ''I detect a huge shift. Students on our campus are intensely concerned. Not a week goes by that I do not get contacted by pastors about the issue. There are active debates going on. It's one of the things that may serve to divide evangelicalism.'' 
 Eventually, all roads lead to abortion. Once, the definition of abortion was simple -- a surgical procedure to extract a fetus -- and with the advent of technology that allowed imaging of the fetus within the womb, abortion opponents found they had a powerful tool; photographs of ''preborn babies'' with human features were common in anti-abortion campaigns. Building on this, and mindful of the difficulty of overturning Roe, they developed an incremental strategy for containing abortion, which has been very effective. Last year, 52 state laws were passed restricting abortion. Currently, more than 100 new state measures are being considered that would limit the procedure, either by making it more difficult to obtain an abortion or by compelling women to reconsider. Nationally, a bill called the Fetal Pain Awareness Act, sponsored by Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, would require a woman seeking an abortion to be told that, as of 20 weeks, a fetus can feel pain, and that she be offered the option of providing it with painkillers. It has not gotten through Congress, and the science of the ''pain age'' is hotly disputed, but four states have adopted similar legislation. The Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which President Bush signed in 2004, makes a violent attack on a pregnant woman two crimes: one on the woman and one on her unborn child. It was denounced by abortion rights groups as a step toward granting full legal status to a fetus. 
 This slow, steady campaign has made an impact on the country at large: polls show that while most people still support Roe, they have deep misgivings about abortion and tend to support restrictions on it, like parental consent and late-term (or partial-birth) bans. One threat to this strategy, according to some on the right, is South Dakota's passage of an abortion ban, which is meant as a direct challenge to Roe.
 But the new abortion and contraceptive drugs have changed the dynamic as well. Because the abortion pill operates before a fetus has developed babylike features, it ''takes away some ammunition'' from the anti-abortion advocates, says Cynthia Dailard of the Guttmacher Institute. Imaging technology helped anti-abortion forces to personify the fetus, and recent tactics that abortion foes have pursued tend to be focused on an older fetus. Such is the case with the Partial Birth Abortion law, which President Bush signed in 2003. It was subsequently declared unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court will take it up again later this year. The new drugs, however, threaten to undercut such efforts. The battle line, in other words, is shifting backward, from viability to implantation. The abortion pill, which has been on the market since 2000, is under attack, with a group of Republicans in Congress calling for its suspension, in the wake of the deaths of five women who took it. 
 Democrats, meanwhile, have had their difficulty with the abortion issue, and their new hopes are pinned to a strategy that focuses on contraception as a way to reduce unintended pregnancy. Last month, Senators Harry Reid and Hillary Clinton -- an anti-abortion Democrat and an abortion rights Democrat -- introduced legislation that would require insurance companies to cover contraceptives. In part, the idea is to force Republicans to support contraception or be branded as reactionaries. The conservative counter was that giving even more government backing to emergency contraception and other escape hatches from unwanted pregnancy will lead to a new wave of sexual promiscuity. An editorial in the conservative magazine Human Events characterized the effect of such legislation as ''enabling more low-income women to have consequence-free sex.''
 Some not-very-attentive college kids spending spring break in Fort Lauderdale got a shock when they wandered into a tent on the beach last March. The sign welcoming passers-by actually said, ''Girls Gone Mild.'' Inside they found a few dozen young people drinking bottled water, some wearing T-shirts that said, ''Pet Your Dog, Not Your Date,'' others perusing a chart about S.T.D.'s. 
 If there is a place where anti-birth-control conservatives speak their subtext regarding sex, it is in the abstinence movement, where the message is ''just don't do it.'' Federal support for abstinence education in schools -- which teaches kids the benefits of saving their virginity until marriage -- began in 1981, but the program muddled along for years and was tangled for a time in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union that charged that it was explicitly Christian in context. Under President Bush, spending increased significantly: the 2007 budget calls for $204 million to support abstinence programs (up from $80 million in 2001). 
 Leslee Unruh, a 51-year-old former motivational speaker who says that her life was transformed in 1984 by the psychological devastation wrought by having an abortion, is the doyenne of the abstinence movement. She has dedicated herself to fostering in teenagers a holistic approach to relationships. Like many in the abstinence movement, Unruh says she believes that society is unhealthily focused on sex and that dwelling on contraception makes it worse. ''I see the problem as a lack of teaching about relationships: how to bond with the person you're going to have a relationship with, so that it's something that's good for you,'' she says. ''We teach kids it doesn't have to be physical.'' 
 In addition to providing an information center for the abstinence industry that has blossomed in recent years, she takes her message directly to kids. Besides ''Girls Gone Mild,'' she sponsors ''Purity Balls,'' which fathers attend with their teenage daughters. ''We think the relationship between fathers and their daughters is the key,'' she told me. At the purity ball, a father gives a ''purity ring'' to his daughter -- a symbol of the promise she makes to maintain her virginity for her future husband. Then, during her marriage ceremony, the daughter gives the ring to her new husband. Abstinence Clearinghouse's Web site advertises the purity ball as an event ''which celebrates your 'little girl' and her gift of sexual purity.'' 
 The intellectual force behind the abstinence-education movement is Robert Rector, senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. Rector wrote some of the federal legislation mandating abstinence education, and he worked on a number of studies that purport to demonstrate its effectiveness. One component of abstinence education is the ''virginity pledge,'' and Rector is an author of one study that concluded that teenagers who take virginity pledges ''have substantially improved life outcomes,'' and another that showed that ''sexually active teenagers are more likely to be depressed and to attempt suicide.'' 
 The idea of promoting abstinence over comprehensive sex education (which includes information on various forms of contraception and how to use them) gets to the core of the expanded conservative approach to birth control issues. It really is all about sex. ''There are two philosophies of sexuality,'' Rector told me. ''One regards it as primarily physical and all about physical pleasure. Therefore, the idea is to have lots of physical pleasure without acquiring disease or getting pregnant. The other is primarily moral and psychological in nature, and stresses that this is the part of sex that's rewarding and important.''
 Rector says that abstinence programs can't properly be combined with other elements in a comprehensive sex education program because the message is lost when a teacher says: ''One option you might want to consider is abstaining. Now let's talk about diaphragms.'' 
 Abstinence education, meanwhile, gets withering criticism from the other side. ''There is still not a single, sound peer-reviewed study that shows abstinence programs work,'' says William Smith of Siecus. Peter Bearman, director of the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy at Columbia University, who has analyzed virginity pledge programs including Rector's, says: ''The money being poured into these programs is out of control. And the thing is this is not about public health. It's a moral revolution. The goal is not stopping unwanted pregnancy but stopping sexual expression.'' 
 A December 2004 report on federally financed abstinence-only programs conducted by the office of Representative Henry Waxman, Democrat of California, charged that the major programs presented misleading information about health (one curriculum quoted in the report stated that ''condoms fail to prevent H.I.V. approximately 31 percent of the time''), state beliefs as facts (the report cited a curriculum that refers to a 43-day-old fetus as a ''thinking person'') and give outmoded stereotypes of the sexes. 
 All parents struggle with how to shield their children from the excesses of popular culture, and not surprisingly, surveys show that most want teenagers to delay first intercourse. But by wide margins they also say kids should be taught about contraceptives. A poll released in 2004 by National Public Radio, the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government found, for example, that 95 percent of parents think that schools should encourage teenagers to wait until they are older to have sex, and also that 94 percent think that kids should learn about birth control in school.
 The Bush administration's point man on abstinence -- Jeffrey Trimbath, the director of Abstinence Education in the Family and Youth Services Bureau of the Department of Health and Human Services -- declined through a spokesman to speak with me and referred me instead to Rector. Rector sought to refute the Waxman report, saying that some of what was cited as flawed information in curricula did not come from abstinence curricula at all, but from other sources. The first major evaluation of abstinence education -- a Congressionally-authorized study being conducted by Mathematica Policy Research -- is due to be completed later this year. 
 Abstinence has also become a primary element of Pepfar, President Bush's overseas AIDS relief program -- with, some experts say, disastrous results. The Government Accountability Office released a study in April that found that in many countries administrators were forced to cut funds intended to fight mother-to-child H.I.V. infection in order to finance abstinence programs. Stephen Lewis, the United Nations special envoy for H.I.V./AIDS in Africa, who had previously charged that the Bush program put ''significant numbers'' of people in Africa at risk, told me: ''I feel vindicated by the G.A.O. study. I think it raises legitimate questions about the disproportionate attention given to abstinence as opposed to condoms. At this moment, even the Catholic Church is reconsidering condoms.'' On April 7, the State Department issued its own response to the G.A.O. study, in which it claimed that as a result of approaches like the Bush administration's ''ABC policy'' -- promoting ''abstinence'' and ''being faithful,'' then ''condoms'' -- H.I.V. transmission has fallen in Uganda, Zimbabwe and Kenya and ''male faithfulness'' has increased. 
 On the domestic front, the rise in abstinence education has been paralleled by a tendency on the part of some conservatives to denigrate condoms. Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who is also an obstetrician, has led a campaign to force condom makers to indicate on their labels that they may not prevent certain S.T.D.'s, specifically the human papillomavirus. In 2001, when he was in the House of Representatives, he issued a press release entitled ''Condoms Do Not Prevent Most S.T.D.'s.'' Sex educators say this is a twisting of data to suit an ideologically driven anti-sex agenda. ''An N.I.H. panel said condoms are impermeable to even the smallest S.T.D. viruses,'' Cynthia Dailard of Guttmacher says. 
 Senator Coburn told me that he's not anti-birth-control: ''I'm not a no-condom person. I prescribe tons of birth control products. But that's only one-half of the issue. The other half is preventing S.T.D.'s.'' This is not the message of the federal abstinence initiative, however. The emphasis there is squarely on promoting a moral framework that puts sexuality in a particular place. As the 2007 federal guidelines for program financing state, ''It is required that the abstinence education curriculum teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual activity.'' 
 Social conservatives in the U.S. seem to be moving in the opposite direction from much of the rest of the world. At least 12 countries have liberalized abortion laws in recent years. Emergency contraception is currently available without a prescription in more than 40 countries. In much of Western Europe, abortion and contraception are available and fully covered by insurance. 
 The dark side of this, according to some commentators, is the declining birth rate in Europe. It takes an average of 2.1 children per woman to keep a population constant. Italy and Spain are tied for the lowest fertility rate in Western Europe, at 1.28. Even Ireland, the country with the highest birth rate, at 1.86, is suffering a population drain. (The U.S. rate is 2.09.) From 1994 to 2004, the average age at which European women became mothers rose by about 16 months, to 28.2. This, according to social conservatives, is the black hole into which the contraceptive mentality is drawn. As the Canadian priest Raymond J. de Souza wrote in National Review in 2004, ''If children are a sign of hope in the future, Europe -- and to a lesser extent Canada, Australia and the United States -- is losing its will to live.''
 This would seem to be a bind, because the benefits of family planning are profound: couples can organize their lives, financially and otherwise, when they are able to choose when to have children and how many to have. And, around the world, countries in which abortion is legal and contraception is widely available tend to rank among the lowest in rate of abortion, while those that outlaw abortion -- notably in Central and South America and Africa -- have rates that are among the highest. According to Stanley K. Henshaw of the Guttmacher Institute, recent drops in abortion rates in Eastern Europe are due to improved access to contraceptives. The U.S. falls somewhere in the middle in rate of abortion: at 21 per 1,000 women of reproductive age, it is roughly on par with Nigeria (25), much better than Peru (56) but far worse than the Netherlands (9).
 The Netherlands, where the teen pregnancy rate also ranks among the lowest in the world, has long been of interest to sex educators in the U.S. for the frankness of its approach. The national sex education course, called Long Live Love, begins at age 13. One of its hallmarks has been dubbed ''Double Dutch'' -- encouraging the use of both condoms and birth control pills. ''It's proven successful,'' says Margo Mulder of STI AIDS Netherlands, the Dutch health education center. ''It shows that when you discuss contraception and protection with students, they actually are careful. And I know that some people in the U.S. say that when you promote contraception, you're also promoting sex, but we've found that when you educate people, they don't have sex earlier. They think about it. So you're not promoting sex, you're helping them to be rational about doing it.'' 
 The problem with this, as far as American social conservatives are concerned, is that it treats symptoms rather than what they see as the underlying disease: an outlook that is focused on the individual at the expense of family and society. Their ultimate goal is not a number -- the percentage of abortions or unintended pregnancies -- but an ideal, a way for people to think and behave. As Mohler says of the Dutch approach in particular: ''The idea is to completely sever the sex act from reproduction, and then train teens to do it. It treats sex as a morally meaningless act. I find it profoundly anti-humanistic.'' 
 While Americans as a whole don't hold such a dark view of comprehensive sex education, many do feel there's something wrong with a strictly clinical approach. This ambivalence, according to Sarah Brown of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, gets to the root of the problem and may explain the numbers. ''One of the things I'm most often asked is why the abortion and unintended pregnancy rates are so much lower in Europe,'' she says. ''People talk about the easy access to contraception there, but I think it's really a matter of the underlying social norms. In Europe, these things are in the open, and the only issue is to be careful. Here in the U.S., people are still arguing about whether it's O.K. to have sex.''

HEADLINE: Rip Torn Won't Go Gentle Into That Good Night

BYLINE: By Susan Dominus. 
Susan Dominus is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
When Rip Torn arrived at a party in Aspen, Colo., one evening in March, he looked somewhat lost. Most of the guests at the event, primarily comedians and fellow actors, were wearing designer jeans and wool sweaters, but Torn had on a suit and tie. When he is at home in New York, Torn lets himself slump around comfortably, unshaven in flannel shirts and suspenders and jeans, looking like the aging Texas hill-country native he is. For public appearances, however, he dresses formally, throws his shoulders back and gives himself at least an extra inch, with a near-military carriage. Tonight, it seemed, the general had shown up at the wrong party. 
After a few moments, as he got his bearings, Torn crossed paths with the actor Jeffrey Tambor, a former colleague from the 1990's HBO series ''The Larry Sanders Show,'' in which Torn starred as a fiercely protective, tough-as-nails talk-show producer named Artie. The two men embraced warmly. ''You're working so much,'' Tambor said, congratulating Torn on a recent flurry of film roles. He then thanked Torn for a thoughtful gesture: when Tambor performed on Broadway last year, Torn, a veteran of the stage, sent him an old-fashioned sign of appreciation, a one-word telegram that simply read ''Bravo.'' ''That really meant a lot,'' Tambor said.
 Torn seemed embarrassed by the compliment. ''Oh, my father used to say, 'You blankety-blank actors, it's nothing but a mutual admiration society,''' he said, his characteristic benevolent gruffness on display. ''I said: 'It better be. It's like the Army -- you get out there, they take a shot at you.'''
 Torn's speech is full of vague references to menacing ''thems'' and ''theys'' -- the producers, the public, the Nixon administration. Never mind that he is stopped regularly on the street by fellow performers, young and old, who are eager to pay their respects, to shake his hand heartily and to speak of his performances with reverence. (Tambor, for one, calls Torn ''a walking acting lesson.'') Rather than see himself, at 75, as a triumphant monarch of the trade, Torn fancies himself a besieged general, the profession itself a bloody battle. He complains frequently and bitterly about how hard it is to make a living in the field, describing his career as ''a scramble for existence.'' Having started out as a fiery actor in his mid-20's, Torn has replaced his youthful spirit of rebellion with the only slightly more composed indignation of someone who is permanently wounded by the accumulation of slights he feels he has suffered over the decades.
 This sense of persecution, which Torn exhibits frequently, is all the more surprising considering that he should, by rights, be appreciating that rare Hollywood phenomenon: a late-career revival. In the past two years, Torn has been in no fewer than eight films, an impressive number for any actor, much less one who spent most of the 80's virtually out of the spotlight. In the 70's, he was a darkly sexy star in the Jack Nicholson mold; later on, he built a reputation as a strong, serious character actor. But it wasn't until the mid-90's that Torn returned to prominence, earning critical success as a skilled comic performer on ''Larry Sanders'' and going on to play a series of bossy tough guys in cruder commercial comedies like ''Men in Black'' and ''Dodgeball'' -- both of them blockbuster hits among the under-18 crowd.
 More recently, Torn's talents as a dramatic actor have earned him recognition of a sort he hasn't seen since ''Cross Creek,'' a 1983 film for which he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Last year, he received rave reviews as an aging, egomaniacal record producer in ''Forty Shades of Blue,'' which won the top prize at Sundance. Later this month, he will be featured at Cannes in ''Marie Antoinette,'' a period piece with contemporary pacing and a modern soundtrack. The film's director, Sofia Coppola, who has already made one successful film (''Lost in Translation'') that turned on the unexpected sex appeal of a rumpled older man, cast Torn as a lady-killing Louis XV.
 No one has more Hollywood insider credentials right now than Coppola, but that doesn't mean Torn considers himself anointed, at last. To remain driven, he seems to crave the drama of the struggle, or the perception of it at least. At the party in Aspen, when the comedian Dave Chappelle ran into Torn, Chappelle broke out into a soft, wide smile and put his hand out by way of introduction. ''Man, you are excellent in everything you do, everything,'' he said. Torn, overcome by emotion, pulled him into a full embrace. ''They want you to be their Silly Putty,'' he warned, perhaps seeing in Chappelle -- who had recently walked away from a lucrative deal with Comedy Central over creative differences -- a younger version of his defiant self. ''That was your show, your talent, and not only do I respect you, but the whole nation respects you.''
 And with that, the general signed off.
 Torn lives with his third wife, the actress Amy Wright, and their two children (he has four others) on Washington Square Park, in a top-floor apartment. A cozy, rambling space, the apartment belonged in the 1920's to Wright's family and still has some of the furnishings from that era: Tiffany lamps, painted shades, quilted throws covering comfortable love seats and the original 1921 stove on which Wright, during a recent visit, was making dinner, as Torn sat at the small kitchen table.
 In Torn today, there is little sign of the edgy womanizers he played in the 70's -- no aging-boomer pony tail, no shades or even expensive-looking glasses. He sometimes wears a hunting cap, or a down vest; his fingernails are often dirty from the gardening that occupies most of his time at his weekend home in Connecticut. Over dinner, as he recalled his long performing past, Torn tended to collapse time, jumping decades in a single bound -- a story about the current Paramount chairman, Brad Grey, might be followed by one about Elia Kazan in the 70's or about Torn's father, an agricultural economist whose gift for public speaking and performance was inherited by his son.
 Torn grew up in Texas and, after a comfortable childhood in a close-knit family, studied acting at the University of Texas, where he was trained by the renowned Shakespeare professor B. Iden Payne. By the mid-50's, Torn had made his way to New York with his wife, the actress Anne Wedgewood, whom he divorced a few years later. Handsome with a reckless, self-assured grin, Torn performed frequently in live-television serials and quickly fell in with the Actors Studio, home of the director and legendary acting teacher Lee Strasberg and a launching pad for other magnetic male leads like Marlon Brando and James Dean.
 For his first major theater gig, Torn was an understudy for the role of Brick in Kazan's production of ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' Around the same time, he started seeing Geraldine Page, who was also a member of the company. Like Woodward and Newman or Bancroft and Brooks, the two became a glamorous couple in theater circles, assuming roles on the board of the Actors Studio and organizing bashes at the Chateau Marmont when they were in Los Angeles. Lena Horne and Judy Garland would show up at their parties, and once Torn, with the help of his friend Miles Davis, cooked up a feast for 50 using fowl that Torn, a lifelong hunter, had bagged in the Imperial Valley. In New York, Torn worked out at Sig Klein's gym alongside Laurence Olivier and afterward hung out across the street at Jack Dempsey's with comics like Milton Berle and Jack E. Leonard. When Torn's cousin Sissy Spacek decided to pursue acting in New York, she moved in with Torn and Page, who introduced her to Strasberg, helping start her own successful career.
 Along the way, Torn acquired a reputation as a volatile personality -- both onstage and off. He was the kind of performer who won rave reviews for the convincing way he tore doors off hinges. The actress Sally Kirkland remembers one time when Torn, playing Richard III to her Lady Anne, spontaneously lifted her by her shoulder and dress to deliver an angry speech as he held her suspended in the air. By that time, James Dean had died, Brando had distanced himself from the Actors Studio and Torn, says Kirkland, ''had totally inherited the throne of that combination -- he was young and gorgeous, and he was that guy.'' 
 Offstage, Torn worked to racially integrate the theater world. He vehemently defended every line, no matter how shocking at the time, of James Baldwin's unsparingly violent play ''Blues for Mr. Charlie'' and helped coax Baldwin, who was procrastinating, into finishing it. According to ''A Player's Place,'' David Garfield's authoritative history of the Actors Studio, Torn was ultimately dismissed from his role in a London production of the Baldwin play for his ''corrosive attitude'' after he insulted both Baldwin and the play's director for making changes to the script (including softening the language to appease British censors). When I read the passage of Garfield's book to Torn, he seemed unsurprised that the book referred to him as ''volatile.'' ''What do they say about all the guys that are tremendous actors?'' he said, as he cut his chicken cutlet. ''Don't they say they have a volatile temper and emotions? Yeah, sure they do! They're not saying they like a nice mild guy. Look at Sean Penn.''
 Torn's most famous career turn occurred in 1967, when he had dinner with the writer Terry Southern and his wife and the actors Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper to discuss the possibility of his appearing in a film they were pulling together called ''Easy Rider.'' Of course, the role eventually went to Jack Nicholson, and years later Hopper maintained that Torn lost the role after he pulled a knife on Hopper at the dinner. Torn recalls the event differently: it was Hopper who pulled the knife on him, and Torn merely disarmed him. At that point, Torn told me, ''Dennis jumped back and knocked Peter on the floor, and I said, 'There goes the job.'''
 Torn says that Hopper's version of the tale hurt his career, spreading an unjustified image of him as unstable and violent. In 1994, just as Torn was starting to enjoy his newfound success on ''Larry Sanders,'' Hopper repeated his version of the events on the ''Tonight'' show. Fed up, Torn sued Hopper for defamation. Southern and his wife testified to Torn's version of events, the judge sided with Torn and Hopper ended up paying Torn close to $1 million in damages, including compensation for lost career revenue. (Through his agent, Hopper declined to comment.)
 Torn insists he had never officially accepted the role and chose not to take it because around the same time, Norman Mailer offered him more money to act in his movie ''Maidstone'' -- a film perhaps best known for an improvised scene in which Torn goes after Mailer with a tack hammer and Mailer, caught off guard and angry, responds in turn by biting into Torn's ear. ''Maidstone'' faded into obscurity (though Torn still defends it), and the divergent success of ''Maidstone'' and ''Easy Rider'' rankled him. More important, Torn says that even now the story Hopper told haunts his reputation, making him especially vulnerable professionally. ''I'm an unemployed actor right now as I talk to you,'' he said. ''I'm still suffering because of this campaign.''
 Many of Torn's anecdotes, professional and otherwise, are marked by a tinge of paranoia -- friends ''died under mysterious circumstances''; he speaks casually of a series of ''mysterious fires in my apartment''; he got fired from a production of Macbeth ''because friends of the Nixon administration told them I was a militant.'' But it is worth noting that he came of age professionally in an era when politically outspoken actors did, in fact, risk more than jaded groaning from the chattering classes. In 1963, Torn attended, at Baldwin's invitation, a meeting with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to discuss integration, an event that led the F.B.I. to list Torn on an official bureau document as a ''prominent Negro.'' And one night in 1970, the day after Torn denounced the Vietnam War on ''The Dick Cavett Show,'' a gunshot penetrated the dining room of his Chelsea brownstone -- perhaps a stray bullet from local hooligans, but an incident that Torn chalks up to more nefarious forces. 
 So what happened in the mid-70's, when the number of roles that Torn was offered dropped precipitously? ''Nixon,'' he said. Nixon happened? ''Right.'' Could he explain further? ''Well, they don't want to say it, but I think that unless you get out there and make a tremendous amount of money, and I've never been able to do that, then probably you better keep quiet and just do your work.'' 
 Convinced that politics stalled his career, Torn now all but refuses to discuss the subject; comedy, not controversy, is the route he prefers. ''You know what Hamlet said?'' Torn asked, then paraphrased: ''Perchance, I put an antic disposition on.''
 As Louis XV in ''Marie Antoinette,'' Torn plays one fully clothed scene so salaciously (with his co-star Asia Argento, who plays Madame du Barry) that he claims he made even the French extras blush. He was delivering precisely the kind of performance that Sofia Coppola says she had in mind when she cast him. ''From everything I'd read about Louis XV,'' she told me, ''I knew he was very masculine and had mistresses and loved food and wine and women -- so I wanted someone very hetero and masculine. I wanted him to play the part like a lion, but with a sweetness.''
 To a director of Coppola's age (34), Torn might not have been an obvious actor for the part, except that she had seen him last year in ''Forty Shades of Blue,'' in which Torn's character, married to a much younger Russian beauty, expertly seduces another young blonde. Coppola said she also knew Torn could play dark and sexy from having seen him in the 1969 film ''Coming Apart,'' an art film considered near pornographic at the time. Torn's role -- a psychiatrist filming the succession of women he sleeps with, as he himself slowly disintegrates emotionally -- is hardly shocking by modern standards, but Torn's acting, spontaneous and fresh, surly and sympathetic, still stands out.
 Never happier than when he is on a set, Torn's approach to acting depends heavily on getting the outer trappings right. For ''Cross Creek,'' in which he played a father in the backwoods of the Florida bayou, he insisted on helping build the character's riverboat. For the part of Louis XV, Torn paid close attention to his costume -- the right boots, the right sword -- and the interplay between royalty and underlings. ''There was a guy who was always bowing so low, I couldn't get past him,'' Torn told me. ''I says, 'You gotta stand up!' I says: 'Look what you're doing! You're supposed to be the head of the bed chamber, and here, when I give you my grandson's dressing gown, you're bowing your head down so low you're dragging my grandson's dressing gown on the floor!''' When the actor replied that he was supposed to bow, since Torn was the king, Torn replied, with the privilege of 50 years of experience and accolades, ''Well, this is the king talking to you!''
 Even a small public appearance, like speaking at the Aspen comedy festival on a panel tribute to ''The Larry Sanders Show,'' which Torn did in March, is something that he approaches with the utmost seriousness. He prepared for the panel as he would for a Broadway opening, eating his usual preperformance dinner of nothing but oysters (''for energy''), making sure to get in a nap, avoiding other performances going on that day, even sleeping lightly from slight nerves the night before. 
 On the evening when the panel started, Torn filed onto the stage along with his ''Larry Sanders'' co-stars Janeane Garofalo, Jeffrey Tambor and Garry Shandling. Torn, dressed in his customary suit, a tuft of hair sticking awkwardly up, looked slightly out of place, gamely sporting a smile as one-liners whizzed right by him for most of the 30 minutes of recollections and mutual ribbings. Finally, the moderator announced to the audience that he was ready to show a clip of the last episode of the show. 
 A split second before the room went dark, Torn put his hand out so far it looked as if he might fall out of his chair, to signal, wait, he had one more thing to say, and it was important. But it was too late -- the lights went out. For an instant, Torn was frozen in that awkward position on the stage, his silhouette visible in the dark, and then he threw up his hands and slouched into a position of defeat. The sense of vulnerability that Torn carries with him at all times was suddenly rendered visible on stage. The clip rolled and the room remained dark. 
 When the scene ended and the lights came up, the moderator, before saying thank you and good night, had the good grace to point out that Torn had wanted to say something earlier but had been cut off.
 Torn nodded, then began: ''It wasn't just.. . .'' He paused, a long enough pause that the audience members shifted uncomfortably in their seats. As the pause grew agonizingly longer, a few people even twittered. ''It was. . .'' he continued, '' . . . it was also the crew. It was a great family. Because Garry made everyone on the show feel like an ace.'' Like an ace -- that was Torn at his best, a bit old-fashioned, vaguely Southwestern in tone. ''And that's why we all love him,'' he continued, his voice quavering, the emotion building. ''Not for being the genius he is, but for being the decent, wonderful gentleman we all know him to be.'' The End. And the audience, which was filled with jaded network types, was suddenly back, rising out of their seats and wildly applauding, as if given permission, or maybe a cue, to let loose in a standing ovation.
 Torn sat back, satisfied, a grin on his face, applauding right along with them. The applause may have been in honor of Shandling, but at the end of the day, Torn knew exactly which old pro had brought them to their feet.

HEADLINE: Looking Out for Numero Uno

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
HOW do you redesign the best-selling car in America? To paraphrase the old joke: very, very carefully.
 The sixth-generation Toyota Camry looks and handles better than the previous incarnation, but the changes will in no way alienate those who have long prized the sedan for its comfort, quiet and durability. It shouldn't come as a surprise, then, that Toyota is confident enough about the 2007 Camry's prospects to supplement its assembly capacity in Kentucky by borrowing a Subaru plant in Indiana. (Toyota recently bought a large stake in Subaru's parent, Fuji Heavy Industries, from General Motors).
The new Camry is hardly invulnerable to competition. The Honda Accord and Nissan Altima (and, to a lesser degree, the Mazda 6 and Volkswagen Passat) have been nipping at the Camry's flanks for years by appealing to the tastes of younger consumers who want sportier -- and, in many cases, less expensive -- family sedans. What's more, the Camry must fend off challenges from fresh designs like the value-laden Hyundai Sonata, the slick-handling Ford Fusion and, next year, a revamped Accord. 
 It is also worth noting that the new Camry has gone on sale when Toyota's reputation for bulletproof quality is showing some dings. The company's larger Avalon sedan, assembled in the same Georgetown, Ky., factory as many Camrys, has been plagued by glitches. Indeed, citing complaints about the Avalon's steering, suspension and body integrity, Consumer Reports downgraded its rating of the 2005 model to the middle of the pack. And Toyota has already recalled some early-production 2007 Camrys with V-6 engines, to fix transmission problems.
 Toyota is quite open about the need to find younger buyers, since the average age of Camry customers has crept up to 55. To that end, the designers edged away from the generic Japanese-sedan look. Indeed, while the new Camry probably won't engage style-conscious shoppers who lust for a sleek Audi A4 or a retro Mustang, the more aggressive front end, raised window line and liberal application of creases to the sheet metal do add some electricity to the ultimate driving appliance. 
 By the same token, Toyota spruced up the interior with jazzier display lighting and even a ''natural moisturizer'' coating on its high-end upholstery fabric -- intended to be more comfortable for bare skin.
 As in the past, the Camry comes in more flavors than Ben & Jerry's. The entry-level CE is nicely equipped -- standard fare includes four-wheel disc brakes with an emergency-assist feature, seven air bags, a tire-pressure-warning system, halogen headlamps, a tilting-and-telescoping steering wheel, power windows and locks, and a six-speaker 160-watt sound system.
 Next up is the LE, which Toyota expects to account for 60 percent of sales; it adds a power driver's seat, remote locking and other features. The fancy XLE (a kissing cousin to the Lexus ES) supplements the LE's amenities with a better stereo, dual-zone climate control, power front seats and moonroof, fog lamps and an auto-dimming inside mirror.
 The Camry SE, like previous models carrying that designation, has sporting pretensions -- only this time the differences are more than skin-deep. Along with jaunty trim (a black grille, front and rear spoilers, leather-wrapped steering wheel), the SE gets a stiffer suspension and wider, lower-profile tires on bigger (17-inch) alloy wheels. 
 Toyota has also endowed the Camry line with a gasoline-electric hybrid model that has its own trim package; that car was previously reviewed on these pages.
 All four nonhybrid grades come with a four-cylinder dual-overhead-cam engine (2.4 liters, 16 valves) carried over from the 2006 model year; four-cylinder models sold in states that follow California's emissions rules are rated ''partial zero emission vehicles,'' or PZEV's, the most favorable rating applied to conventional gasoline engines. 
 The four-cylinder engine has been tuned for a modest increase in horsepower (158, up from 154) and torque (161, up from 160); the PZEV's ratings are slightly lower. All versions but the hybrid and CE can be bought with a new 3.5-liter V-6 (24 valves, dual cams, aluminum block). This power plant, which yields 268 horsepower and 248 pound-feet of torque, is shared with the Avalon. Both engines run fine on regular-grade gas.
 The four-cylinder motor comes with a five-speed manual transmission, but Toyota expects almost everybody to pony up an extra $941 for a five-speed automatic. The V-6 comes only with an automatic, a new six-speed unit with the potential for Tiptronic-style manual shifting.
 But wait -- the menu is even more comprehensive. Most of the luxury features that are standard in the XLE are also available for due financial consideration in other models. Note, too, that leather seats and satellite navigation systems are options on the SE and XLE, while stability and traction control (packaged as a single option) can be had with all four trim grades.
 Cafeteria-style choice is good for consumers, right? And for Toyota, too, because it gives the marketing department more wiggle room to go with the flow. For example, it lets the company advertise a CE for just $18,850, even as it courts customers prepared to pay $30,000-plus for a loaded XLE V-6.
 More subtly, it creates a way to fine-tune prices to meet demand without resorting to rebates in lean times, or giving dealers license to charge premiums in the fat times. When demand is strong, Toyota can force the mix of cars sold -- for example, by delivering more LE's with high-margin options like the moonroof ($752) and the 440-watt JBL premium stereo ($750). In a weak market, the company can offer packages of high-markup options at a discount. 
 I tested both an LE with the four-cylinder engine and five-speed automatic and an SE with the new V-6. The bread-and-butter LE provided few surprises, which is just the way Toyota likes it. The seats are exceptionally comfortable, and the brightly lighted display and oversize dashboard controls are models of ergonomic excellence.
 At cruising speed the LE is as quiet and vibration-free as most luxury cars, though the hard-working four-cylinder engine makes a decidedly unluxurious clatter under acceleration. The transmission shifts seamlessly, often anticipating the need to downshift. The brakes felt terrific. 
 If there are any surprises in the LE, it is in the handling. As with previous Camrys, the steering can be vague and the suspension seems a tad wobbly on broken pavement by comparison with, say, the Accord or the Mazda 6. But Toyota has definitely improved the sedan's cornering capabilities.The LE can actually be entertaining to pilot on well-maintained roads, tracking high-speed turns with considerable aplomb. 
 What works well in the somewhat underpowered four-cylinder LE works even better in an SE with the V-6. The combination of stiffer shocks, fatter tires and added steel braces (for extra rigidity) make a huge difference, transforming the SE into a real driver's car. By the same token, the V-6 is more than adequate, providing confidence-inducing acceleration for entering freeways and passing on two-lane roads. 
 Though excellent in every way, the six-speed automatic didn't seem like a big improvement over the five-speed with the four-cylinder engine. The tall sixth gear may explain, though, how this big, powerful sedan manages a relatively thrifty federal economy rating (22 m.p.g. in town and 31 on the highway). 
 The four cylinder does even better, of course, with a rating of 24/33 with the automatic transmission.
 All told, the SE is the first Camry that is competitive in performance terms with similarly equipped Accords. Unfortunately, in contrast to the Accord, no manual transmission is available on V-6 Camrys.
 Along with its continuing rivalry with the Accord and the Altima, the Camry must now contend with a challenge from the Ford Fusion, which is a cut above the Camry in handling, and the Hyundai Sonata, which is several thousand dollars cheaper and has a longer bumper-to-bumper warranty (six years, compared with three). More generally, features that made the Camry so special a decade ago -- the exceptionally quiet cabin, remarkable fit and finish and reputation for durability -- are now commonplace in this part of the market. 
 Too, virtually every competing vehicle is also loaded with convenience features from auto-dimming mirrors to fold-down rear seats. Thus, the big question is not whether the new Camry is a worthy successor to the 2006 model, but whether its design and quality still merit the $2,000 to $5,000 premium that it commands over, say, an Altima or a Fusion. 

INSIDE TRACK: The leader of a pack that's catching up quickly.

NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN
 North Korea Takes On the World.
 By Gordon G. Chang.
 327 pp. Random House. $25.95.
The Korean War is famous for being forgotten, a muddle sandwiched between the great victory of World War II and the quagmire of Vietnam. But a United States-led coalition, at great cost in human life, fought for three years to restore the longitudinal divide between North and South Korea, postponing any real reckoning to another day.
 Stalin claimed that mighty America could not subdue ''little Korea.'' Republican critics of President Truman, fueled partly by the braggadocio of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, argued that the stalemate threatened freedom everywhere. 
 Fifty years later, a new Korean crisis centers on nuclear weapons. The stakes are more serious, even apocalyptic, and some experts, Gordon G. Chang among them, are alarmed that America is tolerating a festering threat to its leadership and the lives of its citizens.
 Kim Jong Il, the frizzy-haired scion of the Communist dynasty that precipitated the Korean War, now has nuclear bombs, according to most knowledgable observers. He also has ballistic missiles that can or will soon be able to deliver nuclear warheads. Negotiations have continued over more than a decade and produced two agreements to denuclearize North Korea. One stabilized the situation for a few years but was later disavowed by both sides. The other, a statement of principles reached last fall, appeared to evaporate before the ink dried. 
 In ''Nuclear Showdown,'' Chang, a longtime lawyer in China and now a full-time pundit, calls the crisis ''the showdown of the century'' and ''the fiercest game of chicken on the planet.'' He declares that the future of world leadership hangs in the balance. ''Everything is on the line in North Korea,'' he writes.
 There is little question, as Chang argues, that North Korea presents a monumental challenge. Nuclear proliferation has begun to replace the threat of terrorism -- or, if Iran continues on its current course, to merge with it -- as the most pressing foreign policy problem Washington faces.
 As he did in his previous book, ''The Coming Collapse of China,'' Chang tackles an important subject energetically and provocatively. But his hyperbole and cliches overwhelm some astute observations. His marshaling of the facts is often persuasive, but rarely revelatory. His random references to the theories and sayings of others -- Homer, Machiavelli, Samuel Huntington, Malcolm Gladwell, Fidel Castro and Tom Stoppard are among those quoted -- read like scholarly bling. 
 Still, Chang shows how the United States and two other important players, China and South Korea, allowed a renegade nation that can barely manufacture bicycles to become a nuclear power. It is not an easy story to tell. Chang explains how the crisis germinated in the 1950's, took root during the cold war and reached full bloom in the 1990's, when North Korea discovered it was history's orphan. He indicts both the Clinton and current Bush administrations for mismanaging the Korean threat.
 He argues, plausibly, that the standoff defies resolution because Kim Jong Il has ''institutionalized brinksmanship.'' North Korea's command economy never recovered from the collapse of the Soviet Union, but Kim has elicited billions of dollars in aid from China and South Korea to feed his people and prop up his military. He goes to the bank whenever foreign fears about his nuclear intentions reach a fever pitch.
 ''Nuclear Showdown'' carefully details the political and emotional rifts Kim exploits. South Korea has become more anti-American than antinuclear, Chang argues. He suggests that South Koreans might even submit themselves to Kim's leadership because they have grown to distrust Washington so much. At any rate, he says, the United States will find it difficult to muster a firm coalition against the North until it repairs its alliance with the South.
 China presents problems of its own. Chang argues, based partly on speculation, that China either helped North Korea build atomic bombs or had full knowledge of efforts by the Pakistani nuclear scientist A. Q. Khan to assist Pyongyang. He writes that China may be playing a dual game, arranging six-nation talks over the nuclear issue while using proliferation to undermine American interests globally. Despite these suspicions, he accepts the Bush administration's conclusion that any solution requires full Chinese participation. But he offers only vague hints of how President Bush might persuade China to take a tougher line. Trade threats? A stern talking to?
 Yet the bigger failure may be that Chang does not consider the available options seriously. He derides the soft, pro-engagement approach favored by China and South Korea, but never fully explains why hopes for a peaceful evolution in the North are so misguided. He recommends that the United States unilaterally reduce its own nuclear arsenal to put moral pressure on North Korea and then, if that does not work, attack the country, a sequence that seems unlikely to win support from the Pentagon. If North Korea has proved intractable for 50 years, it's not because no one understands the risks, but because no one, Gordon Chang included, has found a better way.

THIS BOOK WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE 
 By A. M. Homes. 
 372 pp. Viking. $24.95.
Affluent Los Angeles can be ridiculed, but mockery seems only to make it stronger. It's the sole great city on the planet that treats bitter satires as interesting suggestions and can transform the outrage it inspires into vital cellular nutrition. Nathanael West's ''Day of the Locust,'' for example (that vision of cannibalistic assassination by overstimulated crowds), offers a model for ''American Idol.'' Vote for your top former nobody, America, and then, in the next round, demolish her. Cheer as her pieces are trucked back to Des Moines.
 This Californian talent for turning absurdity into sustenance and employing farce to build its future presents a challenge for a writer as knowing, cool and ingenious as A. M. Homes, who's decided -- as all social novelists dream of doing but only the cocky or careless still attempt -- to take a grand stab at the laughing vampire's heart and hope that her actions create a show worth watching. Homes is too smart to believe that she can wound the creature and too sophisticated about her audience not to see its bite marks all over their necks, because most of us are part Hollywood zombie, too. 
 Richard Novak, Homes's hero (her story turns him into one, and in an intentionally old-style, corny sense) begins as a purebred specimen of the undead. He lives in a blandly extravagant house stuck to the side of a fashionable slope and generates wealth by literally running in place -- trading securities on a computer while jogging on an exercise machine. Deep down, he's faintly aware of his predicament, and the narrator at his back is fully aware of it in a manner that thinks the reader's thoughts for him: ''Above and below, a chain of houses climbs the canyon wall: a social chain, an economic chain, a food chain. The goal is to be on top, king of the hill -- to win. Each person looks down on the next, thinking they somehow have it better, but there is always someone else either pressing up from below or looking down from above. There is no way to win.''
 A vacuum-packed, freeze-dried entity like Richard can be handled in two main ways: the author either rips him open, exposing his cold dark gizzard to air and sunlight (and, inevitably, in some form, love) or the author sends him on a killing spree. Homes picks Option 1 but pays an ironic homage to Option 2 by dispatching the torn but healing Richard (it's a health crisis here that unzips his spiritual zipper) on a kind of fantastic compassion spree. All around him, suddenly, breakdowns and catastrophes arise that he can repair with his newly human touch.
 Homes spends the imaginative assets that she's conserved by hiring a cast of nonunion cut-out characters to conceive and mount the tricky scenarios that bring them into manic collision. These sequences are worth buying tickets for, especially the first one. A sinkhole has formed in front of Richard's house (to make visual the sinkhole in his heart) and a horse stumbles into it one morning. The beast can't climb out, but just up the road from Richard lives a highly specialized professional who deals with such fluky disasters for a living and can requisition the costly contraptions -- a helicopter, an aerial equine harness -- required to engineer a happy ending. He's not a cop, he's not a fireman, he's not a soldier. He's better. He's an action-hero. An actor.
 It's a splendidly perceptive joke about the freaky helixes of cultural evolution. In the only place where human beings would think to build multimillion dollar homes on soil unstable enough to form a crater that could entrap some rich neighbor child's pet horse, there also exists the only type of being who isn't fazed by such fantastic developments. 
 In the simulated reality of contemporary Los Angeles, the simulators are the realists. Homes's actor is her best invention -- a zombie only by vocation who, at home, is a kind and house-proud gentleman who spends his free time in the kitchen whipping up wholesome homemade food for guests. Unlike Richard and the story's other stars, the actor is more than a concept to be toyed with; he's a twisted strand of fictional proteins that we can actually picture shaking hands with and accepting a plate of cookies from.
 He also seems capable of reproducing, unlike the crew of sterile castaways whom Captain Richard welcomes aboard during his voyage through the Straits of Solipsism up into the Gulf of Empathy. The most annoying of these second mates is the one who's supposed to warm our spirits the most: an immigrant doughnut-shop owner named Anhil (sinkholes, doughnuts, doughnut holes, emptiness in the land of plenty: Anhil, as in annihilation of the self). His role, besides speaking English funny (the cutest of his slips is ''stereotropical,'' referring to typical natives of warm climates), is to not be condescended to by Richard, who, one presumes, used to condescend to everyone back when he was a carb-counting control freak who wouldn't so much as sniff a greasy pastry -- not to mention let himself be guru-ed to by the simple soul who fried it.
 Homes's respect for the wisdom of the East and her disdain for the vanity of the West are both very Santa Monica, of course. Properly combined with opportunism, in fact, they form Streisandism -- the alchemical religion that allows Hollywood's bipolar elite to self-loathe its way into a party mood every wartime Oscar night. For masochistic moneyed meditators, shame is bliss, embarassment nirvana. Their biggest grins are their most conscience-stricken. That's why they hire satirists as hosts and why the guests look so refreshed after their beatings, while the satirists go home looking glum and neutered. They came to harshly tease but they appeased.
 It's easy to be defeated by place. Homes -- a master of syncopated jabber about nutrition, parking, real estate and other inescapable Los Angeles fetishes; a whiz at directing complex set pieces that almost always hold their own both as metaphors and as spectacles; and as sure with a knife as a great sushi chef when it comes to slicing up her prose into sentences of chewable lengths and paragraphs of satisfying thicknesses -- seems flummoxed by the larger task of leveraging Richard's adventures in recovery into a panoramic Los Angeles black comedy. Her people are made of dough that just won't rise. Her miniature editorials on class and status belong in a 1960's Newsweek column. She scourges Hollywood in all the ways that make it tingle with guilty ecstasy.
 What's an uncompromising mocker to do?
 Homes reprises West, but on a vastly grander, intensely less affecting manner. She sends the Four Horsemen galloping across Malibu. She summons the beasts to have fanged vengeance. It's a creaky studio-system apocalypse. And just when poor Richard had almost passed through the doughnut hole and learned to sit and taste and feel and breathe.

HEADLINE: Sometimes the Right Approach Is Putting the Best Face Forward

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
It was not a typical job workshop. 
 ''When's a good time to show this face?'' asked Gyasi Headen, a manager of training at Strive, a nonprofit job training and placement organization on East 123rd Street in Manhattan. He slumped in his chair, rested his head on the palm of his extended arm, and glared at the 20 or so mostly black male job seekers who gathered on a recent Monday, the first day of a four-week job-readiness training program.
''At 12 o'clock at night, you're in the 'hood and they're going to try to get you,'' one man answered. 
 Another man said, ''It's to keep people at bay.'' 
 James Moody, 30, of Brooklyn, offered: ''It's when you want to intimidate somebody.''
 The men were talking about ''game face,'' slang for the menacing expression worn by many African-American and Hispanic men who live in inner cities. But many men who wear their game faces on the streets also wear them on interviews and at work, preventing them from getting and keeping jobs, said Mr. Headen, who is black. 
 Mr. Moody acknowledged, ''I got one of those faces -- it's a byproduct of my environment.'' By way of explanation, he said that 12 years in prison, which began when he was a teenager, had taken a toll. 
 ''But I'm trying to square up,'' he said. ''That's why I'm sitting here.'' 
 Mr. Headen stressed the importance of leaving the game face behind at interviews. Employers, he explained to the group, are often willing to provide training for entry-level employees who have good attitudes and are willing to learn. 
 ''You only have 30 seconds to make a first impression, and the next half-hour to really win a person over,'' Mr. Headen said. ''Rob me with your smile, please. You know, 'He was a nice gentleman and he robbed me.' '' The class members -- many of them, like Mr. Headen, former offenders -- laughed. 
 Since it started more than 20 years ago in the East Harlem projects, Strive has been known for taking a nontraditional approach to job preparation for the hard-to-employ. Many participants are high school dropouts, have criminal records or are substance abusers. 
 ''Their anger can be totally justified,'' said Lizzette Dunn-Barcelona, executive director of Strive's New York office. ''But if you want to get a job, you can't look angry.'' 
 The new workshop, she said, is in keeping with Strive's overall philosophy. ''Our mandate is that we ensure that we give them every single tool to be successful.'' 
 Strive mainly serves people in the New York City boroughs, but is open to anyone. With a few exceptions -- like those who are actively using drugs -- ''we really don't turn anyone away,'' Ms. Dunn-Barcelona said. 
 Strive's core program -- the game face workshop is a part of that -- has been described as attitude-change boot camp. 
 Participants, who pay no fees for the program, are fined for breaking rules, like using slang words (50 cents) or not wearing name tags ($1.50). Classes run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each weekday, and those who miss more than two sessions have to redo the entire four weeks. And being late, even by a minute, ''will be grounds for termination'' from the program, the manual states. 
 ''Sugarcoating it really doesn't help them,'' Mr. Headen said in an interview. ''We don't have time; it has to be straightforward; it has to come fast. They have four weeks to give up 18 to 40 years of bad habits.''
 Kendan Luther, 22, of the Bronx, who was hired by Chelsea Mini-Storage as an elevator operator last year after attending Strive's program, participated in one of the first game face workshops. He said he would often display his game face on interviews -- out of nervousness more than any other reason -- but was not aware of it. 
 Mr. Headen said the game face workshop, the most recent set of exercises added to the core program, was ''an opportunity to address a taboo.''
 ''If you look at American culture, we've been taught not to discuss people's looks'' like their attractiveness or weight, he said, ''but we judge people based on looks.''
 But it is not all tough love. Some exercises introduced over the years are intended to lift confidence, like the ''praise poem,'' which requires participants to write about their positive qualities.
 ''I see drive and I see fire,'' said Stephen Mallon, general manager of Chelsea Mini-Storage in Manhattan, who has hired some 60 Strive graduates over the last 12 years. He said they were often more focused than other prospective employees. 
 Gail Tessler and Norma Menkin, co-presidents of Gainor Staffing in Manhattan, who have worked with Strive for a decade, said they believed that the organization's strong track record was a result of the candidates' preparedness and the careful matching of candidates to jobs. Strive graduates are often easier to place than candidates from similar organizations, they said. 
 Last year, Strive's New York office placed close to 70 percent of its graduates in jobs, and an average of 70 percent of those remained employed after a year, Ms. Dunn-Barcelona said. 
 Employment has generally increased among black men in the last two years in New York City, but it still trails that of white men by nearly 13 percentage points, said Mark Levitan, senior labor market policy analyst at the Community Service Society in New York and author of a recently released report on employment in the city. ''What the data show very clearly is that there is an ongoing racial disparity in employment,'' Mr. Levitan said.
 Young black men are particularly hard hit, said Ronald B. Mincy, a professor of social policy and social work practice at the Columbia University School of Social Work and editor of ''Black Males Left Behind'' (Urban Institute Press, 2006). 
 His book is one of several recent studies showing that the plight of young black men with limited education has worsened in recent years, despite periods of economic growth and welfare overhaul that have benefited black women and other groups.
 Young black men have unique needs that have not been widely addressed, but programs like Strive, which stress attitude assessment with respect to work, have been particularly successful, Professor Mincy said. 
 ''Strive has found a way to communicate with young black men,'' he said. ''They understand how to package it in a way the population they serve can understand and embrace.'' 
 Mr. Moody, the Strive participant, agrees. ''Change is a beautiful thing,'' he said. ''I love waking up at 6:30 a.m.''
 One of his favorite things about Strive is the discipline it instills, he said in an interview. Mr. Moody, who is studying for his G.E.D. exam, recently got a job at Ellis Island in the food service area, and hopes one day to work counseling teenagers to avoid the mistakes he made at their age. ''You're looking at a man on the right path,'' he said. ''My life is beautiful. I love it out here.''

HEADLINE: Anchors Aweigh And Cut the Ballast

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

 BODY:
The way the Coast Guard sees it, one anchor is enough.
 Last week, it announced interim guidelines, adjusting what it assumes is the average weight of people on commercial oceangoing vessels -- mainly fishing boats -- to 185 pounds from 160. For boats that go in protected waters like lakes, rivers and some bays, the average weight has been raised to 185 pounds from 140. 
 That means that when the Coast Guard certifies deep-sea fishing vessels or tourist boats that circle the Shore islands, the operators' capacities will be down 14 to 25 percent. 
 This all came about because the average person weighs more today than when the standard was developed in the 1960's, said a Coast Guard spokeswoman, Angela McArdle. 
 Ms. McArdle said that when a pontoon boat capsized in March 2004 in Baltimore Harbor, killing five, the Coast Guard determined that the boat was overloaded based on the 140-pound standard. After consulting with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it came up with the 185-pound average weight.
 The standards this year are voluntary and apply only to standard boats up to 65 feet long and all pontoon boats, but this year's results will determine the rules that will become mandatory in 2007. 
 ''We assume most carriers want to be safe, and I'm sure they are,'' Ms. McArdle said. ''We'll be studying the economic impact of this, too, since the intention is not to drive anyone out of business.'' ROBERT STRAUSS

HEADLINE: The New Puritans

BYLINE: By Holly Brubach

 BODY:
We were already beating ourselves up about the damage we've done to our arteries. Now along comes ''The Ethical Gourmet: How to Enjoy Great Food That Is Humanely Raised, Sustainable, Nonendangered, and That Replenishes the Earth'' (Broadway Books), by Jay Weinstein, which would seem to offer all the fun of a guilt trip with a tour guide. Happily, Weinstein, a chef and an avid environmentalist, holds fire where the reader is concerned and reserves his scorn for the Bush administration, linking its cavalier disregard for our natural resources with its conviction that the rapture will occur any day now.
Weinstein is one of several agents for change publishing books this spring, and despite occasional differences of opinion, all are comrades in arms, on a mission to overhaul the way we think about food. Their message is not new, but it furthers a cause propounded most conspicuously by Alice Waters and the Slow Food movement, lately advanced by ''Fast Food Nation'' and ''Super Size Me,'' and dating all the way back to Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring.'' 
 Anna Lappe and Bryant Terry speak directly to our conscience in ''Grub: Ideas for an Urban Organic Kitchen'' (Jeremy P. Tarcher/Penguin), addressing the tired misconception that organic food is a luxury the human race can't afford. In ''What to Eat: An Aisle-by-Aisle Guide to Savvy Food Choices and Good Eating'' (North Point Press), Marion Nestle deconstructs the typical American supermarket from a nutritionist's point of view, elucidating the maddeningly convoluted means by which our options are determined. And ''Real Food: What to Eat and Why'' (Bloomsbury), by Nina Planck, poses a convincing alternative to the prevailing dietary guidelines, even those treated as gospel.
 The righteous indignation is contagious. As a group, these authors document various aspects of the behind-the-scenes role that politics and big business have played in shaping our food supply. It's infuriating to read Nestle's account of the roadblocks that legislators and lobbyists erected to prevent Country of Origin Labeling (C.O.O.L.), a seemingly straightforward initiative that would allow consumers to know where the food they are buying was grown. And two years after C.O.O.L. went into effect, its implementation is still spotty. As evidence of secrecy and corruption on a scale that brings to mind the Mafia, Nestle cites the 1999 Congressional hearings convened to investigate ''slotting fees,'' introduced in the 1980's ''as a way for stores to cover the added costs of dealing with new products: shelving, tracking, inventory and removing products that do not sell.'' According to Nestle, the industry people who testified ''were so afraid of retribution that they wore hoods and used gadgets to prevent voice recognition.''
 There is no shortage of appalling information here, and the authors all seem to acknowledge that change will come about only by hitting corporate America where it hurts, i.e., the bottom line. Lappe and Terry seem particularly ingenious in this regard. They report that the 10 extra pounds gained by the average American in the 1990's now require the airline industry to use 350 million more gallons of fuel per year, costing an additional $275 million. Their chart comparing food corporations to nations ranks the revenues of Nestle (Nestea, Lean Cuisine, Stouffer's, Butterfinger, KitKat, PowerBar) and Altria (Nabisco, Kraft, Maxwell House, Post, Jell-O, Kool-Aid, Oscar Mayer) somewhere between the gross domestic products of the United Arab Emirates and Nigeria.
 In the course of educating readers, the authors' personalities emerge. There is Nestle, the no-nonsense reporter, at pains to take into account all sides of the story; Weinstein, the evangelist whose zeal sets the tone for his relations with the reader; and Lappe and Terry, earnest New Age hippie types offering menus accompanied by playlists and poems by their friends. (Readers accustomed to a more literary diet should proceed directly to recipes.)
 Of the group, it is Planck who is the most companionable. Her capacity for humor and self-deprecation makes for good company, and her intelligence and skepticism inspire confidence. To those who proscribe dairy products on the premise that milk was designed for newborn calves, not humans (a popular, if somewhat bizarre, argument), she retorts that a tomato was designed to make more tomato plants, not pasta sauce. Cataloging her own history, which spans a series of draconian regimens, including vegan, vegetarian, low fat, low saturated fat and low cholesterol, she labels one category ''New Foods I Tried to Love'' and lists ''Various imitation foods made with soy and rice.'' Planck now eats and, even more outrageously, advocates grass-fed meat and whole dairy products.
 Tracking changes in the American diet over the course of a hundred years, she notes that the three most common fats in 1990 -- soybean oil, canola oil and cottonseed oil -- were unknown in 1890. They are modern inventions. Whereas, she argues, ''we've been eating animal fat for three million years.'' She avoids egg-white omelets and skim milk (''low-quality, incomplete foods'') and contends that, where milk is concerned, butterfat facilitates protein digestion and contains the vitamins A and D required for calcium absorption. She recommends ''traditional'' milk -- raw, unpasteurized, unhomogenized -- from grass-fed cows, as opposed to those fattened on grain.
 Fat, cholesterol, carbs, red meat -- none of these, Planck contends, is the problem. Instead, she lays the blame on chemicals and industrial food, including ''new'' fats, many of which are often hydrogenated. Industrial food, she says, is to blame for the steep rise in rates of disease, especially heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Planck arrives at this incendiary conclusion via Darwin and research into Stone Age eating habits, which flies in the face of widespread myths and confirms that, contrary to popular assumptions, humans used to be more carnivorous, not less. ''I doubt that foods we've eaten for millions of years cause cancer,'' she writes.
 Though all these experts challenge the existing order, their advice is often contradictory. Nestle, for instance, questions the premise that a diet high in calcium is best for building bone density, but ratifies current advice to curtail fats and cholesterol. Weinstein suggests albacore tuna as an environmentally responsible choice, but Nestle cautions specifically against it for its high content of methylmercury. Planck suggests soaking dried beans before cooking them; Weinstein insists that this is unnecessary in most cases. And Lappe and Terry endorse cooking with canola oil, one of the very fats that Planck abhors.
 Never mind. The zeal that animated sit-ins and antiwar protests in the 1960's hasn't died; it's gone underground, fostering small-scale, sustainable agriculture that undermines industrial food's hegemony. The ''Think globally, eat locally'' message comes across loud and clear, and these books provide invaluable online resources for information and hard-to-find ''real food.'' Even the most cynical readers will come away from these books determined to change some aspect of their diets, and many people -- I, for one -- may resolve to revamp their eating habits completely. Radical as Planck's ideas may be, the case she makes for them strikes me as eminently sensible. I consider myself an enlightened eater, but when I finished her book, I threw out half the contents of my refrigerator, including the soy-based fake bacon bits, the tofu hot dogs and the nonfat sour cream. That was a few weeks ago. It is, I guess, a measure of the extent to which I've bought into all these years of nonfat propaganda that I'm still working up the nerve to eat the skin on my chicken.

HEADLINE: Magic Mushrooms

BYLINE: By Gary Wolf

 BODY:
Shawn Ryan and Cathy Wood live on a pile of rocks. The pile begins 11 miles south of Dawson City, Canada, where the paved roads end, and meanders like a giant worm tunnel along the banks of the Klondike River. In this sparsely populated region in Yukon Territory, Ryan and Wood run a small geological exploration company. But every so often, when the previous season's forest fires have been good and severe, they stop prospecting for a few weeks and go out with a group of friends in search of another type of natural commodity, one that is also globally prized and instantly exchangeable for cash. With any luck, they'll come back with thousands upon thousands of pounds of wild morels.
Rumors of a great morel boom began to circulate more than a year ago, while the skies above Dawson City were still hazy with smoke. The promise was tantalizing. Even in comparison with many wild mushrooms, morels are elusive. With their deeply pitted surface, impudent shape and complex smell of fresh dirt and raw milk, morels can be found in modest quantities in orchards and under dead elms, but they can grow most abundantly beneath charred trees after a fire. 
 The far Northwest has seen big morel flushes in the past, but in the summer of 2004, with more than 10 million acres burning across the western Yukon and the interior of Alaska, stories of an unprecedented bonanza quickly spread by phone and e-mail through an extended network of pickers and buyers. By last spring, the Cooperative Extension Service at the University of Alaska was teaching workshops on how to pick, and newspapers were publishing stories about the morel harvest that evoked the history of the Klondike stampede, when thousands of people climbed the Chilkoot Pass in search of gold.
 In late June of 2005, I succumbed to the lure and arranged to travel north with David Arora, the author of the classic field guide ''Mushrooms Demystified.'' Arora has been researching the commercial mushroom harvest for many years, and he has deep ties to a world that is simultaneously flamboyant and insular, with something of the frontier in it, as well as something of a traveling carnival. 
 After flying into Whitehorse, the territorial capital, we drove north, looking for a morel buyer we'd heard about named Bugeye Bob. Twenty-five miles from Dawson City, we pulled into the parking lot of an isolated motel. ''Oh, Bugeye got kicked out,'' said a man with a broad, sunburned, deeply lined face. He was about 50 years old and spoke with a German accent. After a brief, wary conversation, he and Arora determined that they'd met each other before. His name was Wolfgang Habermann, and he was buying morels for a small firm based just outside of Vancouver. The pickers called him Wolfe.
 Wolfe had a good spot this year, on the side of the Klondike River Lodge, at the turnoff to a dirt highway heading north to the Beaufort Sea. He was working out of a cinderblock outbuilding 20 feet square, with a folding table at the entrance, a scale and a tarp for shade. Wolfe told us that Bugeye's handouts of free beer and hot dogs to pickers had irritated the owners of the lodge, but he advanced his hypothesis in a dry tone that acknowledged his own self-interest. He didn't mind having the location to himself. 
 Many of the wild-mushroom buyers know one another. The harvest involves hundreds of regulars who move through the western states picking and buying morels, chanterelles and matsutake, forming improvised camps in the woods, parking their vans and R.V.'s in empty lots, taking over small-town restaurants and cheap hotels for weeks at a time. They compete and argue, but also form fragile partnerships to share costs and split profits when the mushrooms are abundant and teamwork is necessary to get them out of the woods. Pickers sell their mushrooms every day, for cash. The cash comes from a handful of mushroom companies near Vancouver and elsewhere on the West Coast, whose owners front tens of thousands of dollars to field buyers like Wolfe.
 Wolfe said his commission was 50 cents for every pound bought and another 50 cents per pound for drying the mushrooms. Over the border in Alaska, some fresh morels were heading to Anchorage, and then onward by overnight delivery to distributors servicing restaurants and gourmet markets across the United States. Here in the Yukon, a small amount of fresh morels were being flown out of Whitehorse, but most were dried and going to Paris, the capital of the international trade. From Paris, the smallest unbroken morels might end up in Bavaria, where tiny specimens are prized; nice-looking, medium-size morels could find themselves in a holiday dish in any bourgeois household in France or Switzerland at Christmas; broken or uglier ones were destined for charcuterie; the dust would be used in seasonings and packaged foods.
 A dirty pickup pulled around the corner of the lodge and stopped directly in front of Wolfe's table. The picker, a thin, quiet man whose face and beard were black, asked Wolfe the price, which led to some polite combat.
 ''Don't know yet,'' said Wolfe. ''I just sent out a couple of spies. I hope it's the same as yesterday.''
 ''What was it yesterday?'' asked the picker.
 ''Weren't you here?''
 ''I just came. This was my scouting trip.''
 ''Yesterday it was five.''
 Wolfe meant $5 per pound. There was a prolonged moment of silence. Even under his tarp, it was very warm. At this latitude the sun inches downward and northward all afternoon, sinking but seeming to grow hotter, until by 8 p.m. everybody is sweating and shading their eyes. ''I'll give you five, and if it's five-fifty in town I'll make it up,'' 
 Wolfe said. At this, three large, flat, white baskets emerged from the truck.
 A commercial mushroom picker does not use a straw or wicker basket, as in folk tales, but rather a large plastic bucket, sometimes drilled with holes. When full, the buckets are poured into shallow boxes of plastic mesh; these are what the pickers call baskets. They are stacked and carried on a backpack frame up to seven high. Each basket will hold more than 10 pounds of morels. Carrying 70 or 80 pounds through the raw brush would seem to require formidable strength, but Arora has seen small men and women do it. ''It's not strength so much as toughness,'' he told me. The best pickers are immune from physical discouragement. Mental resilience is an asset, too, because even in the most likely terrain, morels can be painfully hard to find.
 The rocks on which Shawn Ryan and Cathy Wood live are left over from mines, when the dirt was sluiced away from the river banks to expose the gold. Nothing grows on the rock pile, which in places is more than 20 feet high. It is surprisingly beautiful. Ryan runs the prospecting side of their company, while Wood controls the finances. To make a home here, she cinched two tiny cabins together and sealed them with insulation and electrical tape. She waited until her husband was out prospecting, because the new house was hooked up to the electrical grid, which at the time he denounced as superfluous.
 Ryan, Wood and their two children are year-round residents in Dawson City, where winter temperatures can hit 50 below. ''Don't you get cold?'' I asked their daughter, Cheyenne, who is 9 years old. She fixed me with a stare of the widest innocence. ''Only when my eyelashes freeze,'' she said. 
 As a prospector, Ryan has a great deal of local renown. He has staked many valuable claims. When the bitter weather traps everyone indoors, he keeps himself busy with intricate problems of geology and natural history, which he treats as puzzles. One of his favorite puzzles is: How do morels grow, and when, and where?
 The mushroom holds Ryan's interest because it has never been well understood. In the early 1980's, a graduate student named Ron Ower published a landmark paper reporting that he had coaxed morels to fruit in his laboratory. Tragically, just weeks before a patent was granted to Ower and his colleagues, Gary Mills and James Malachowski, Ower was murdered during a mugging in San Francisco. Afterward, his mushroom-growing method passed through many hands, including Domino's Pizza and a mushroom farm in Alabama that claimed to be producing thousands of pounds per week. Today, the Alabama operation is long out of business and Domino's has given up the game. The most popular varieties have never been successfully cultivated.
 Ryan hunts for morels using the same tools he uses for prospecting: aerial maps, government data and an intimate knowledge of Yukon geography. He is looking for fires that singe the trees without incinerating all the nutrients below, on slopes where the thick layers of moss burn away. He tracks the soil temperature in the spring, waiting for it to 
 go above 40 degrees. This year, he planned to take nine pickers 100 miles up the Yukon River to a shallow, silt-obstructed, barely navigable tributary and build a small camp in the woods.
 His motives are only partly economic. For years, Ryan and Wood were full-time circuit pickers, and the experience left Ryan with a sense of frustration that he has never been able to resolve. Pickers walk and search, travel for thousands of miles, analyze the weather and the terrain, and then, at last, the mushrooms might come up for a few short weeks in overwhelming amounts. Most of them never get picked. ''It's like the guy who found all the gold and didn't have the ability to carry it out,'' said Ryan. ''He fills his shirt and his socks and he still can't get it. It's a hundred-million-dollar strike, and he only gets nine.'' 
 This kind of thing drove him crazy. He had long wanted to overcome the uncertainties of the harvest, to have his crew and his boat on the scene when the flush came. 
 ''It's all greed,'' said Wood. She didn't mean greed for money. She and her husband own nothing fancy, and no picker in history has ever gotten rich off morels. She was talking about a different greed, a primeval desire stimulated by an abundance that owes nothing to human work. ''When he is coming out with a boat loaded with mushrooms, like he was a few years ago,'' she said of Ryan, ''he feels like a trapper of the old north coming out with his canoe piled high with furs.''
 Ryan, who spent his teenage years trapping for fur in the north of Ontario before turning to mushrooms and gold, looked up from the little spreadsheet that detailed the morel fortune he intended to make this year. ''Ay,'' he said, conceding her point, ''it's not as fun when you are up in the leprechaun land of the north all by yourself and all those mushrooms are going to waste.''
 Mushroom populations are not diminished by picking, according to David Arora, who is among the foremost experts on the commercial harvest. This makes the morel harvest a safe harbor for a foraging instinct that has increasingly been chased from the wild and forced to satisfy itself in discount outlets. Arora says there isn't any credible evidence that pickers damage the fungal life cycle; he's been out on the mushroom trail in India and China, where villagers and schoolchildren take almost every morel out of the ground, and still the mushrooms return, even proliferate. Morel mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of the fungus, analogous to blackberries on a blackberry bush. 
 Analogous, that is, if the branches of the blackberry were underground, nearly invisible and typically fruited in a different place every year.
 Driving near Dawson CITY one afternoon, I noticed a large, empty lot near town that was full of junked equipment. In the middle of the lot was an overturned table and a wooden sign half-tumbled in the dust. The sign was unreadable, but by now I was familiar with the gestalt of a morel-buying situation, so I made a sharp turn and went in. There, next to 
 a non-working Dodge Caravan, introducing himself with the kind of blustery friendliness that must have helped thousands of pickers over the years shake off the gloom of the woods, was Bugeye Bob. He was a stocky man whose blue eyes were entirely normal. ''I used to be known as Barnaby Bob until a spider bit me,'' he explained. The swelling went away, but his new nickname stuck.
 Bugeye's season was not going well. His Dodge was broken down. His situation at the lodge had proven untenable. He did not yet have his station going. But the biggest problem was one that he shared with all the other buyers this year: the mushrooms were up, but the pickers were scarce. ''Come welfare day, they'll come,'' Bugeye said. ''Their checks arrive, they can buy gas, they'll be here.''
 He did not sound sure. The ups and downs of the mushroom market are mysterious even to its participants. Most morels in the Yukon are gathered by itinerant pickers, which means that buyers must rely upon the unplanned, unpredictable convergence of many small, independent groups: ex-loggers, Southeast Asian immigrants, students on break, pensioners, Mexican and Central American crews who organize themselves for a trip north, recipients of government disability checks who prefer not to report extra income and many other wanderers who have little in common except a streak of nonconformism and, if they are to succeed, an economically irrational love of foraging that compensates for frequent failures. The circuit swells and shrinks in response to last season's field prices, regional trends in employment, the cost of gas, the hassle immigration officials give pickers moving back and forth across the border and, most obscurely of all, the pickers' judgment about whether the season will be good. Recently, competition in morels from Asia had been putting pressure on the buyers, who were working hard to keep the field prices down. Also, a decline in Japanese demand hurt the matsutake season, which bankrolls many of the circuit pickers for their subsequent journeys. For these, and possibly for other, unknown reasons, Yukon buyers were facing a labor shortage.
 The structure of the North American mushroom harvest is unusual. Arora, who first encountered the circuit pickers in the early 90's while working with the Department of Forest Science at Oregon State University, noted that the United States and Canada have a rare combination of vast, publicly accessible lands and widespread private ownership of automobiles. That allows pickers to go after the small, clean chanterelles of the Queen Charlotte Islands in the late summer, matsutake in British Columbia in the fall, the big, muddy chanterelles and black trumpets of California in the winter, and morels in the spring, starting with the morels in Oregon and working northward for months. No single picker would ever make the whole circuit, because mushroom flushes are brief and occur thousands of miles apart. Instead there are halting, unforeseeable flows influenced by events nobody can control. 
 The unpredictability leads to speculation. 
 ''It is one of the craziest markets I've ever seen or heard of, and I'm an economist by training,'' said Peter Moroz. 
 I had been looking for Moroz for days, ever since I'd been told that he was running the biggest, fanciest mushroom dryer in the Yukon. For a while, I had wondered if someone was pulling my leg. Most morel drying is decidedly low-tech, with screens set out in the sun, simple electrical heaters and store-bought fans. Adding to my skepticism, I first heard about the amazing giant dryer during a long afternoon of gossip at a buying station in the woods. 
 The station was run by a man named Psycho Rick, and he was the type of compelling narrator who represents a clear and present danger to journalists. Psycho Rick displayed his enormous pack and described his method of removing it from his back after bringing out 120 pounds of morels. He pulled up the legs of his jeans to show the long scars on his knees. The ground in the burned woods can be extremely slick when wet, with a layer of ash over a muddy subsurface that pickers compare to the excrement of geese. The worst thing was to slip and fall. ''I've hit the ground so hard I've had to go like this,'' Rick said as he mimed pulling pieces of dirt from out between his teeth. Then he corrected himself. The worst thing was not merely to slip and fall but to die. ''We lost four in the last year,'' Rick claimed. ''Two in a head-on with a logging truck, one guy gored himself, one was ate by a grizz.'' 
 ''How did he gore himself?'' I asked. Psycho Rick explained that sometimes the fire burns the logs to a sharpened point, and last year this picker took a tumble on a hill headfirst and got a charcoal spear embedded in his chest. 
 Two days later, the credibility of the chitchat at Psycho Rick's rose quite a bit when, after driving back and forth on the Klondike Highway many times, I found an obscurely marked turnoff, pulled around a bend in the rock pile and discovered a very large, remarkably pristine structure made of wood and plastic. At the entrance was a tall man with rosy cheeks and an intelligent face, across which flashed frequent signs of mental stress. This was Peter Moroz. He used to be a special adviser to the cabinet in the province of Saskatchewan. Anticipating a huge morel boom, he had invested in this drying operation to handle the overflow. 
 ''But my little gamble hasn't paid off,'' said Moroz, ''and I'm eating a whole lot of cheese.'' 
 Moroz showed off his dryer, with its automatic regulators, fans and heaters. He had the capacity to handle more than 4,000 pounds of mushrooms each day. ''The Yukon morel is a perfect morel,'' he said. ''Look at this one.'' He picked up a mushroom that was about as long as my thumb, with a black cap and a pale gray ring at the bottom where the stem had been cut. It was as symmetrical as an ace on a playing card. He urged me to tap it with my fingernail. The sound was clear and hollow. Unfortunately, Moroz didn't have many like it. Inside his dryer were row after row of empty racks. He was attempting to comfort himself with a historical view. ''That's the Yukon for you,'' Moroz said. ''A lot of guys left after the gold rush with only the pack on their back.''
 We were now into the last week of June. ''We're all losing our shirts,'' confirmed Pierre Brulot, a Canadian from France who had come to the Yukon hoping to purchase many thousands of pounds. ''There aren't enough pickers in the woods.''
 With the fruiting season reaching its climax and almost nobody to hunt the mushrooms, the price held steady, and then began to rise. Soon it was $6 per pound. 
 Before the end of the season it would hit $7. This was good news for Shawn Ryan. His haul last year was 6,000 pounds. This time he expected to do even better. To prove it, he took Arora and me on a scouting trip to a burned forest that caught his interest while he was prospecting this spring. The hike was dramatic. The landscape was fascinating. We did not find a single morel. 
 Other pickers had been coming in with full baskets, and Arora cheerfully taunted our guide. But Ryan was undaunted. ''We're playing a game of statistical probability,'' he said. An empiricist, Ryan holds that not finding mushrooms is almost as informative as finding them, as each negative result narrowed the scope of his search. 
 This sounded to me like an excuse, and I searched his face for signs of embarrassment. I found none, and three days later we were up the river with his crew.
 Ryan promised to bring us to a slope that would contain more morels than we had ever seen before. ''Did you even go and check out this patch?'' asked Cathy Wood. They had brought their children along, and everybody was planning to pick. ''I don't need to do that, dear,'' Ryan said. ''I walk with confidence now. It's a statistical thing.'' 
 Ryan is stocky, not very tall, with a large chest and forearms that swell slightly below the elbow from carrying heavy things. He led us along a swampy creekside and then up into the stumps and skeletons of fir. His pace through the woods was brutally fast. There was no path, of course, just blackened trees, which made thick lines across our hands and clothes as we pushed through. 
 Morels often have the same color as the ground they grow in. This makes them hard to spot, so pickers hunting in marginal areas will distrust what they see, making second and third visual sweeps, staring hard at a shadow, commanding stray shapes to resolve themselves into morels. The mushrooms grow secretly; and perhaps this is why, as soon as we got into the larger trees, the enormous clumps of morels seemed shockingly, almost illicitly bold. Nature had abandoned its modesty. There were morels everywhere.
 ''That's just to keep you salivating,'' said Ryan. He had a point to make, and he did not let us stop. ''Keep walking. Come on,'' he said. This was torment to Arora, who had finally reached the bonanza he had been hearing about for weeks. The more Arora wanted to pick, the faster Ryan hurried him, until the scene was like something out of Aesop's fables, with Arora begging to stop and Ryan enticing him forward. ''Ay, there's so much more,'' said Ryan, ''this is just the beginning.'' He moved another 300 feet away. 
 Finally, as if paralyzed by the richness of the strike, we stood and talked among the mushrooms, not even picking. Across the valley, on the other side of the creek, we could see the cinnamon-colored tops of singed trees. ''If there's mushrooms here, I eat my hat!'' Ryan said, and gave his trumpeting laugh. He was quoting what a French buyer said to him 15 years ago, before commercial pickers had discovered the Yukon. 
 There in the forest, Ryan told us that he had been studying Ron Ower's patent. He had an idea about how to grow morels, not in the lab but here in the woods, in succeeding years after a burn. ''The goal is to get a good chunk of coin with mining, then go into cultivation,'' he said.
 I could not believe my ears. Here in this remarkable patch of mushrooms -- perhaps too many for him to harvest quickly enough, even with his crew -- Shawn Ryan, trapper and prospector, was talking about agriculture. But agriculture has nothing to do with this sort of unbidden glory. Agriculture involves steadfast attachment, a rhythm of reciprocal actions. Agriculture is work. 
 A few weeks later, when I gave him a call, Ryan was back to normal. I had left him in camp with his family and crew. They were getting huge quantities of morels, drying them in racks, going out twice a day and returning with six or seven baskets each time -- crushing weight. Going to sleep under the blue sky at midnight, they were filthy and tired. When they weren't picking, they were felling trees, building dryers, shuttling supplies in and out. Ryan was running up bills with the local helicopter firm he uses for his exploration jobs, getting them to drop in more necessities for his crew: bacon, cigarettes, coffee. 
 In retrospect, this effort left no trace in his mind. ''It's not like we had a job,'' he said. I found this hilarious, and laughed out loud. ''We made money out of nothing, out of thin air!'' All he remembered is that he discovered treasure, that one day he went for a walk in the woods and found a fortune there.

HEADLINE: Jazz Is King At William Paterson

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY

DATELINE: WAYNE 

 BODY:
DESPITE its 150-year history, 11,000 students and sprawling hilltop campus, William Paterson University is all but anonymous to much of its home state's general population. But among the jazz cognoscenti, William Paterson is admired worldwide.
 ''Without question, it is one of the most respected and esteemed jazz studies programs in the country,'' said Bill McFarlin, executive director of the International Association for Jazz Education. ''Absolutely.''
 The jazz program's big man on campus these days is the trumpeter Clark Terry, a revered figure who played with Duke Ellington and was a mentor to Miles Davis. Apart from a celestial career of gigging and recording throughout most of the 20th century and into the 21st, Mr. Terry has been called the father of jazz education, having held countless clinics, written 3 books and received 13 honorary doctorates, among many other honors, including the 2006 President's Award from Mr. McFarlin's group. 
 After being brought into William Paterson's Jazz Studies Program by a close friend, the pianist James Williams, Mr. Terry, or C. T., as he is often called, is now an adjunct professor who coaches a student ensemble on Wednesday nights. He lives in Haworth, about a half-hour's drive from the Wayne campus that overlooks Paterson, and serves as a mentor, sage and all-around inspiration to the program's 83 graduate and undergraduate students.
 ''Every word he says is pretty much beneficial to your development as a musician,'' said Garret Brown, a senior and drummer from Medford. ''He's the man.''
 Two years ago, Mr. Terry gave the university his personal archive, a Smithsonian-quality collection of instruments, musical manuscripts, personal correspondence and other jazz artifacts. ''We're slightly envious that they got Clark's stuff,'' said Dan Morgenstern, director of the Institute for Jazz Studies at Rutgers University's Newark campus, which is said to house the world's largest jazz library. ''It's a wonderful thing that Clark did that.''
 To show its appreciation, and to fulfill a broader goal of improving the jazz program's facilities, William Paterson has started a $15 million drive to build the Clark Terry Concert Hall, which would be a 20,000-square-foot building housing a 450-seat concert hall, rehearsal rooms and glass atrium for Mr. Terry's archives and those of a fellow trumpeter, Thad Jones, founding director of the program in 1973. ''It means the world to me,'' Mr. Terry, who is 85, said in his raspy baritone during a break in a recent Wednesday night session, when he taught the student sextet the standard ''Girl of My Dreams, I Love You,'' by singing each instrument's part. ''It's something I've always dreamed of, never thought it would ever happen. Makes me feel like all my efforts, the dues I've paid, haven't been paid in vain.''
 But the fund drive, kicked off last November with a campus event whose host was Bill Cosby, has raised virtually no money so far, according to the university's president, Arnold Speert. Though Mr. Terry may seem younger when he plays the trumpet, like any octogenarian his tempo is slowing. His wife, Gwen, said his medical history includes colon cancer and a struggle with diabetes that has diminished his eyesight.
 So it is a race against time, as William Paterson tries to raise the money and complete the concert hall before Mr. Terry himself passes into jazz history.
 ''It's one thing for him to know -- and he must know -- how his music will be appreciated by countless generations,'' Dr. Speert said. ''But I'd like him to also be able to see evidence that his devotion of his life to teaching young talent, to bringing along young talent, is appreciated as well.'' 
 Dr. Speert, a former chemistry professor who admits to a layman's appreciation for jazz, is credited by jazz faculty members with coming up with the idea to build the new concert hall in Mr. Terry's name. 
 ''He's a very hip guy,'' said Richard DeRosa, supervisor of the program's arranging and ensemble sections; off campus, he plays drums and writes arrangements for Wynton Marsalis, who performed at William Paterson last March as part of the school's long-running Jazz Room Series.
 The Jazz Studies Program, which has 65 undergraduate and 18 graduate students, was built by a progression of world-class performer/educators, beginning with Mr. Jones. He was succeeded by the bassist Rufus Reid, who as director of jazz studies from 1980 to 1999 put William Paterson's jazz program on a par with those at the Manhattan School of Music, Juilliard, the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston and a handful of other elite music schools. The pianist Mulgrew Miller is the program's current director of jazz studies, while its top administrator is David Demsey, an accomplished saxophone player. 
 The program is known for it emphasis on small-group ensembles. Accordingly, each semester students are grouped into 24 trios, quartets or quintets, and on Dialogue Day, they perform before an audience of students and faculty, who critique each performance. At a recent session, several dozens students sat in the 100-seat ensemble room at Shea Center for the Performing Arts, the music department's main performance and rehearsal space, listening to ensembles play their own arrangements of Gershwin tunes. 
 ''I didn't really feel enough pocket,'' Mr. Miller told one group. ''You were playing the same tempo, but you weren't necessarily playing together.''
 Mr. Miller is also a towering figure here, and students gathered around him as he demonstrated his own technique. While his critiques were direct -- ''They're here to learn,'' he said -- Mr. Miller took pains not to undermine students' confidence. ''First of all, you have to be careful about the tone,'' he said of his criticism. ''I just like them to know that I'm in their corner.''
 Josh Richman, a sophomore piano player from Hatfield, Pa., said the pressure of being scrutinized by one of his idols can be intense. ''At times it's kind of nerve-racking because he's Mulgrew Miller,'' he said. ''But he's such a nice guy.'' 
 Mr. Richman has begun gigging in Philadelphia with a trio that includes Mike Emswiler, a sophomore from Washington State on bass, and Mr. Brown, whose playing is admired by his classmates. ''You're my favorite drummer, man!'' Lalo Balandrano, a drummer and master's candidate from Mexico City, told him recently. 
 Several students car-pooled to a gig Mr. Miller was playing later that night at Smoke, a jazz club in Manhattan, 20 miles away. One of the attractions of William Paterson is its combination of bucolic setting and nearness to New York City. 
 ''I'd heard a lot about it, and a lot of people, a lot of really good players, seem to be going there and coming out of there,'' said Ethan O'Reilly, a bass player and senior at Montclair High School, who will enter William Paterson in the fall. ''I paid a visit and checked it out, and I really liked it a lot.''
 The Clark Terry Concert Hall is anticipated by students and faculty members not only as a tribute to its namesake. Shea Center was not built to house a music program, but rather for drama and speech. The 965-seat theater at the Shea Center, now home to the Jazz Room Series, is actually a multipurpose room, with poor acoustics and a lack of intimacy. The university started the drive for the new hall even as it was already moving ahead with one of its largest capital projects since its founding in 1855 as a teachers college, an $80 million renovation and expansion of the main science building. But unlike the concert hall, the science project is being financed by a bond issue, and its progress does not depend on donors. 
 These are challenging financial times for all of New Jersey's four-year public colleges and universities, which face steep cuts in Gov. Jon S. Corzine's fiscal 2007 budget proposal. But fame has its rewards, and Dr. Speert said the Music Department's $2 million budget, which includes the Jazz Studies Program, will probably be spared. ''It is the one program, I think, in which we have an international reputation,'' he said.
 Which is one reason the fund drive will probably succeed, said Beth Hershenhart, chairwoman of the Association of Philanthropic Counsel in Charlotte, N.C. And how long may it take to raise the $15 million? ''Well, some colleges could raise it in about five minutes, some colleges could raise it in five years,'' she said. Once enough money is in place to begin -- Dr. Speert said the university needs to raise $3 million before hiring an architect -- then ''8 or 12 months would be reasonable to build it,'' she said. 
 Mr. Terry played down whether the concert hall would be built in his lifetime. ''I'd love to see it completed,'' he said. ''But if it doesn't make it, it doesn't make it.''
 Despite the acoustic challenges of Shea Center, on Wednesday nights the music made in Room 101 is nothing short of sublime. One recent night, Mr. Terry, sharply dressed as always, in a fine-plaid suit and Art Deco tie, was helped into a cushioned swivel chair as his proteges arranged themselves around him.
 ''What's happening, C. T.?'' said Justin Kauflin, a piano player from Virginia. 
 ''Hey, all right, Justin!'' Mr. Terry said. 
 Mr. Kauflin lost his sight to a childhood illness, and has helped guide Mr. Terry on his own journey into blindness. 
 Clockwise from Mr. Kauflin, the ensemble was made up of Nicholas Morrison on upright bass, a master's candidate from Phoenix; Alan Hicks, a drummer and a senior from Australia; Cameron MacManus, a trombonist and master's candidate from Tennessee; Brian McCarthy, a master's candidate from Vermont, on alto saxophone; and Stantawn Kendrick, a master's candidate from Georgia, on tenor sax. 
 Mr. Terry sang the basic arrangement, allowing students to flesh out their parts, trading ideas with him. The players took turns soloing, as Mr. Terry listened, nodding his head and smiling. 
 Working with students ''makes me feel beautiful because it makes me think younger,'' Mr. Terry said. With established professionals, he added, ''Sometimes you run into egos, you know, attitudes -- sometimes we call them egotudes.''
 Mr. Terry's own musical education was less formal than the university degree programs that have become an increasingly common path to a career in jazz -- a trend that, for various reasons, including economic, has contributed to jazz's shift from a genre traditionally associated with African-Americans to one practiced largely by whites. 
 But jazz was the popular music of Mr. Terry's day growing up in Depression-era St. Louis, a city known for trumpet players. 
 One of the earliest influences on Mr. Terry's playing was not a trumpet player at all, but rather his brother-in-law, Sy Mackfield, who played tuba. ''And in those days, tuba was the basic instrument of the rhythm section,'' Mr. Terry said. ''No string bass, it was always the tuba. And the same type of boom, boom, boom-boom-ba-boom-boom. And I used to like to go to the rehearsals with him, listen to the band, and watch him practice at home. And it had the same valves as the trumpet, you know, same three pistons. So I used to watch him, listen, and said, 'Yeah, that's just like the trumpet.'
 ''It just so happened that one of his buddies in Dewey Jackson's band -- that was a band out of St. Louis -- was a trumpet player, and he had a candy store. He was his own best customer, he always had pockets full of Mary Janes and caramels, his favorite candies. And every time they would rehearse, my brother-in-law would let me come to rehearsals, and when they'd get ready to take a break, the trumpet player -- I can't think of his name right now -- he'd come over to me and say, 'Here son, watch my horn while we take a break.' And he'd give me a couple of pieces of candy. And I thought he was the greatest cat in the world. So that really influenced me. I'm glad he wasn't a banjo player.''

HEADLINE: Legalize or Bust 

BYLINE: By David M. Sperling. 
David M. Sperling is an immigration lawyer.

DATELINE: Huntington Station, N.Y. 

 BODY:
AS the national debate over illegal immigration reaches a fever pitch, it may come as a surprise to learn that legalization of undocumented immigrants from Latin America has been under way in the suburbs of New York City for more than 15 years.
 Special immigration programs starting in 1991 have provided work permits and green cards to tens of thousands of Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans on Long Island and in Westchester County. Their integration into the region's economy provides a glimpse of how legalization could transform the nation. 
The greater metropolitan area is unusual because its immigrant population is overwhelmingly Central American, not Mexican. Unlike Mexicans, Central Americans have been the beneficiaries of some of the country's most generous immigration policies.
 Refugees fleeing guerrilla wars and natural catastrophes in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras streamed into the region starting in the 1980's. After applying for political asylum or temporary protected status, they were able to obtain work permits, Social Security cards and driver's licenses.
 Salvadorans -- by far the largest immigrant group on Long Island and in Westchester -- have been the beneficiaries of two separate protected-status programs, first in 1991 and again in 2001 after devastating earthquakes in their homeland. 
 The latest program, recently extended for another year, has alone resulted in the legalization, albeit temporary, of more than 30,000 Salvadorans living on Long Island and in Westchester. Hondurans living in the United States since 1998 were also eligible for temporary protected status after Hurricane Mitch, and their status has recently been extended to July 2007.
 A 1997 law called the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, has led to legal permanent resident status for more than 15,000 Salvadorans and Guatemalans on Long Island and in Westchester. Thousands more Hispanic immigrants have obtained green cards through work, marriage and family relationships.
 When immigrants attain legal status, everything changes. 
 Emerging from the shadowy underworld of illegal immigrants, legal immigrants have become an integral part of the region's economy. With their coveted work permits and Social Security numbers, they get jobs on the company payroll or start their own businesses, all the while paying taxes and contributing to Social Security. 
 Instead of sending all their money back home, they are investing in their communities, buying houses and revitalizing decaying neighborhoods in communities like Mamaroneck, New Rochelle, Port Chester and Yonkers.
 The negative images that many people have about illegal immigrants would be erased by a legalization program like the compromise measure under consideration in the Senate. That plan would divide undocumented immigrants into three categories, providing a route to citizenship for law-abiding, tax-paying workers who speak English and have been in the United States for at least five years. 
 In many respects, the first category is similar to the program under which Salvadorans and Guatemalans obtained legal permanent resident status. Those Salvadorans and Guatemalans were required to show continuous residence for seven years, ''good moral character'' -- a term of art that has helped root out criminals by checking for misdemeanors and felonies -- and proof of tax payments. Every applicant had to appear before an immigration official at the New York Asylum Office in Rosedale, Queens. As I know from representing hundreds of these applicants, approval rates are high, but the program is certainly not an amnesty.
 Temporary protected status is analogous to the second category, for those undocumented immigrants who have been in the United States for two to five years. These immigrants would qualify as guest workers but would have to leave and re-enter the country to retain that status. They also would be required to demonstrate good moral character.
 Of course, there are those undocumented immigrants who do not qualify for legalization -- the third category in the Senate plan. These immigrants are unlikely to leave voluntarily and no president would order mass deportations. Desperate migrants will always find a way to sneak in, no matter how many billions of dollars are allocated to border security. 
 But at least it would be the first step to repair a system that simply no longer works. If the metropolitan region's experience is any guide, the best solution is legalization.

HEADLINE: Preventing Eminent Disasters

 BODY:
Making your way through downtown Port Chester in the quaint old manner -- on foot, in the open air, looking for a way into a mall known as the Waterfront at Portchester -- gives you a lot of time to ponder the problem of ugly malls and thoughtless land-use decisions. 
 The mall, part of a $100 million downtown renewal project, turns its back on downtown. It presents Main Street with a long, sullen wall, a blank stucco barricade without windows or doors -- its molded lintels and sills creating merely the illusion of windows -- and a gaping truck bay for the hauling of freight. When Allen Ginsberg, in ''Howl,'' wrote ''Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows!'', he might have been anticipating this architectural stinker, which envisions the civic life as something to be conducted within a closed box. 
The real downtown is across the street, where you will find a dilapidated 1888 firehouse, a sidewalk with the words ''Steamship Tickets'' embedded in the concrete, and a motley assortment of stores, delis, bakeries and other mom-and-pop businesses. Whether this bustling, sometimes dumpy-looking business district strikes you as thriving, decaying or something in between depends heavily on your understanding of what constitutes blight.
 The mayor and village board and others who like the Waterfront mall feel sure they know blight when they see it. This is bad news for the moms and pops -- many of them Latino immigrants -- who fear their businesses could be forced out under eminent-domain law, if the current administration's big-box vision of urban renewal expands. An article in The Times by Joseph Berger in February captured the plaintive mood of the residents from Peru, Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador who fret about being ordered to make way -- as other businesses in Port Chester did -- for the chain stores from nowhere.
 Their worries are echoed on a national scale. The Supreme Court recently upheld the right of the City of New London, Conn., to seize private property for economic development, provoking a nationwide rush by state lawmakers to refine and restrict their states' ability to exercise such power. The legislative scramble is understandable, although the eminent domain principle, which gave down-and-out New London a means to regain its economic footing, is sound. 
 The question is how to balance the scales of justice when the powerful -- a municipality and a developer -- take something valuable from the weak. In New York State, whose eminent domain law has been criticized as unfair to the little guy, there have been efforts to mitigate the harm. Assemblyman Richard Brodsky changed state law to require that property owners on the losing end of eminent domain decisions be alerted by certified mail or told in person, rather than through a fine-print legal notice in a newspaper. 
 Assemblyman Adam Bradley wants to protect homeowners and small businesses with a law that tries to make sure they are compensated fairly. It would entitle homeowners and mom-and-pop businesses (with receipts of less than $1 million) to a jury trial over eminent domain compensation, and require that they receive at least enough money to relocate in an equivalent area and to cover lawyers' fees, moving expenses and closing costs. 
 It is not possible to legislate good sense at the local level, to make sure that today's urban renewal isn't urban removal, and that today's spectacular shopping experience is not tomorrow's desolate retail wasteland. The challenge of reviving old downtowns will be with us for a long time, as will the problem of local officials making benighted decisions, as they seem to have done in Port Chester. The sensible approach is to lessen the harm, as Mr. Bradley seeks to do.

HEADLINE: Abroad at the Pump, Circumspection by the Barrel

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: MUNICH 

 BODY:
THE German mass-market newspaper Bild carried a banner headline last week complaining about all the new taxes being proposed by the government: a higher sales tax, a health care tax and a surtax on rich people.
 Nowhere did it mention fuel taxes, which account for more than half of every euro spent at the gas pump. On that very day, gasoline had hit the equivalent of $6.40 a gallon. But even at today's prices, few people here are calling for gasoline taxes to be cut.
The lack of debate about gasoline prices in Europe is instructive at a time when American politicians are scrambling to soothe their angry constituents with ill-fated proposals like a $100 rebate for motorists. 
 It's not that Europeans like paying $6 a gallon to fill up their Fiats. Nor do they relish paying taxes; Bild warns that the new taxes being proposed could strangle Germany's economic rebound. But for now, people here seem to agree that taxing gasoline is both necessary -- as a way to raise money to pay down their huge public debts -- and beneficial for the environment.
 So while the latest spike in fuel prices has provoked howls of anguish from many Americans, Europeans have reacted like, well, Europeans -- with a mixture of weary resignation, halfhearted anger toward ''price-gouging'' oil companies and bemusement at the furor across the Atlantic.
 ''We've been debating these issues intensely for the last few decades, while the Americans were paying no attention to them,'' said Hans-Werner Sinn, the president of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research here. ''People have gotten tired of talking about it, quite frankly.''
 Other countries with high gas prices are coping quietly as well. In Japan, people are turning to self-service gas stations, which are a few pennies a gallon cheaper. Truckmakers are giving drivers lessons on how to avoid wasting fuel (do not put the pedal to the metal when accelerating).
 Gasoline in Japan costs nearly twice what it does in the United States because of the taxes. The other high-tax countries include Europe's two big oil producers, Norway and Britain, as well as Turkey, South Korea and Poland.
 Perhaps surprising, the steep taxes make Europeans less sensitive to surges in the wholesale price of crude oil than Americans, for whom the producer's price represents far more of the total. In addition, many of the taxes here are fixed, allowing only the underlying oil price to fluctuate. 
 In the United States, some of the taxes, though lower over all, are levied as a percentage of the oil price, which means a jump in the price of a barrel has an even more pronounced effect at the pump.
 Europe, in addition, is reaping the benefits of trying to cut its dependence on fossil fuels: it has smaller cars and better public transportation. Not least, these days, it has the help of a strong currency, the euro, which acts as a hedge against changes in the dollar-denominated oil market.
 Despite this, a few Europeans are starting to point fingers. Last week, Luxembourg's prime minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, called on the European Union to impose a windfall profit tax on oil companies, which he said were ''starting to irritate parts of our public opinion.''
 It is not clear whether his proposal will get any farther than a similar one in the Congress, which President Bush has threatened to veto. Some of Europe's equanimity may have to do with a simple change in the public mood: the economy, after three years of sputtering, has begun to rev up.
 ''When gas prices went up two years ago, we were able to live off it for days,'' said Klaus-Peter Siegloch, the head of news for the German television network ZDF. ''Now we barely put it on TV.''


CARACAS: $0.12; KUWAIT $0.78; RIYADH: $0.91
VENEZUELA, SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT -- Oil-producing countries the world over heavily subsidize gasoline as a dividend to their populations.

JOHANNESBURG: $3.39
SOUTH AFRICA -- Like Europe, it is insulated somewhat from the effects of high gas prices by the strength of its currency, compared with the weak dollar. Unlike Europe, it has lower fuel taxes.

NEW DELHI: $3.71
INDIA -- The government controls prices to rural consumers but high taxes apply in cities. The government is promoting compressed natural gas, which is cheaper than oil, as an alternative fuel in cars.

BEIJING: 2.05; SHANGHAI: $1.94
CHINA -- Price controls have shielded consumers from the full brunt of high energy costs; last year, the government started to decontrol prices, meaning that drivers pay more.

OSLO: $6.90
NORWAY -- Despite being an oil producer with a tiny population, Norway has perhaps the most expensive gasoline on earth. That's because it uses high taxes on gasoline to limit domestic consumption, for environmental reasons.

LONDON: $6.28; BRUSSELS: $6.16; ROME: $5.53
REST OF EUROPE -- Governments have always looked at gasoline taxes as a way to raise significant revenue.

SYDNEY: $3.42

HEADLINE: Legalize or Bust 

BYLINE: By David M. Sperling. 
David M. Sperling is an immigration lawyer.

DATELINE: Huntington Station 

 BODY:
AS the national debate over illegal immigration reaches a fever pitch, it may come as a surprise to learn that legalization of undocumented immigrants from Latin America has been under way on Long Island for more than 15 years.
 Special immigration programs starting in 1991 have provided work permits and green cards to tens of thousands of Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans on Long Island. Their integration into the region's economy provides a glimpse of how legalization could transform the nation.
The greater metropolitan area is unusual because its immigrant population is overwhelmingly Central American, not Mexican. Unlike Mexicans, Central Americans have been the beneficiaries of some of the country's most generous immigration policies. 
 Refugees fleeing guerrilla wars and natural catastrophes in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras streamed onto Long Island starting in the 1980's. After applying for political asylum or temporary protected status, they were able to obtain work permits, Social Security cards and driver's licenses.
 Salvadorans -- by far the largest immigrant group on Long Island -- have been the beneficiaries of two separate protected-status programs, first in 1991 and again in 2001 after devastating earthquakes in their homeland. 
 The latest program, recently extended for another year, has alone resulted in the legalization, albeit temporary, of more than 25,000 Salvadorans living on Long Island. Hondurans living in the United States since 1998 were also eligible for temporary protected status after Hurricane Mitch, and their status has recently been extended to July 2007.
 A 1997 law called the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, has led to legal permanent resident status for more than 12,000 Salvadorans and Guatemalans on Long Island. Thousands more Hispanic immigrants have obtained green cards through work, marriage and family relationships.
 When immigrants attain legal status, everything changes. 
 Emerging from the shadowy underworld of the estimated 125,000 illegal immigrants on Long Island, legal immigrants have become an integral part of the region's economy. With their coveted work permits and Social Security numbers, they get jobs on the company payroll or start their own businesses, all the while paying taxes and contributing to Social Security. 
 Instead of sending all their money back home, they are investing in their communities, buying houses and revitalizing decaying neighborhoods in communities like Bay Shore, Brentwood, Hempstead, Huntington Station and Patchogue.
 The negative images that many people have about illegal immigrants would be erased by a legalization program like the compromise measure under consideration in the Senate. That plan would divide undocumented immigrants into three categories, providing a route to citizenship for law-abiding, tax-paying workers who speak English and have been in the United States for at least five years. 
 In many respects, the first category is similar to the programs under which Salvadorans and Guatemalans obtained legal permanent resident status. Those Salvadorans and Guatemalans were required to show continuous residence for seven years, ''good moral character'' -- a term of art that has helped root out criminals by checking for misdemeanors and felonies -- and proof of tax payments. Every applicant had to appear before an immigration official at the New York Asylum Office in Rosedale, Queens. As I know from representing hundreds of these applicants, approval rates are high, but the program is certainly not an amnesty.
 Temporary protected status is analogous to the second category, for those undocumented immigrants who have been in the United States for two to five years. These immigrants would qualify as guest workers but would have to leave and re-enter the country to retain that status. They also would be required to demonstrate good moral character.
 Of course, there are those undocumented immigrants who do not qualify for legalization -- the third category in the Senate plan. These immigrants are unlikely to leave voluntarily and no president would order mass deportations. Desperate migrants will always find a way to sneak in, no matter how many billions of dollars are allocated to border security. 
 But at least it would be the first step to repair a system that simply no longer works. If Long Island's experience is any guide, the best solution is legalization.

HEADLINE: Quinnipiac Plans More Dorms, to Hamden's Relief 

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
ONE lone building was enough to house Quinnipiac University, then a tiny commuter school known as the Connecticut College of Commerce, when it opened in Hamden in 1929.
 Now, the school takes up half the town, or so it seems to many neighbors, who complain that the school's surging growth is destroying Hamden's small-town New England character. Quinnipiac, which has 17 graduate programs, a well-known polling service and nationally ranked sports teams, is now sprawled across 500 acres on two campuses.
More specifically, these neighbors criticize Quinnipiac for not building enough dorms for its students, forcing about 2,000 of its 5,000 undergraduate students to bunk off-campus, which brings noise and clutter, they said, to residential neighborhoods used to cleanliness and quiet. 
 ''It's not the students in the housing, it's the student housing that doesn't belong,'' said Lester Faiman, a 60-year resident of the Mount Carmel section of Hamden, which includes the school. 
 Mr. Faiman also serves as a co-president of Concerned Citizens for Hamden Neighborhoods, a 100-member group that formed last November to oppose Quinnipiac's expansion plans. 
 ''It's a very poor situation that has grown beyond acceptable,'' Mr. Faiman said.
 Quinnipiac administrators announced at a town meeting on April 18 that the school plans enough new dormitories for another 2,348 students, which would take almost all of the overflow students out of the community and put them back on campus. The university has 13 dormitories and said it will build five more in the next five years.
 That could finally address the longstanding housing shortage, which the school is acutely aware of.
 ''The primary issue here is that people in their late teens and 20's are living in a residential neighborhood,'' said Lynn Bushnell, a school spokeswoman. ''If you're a family with young children, you're up early and in bed early, and that's not the lifestyle of a 20-year-old.''
 Many residents said they are pleased with the physical expansion to the main campus on Mount Carmel Avenue, which now features low-slung buildings and brick-lined walks, nestled at the base of Sleeping Giant State Park, a series of tree-draped ridges popular with hikers. 
 The same residents are also grateful that Quinnipiac gives back a lot to Hamden in terms of entertainment, whether arts or athletics, rock concerts or hockey games. And the school, which is Hamden's largest employer after the town itself, is clearly an economic engine.
 Yet negative effects of a small college's quick transformation into a major university are felt strongly in an area still dotted with some Colonial homes and horse farms.
 During the day, cars clog the major road, Route 10, where a traffic light can change twice before stopped cars can pass underneath. In recent years, parked cars have also lined up two or three deep on suburban lawns.
 ''Quinnipiac for all its glory and wonder and greatness has definitely sprawled,'''' said Joseph Pepe, an archivist for the Hamden Historical Society and 27-year Hamden resident. ''That has created problems.''
 A solution for decreasing the number of students who live in Quinnipiac's surrounding neighborhoods that is favored by many residents is simply to enforce existing laws.
 One of them is a zoning regulation, approved in 2001, that represents an earlier effort to crack down on the numbers of students sharing off-campus houses. 
 The regulation stipulates that an absentee landlord who wants to rent to a student must get a special permit from the town's planning and zoning office. Even with a permit, no more than four students can live in a one-family home, unless the students are related. 
 Mayor Craig Henrici said his promise to enforce this regulation helped propel him to victory in Hamden's mayoral election last fall. 
 Mr. Henrici, who is a Democrat, appointed a new town planner and filled two zoning enforcement positions that had been empty. 
 And the new hires got right to work. Between Mr. Henrici's election in November and April, the zoning officers issued 15 notices of violation, 2 cease-and-desist orders and a fine, almost all having to do with student overcrowding, according to preliminary figures from Hamden's planning and zoning office.
 But cracking down on all students who are living in illegal conditions may be a formidable task. 
 Of the 400 off-campus addresses where students are known to live, only about 45 have permits allowing students, zoning officials said. Although many of the 400 addresses are apartment buildings, which don't need permits, zoning officials said many others are one-family homes that are renting to students without a permit. Also, some students both own and live in their units, so they don't need permits.
 Further complicating matters is tracking down landlords, some of whom live out of state. Other landlords buy homes through trusts, so it can be difficult to determine who owns the property.
 Still, in what zoning officials said was a possible sign of improving town-university relations, Quinnipiac has started sharing its records of known student off-campus addresses with town officials. That, plus the announcement about the new dorms, is heartening to the mayor.
 ''Change won't be immediate, and we realize that it's very unlikely that 100 percent of the student body will ever want to live on campus,'' Mr. Henrici said. ''But we can deal with 5 percent who don't.''
 Yet even some landlords who said that they play by the rules said the deck is stacked against them in the community, because the neighbors are so soured.
 ''I don't understand these people who complain, not one of them,'' said Ari Gorfain, president of the Hamden-based AMG Property Management, who said that all of his houses are properly permitted.
 He said he owned ''a dozen'' homes, not wanting to be specific because of concerns that residents would be upset with him for renting to so many students. 
 ''If they were smart, the neighbors would turn this into a positive and sell their homes,'' said Mr. Gorfain, who is also a local DJ and co-owner of two New Haven night clubs. ''They could probably get four times what they paid.''
 For its part, Quinnipiac promises on-campus housing for undergraduates for their first three years. As seniors, students are on their own. (Quinnipiac also plays the role of off-campus landlord, offering 30 homes for students.)
 But some students complain that the guaranteed housing is far from desirable. 
 Leah Silverstone, a sophomore from Melrose, Mass., said Quinnipiac, where undergraduate tuition, including room and board, costs $36,980 a year, sometimes packs 12 people into suites designed for 8.
 As a result, she is looking to live in an apartment near the campus, in a neighborhood popular with students.
 ''When I went away to college, I didn't realize it was going to be like this,'' Ms. Silverstone said. ''It's extremely frustrating.''
 When the school gets new dorms, most of them are planned for the Sherman Avenue campus, part of a $200 million five-year expansion plan, which also calls for a student center and new parking lots.
 The 250-acre property, which was bought in pieces by the university beginning in 1997, is already home to a new hockey and basketball arena, which is under construction but whose gleaming roof is visible from the top of Sleeping Giant.
 Whether or not Quinnipiac will continue to leave its mark on the land with more buildings is somewhat unclear. 
 The school has refused to cap its enrollment, but promises, as part of its expansion plan, to have a bed on campus for every undergraduate student. ''We will not grow at the undergraduate level unless we have enough residences to meet that growth,'' said Ms. Bushnell, the school spokeswoman.
 Yet some neighbors remained skeptical.
 ''The new dorms are a great undertaking, a big enterprise, but there are some big wild cards in there,'' said Joanne Iacobellis, a 40-year Hamden resident who is president of the Kenwood Valley Neighborhood Association.
 Ms. Iacobellis also serves as co-president of Concerned Citizens for Hamden Neighborhoods.
 ''We're hopeful but cautious,'' she said, ''because we're not going to have any real answers for a couple years.''

HEADLINE: Border Arrests Rise as U.S. Debates Immigration Issue

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
Outside a shelter for migrants in the teeming Mexican city of Tijuana, Jesus Lugo Diaz clutched a creased paper with names and numbers of people in the United States scrawled over it -- and clung to the hope of sneaking across the border.
 It would be his fifth try.
''One way or the other you're going to cross,'' Mr. Diaz, 36, said as he waited for the shelter to open and offer him a bed and food for the night, a few days after the United States Border Patrol had last caught him and sent him back.
 Here on the American side, a Border Patrol agent, Richard Kite, surveyed an array of fences, stadium lights and sensors. Mr. Kite kept a wary eye on several men loitering just across the border, singling out one perched atop a billboard. 
 ''He's probably a spotter,'' Mr. Kite said.
 The cat-and-mouse game along the 1,900-mile border with Mexico proceeds as it always has, even as the national debate over revamping immigration laws intensifies. The chanting in the streets of America's big cities and the arguing in the halls of Congress serve mostly as background noise.
 The ebb and flow of arrests also goes on, with the Border Patrol watching a dip in central Arizona and a spike in San Diego and other developed areas for signs of shifting smuggling patterns. 
 Some suggest that a Senate proposal to adopt a guest worker program, possibly leading to legal residency and citizenship for many of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, might be inspiring more people to try a crossing. Others say the larger numbers indicate nothing more than stepped up enforcement or even a statistical aberration. Nobody really knows. 
 The peaks and valleys of arrests over the years reflect a variety of social, economic and political influences, including the pull of jobs and family here, a lack of opportunity on the other side, or even the weather. 
 What is certain is the United States keeps building up its border defenses, with more planned this year, including adding 1,500 agents and spending some $35 million in Arizona alone on surveillance equipment.
 People still keep trying to get in, tucked under the dashboards of cars, tunneling under the fences -- more than a dozen passages have been found this year -- throwing bicycles over the barriers and pedaling away like weekend enthusiasts, crawling through brush, and walking, walking and walking -- sometimes dying in the desert. 
 ''They are ingenious sometimes,'' Mr. Kite said.
 Fresh off a four-day bus ride from Leon, Mexico, Roberto Estrada, 43, toted a small plastic grocery bag with his belongings and planned to bed down the night before making contact with a smuggler. He said he had heard nothing about the immigration debate in the United States and was simply itching for work, maybe in a restaurant, but he would not get picky.
 ''I'll take whatever job,'' Mr. Estrada said.
 After a peak of 1,676,438 arrests in 2000, apprehensions dropped, but they have drifted upward again to 1,189,067 in 2005 from 931,557 in 2003.
 While the Border Patrol attributes the increase to the build up of security, scholars who study the border said it was more likely that migration was rebounding from an economic slump after the Sept. 11 attacks and years of diminished back-and-forth crossings by repeat crossers. 
 In the San Diego sector, which includes some of the Border Patrol's heaviest fortifications, federal agents have apprehended 90,843 people since October, a 33 percent increase over the same period a year before.
 Along the busiest stretch for crossings, a 1,000-mile stretch from San Diego to the Texas state line, there have been 699,609 arrests over the same period, a 6 percent increase. 
 But arrest figures fluctuate, so the Border Patrol cannot declare a trend. As a rule of thumb, the agency estimates that for every person arrested two or three get through. But because of repeat arrests the number of apprehensions does not necessarily reflect the actual number of people trying to cross. 
 Still, people familiar with the border crossings, including the head of the union representing the border agents, suggest that the crossing attempts are growing, with some of those inspired by the prospect of a guest worker program.
 ''I think we are starting to see the early stage of a rush to take advantage of what is perceived to be a shift in immigration policy,'' said T. J. Bonner, president of the union, the National Border Patrol Council.
 Mr. Bonner said some of the people arrested had told agents that they believed Congress had approved a guest worker program that would make their presence in the United States legal. 
 Mario Martinez, a spokesman for the Border Patrol in Washington, did not dismiss the guest worker program as a factor in the rising numbers of crossing efforts, but he said other influences, like jobs and reuniting with family, could also account for the increase.

Cornelius, director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California, San Diego, said researchers there recently surveyed prospective migrants from the Yucatan Peninsula. They found that 60 percent of them had heard of the guest worker debate and that 30 percent said it would make them more likely to go the United States if it was approved. Only one who had already made the trip said the program was the main reason. 
 Operators of shelters in Mexico said they had noticed an increase in the number of people passing through, but they were also unsure of the cause. 
 The director of the Casa del Migrante shelter in Tijuana, the Rev. Luiz Kendzierski, said shelter visits had increased about 20 percent in the past year. More than anything, he said, grinding poverty in parts of Mexico and Central America and word from relatives about the ease of finding jobs in the United States have pushed most people to try crossing.
 At Casa Betania, a shelter in Mexicali, Mexico, Tomas Reyes Hernandez, the director, said he had heard only a few people mention the prospect of legalization as a reason for crossing. 
 ''Most people don't know what is going on in the United States,'' he said.
 At the Tijuana shelter, men flowed in and out, trading stories about their journey to the border and comparing notes on promising smugglers.
 More and more people use guides, known as coyotes or polleros, because of the dangers of the desert and the strengthened enforcement.
 ''It's not that hard if you're willing to pay a good smuggler,'' said a 23-year-old man deported from Los Angeles after an arrest for domestic violence. ''The hard part is getting the $2,000, $3,000 it costs for a good one. But sometimes they can get you across right here in Tijuana in the trunk or under the seat of a van.''

HEADLINE: Plan to Reshape Mileage Standards Could Buoy Detroit

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6 

 BODY:
Of all the proposals that $3-a-gallon gasoline has elicited from Congress, the one that would do the least to bring down high gasoline prices might be higher fuel economy standards for cars, at least in the next 5 to 10 years, experts say.
 But it could help Detroit automakers, which might be just as much of a motivation for a change. 
Conservation advocates have called for higher mileage standards for years, but they and other car experts agree that during periods of high gasoline prices, the government standards, called Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE standards, are irrelevant, because consumers buy smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles without prompting. 
 For 2005, with a government requirement for a minimum average for cars of 27.5 miles per gallon, the preliminary estimate by the Environmental Protection Agency is that the actual average was 28.9 m.p.g.
 Falling gasoline prices illustrate the value of the standards, said Kateri Callahan, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group based here. 
 ''What you're doing with CAFE is saying, as a society, there's a minimum level of fuel efficiency that we think ought to be offered,'' Ms. Callahan said. ''History shows that when, and if, energy is cheap again, and people fall back into old and bad habits, you want to make sure they can act only so badly.'' 
 At that point, the standards limit the growth of oil imports and the average fuel economy of the fleet, and help with the balance of payments problem in the long term. That is what happened in this country in the 1990's, when a price war between Persian Gulf oil producers pushed the price of a barrel below $10. 
 But when CAFE standards were being introduced in the 1980's, the average fuel economy of vehicles sold exceeded government mandates for much of the period. That was partly a result of the oil price spike of 1979-1980, which still ranks as the most severe when prices are adjusted for inflation.
 The provision of the energy bill proposed by Senate Republican leaders, and endorsed last month by President Bush, does not explicitly call for higher standards. Instead, it calls for allowing the Transportation Department to restructure the CAFE rules for cars, as it recently did for trucks. 
 There is no strong indication that the Bush administration will raise the magic number significantly. And transportation officials already have the power to raise the number, without any action by Congress.
 What those officials want Congress to approve is legislation that would allow them to reorganize the standards, as they recently did for light trucks. Transportation officials say they would like to create a sliding scale for minimum fuel economy, based on ''footprint,'' or distance between the wheels. They say they are seeking this authority because of a study by the National Academy of Sciences that showed that forcing people into smaller vehicles had led to a slight increase in traffic deaths. 
 The administration wants to keep vehicle size constant but to force automakers to use materials and technologies that will improve fuel economy in whatever size vehicle is offered.
 In March, when transportation officials rewrote the truck standard, the new rules demanded only a small increase in overall mileage, although they pushed the minimum required fuel economy for some small sport utility vehicles to above the level now required for cars.
 Setting the standard vehicle by vehicle is important because existing car standards make no difference to some manufacturers. For example, for 2005, the most recent year for which statistics are available, Toyota and Honda both averaged 33.1 m.p.g., partly because they sold a lot of small cars, and they had no CAFE concerns.
 DaimlerChrysler averaged 26.6, and Ford, 26.9, and unlike Toyota and Honda, both manufacturers had to worry about technology and sales mix. If cars were judged individually, even small cars that performed poorly considering their size would have to be improved. Thus, the burden would fall for the first time on companies that make mostly smaller cars, generally imports. 
 The actual importance of these miles per gallon figures is also diluted somewhat by oddities of the testing procedure and rules that allow adjustments to the numbers. CAFE numbers are 15 percent higher than window-sticker numbers, and even the numbers on the window sticker are higher than what most drivers will achieve.
 In addition, automakers may earn a credit of up to 1.2 miles per gallon for building ''flex fuel'' vehicles that can run on something other than gasoline. Almost all of these are cars capable of burning ethanol, although most of them will never see ethanol beyond the 10 percent sometimes blended into ordinary gasoline. 
 Car makers can also carry over credits from previous years or borrow them from future years, which is why Ford is unlikely to pay penalties and DaimlerChrysler may not have to either, despite being below 27.5 miles per gallon.
 Some policy makers are counting on new CAFE standards for a different purpose, though. 
 Representative Sherwood Boehlert, the New York Republican who is chairman of the House Science Committee and a longtime advocate of higher standards, said that adopting them now would send a signal to automobile companies that investments in new tooling and technology to produce high-mileage vehicles will pay back for years to come. It will also stimulate inventors with new ideas, Mr. Boehlert said. 
 ''They will come out of the woodwork,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Hen Activist Says the War On Cages Will Go On

BYLINE: By MICHELLE YORK

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, May 5 

 BODY:
An animal-rights activist acquitted of burglary and other charges after admittedly sneaking onto a large commercial egg farm to film conditions there said his group would continue to pressure the company to stop caging hens.
 ''We'll embolden our efforts,'' said the activist, Adam C. Durand, of Rochester, who has lead a two-year protest against the egg-farming practices of the popular regional supermarket chain Wegmans.
Some 750,000 hens at the Wegmans farm in Wolcott, N.Y., are kept in wire cages, as are the vast majority of the nation's hens used for commercial egg production. The practice has an economic benefit, since farmers can house far more hens by stacking cages. Also, caged flocks tend to have a lower mortality rate, since they are less vulnerable to disease and predators. 
 But at some commercial farms, hens are sometimes packed so tightly into cages that they cannot lie down or flap their wings. ''It's among the most abusive factory-farming practices used today,'' said Paul Shapiro, a director of the Humane Society of the United States, who leads a campaign to ban the practice.
 A Wegmans spokeswoman, Jeanne Colleluori, said the film was not representative of the farm. ''The film was slanted in a very negative way,'' she said. 
 The Rochester group intended to dissuade consumers from buying eggs from farms that use cages by producing a film to show conditions at the Wegmans farm, one of the largest in the Northeast. 
 Mr. Durand, 26, admitted that he and several others crept onto the Wegmans property three times in 2004, hoping to capture the scene on video. He took video of some hens stuck in the wires and others wandering in the manure pits. 
 His film, released last year, caught the attention of national animal-activist groups, who supported his efforts. But it also came to the attention of the Wayne County district attorney, Richard Healy, who charged Mr. Durand with burglary, petty larceny and criminal trespass.
 Last week, as Mr. Durand was about to go on trial, the group Animal Rights International said it tried to place a $13,000 full-page advertisement in The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. It included a photo of a decomposed hen still in its cage with several live hens, with the headline, ''Did Your Wegmans Egg Share a Cage With a Corpse?''
 The paper's publisher, Michael G. Kane, said it asked the group to remove the picture and to delay publication, considering that the Wegmans family patriarch, Robert Wegman, had recently died. ''It was a disgusting photo,'' Mr. Kane said.
 The group declined, and the ad never ran.
 At Mr. Durand's three-day trial, the farm production manager, Andrew Wadsworth, testified that that about eight of the farm's 80 employees are in charge of caring for the flock and regularly check the birds. 
 Mr. Durand testified in his defense and showed video images, for example, of a hen submerged up to its neck in manure. After 90 minutes of deliberations, the jury convicted Mr. Durand only of misdemeanor trespass charges.
 Later, he said he planned to eventually distribute a second film, one that includes information about his legal battles. ''The whole trial has strengthened our resolve,'' he said.
 Meanwhile, Ms. Colleluori, the Wegmans spokeswoman, said the company would rely on science, poultry experts and consumer demand, rather than pressure from activists, to decide how it runs its farms.
 ''We'll continue to do what's best for our farm, our employees and our hens,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Out of Favor, Into Power: Pataki's Vetoes Bring Choices

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 6 

 BODY:
Republicans in the State Senate are howling in their districts that Gov. George E. Pataki is blocking their plan to send property tax rebate checks out to homeowners before Election Day. 
 The powerful health lobby is running ads practically suggesting that the governor's budget vetoes of health care spending could kill babies.
And to top it all off, Mr. Pataki's approval ratings in New York are dropping sharply. 
 But, for all the heat he is taking, Mr. Pataki's budget vetoes have given him a shot of steroids just when the Legislature had written him off as the weakest of lame ducks. Now the Senate, for all its fury, needs something from Mr. Pataki. And they are the ones facing New York voters in November, not him. 
 Mr. Pataki, who will step down from office in eight months, can afford to look at a very different audience: the national Republicans he will have to win over if he decides to run for president.
 And while Mr. Pataki's budget vetoes -- and his declaration that several costly items, including the property tax rebate, were unconstitutional and void -- were met with wails in some quarters, they were met elsewhere with something that has become increasingly rare for Mr. Pataki in recent years: headlines praising him for fiscal restraint.
 So as Mr. Pataki navigates the rest of his final legislative session, he is being buffeted by competing political impulses. He can try to improve his approval ratings in New York and make friends with the Senate and with the health lobby by reopening the budget and spending more. Or he can hold out and try to salvage a reputation for fiscal conservatism that has been eroded by the near-doubling of the state budget during his three terms in office. 
 It is not necessarily an easy choice. No governor interested in higher office wants dismal poll numbers in his home state, which could prove an embarrassment. 
 A poll released this week by the Siena Research Institute found that only 38 percent of New Yorkers said they had a favorable opinion of Mr. Pataki, while 55 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion of him -- a steep drop since March. (The poll, of 620 registered New York voters, had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.)
 Republican senators -- fearful that they could lose their dwindling majority in November -- recently had a strategy session with Frank Luntz, a well-known Republican pollster, who told them that they should keep their distance from Mr. Pataki, according to several Republicans who attended the meeting.
 But Mr. Pataki, who has been criticized in recent years for increasing state spending and debt levels, seems to enjoy the praise his vetoes received in newspaper editorials from Long Island to New York City to Rochester and from fiscal monitors that have been highly critical of him in recent years, like the Citizens Budget Commission. 
 The praise may be too little, and too late, for a governor who oversaw state spending growth that exceeded inflation, but it could help Mr. Pataki try to win back some of the conservatives who are inherently skeptical of a Northeast Republican who is liberal on social issues.
 The question around the Capitol is, Is the budget done or not?
 This week the governor, and the other two men who run the state, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, all signaled some willingness to discuss some of the issues that were not addressed or resolved. But the governor contends that the budget is over for the year -- sort of.
 ''The budget is over, period, end of story,'' said David M. Catalfamo, the governor's communications director, who praised many of its items. Some senators say they believe that if they find a way to pay for the rebates -- so as not to increase future gaps -- they might still be able to get the governor to go along. The governor, after all, proposed his own property tax rebate program this year, but his plan called for sending checks only to homeowners who live in school districts that agree to limit spending their growth. The Legislature removed that requirement.
 It all goes to show one thing: The new era in Albany of passing budgets by the April 1 deadline may not be so different from the previous 20 years of late budgets. 
 One of the main criticisms of late budgets in Albany was the way other unrelated issues invariably became linked to the budget as they were held out as bargaining chips. This year, the budget was passed on time, but the uncertainty as to whether it is really done has once again led to a bargaining-chip mentality that pervaded in the past, when the budget often became one more card to play in debates over other legislation.
 Dozens of issues are being floated that could be tied to some kind of universal settlement -- in which everyone gets something -- when the session ends in June.
 Lawmakers are weighing proposals to increase the number of charter schools, a priority of Mr. Pataki's. There is talk of raising the salaries of judges, expanding the statewide DNA databank and taking more steps to combat Medicaid fraud. The halls buzz with all kinds of one-shot budget infusions that could add to a budget that none of the sides can agree on, but that is said to be $112.1 billion. All of these issues could find themselves in a megatrade.
 But one obstacle, from the Senate's point of view, is the State Assembly. The Assembly made out well in the budget, winning its preferred tax cut -- eliminating the sales tax on modest clothing purchases -- and winning a big school construction project. 
 Republicans, both in the Senate and those who work for the governor, are now wondering aloud what they can offer the Assembly to go along with their priorities. 
 For now, Mr. Pataki is showing that even if he is a lame duck, attention must be paid. And he seems to have caught the attention of the Senate Republicans, who opened the year bucking his wishes. But neither side is taking bets as to whether they reach a deal this year.

HEADLINE: New Jersey's Slogan Goes From New to Stale

BYLINE: The Associated Press

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 6 

 BODY:
New Jersey officials have said the new state slogan, ''Come See for Yourself,'' would highlight the Garden State's true beauty.
 It turns out, however, that at least one other state already had that idea. 
 State tourism officials said they canned the slogan after it failed to pass legal muster because some states, including West Virginia, have used it in the past.
 ''We are proceeding without the slogan,'' Karen Wolfe, a spokeswoman for the state's Commerce, Economic Growth and Tourism Commission, was quoted as saying in The Press of Atlantic City's Saturday issue. ''We will revisit the next steps at the end of the year.'' 
 Former Gov. Richard J. Codey unveiled the slogan with great fanfare at a January news conference, just days before he left office.
 Mr. Codey, who remains State Senate president, said at the time that the state's catchphrase ''should hint at our true beauty.''
 The slogan was the top choice among 11,227 telephone and online votes cast by residents for five final entries in a statewide contest.
 But at an annual tourism conference in Cape May County more than a week ago, the slogan was absent from state promotional materials. 
 Tourism officials say West Virginia used the phrase in some previous promotions, but now uses ''West Virginia: Wild and Wonderful.''
 The slogan resulted from Mr. Codey's appeal in October for ideas after he rejected a marketing company's proposal for which the state paid about $250,000. He said that slogan, ''New Jersey: We'll Win You Over,'' was negative and reminded him of his own self-deprecating pitch when he asked girls out on dates.

HEADLINE: Quinn Alters Council Rules On Financing Pet Projects

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
Every year, members of the City Council propose to empty the city's coffers by compiling a list of worthy causes and pet projects that they want financed, from studies on minority unemployment to new treatments for addictions.
 The so-called wish list has approached $1 billion in recent years, as the requests for money have stacked up, with individual council members submitting as many as 10 at a time. The list is then chopped down -- typically to $150 million or so in a good year -- during a series of closed-door meetings.
 But now the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, has clamped down on that free-wheeling process, a move that has angered many of the 50 other council members and has created the most serious dissension in the legislative body since she was elected its leader in January. 
 For the first time, the speaker is requiring members to turn in a printed form whenever they want to create or finance a new citywide program or to increase the subsidy for an existing one. Each member will be limited to four such requests.
 Each request must be signed by nine other members to demonstrate ample support for the program, and the signers together must represent at least three of the five boroughs. Council members may sign onto only seven requests besides their own four. 
 The deadline for handing in requests is May 17. After that, the wish list will be closed until next year's budget negotiations.
 Ms. Quinn's rules have drawn complaints from many of the council members, who are accustomed to making as many requests as they want, whenever they want. In past years, members simply called the speaker or scrawled their requests on scraps of paper.
 Critics say the new rules are confusing to follow, create more paperwork and unfairly force them to choose among worthy causes. 
 ''Most of the council members do not seem pleased,'' said Councilman Charles Barron, of Brooklyn, who has been an outspoken critic of Ms. Quinn. ''Personally, I'd rather not do it because it puts the onus on us. People are running around trying to get signatures. It's getting a little crazy.''
 Under the previous speaker, Gifford Miller, the wish list had come to resemble something of a pork barrel, several council members said, as Mr. Miller and others used it as a way to show support for community groups. Also, members were often reluctant to turn down requests, for fear of alienating potential supporters.
 Councilman David I. Weprin, the chairman of the Finance Committee, said that the list had become unmanageable. ''It had gotten out of hand,'' he said. ''Anybody could propose whatever they wanted and there was no rhyme or reason.''
 In several instances, money was requested and approved for groups without the beneficiaries' consent or knowledge, council members said. That could lead to an awkward situation when a group had to either decline the money or hastily reorganize to conduct the new program, usually not without delays.
 Councilwoman Gale Brewer, of Manhattan, said that formerly, she would learn about items on the wish list only after the budget had passed. Under the new rules, she said, council members are being forced to pitch their programs to their colleagues openly and circulate forms for signatures. ''It is more transparent,'' she said. ''This year, everybody's in the same boat.''
 Many members, though they said the rules had made the budget process more cumbersome, gave the speaker credit for trying to make improvements. 
 ''I think it needs perfecting, but it's a good idea,'' said Councilman Lewis A. Fidler, of Brooklyn, who plans to request an additional $5.4 million for after-school programs for high school students. Requiring council members to do more work, he said, would ensure the list ''doesn't get silly.''
 Councilman Michael McMahon, of Staten Island, said that he wanted to request $1 million each for three new sanitation programs: to increase commercial garbage pickups in the boroughs outside Manhattan, expand public education about recycling and step up enforcement of laws on littering and disposal of dog waste. But he said he would submit only the first request, because he did not anticipate getting enough signatures for all three.
 Mr. McMahon said he was already feeling pressure from council members and community advocates to sign the forms. ''Being the sole Democrat from Staten Island kind of makes me popular,'' he said.
 Ms. Quinn said that the budget rules had been discussed in leadership meetings with council members before the forms were distributed last week, and that no one had directly complained to her. She said, however, that several members had raised questions or made suggestions, all of which she was considering.
 ''The reality of the budget is there will be moments when you say 'Yes,' and moments when you say, 'Sorry, no,' '' Ms. Quinn said. ''And we can't pretend that isn't what a budget is.''
 Councilman Leroy G. Comrie, of Queens, said the new rules would force the council members to focus on the things they care about most, rather than try to accommodate everyone. ''Most of the people were positively grumbling,'' he said. ''They're not happy to do more work, but they understand how this can be helpful.''

 Barry Bonds, Balco, and the Steroids
 Scandal That Rocked Professional Sports.

SO you want to be a sports star? Who's your daddy? DNA matters in sports, more than we often care to admit. That was one of the lessons of the recent men's N.C.A.A. basketball tournament, in which three of the five starters on the champion University of Florida team had fathers who were former professional athletes. And it is the subtext of the current scandal over steroids in baseball. Must you go to bat only with your so-called God-given talent? Or, if you come up a little short in that area and get yourself chemically enhanced, how exactly should your achievements and records be regarded?
 Barry Bonds -- baseball superstar, suspected drug cheat, possible perjurer and pariah -- is a second-generation big leaguer. His father, Bobby Bonds, was an all-star outfielder with the San Francisco Giants, his son's team since 1993, and a teammate of the great Willie Mays (Barry's godfather). 
 ''Game of Shadows,'' one of two new books on Barry Bonds, begins right at the moment he senses a perversion of the natural order, a new way for those without the right stuff to leap over the game's true thoroughbreds. In 1998, Bonds watched, seething, as Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa roared past the venerated season home-run marks of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris. McGwire was a big man who in 1998 appeared notably more massive. Sosa, a minor talent through his early career, and slightly built, looked as if someone had jabbed him with a bicycle pump and inflated him.
 Bonds was a perennial all-star, a three-time M.V.P. and a surefire future Hall of Famer -- everything, in fact, but a historic slugger. In 12 years, he had never approached 60 home runs in a season, and he did not seem -- as he did entering the 2006 season -- on a course to threaten the career statistics of Ruth and Hank Aaron. ''Bonds was astounded and aggrieved by the outpouring of hero worship for McGwire, a hitter whom he regarded as obviously inferior to himself,'' Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams write in ''Game of Shadows,'' an authoritative study of Bonds and baseball's steroids scandal.
 After the 1998 season, according to the book, Bonds began bulking up in the same way he believed McGwire had: by taking steroids, and later by adding human growth hormone to the mix. By 2001, the year he hit 73 home runs, wiping McGwire's record of 70 off the books, the once lean-muscled Bonds had bulging biceps, a thickened neck and a head that seemed to have grown a hat size or two. His former mistress told the authors that his back was pocked with acne, a telltale sign of steroid use, and that he suffered from impotence, another marker. 
 In grand jury testimony quoted in ''Game of Shadows,'' Bonds acknowledges applying a substance known as ''the clear,'' which federal investigators say was a steroid, after it was given to him by his childhood friend and personal trainer, Greg Anderson. But he testified that he believed it was flaxseed oil, which he took just to keep Anderson happy. He ''gave me some flaxseed oil, man,'' Bonds is quoted as telling the grand jury. ''It's like, 'Whatever, dude.' ''
 Fainaru-Wada and Williams, investigative reporters at The San Francisco Chronicle, have been out in front of the journalistic pack on the story of baseball's steroids scandal, and ''Game of Shadows'' shows their mastery of the subject. The book is based on secret grand jury testimony that they obtained and first published in their newspaper, on court records and on interviews with mostly named sources. The authors allege that Bonds participated in a sophisticated doping program that resulted in a late-career offensive surge unheard-of in baseball history. Over his first 13 seasons, Bonds hit a home run every 16.1 at-bats; from 1999 through 2004, he hit one every 8.5 at-bats.
 The book is economical in its character study of Bonds, which is wise because what the authors do include just confirms his well-established reputation for boorishness. Its real strength comes in the connections it makes between the baseball doping scandal and the wider culture of drugs in international sports. The nexus for this was the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (Balco), brainchild of Victor Conte. 
 Conte is an entertaining figure, of sorts, an idea-a-minute man and huckster par excellence who once tried to market a piece of his lab equipment as something that could inform women if their silicone breast implants were leaking. At Balco, he sold a legal supplement called ZMA, which over time, the authors say, became a front for his real business: peddling performance-enhancing cocktails of anabolic steroids and human growth hormone, sometimes mixed with such compounds as insulin and the women's fertility drug Clomid. The drug regimens were complicated but devastatingly effective. 
 One client, Tim Montgomery, an undersize sprinter nicknamed Tiny Tim, told Conte that if he could win a gold medal, ''it would not matter if I died on the other side of the finish line.'' With Balco's drugs, the book says, he gained 28 pounds of muscle in just eight weeks. Later, he broke the world record in the 100-meter dash. 
 No one will read this book and come away wondering if steroids really work. Oh, they work. They bump a competitor up a whole pay grade -- from finishing in the middle of the pack in the final heat to breaking the tape and collecting the winner's bonus. 
 Jeff Pearlman, the author of ''Love Me, Hate Me,'' cedes the hard investigative terrain to ''Game of Shadows'' -- probably a necessary move, since the duo from The Chronicle own their story the way Woodward and Bernstein owned Watergate. What Pearlman leaves himself with is 300-plus pages to plumb the personality of Barry Bonds, which in its low range is bullying and abusive, and in its high range, sarcastic and self-pitying. 
 Pearlman, whose previous book was about the 1986 Mets, tracks down Bonds's former teachers, scout leaders, neighbors and teammates from Little League up through the majors -- more than 500 people total. The legwork is impressive, but nearly everyone says a version of the same thing -- that Bonds is a thoroughly miserable guy. The kind of person who throws sweat socks on the floor just to watch the clubhouse attendant stoop to pick them up. 
 ''Love Me, Hate Me'' (a more apt title would have been ''Hate Me, Hate Me'') does have one newsbreak -- comments attributed to Bonds while he and several others were dining after the 1998 season at the home of Ken Griffey Jr., now a star with the Cincinnati Reds. Bonds expresses frustration that players are taking steroids, and says: ''I'm just gonna start using some hard-core stuff and hopefully it won't hurt my body. Then I'll get out of the game and be done with it.'' 
 Griffey (predictably) says he doesn't remember the conversation, and Bonds (predictably) would not comment. Bonds did tell Pearlman, in their one brief encounter, that he'd never been in the Cub Scouts -- even after the reporter had interviewed the den mother of his troop. Whatever, dude. 
 After ''Game of Shadows'' was excerpted in Sports Illustrated in March, Commissioner Bud Selig announced thatformer Senator George Mitchell would lead an investigation to get to the bottom of what is now commonly referred to as baseball's ''steroid era.'' Good idea. 
 But what baseball needs more than an investigator is an ethicist, someone who will help us know what to make of all this. If Bonds took performance enhancers because he believed his competition was doing the same -- at a time when baseball was winking at, if not outright encouraging, the practice in the pursuit of home runs and ticket sales -- it would have been, on his part, a considered and rational act. A business decision, like the one baseball was making.
 Should his records be erased? And what of the records set during the whole era, when untold numbers of players did the same thing -- including almost certainly some whom we would be shocked to learn about?

HEADLINE: Money Changes Everything

BYLINE: By JENNIE YABROFF

 BODY:
GRETA GILBERTSON was caught off guard recently when her 9-year-old daughter, who attends a private school on the Upper West Side, requested a cellphone. 
 ''I sort of snapped at her,'' recalled Ms. Gilbertson, an assistant professor at Fordham University in the Bronx. ''I said, 'Don't think that you're one of the rich kids, because you're not.' '' Though her daughter rarely expresses envy of her more affluent friends, Ms. Gilbertson said, it was an ''unedited moment'' revealing her anxiety over being in a world where other parents have more money than she does.
Carol Paik, a former lawyer who is married to a partner at a prominent New York law firm, found herself on the other side of that money equation. When she returned to school in 2002 to get her M.F.A. in creative writing at Columbia, her diamond engagement ring attracted particular attention from her new group of friends. ''When I was working,'' she said, ''I never thought about the ring, it seemed unremarkable.'' 
 But at school, she said, ''People said things like, 'That's a really big diamond,' and not necessarily in a complimentary way.'' So she began taking off the ring before class. 
 If, as Samuel Butler said, friendships are like money, easier made than kept, economic differences can add yet another obstacle to maintaining them. More friends and acquaintances are now finding themselves at different points on the financial spectrum, scholars and sociologists say, thanks to broad social changes like meritocracy-based higher education, diversity in the workplace and a disparity of incomes among professions. 
 As people with various-sized bank accounts brush up against each other, there is ample cause for social awkwardness, which can strain relationships, sometimes to a breaking point. Many find themselves wrestling with complicated feelings about money and self-worth and improvising coping strategies.
 ''The real issue is not money itself, but the power money gives you,'' said Dalton Conley, a professor of sociology and the director of the Center for Advanced Social Science Research at New York University, who studies issues of wealth and class. ''Money makes explicit the inequalities in a relationship, so we work hard to minimize it as a form of tact.''
 For Ms. Gilbertson, that means not having her daughters' friends over to play because, she said, her apartment in Washington Heights is small and in what some parents might consider a marginal neighborhood. For the same reason, she had a pizza party for her daughter's birthday at the local Y.M.C.A. 
 For Ms. Paik, that meant avoiding inviting her classmates to her prewar, three-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side, because many of them lived in student housing and she feared they would think she was showing off. ''I didn't want to introduce that barrier,'' she said.
 Money's discomfiting effects are explored in the recent film ''Friends with Money,'' in which three of four female friends are well off while one is barely getting by. In an early scene the friends are gathered for dinner when Olivia, a former schoolteacher played by Jennifer Aniston, announces that she has started working as a maid. A few moments later Franny, played by Joan Cusack, says she and her husband will be making a $2 million donation to their child's elementary school. When another friend asks why Franny doesn't just give the money to Olivia, everyone laughs uncomfortably and the subject is changed.
 ''Money is talked about with such discomfort; it's so taboo,'' said Nicole Holofcener, the writer and director of ''Friends With Money.'' ''With close friends it takes work; I have to make a conscious effort to talk about issues of money that come up between us.''
 Economic barriers to friendship have come about in part because other barriers have been broken down, sociologists say. College, where people form some of the most intense friendships of their lives, is a melting pot of economic differences. Students from country-club families and those on scholarships are thrown together as roommates, on athletic teams and in classes.
 ''There has been an incredible expansion of higher education,'' Professor Conley said. ''More people from more varied backgrounds are going to college. There are also more meritocratic admissions among elite institutions.'' 
 According to data compiled by Thomas Mortenson, a senior scholar at the Pell Institute in Washington, 42 percent of young adults (age 18 to 24) from the bottom quarter of family income were enrolled in college in 2003, compared with 28 percent in 1970. Enrollment for students from the two middle income quarters also increased. Participation of students from the highest-income families changed the least, with 80 percent attending college in 2003, compared with 74 percent in 1970.
 Once college friends leave campus, their economic status can diverge widely depending on their careers. While 20 years ago a young lawyer and a new college instructor might have commiserated about their jobs over coffee and doughnuts, today the lawyer would be able to invite the assistant professor out for a meal at a restaurant with two sommeliers and a cheese expert. 
 At New York University, for instance, instructors make $35,300 for the current academic year, up from $24,500 for the 1985-86 academic year, according to the American Association of University Professors. A first-year associate at a large New York law firm, however, can earn as much as $170,000 with a year-end bonus, compared with about $53,000, including bonus, in 1985. 
 ''In New York City we're on the front lines of the rise in inequality in income because it's happening at the top half of the income distribution ladder,'' Professor Conley said. ''The difference between the middle and the top has grown incredibly.''
 Although the wealthy can wall themselves off in buildings with doormen or in high-tax suburbs, other trends in society lead the affluent to brush up against the not-so-affluent. Gentrification, an urban movement from Prospect Heights, Brooklyn to downtown Los Angeles, moves the professional class into the neighborhoods of the working class. They mix when their children attend the same school or participate in athletic leagues. 
 Feeling awkward about the differences in net worth is not just an issue for those on the bottom of the equation. Some wealthy people -- especially the young -- have trouble admitting that they are different. 
 ''We are allegedly a classless society, and that's obviously completely untrue, but people don't want to acknowledge that those differences exist,'' said Jamie Johnson, a 26-year-old heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune. He explored attitudes about money among his peers in his 2003 documentary, ''Born Rich.'' His new documentary, ''The One Percent,'' which debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 29, looks at the political influence of wealthy Americans. 
 Mr. Johnson said that some of his moneyed friends act like they have fewer resources than they do, making a show of taking the subway and saying they can't afford a cab. ''It's to avoid that awkwardness of seeing the distinction of social class,'' he said. 
 The pressure to fit in economically can be especially intense for teenagers and young adults. Marisa Gordon, a 27-year-old account executive at a midsize Manhattan advertising agency, recalled that as a student at Syracuse University, her roommate resented that Ms. Gordon had more spending money than she did. The roommate made comments when Ms. Gordon brought home a pair of Diesel sweatpants and cried because she couldn't afford the same Issey Miyake perfume. 
 Though she and the roommate are still friendly, Ms. Gordon said money issues contributed to the fact they aren't as close as they once were. Now it is her younger sister, a freshman at Syracuse, who is feeling the sort of competitive pressure Ms. Gordon's roommate felt. The sister recently asked their parents for a Louis Vuitton bag, Ms. Gordon said, because, ''Everyone at school has a Louis bag.'' 
 Suze Orman, a financial writer and speaker whose latest book is ''The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous and Broke'' (Riverhead Hardcover), said young adults can go into debt trying to keep up with their friends. 
 ''I call them 'money pods,' '' she said. ''Look at a group of female friends walking down the street. They're often all dressed identically: the same shoes, the same belts, the same handbag.'' 
 But what is not easily apparent, Ms. Orman said, is that one of the women may have saved for months to buy her one expensive handbag, or more likely, put it on her credit card. Her identically dressed friends, meanwhile, may have the salary or the family money to afford a closet full of designer purses. 
 ''That is how we get in trouble,'' Ms. Orman said. ''We think our friends are just like us, and if our friend can afford something, we fool ourselves into thinking we can afford it, too.'' 
 Mary Ochsner, a stay-at-home mother of three in San Clemente, Calif., ended a friendship after money issues came to the fore. She had befriended a woman after college when they were both, as she put it, in ''very affluent periods.'' But their paths diverged when Ms. Ochsner married a Marine and her friend married a man whom Ms. Ochsner described as an ambitious executive. She said her friend became increasingly status-conscious and would brag about home improvements. 
 The final insult came, Ms. Ochsner said, when she invited the woman to a birthday party for her daughter. The woman barely socialized but tried to poach her babysitter by offering $5 more an hour than what Ms. Ochsner was paying. Ms. Ochsner decided the friendship wasn't worth it. 
 ''It wasn't about the money,'' she said. ''The money made me realize she had different social ambitions.'' 
 Perhaps the most fraught social ritual of all when it comes to money and friendship is the settling of a restaurant bill. ''I know wealthy people who are extremely troubled by the whole idea of who's going to pay the bill,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''They're terrified for hours before it happens.'' 
 He said he has found himself arguing over the check with a dining companion who was not as wealthy. ''Sometimes people feel obligated to buy me dinner because they don't want me to think I'm expected to pay for the meal,'' he said. ''I don't really appreciate it. If anything, I think it's unfortunate that people feel that uncertainty.'' 
 The uneasiness is also acute on the other side of the income divide. A 30-year-old book editor in Manhattan who earns less than $40,000 a year recently went to Miami for the weekend with two friends from high school who both work for hedge funds.
 ''We're staying at the Shore Club, in a suite they've booked; I'm sleeping on the pullout couch and they're paying for it, which is hugely generous of them,'' the editor wrote in an e-mail message. He has not been identified to avoid offending his friends. ''However, tonight they've booked a table at Nobu, with Mansion'' -- an expensive night club -- ''to follow. I'll end up spending about a week's pay in the next two nights, probably more. It'll feel worth it while I'm hanging out with them without any of the unpleasant reminders that our lives have seriously diverged since high school, but it's going to sting when I get back.'' 
 Mike Seely, a 31-year-old journalist in Seattle, recently arranged a lunch date with a wealthier friend who works in politics. He said he suggested a diner ''where nothing's over $10, right in my price range.'' She countered by suggesting the Dahlia Lounge, an upscale restaurant where a spinach salad costs $14. 
 ''I said, 'Sure, as long as this is on your dime,' '' he said. 
 It was one of the few times he has felt comfortable addressing the issue so directly, he said, because his friend was the one to press for the more expensive place. 
 Even those who study the topic for a living have a hard time when it comes to divvying up the check. ''I have friends who are economists who are comfortable getting down to the last decimal point of who owes what when we go out,'' Professor Conley said. Yet he feels compelled to keep quiet when he finds himself across the table from a friend who orders three glasses of wine to his tap water, then suggests they split the tab. 
 ''It's probably because I don't want to appear petty,'' he explained. ''I'd be battling pretty strong social norms.''

HEADLINE: A Message Aimed at Big Oil, or Pain for the Little Guy?

BYLINE: By DAVID STABA

 BODY:
Kathleen C. Hochul wanted to send Big Oil a message. 
 She had heard the recent news from Bee County, Tex., where the county commissioners passed a resolution calling for a boycott of Exxon Mobil to protest high gas prices, the company's record $36.1 billion profit in 2005, and its chairman's $400 million retirement deal.
So last Monday, Ms. Hochul, a member of the Hamburg Town Council, introduced her own resolution. It called on residents to boycott the town's five Exxon Mobil stations and on Hamburg municipal employees to avoid filling up any of the 175 town vehicles with Exxon gas. 
 ''We heard what they were doing in Texas and we took it another step,'' Ms. Hochul said. ''Our motive was really to draw attention to what we consider a crisis situation.'' 
 The resolution was passed unanimously by the bipartisan council. But some of the attention it has drawn in Hamburg, a town of 56,000 people about 5 miles south of Buffalo, was not quite what Ms. Hochul or other board members expected.
 She did receive calls of support from residents fed up with steadily rising prices. But she also got calls from people who complained that the town was unfairly picking on the local gas stations. Four of them are owned by local business people and the fifth is owned by a chain. 
 ''It kind of irks me,'' said Joseph J. Enser, who owns one of the independent stations affiliated with Exxon Mobil. ''All these years I've been paying taxes on my business, and now they want people to boycott me. If they put me out of business, who is going to make up for the taxes they'll lose?''
 Mr. Enser opened a Shell station in 1971, selling regular gas for 29.9 cents per gallon, he said. He has sold gas under the banner of most major oil companies, including Amoco, Pennzoil, Citgo and BP. He has been selling Exxon gas for more than three years.
 ''It's not going to help solve the problem,'' Mr. Enser said of a boycott. ''All it's doing is hurting small businesses. Exxon is still going to sell all the supply it wants.''
 Mr. Enser said he made between four and six cents per gallon sold. He made roughly 10 cents per gallon 35 years ago, adjusting for inflation, allowing him a much larger rate of profit than he receives now.
 Some residents said their loyalties were with the local stations rather than the supplier.
 ''This is more of a convenience,'' Phil Dutson, a salesman who said he spent about $100 a week on gas, said while filling up one afternoon last week at an Exxon Mobil station around the corner from his house. ''It's right here, and you get to know the people who work here.''
 An Exxon Mobil spokeswoman said that making a target of the corporation was misguided.
 ''Exxon Mobil does not and could not control the market price of gasoline,'' Premlata Nair said in an e-mail message. ''There are many factors that impact gas prices, and the biggest influence continues to be demand and supply for crude oil and petroleum products and local supply and demand for gasoline.''
 On Friday, Ms. Hochul and other town officials met with the station owners, including Mr. Enser. Afterward, Ms. Hochul said she would move to rescind the boycott at Monday's town board meeting and replace it with one encouraging conservation and calling on state and federal officials to roll back gas taxes.
 ''The town has acknowledged that these are not the people we're looking to target,'' Ms. Hochul said on Friday.
 But Mr. Enser, who complained that he had been portrayed as a ''gouger,'' said: ''The damage to the businesses in Hamburg can't be undone. But it's a start toward healing the wounds.'' 
 Ms. Hochul said she did not regret the boycott.
 ''In our small way, we wanted to say, 'We can't take it any more,' '' she said. ''But we don't want to continue the boycott at the expense of these hard-working business people in our town.''

HEADLINE: This Pause May Have To Wait

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
BEN S. BERNANKE has suggested that the Federal Reserve may skip a chance to raise interest rates at some point soon, but one investment adviser cautioned against expecting that pause when Fed policy makers meet on Wednesday. 
 ''There is a near certainty we'll see 5 percent'' in the Fed's benchmark short-term interest rate, said John K. Lynch, chief market analyst at Evergreen Investments; the rate currently is 4.75 percent. After that, he said, ''they could pause, but I don't know how they'll telegraph that; I don't think they'll say, 'We're done.' ''
Instead, Mr. Lynch said, ''they'll probably provide a nebulous comment'' reiterating that future action will depend on new economic data. ''I think they'll string us along for another six weeks,'' he predicted. 
 Mr. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has good reason to resort to the same Delphic ambiguity for which his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, was renowned. The economy itself is sending mixed signals, Mr. Lynch said.
 Although inflation is not severe at the moment, it may flare up and spread through the economy too quickly and widely for the Fed to control it, Mr. Lynch said. ''Energy costs have not seeped into other goods and services,'' he said, ''but if the Fed pauses with faster global growth and the weaker dollar and high prices for oil and gold, they run the risk of getting behind.'' He added: ''The risks are remote at this point, but I don't think they're going to paint themselves into a corner. There are a lot of issues they've got to factor in.'' 
 Stocks may sell off without a more concrete statement from the Fed, he warned, but the mercurial spirit of traders should help to ensure a swift recovery.
 ''They may be disappointed, but if they are, there will be a 24-hour mourning period, then they'll be on to something else,'' Mr. Lynch said.

DATA WATCH -- The size of the gulf between the nation's imports and exports in March will be announced on Friday. A Bloomberg News poll of economists forecasts a deficit of $66.8 billion, bigger than the $65.7 billion in February.
 That report often carries weight with traders, but it may be viewed as old news this time around. The dollar has fallen about 5 percent since the end of March, making foreign goods that much cheaper for American shoppers and cutting the prices of products made here for buyers abroad. That should reduce the deficit in coming months, at least in theory.

THE DEFINING MOMENT
 FDR's Hundred Days and
 the Triumph of Hope.
 By Jonathan Alter.
 Illustrated. 414 pp. Simon & Schuster. $29.95.
Lately Franklin D. Roosevelt has seemed strangely vulnerable, and not merely because of our new inclination to memorialize him in his wheelchair. The percentage of Americans who can truly remember him is small and dwindling. A few years ago, House Republicans tried to remove his profile from the dime and replace him with Ronald Reagan. Meanwhile, a recent spate of books from the right, including Jim Powell's ''FDR's Folly'' and Thomas E. Woods Jr.'s ''Politically Incorrect Guide to American History,'' have accused him of prolonging the Great Depression and generally screwing up America. 
 But memory of the New Deal has not entirely flickered out, thanks to a flurry of literary activity on the other side, including recent pro-Roosevelt books by academics (Cass Sunstein, Alonzo L. Hamby) and, surprisingly, a conservative press lord (Conrad Black). Their ranks are now joined by a new defender: Jonathan Alter, a senior editor at Newsweek. Since writing a paper on the 32nd president when he was 11, Alter has nurtured a schoolboy crush on F.D.R., chatting about the New Deal with politicians (the acknowledgments thank Presidents Ford and Clinton) and digging through assorted archives. The result is a most readable book -- not quite a biography or a detailed policy study, but a reflection on the way that Roosevelt reinvented the presidency during his first hundred days in office, through bold policy innovations, brilliant speeches and broadcasts and a personal connection with the American people that has not been equaled since. 
 Alter shrewdly reads this achievement as a matter of style as much as substance, and spends considerable time examining the subtle ways in which F.D.R. embodied hope to a people consumed by despair. He gives much of the credit for this ineffable confidence to Roosevelt's earlier struggle with a disability that relatively few Americans were aware he had. Through his agonizing triumph over polio and the bond he discovered with fellow sufferers, Alter writes, Roosevelt discovered ''traits that would prove instrumental to the presidency'' -- a theatrical bonhomie, mental suppleness and an empathy for the downtrodden that had not characterized his early career.
 The book begins in the dark days of March 1933, with a vivid depiction of an American financial system close to collapse. Stocks were down 75 percent in four years. Exports were at their lowest level since 1904. Banks were shuttered around the country, and unemployment in some cities had reached 80 percent. Alter reminds readers that Roosevelt came close to not even making it to this unenviable rendezvous with destiny -- an assassination attempt in Miami two weeks earlier almost ended the New Deal before it even began.
 But with a great actor's sense of instinct, Roosevelt rose to the occasion, converting all of these tensions into what Alter calls ''an exquisite piece of political theater.'' Through his words, his improvisations and his effortless optimism, Roosevelt resuscitated American capitalism, and in so doing, may have saved democracy as well. The new president was fortunate in his predecessor, the dour Herbert Hoover. (In reality, Alter reminds us that some of the New Deal's earliest successes, including the rescue of the banks, stemmed from ideas offered by departing Hoover officials.) But of course there was more to F.D.R.'s magic than the mere fact that he was less depressing than a man whose name had become synonymous with slums around the country. Alter illuminates how Roosevelt made the presidency exciting and responsive and alive. Fifty staffers were needed to handle the mail sent to the Roosevelt White House; under Hoover, this job had belonged to a single employee. 
 ''The Defining Moment'' is not without its shortcomings. Some of the chapters are very short, almost sidebars, and the presidency does not even begin until halfway through the book. Footnotes frequently make labored comparisons with the present, for example an effort to link a Roosevelt spelling mistake with Dan Quayle's famous stab at ''potato.'' At one point, Alter argues that much as Bill Clinton could be said to be the first black president, Roosevelt may have been ''the first woman president,'' because of his sympathy for women's rights and ''an intuition rarely found in male leaders.''
 And then there's Alter's discussion of an ''eye popping'' sentence in a draft of the first radio speech of Roosevelt's presidency, which would have had him saying to a gathering of veterans: ''As new commander in chief under the oath to which you are still bound I reserve to myself the right to command you in any phase of the situation which now confronts us.'' This, Alter writes, was ''dictator talk,'' ''an explicit power grab'' that echoed Mussolini and ''every other crisis leader in world history.'' But Alter's emphasis on this point feels like a stretch, mainly because Roosevelt never delivered this version of the speech. 
 Still, Alter's account has a refreshing buoyancy, not unlike its protagonist. Near the end of the book, Alter allows at least one unflattering comparison with the current White House into his text, but he is a fair reporter, describing Roosevelt's missteps (like his opposition to federal deposit insurance) as honestly as his triumphs. Alter's book will not replace the classic study of the early New Deal written by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., but it succeeds in bringing a remarkable man back to life. 
 In fact, if there is an overarching frustration to the experience of reading this book, it is that the panorama of hope and ingenuity that Alter paints for us today seems a thing of the past.

HEADLINE: Outcry Over Self-Serve Gas Has Corzine in Reverse 

BYLINE: By David W. Chen. 
David W. Chen is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
During an ill-fated excursion to the Pine Barrens in a 2001 episode of ''The Sopranos,'' Paulie Walnuts is shown pumping gasoline on the Garden State Parkway. Fans howled about the faux pas because there is no such thing as self-serve gas in New Jersey -- and as Gov. Jon S. Corzine found out the hard way last week, there probably never will be.
 A little more than a week ago, Mr. Corzine proposed a pilot program as part of a package of proposals intended to cushion motorists from the sting of rising gas prices, with the rationale that self serve is usually a nickel or so cheaper than full service in other states. 
As pilot programs go, it was the equivalent of baby steps: for three months, motorists would be given the self-serve option at stations that would continue to offer full service, starting on the New Jersey Turnpike, where a good number of drivers are from out of state, and therefore accustomed to getting out of their cars to pump gas.
 But within minutes of that suggestion, the political switchblades came out. Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski, a Democrat from Middlesex County who is chairman of the Transportation Committee, blasted the idea. So did Senator Joseph F. Vitale, also a Democrat from Middlesex, who is chairman of the Health Committee. He called self service ''discriminatory'' and said that it would ''only benefit oil companies making a killing at the pump.''
 The next day, Assemblyman Alex DeCroce, a Republican from Morris County who is the minority leader, said ''senior citizens don't need the hassle of trying to pump their own gas, especially at night.'' And later, in perhaps the most fatal of blows, Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr. criticized the idea as well.
 Over the weekend, Mr. Corzine heard it directly from the masses at the Shad Festival in Lambertville, and even at the National Darfur Rally in Washington. The issue provoked such visceral outrage, in fact, that Mr. Corzine told reporters and editors in Trenton on Tuesday that his office had received 1,400 phone calls and e-mail messages, most of which were critical of the idea.
 And what about the response to his proposal to increase the sales tax from 6 to 7 percent? Only 200 responses.
 ''This is not a fight that you want to take to the death,'' Mr. Corzine said in backing off from the pilot program. 
 Now, people outside of New Jersey may wonder what the fuss is all about. After all, every state other than Oregon has self-serve gas, and even people there say that the only reason for the ban is more cultural than economic, or anything else.
 ''There's no real justification for it now,'' said Steve O'Toole, executive director of the Oregon Petroleum Association, which represents about 140 retailers and distributors in the state.
 And it's not as if full service would have been eliminated under Mr. Corzine's plan. It would still have been available to anyone who could not or did not want to get out of the car, and who did not mind waiting the extra 10 to 15 minutes that it sometimes takes on the turnpike for a gas attendant to actually get to one's car.
 Think of it, perhaps, as having the option of either waiting to pay your toll on the turnpike or at the Holland or Lincoln tunnels, or choosing E-ZPass.
 On the other hand, maybe New Jersey residents should not have been all that surprised that Mr. Corzine floated the idea. If nothing else, Mr. Corzine, a bond trader by training who is not averse to taking risks, has demonstrated in his first four months in office that he is not afraid of taking unpopular positions, or taking on popular officials.
 How about raising taxes by $1.5 billion in your first budget?
 Or calling for a freeze to the state's poorest schools under the Abbott v. Burke decision, then showing up with most of your legal brain trust for arguments before the State Supreme Court?
 Or sandbagging Newark's departing mayor, Sharpe James -- the vice chairman of the Budget and Appropriations Committee whose support will be crucial to get the governor's $30.9 billion budget through the Legislature -- first by ruling that a request from Newark for $80 million did not pass the legal smell test, then allowing reporters to sit in on a meeting that Mr. James had thought would be private? 
 Mr. James is still seething from that episode, and complained about it for five uninterrupted minutes during a Senate budget committee hearing on Wednesday while questioning Susan Bass Levin, Mr. Corzine's commissioner of community affairs, who sat across from the mayor during that State House showdown.
 In the future, perhaps Mr. Corzine will criticize the powerful New Jersey Education Association, or play hardball with some of the state's unions when some of their contracts expire next year. Or maybe he will propose the ultimate third-rail idea in New Jersey: that home rule should end.
 After all, it's only May.

HEADLINE: Give It the Old College Try

BYLINE: By Marc Holzer. 
Marc Holzer is a professor of public administration at Rutgers-Newark.

DATELINE: Newark 

 BODY:
FISCAL stress is a chronic condition in New Jersey. Past administrations have opted for quick fixes -- cutting pensions, deferring maintenance, selling assets -- rather than the long-term structural solutions that Gov. Jon Corzine is now proposing. 
 Budget cuts, like the ones that Mr. Corzine has suggested, are certainly in order, and higher education must share in those painful decisions. Understandably, required courses will be canceled and some research -- even that which contributes to the state's economy -- will come to a stop. But sadly, many of these cuts to research will hobble New Jersey's economic growth. 
 That's why the Legislature, instead of cutting back research, should work with state colleges and universities to come up with creative solutions to problems that are plaguing our state. The higher education community is uniquely prepared to help address some of the immediate and long-term fiscal issues for the state. As crisis responders, our faculties are poised to be the state's prepaid consultants. As partners, we will expect to share in the gains from fiscal problem solving, as well as the pain from necessary cuts.
 While New Jersey's governors have routinely asked a small network of faculty members and alumni for advice, none have opened government to the expert suggestions of thousands more. States like Wisconsin and Minnesota have been more willing to ask their universities and colleges for advice, and the results have been widely successful. Governor Corzine now has the opportunity to define a new, productive partnership between government and higher education, a new mechanism with great long-term potential for a leaner, more effective government.
 New Jersey's higher education institutions -- from Rutgers to Montclair and the New Jersey Institute of Technology to Kean -- study all of the state's major issues, like child welfare, public education, transportation and affordable housing. Here at Rutgers-Newark, faculty members have recently completed studies that could potentially save the state tens of millions of dollars a year. 
 Many of these studies could help address the property tax problem. For instance, one study has recently found that many of New Jersey's small cities and townships could consolidate basic services like fire protection, share expensive equipment, jointly hire inspectors or cooperate in electronic record-keeping, saving the state perhaps $50 million or more a year. 
 Another study is now designing a 311 nonemergency call-in system for the state, which could efficiently respond to millions of requests for information and referrals, thereby avoiding another $50 million or so in excessive costs at the local level. 
 And research conducted by my own department has estimated that fuller transparency in the issuing of municipal bonds could improve ratings, saving tens of millions in interest costs every year. Similar savings could extend to school districts and perhaps the state's own bond issues. 
 Not only can New Jersey's higher education offer the governor its research and academic expertise, it can also tap into another resource: its alumni in public service. New Jersey's universities and colleges have credentialed or certified the bulk of the state's public servants, and in the present fiscal crisis we can mobilize them as volunteer consultants to suggest immediate and long-term savings. Meetings and online listservs moderated by faculty members could reach out to active and retired alumni in state and municipal service, seeking their suggestions. 
 Universities and government are mutually dependent. That interdependency must continually evolve if both are to thrive. Tapping faculty and alumni expertise in a crisis is only one possible mechanism. The state should also consider empowering its own work force to seek solutions, innovations and best practices by giving each agency an ''innovation spending account'' that could be used for university-recommended subscriptions to professional publications, network memberships or attendance at professional workshops.
 In the short run, higher education is an underused partner in solving the state's present crisis and helping to create sound policies for the future. In the long run, it is one of New Jersey's very best investments. Its graduates are much more likely to have the 21st-century skills the state's employers are seeking, to participate in the political process and to volunteer their time and expertise to their fellow citizens.
 Governor Corzine and the Legislature have an important resource at hand. Rather than cutting innovative research programs, they should move quickly to enlist the faculties of New Jersey's publicly financed universities and colleges as partners in the problem-solving process. 
 In return, as those ideas result in tangible savings and revenue, some significant portion of cuts to the higher education budget should be offset.

HEADLINE: The Tappan Zee Divide 

BYLINE: By DAVID SCHARFENBERG

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN 

 BODY:
WHETHER you're for it or against it, the case for a new Tappan Zee Bridge is compelling.
 The current model, clogged and creaking, is at the end of its 50-year life span. And the need for a viable connection across the Hudson River is hardly debatable.
For Rockland, Orange and Bergen Counties to the west, the bridge is a portal to jobs, ballgames and grandmothers in Westchester, Connecticut and New York City. And for those on the east side, the bridge means access to vital labor markets and, on a hot summer night, an escape route to the Catskills.
 So it was not much of a surprise when Eliot L. Spitzer, who is running for governor this fall, indicated last week that he would support a new bridge. 
 If he is elected, his support would provide the project with an important boost. But the new bridge, which could cost as much as $14.5 billion and take seven to eight years to build, is not exactly a fait accompli.
 At the heart of the proposal is a plan for an east-west commuter rail line that would run across the new bridge, linking Rockland to Westchester with stops in Greenburgh, White Plains, Purchase and Port Chester. With connections to Connecticut and New York City lines, the new service would provide west-of-Hudson commuters with improved access to the entire region. 
 But in Washington, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York is backing what some view as a rival project, a commuter rail tunnel that would connect west-of-Hudson commuters to Manhattan through New Jersey.
 And now a new challenge is emerging. If the locals are fed up with the current bridge, state officials are finding, they are just as worried about the idea of building a new one.
 That is not to say the proposal is without prominent supporters. C. Scott Vanderhoef, the Rockland county executive, is firmly behind the new bridge, as long as it is not too wide. And business leaders on Westchester's Platinum Mile, a shiny string of office parks extending out from the bridge and along the Interstate 287 corridor, have argued that a new bridge and commuter rail system are vital to the regional and local economy.
 But residents on both sides of the bridge have grumbled that a new, wider span would mean more traffic, more development and an abundance of property seizures. And Riverkeeper, the region's most prominent environmental advocacy group, has warned that construction could disturb the underwater habitat of the short-nosed sturgeon, an endangered species, and cramp the comeback of the striped bass.
 Moreover, the first signs of a cross-Hudson tension over the bridge are beginning to show, as Westchester community activists and politicians wonder aloud if the county would truly profit from a new bridge. Sure, the argument goes, there is much to gain for the west-of-Hudson commuting crowd, which pours across the bridge 80,000 strong every day. But what, they say, is in it for us?
 Patricia Weems, president of the Fairground Civic Association in Greenburgh, battled for years to get a sound barrier built between her home and the Interstate 287 corridor fed by the Tappan Zee Bridge. Now the sound of truck tires exploding at 3 a.m. is muffled and her drapes are not quite as dirty. But she says more traffic could spoil her hard-won gains and affect the quality of life for thousands of other residents.
 ''What we would become is a repository,'' she said, ''a manner in which people can rapidly move through the county. We get the emissions, we get the traffic, we get the noise.''
 Jeffrey Zupan, senior fellow for transportation at the Regional Plan Association in New York, says east- and west-of-Hudson tensions will only escalate as the process unfolds. After all, he said, a new bridge would yield obvious benefits for Rockland and Orange Counties: drivers would get a more reliable ride, and rail passengers a coveted one-seat trip to Grand Central Terminal. 
 But the advantages for Westchester are not so clear.
 Those who live along the proposed route might take advantage of the commuter rail, Mr. Zupan suggested, but few from Yonkers or Yorktown would be likely to use the service. ''No matter what you do,'' he said, ''the biggest gain is going to be for people in Rockland and Orange County and perhaps for the economy of those counties, and the gain for Westchester will be smaller.''
 The Westchester county executive, Andrew J. Spano, is clearly attuned to this reality; he has declined to take a position on the new bridge at this stage. In a recent telephone interview, he did acknowledge the utility of an east-west rail link that would connect the five north-south lines now flanking the Hudson. But he suggested that a large-scale rehabilitation of the current bridge and a dedicated bus lane could do the trick less invasively.
 For Mr. Spano, damage control seems to be the top priority. ''Something has to be done with that bridge,'' he said. ''That's number one, that's a given. And it's my job to make sure two things happen -- or don't happen. One is to make sure nothing happens that damages the quality of life of Westchester. And two, make sure that whatever happens enhances the quality of life of Westchester.''
 But Ellen Lynch, who heads the board of directors of the Business Council of Westchester, a countywide chamber of commerce, urges what she calls a forward-looking, regional approach to the bridge, one that recognizes the shifting rhythms of life and work in the modern suburb.
 Commuting to work, she notes, is no longer about hopping into a car or jumping onto a train and heading south to New York City. A Regional Plan Association analysis of census data shows that suburb-to-suburb commuting in the New York metropolitan area grew 52 percent between 1970 and 2000. Trips to, from or within New York City grew less than half as much during that period.
 A recent study by state bridge planners, meanwhile, found that just 31 percent of the eastbound traffic across the Tappan Zee each morning winds up in New York City or Long Island. Fifty-one percent lands in Westchester, and the balance heads to Connecticut or points farther north.
 In this environment, Ms. Lynch said, connectivity and mobility are vital if the regional economy is to grow. ''If you have the east-west rail line,'' she said, ''you're connecting the five existing north-south lines and creating a real network.''
 PLANNING for the east-west commuter rail is in the beginning stages. But the preliminary route laid out by the State Department of Transportation, Metro-North and the New York State Thruway Authority, the three agencies collaborating on the project, would include 10 new stations: 4 in Rockland and 6 in Westchester.
 Moving west to east, the proposed train would originate at a new Suffern station in Rockland, make a stop near the Palisades Center mall in West Nyack and go across the bridge. The first stop in Westchester would be at a new underground Tappan Zee or South Tarrytown station. From there, commuters could continue south along the Hudson line into Manhattan or east through the center of Westchester.
 The eastbound train, roughly following the path of the I-287 corridor, would move along viaducts and tunnels, popping in and out of the sunlight as it made stops in Greenburgh; at the Westchester County Center; in the heart of White Plains, with a transfer available to the Harlem Line; at The Westchester mall; on Corporate Park Drive; and in Purchase before connecting to the New Haven Line in Port Chester.
 The proposed line sounds appealing to commuters like Lori Skjeveland, a Xerox efficiency expert who lives in the Hartsdale section of Greenburgh with her husband and two children.
 Ms. Skjeveland, who has commuted to New York City and Rochester, has tried just about every conveyance, from Metro-North train to corporate jet. These days she drives about 35 minutes to Xerox's corporate headquarters in Stamford, Conn. The commute is relatively easy, she says, but she longs for the pleasures of more passive travel. ''I kind of miss having the down time that I considered my train time -- or plane time -- to be.'' 
 Still, Ms. Skjeveland said she would take the proposed commuter rail line east, and up to Stamford, only if the Westchester train station were close to home, the commute smooth and a shuttle bus connection from the Stamford train station to her office easy.
 Robert Goldstein, senior attorney with Riverkeeper, says commuters entering Westchester in the morning would face similar hurdles. With a relatively small number of stops in the county, he said, the train would not get most commuters within walking distance of their workplaces. ''We don't think that's going to get people out of their cars'' is how he put it. 
 Such concerns have prompted state officials to propose an express bus service as an alternative. Other options include substituting only the Westchester portion of the commuter rail with a bus or light-rail service that could make more frequent stops.
 The state-led study suggests that bus or light-rail service in Westchester would attract more intracounty riders, but depress the sort of regionwide ridership the project has been designed, in large part, to accommodate.
 And it is the regionwide character of the plan that has made it a difficult sell, thus far, in Westchester. In an era of rapid regional growth, and in a county already sensitive to the growing burdens of traffic and development, it seems there is little interest in playing throughway for those to the east, west, north and south.
 But Mr. Zupan, of the Regional Plan Association, suggests it may be time for the county to take one for the team. ''When people say in Westchester, 'There's nothing for me,' come on, now,'' he said. ''For the past 100 years you've had three lines going into Grand Central. You've been living very well for 100 years. Isn't it time that someone else got something good?''

But the Canoe Trip Just Doesn't Make Sense
WHITE PLAINS
 For the highway warrior, there is nothing so perplexing, nothing so maddening, as the traffic jam.
 But the commuter is an imaginative animal. And with a new Tappan Zee Bridge still years away, Hudson Valley drivers have come up with all manner of theories to explain the legendary backups on the current span -- and all manner of tactics to get around them.
 Art Masarky, director of human relations and diversity at Heineken USA in White Plains, leaves his northern New Jersey home at 6:15 a.m. in order to avoid the morning rush hour. And George Oros, a lawyer and county legislator from Cortlandt who works in White Plains, takes every precaution to avoid the evening jam on Interstate 287, which feeds the bridge.
 ''If I don't leave my office here by 4:30,'' he said in a recent telephone interview, ''I don't bother to go until 6:30, because I'm just going to sit in traffic.''
 Elf Fairservis, a newly hired marketing specialist with the environmental consulting firm Malcolm Pirnie in White Plains, has only recently begun the daily trek across the bridge from her home in Montebello in Rockland County. But, she insists, she has already begun to divine the mysteries of the Tappan Zee.
 ''I have a pet theory,'' she said in an interview last month, ''that there's a holiday truck situation -- that prior to the holidays, the highway, 287, is just jammed with trucks. And then after the holidays things seem to lighten up.''
 ''This morning there were a lot of trucks on the road, I'm not certain what holiday,'' she said, pausing, suddenly a little unsure. Then, a brightening of the eyes: ''They're restocking after Passover and Easter. See, it all falls into place.'' DAVID SCHARFENBERG

HEADLINE: For Bush, the Economy Is a Glass Half Empty

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
EVEN as gas prices topped $3 a gallon in much of the country, President Bush spent a good part of last week trying to tie himself and his party to the economy. ''This economy is powerful, productive and prosperous,'' he said in a speech in Washington. ''And we intend to keep it that way.''
 It was in some ways an odd remark. He was vowing to stay the course at a time when Americans say they are as unhappy with his handling of the economy as they are with his performance on everything else.
But Mr. Bush's cheerleading also had a clear logic. Polls show that Americans are quite satisfied with today's overall economy. Gas prices, interest rates and health care costs may be rising, but companies are hiring more workers, the stock market has rallied and interest rates remain fairly low. If anything, the president's other problems seem to be dragging down his economic approval numbers, Republicans say. They see the economy as a welcome chance to change the subject from Iraq. 
 So six months before the midterm elections, both parties have come to mirror-image conclusions: the economy, say Democrats and Republicans alike, will help our cause. 
 To Democrats, it is part of a three-legged strategy, along with Iraq and Washington scandals, to nationalize the election by making it a referendum on Mr. Bush. They are emphasizing that even though the statistics on economic growth look good, wage increases for most workers have barely matched inflation over the last few years. ''George Bush doesn't understand why he doesn't get more credit for the economy,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ''Until people get a raise, he's not going to get it.''
 The Republican narrative focuses on the tax cuts of Mr. Bush's first term and the battle over whether to extend some cuts. Senator Robert F. Bennett, a Utah Republican who is vice chairman of Congress's Joint Economic Committee, put on a lunchtime slide show last week for colleagues titled, ''The Greatest Story Never Told.'' Lawrence Kudlow, the conservative CNBC commentator, has been using that line on television to talk about the economy's recent growth. 
 In the slide show, Senator Bennett pointed out that both job growth and business investment surged shortly after the 2003 tax cut took effect. ''We Republicans are entitled to say, 'We did the right thing,' '' Senator Bennett said in an interview. 
 Their biggest advantage may be that Americans are giving the economy good marks. In the most recent CBS News poll, 57 percent of respondents rated the economy as fairly good or very good.
 People have anxieties, mostly about health care and the direction of the economy, and Democrats say the spike in gasoline prices could heighten these worries. Still, in a Gallup Poll taken last month, more people than not said their own financial situation was improving. Just 10 percent of Americans were worried about losing their jobs in the next year, less than throughout most of the 1980's or 90's.
 Yet 71 percent of Americans said the country was on the wrong track, according to the CBS poll. ''There is a fog of caution that just won't go away,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management. ''There are good reasons for that, but they're not economic. They are military and political.''
 The most appropriate midterm election analogy may be to 1966 -- not 1994, which has been the point of reference because it was the last time that control of both the House and Senate changed parties. In 1994, Bill Clinton was only two years into his first term, Congress had just raised taxes to close the deficit, and the country was still suffering the aftereffects of the 1990-1991 recession.
 Forty years ago, the economy was roaring along. The Democrats kept control of the House that year, but lost 47 seats, thanks in large part to the pall the Vietnam War was casting over Lyndon Johnson's administration. The war was not yet as unpopular as it would become, and many winning candidates in 1966 were actually hawkish, noted Curtis B. Gans, a Democratic activist at the time who helped start the ''Dump Johnson'' movement shortly after the election. 
 ''What the issue was in 1966 is precisely what the issue is now,'' said Mr. Gans, now the director for the Center for the Study of the American Electorate at American University in Washington. ''It was the president. The war was a backdrop.''
 The analogy obviously helps feed Democratic hopes that the party can recapture the House or Senate, if not both. And in many ways the economy is not as strong now as it was in 1966. 
 Consumer confidence is not as high as it was in those years, according to surveys done by the University of Michigan, and most workers today have not received a raise over the last four years, after taking inflation into account. 
 ''What people sense is that the other shoe is going to fall,'' said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat. ''They're looking at the deficit, they're looking at deindustrialization, they're looking at the headlines about Delphi filing for Chapter 11. And all these different things portend not a booming economy but a restricted economy.''
 But this argument also has a familiar ring, which should comfort Republicans. Four years ago, employers were still cutting jobs, and Democrats predicted, wrongly, that the economy's weakness would help them gain seats in the midterm elections. Two years ago, Mr. Bush had to run for re-election with the worst record of job creation of any president since Herbert Hoover.
 Yet he won, and the Republican margin in Congress is larger today than it was after the 2000 election. This year, as Representative Paul Ryan, a Republican of Wisconsin, said, his party has a good story it can tell ''over and over again'': the tax cuts helped the economy emerge from a long period of weakness after the 2001 recession.
 ''There's some anxiety surrounding globalization, but that's a fear in the background,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''Immediately, people feel pretty good.''
 Of course, the Iraq war could overwhelm every other issue, either to Mr. Bush's benefit or detriment. Many voters also seem to understand that neither the White House nor Congress is responsible for most short-term ups and downs in the economy. 
 ''When the economy is doing well and people take it for granted,'' Senator Bennett said, ''they look at other issues.''

''Americans are no longer in full control of their own national destiny when that destiny depends on uncertain foreign fuel at high prices fixed by others.''

JIMMY CARTER

''The energy industry should not reap large unearned profits. Increasing taxes, increasing prices on existing inventories of oil should not result in windfall gains but should be captured for the people of our country.''

GEORGE H. W. BUSH
FEB. 20, 1991
''We want to build an energy future that is based on a range of diverse sources, so that never again will this nation's energy well-being be swayed by events in a single foreign country.''

GEORGE W. BUSH APRIL 25, 2006
''Americans understand, by and large, that the price of crude oil is going up and that the prices are going up, but what they don't want and will 
 not accept is manipulation of the market. And neither will I.''

HEADLINE: Rubbing Shoulders With Trouble, and Presidents

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
John R. Burgess makes for an improbable courtier of presidents, or of a senator who might become one.
 A disbarred New York lawyer with a criminal record for attempted larceny and patronizing a 16-year-old prostitute, Mr. Burgess owns International Profit Associates, a management consulting company in Illinois.
Federal authorities are pressing a sexual harassment suit against the company on behalf of 113 former female employees.
 The Illinois attorney general is investigating accusations of deceptive marketing tactics, officials say, and the company has been the subject of 470 complaints to the Better Business Bureau across the nation in the past three years. 
 But despite the trail of problems dating to the 1980's, many prominent politicians have accepted campaign contributions and speaking fees from Mr. Burgess and his company, which offers organizational and financial advice, mostly to owners of small businesses, and claims annual revenues of more than $200 million.
 Former President George Bush was paid $82,000 to speak at a company banquet in 1999, and former President Bill Clinton received $125,000 to appear in 2001.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has collected more than $150,000 in contributions from executives of International Profit Associates, some as recently as September, and spoke at a company event in 2004. As a group, company officials and their spouses are one of the largest sources of contributions to Mrs. Clinton's re-election campaign.
 Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton and Mrs. Clinton all say they were not aware of problems with the company, known as I.P.A., or with Mr. Burgess when they took the money, though some problems were documented as early as 1997 in newspapers, magazines and on the Internet. 
 Other politicians have returned money to I.P.A. upon learning of Mr. Burgess's history, among them Rod Blagojevich, the Democratic governor of Illinois, and Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat running for attorney general of New York. Mr. Cuomo gave back $20,000 in 2002, when he was running for governor, and Mr. Blagojevich returned $125,000 the same year. Just last month, Wisconsin's governor, Jim Doyle, and attorney general, Peg Lautenschlager, said they would return $35,000 in I.P.A. contributions.
 A spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton said her campaign ''will be reviewing'' the I.P.A. contributions.
 The story of I.P.A. underscores the perils politicians face when they accept money from companies they have not closely vetted for problems. It also exemplifies the ways some companies attempt to use relationships with prominent politicians -- or the appearance of relationships -- to promote themselves and burnish their images. 
 In one of the many lawsuits I.P.A. has been involved in, for example, the company filed papers saying it ''holds honors'' from former Presidents Clinton, Bush and Gerald Ford, Mrs. Clinton and former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. On its Web site, the firm posts images of Mr. Burgess, wearing a tuxedo, standing with political celebrities like Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton. Former clients said I.P.A. sales representatives would sometimes pull out those photos to impress them.
 Just last week, in response to questions by The New York Times, Mr. Burgess invoked a presidential visit to the company. ''Lots of people have very good things to say about us,'' he said, ''including former President George Bush.''
 In one instance, Mr. Burgess seems to have garnered positive attention from his investment in politicians. Mr. Clinton's foundation publicized a pledge by I.P.A. last year to provide $10 million worth of free services to businesses damaged by natural disasters, including Hurricane Katrina. The commitment raised the company's profile. Now, however, I.P.A. says that the pledge was ''premature and unrealistic'' because the storm damage drove away so many businesses that providing much consultation was impossible. 
 Jay Carson, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton, said that I.P.A. was one of many companies the foundation called on to answer the thousands of requests for help it received after the hurricane. 
 Like ''many other dignitaries,'' Mr. Carson said, ''President Clinton spoke to this company once more than four years ago.''
 Mr. Bush's chief of staff, Jean Becker, said that former President Bush had no personal relationship with I.P.A., and she expressed displeasure that Mr. Burgess would try to use his appearance at the company banquet as a character reference.
 ''It is inappropriate for I.P.A. to use generic statements from a speech President Bush gave seven years ago to defend its record,'' Ms. Becker said. ''We are very disappointed they are doing so.''
 In a four-page statement, Mr. Burgess denied trying to ingratiate himself with political celebrities for business purposes and he defended I.P.A.'s work, saying some complaints are inevitable considering that the company has worked with 125,000 clients. 
 He said that his two arrests in the 1980's ''occurred long ago'' and that his accomplishments building I.P.A. since then ''are far more representative of my character and contribution to society.''
 ''I do not deny that I have made mistakes in the past,'' Mr. Burgess wrote, adding, ''We make it a point at I.P.A. to judge people on their performance, not their past.''
 Myron M. Cherry, a Chicago lawyer who represents I.P.A. in several legal matters, said that he believed Mr. Burgess first met Mr. Clinton at a fund-raising event that Mr. Cherry held at his home in 2000.
 Mr. Cherry, who raises money for many Democrats and helped arrange at least some of the I.P.A. contributions to Mrs. Clinton, said Mr. Burgess's background was irrelevant to determining whether to accept his money or services.
 ''John is a really nice guy who has helped a lot of people,'' he said. ''He should not be defined by what he did 24 years ago.''
 The spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, Ann Lewis, said Mrs. Clinton was not aware of Mr. Burgess's background when he held fund-raising affairs for her in 2000 and 2003, nor did she know whether other prominent Democrats had rejected contributions. She said that Mrs. Clinton's vetting procedures have been strengthened since the senator's appearance at I.P.A. 
 In 1997, the Chicago Tribune noted that Mr. Burgess had been disbarred and pleaded guilty to attempted grand larceny in upstate New York in 1988 after being accused of stealing $15,739 from a client's account. 
 In June 2000, an article in Inc. magazine reported that Mr. Burgess pleaded guilty to patronizing a teenage prostitute in 1984 and that I.P.A. had falsely claimed that Mr. Burgess served on a White House advisory committee on small businesses. The Web site for the Lawyers Fund for Client Protection in Albany, a state bar program that reimburses clients defrauded by their attorneys, shows it has paid $30,868 to six former clients of Mr. Burgess from the 1980's.
 Mr. Burgess, 56, left New York and worked for a few years at another Illinois-based consulting firm before starting I.P.A. in 1991. Based in the Chicago suburb of Buffalo Grove, I.P.A. became what it calls ''the largest privately held business development company for small and medium-size businesses in North America.'' It claims to have 1,789 employees and annual revenues exceeding $200 million.
 When asked for help locating people who had positive experiences with I.P.A., Mr. Burgess initially directed a reporter to dozens of anonymous testimonials on the company's Web site. Later, I.P.A. produced names and phone numbers for two people, who both praised the company.
 One of them was Ray Hicks of Michigan, who said I.P.A. helped him sell a business in 2002 that manufactured photofinishing machines and has advised him on the purchase of other small businesses. He said the I.P.A. consultants did good work. ''I just thank God there are people out there who are capable of doing that sort of stuff,'' he said.
 Some other former clients and employees paint a far different picture.
 Bart Greenhut, the owner of a pet-supplies business in California, was so angry about his experience with I.P.A. that he set up a Web site to post information about it. Mr. Greenhut said an I.P.A. representative tried to impress him by pulling out a binder filled with photographs of company executives shaking hands with President Clinton and other dignitaries. Mr. Greenhut agreed to a consulting contract, but soon regretted it, he said.
 Three I.P.A. consultants arrived at his office the next morning, each charging $235 an hour, he said, and proceeded to give what he considered useless advice. When Mr. Greenhut told them to leave on the second day, he said, one of them presented a bill for $16,775, demanded immediate payment and became hostile when he refused.
 ''I could see by the second day they were just churning time, with nothing of real value happening,'' Mr. Greenhut said. ''It was a complete rip-off.''
 The Better Business Bureau said that I.P.A. had resolved most of the 470 complaints against it, but that the company had received an unsatisfactory rating because it had failed to remedy the root causes, including accusations of high-pressure sales tactics, poor quality service and aggressive debt collections.
 The Illinois state attorney general's office said it has received more than 200 complaints since 2001 and is investigating the company.
 Deborah Hagan, chief of consumer protection for the attorney general's office, said that I.P.A. paid $20,000 in 1998 to settle accusations that it improperly withheld payment to former employees and that it agreed in 2004 to better inform clients of their rights and obligations.
 ''The thing that is of concern to me is that the complaints have just continued,'' she said.
 Mr. Burgess would not discuss individual complaints but said in his statement that I.P.A. had ''instituted policies to continually reduce complaints,'' which he said are resolved through an arbitration process at I.P.A.'s expense. He said that the company gets complaints from fewer than 0.5 percent of its clients.
 I.P.A.'s troubles extend beyond client complaints. For almost five years, the firm has been battling a lawsuit filed by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which asserts that its executives had routinely harassed female subordinates with crude comments, groping and demands for sex. Mr. Burgess himself was accused by a former employee of making comments about her body and ''telling her that her future with the company depended on having sex with him,'' the lawsuit said. 
 Mr. Burgess said that for legal reasons, he could not discuss specifics of the case, but that he and the company strongly deny the accusations and do not tolerate harassment in the workplace.
 Diane Smason, the commission's lead attorney on the case, said the government's I.P.A. investigation, which began during the Clinton administration, found that ''sex harassment is the standard operating procedure of this company.'' She said that 113 women had been victimized.
 ''This is probably the most egregious case of sex harassment that the Chicago district office has seen,'' Ms. Smason said in an interview. ''The owner of the company engaged in harassment, and that set the tone for the company, on down.''
 For all of its controversies, I.P.A. has had little trouble lining up its high-profile guests for annual company galas. Although Mr. Burgess told Inc. magazine in 2000 that the speaking engagements meant ''instant credibility'' for his company, he said last week that they were intended only to boost employee morale.
 I.P.A. did not limit itself to paying speaking fees. In 2000, the company and its executives contributed $400,000 to the national Democratic Party and $50,000 to Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign. Since then, employees of the firm and their spouses have contributed an additional $107,000 to the Clinton campaign. Company officials have also given about $30,000 to the national Republican Party in recent years.
 For their support of the Democrats in 2000, Mr. Burgess and his wife, Dana, were rewarded in September of that year with an invitation to a state dinner at the White House for the prime minister of India. When Mr. Clinton appeared at I.P.A.'s banquet in December 2001, he thanked the Burgesses ''for being such good friends to Hillary and to me'' and praised I.P.A.'s work with small businesses.
 ''The small and medium-size businesses that you helped to flourish fueled America's economic growth,'' Mr. Clinton said.

HEADLINE: EARLY INTENSITY UNDERLINES ROLE OF RACES IN OHIO

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and IAN URBINA

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, May 6 

 BODY:
For the Democratic Party, the road back to power in Washington begins here in Ohio. But as long-dominant Ohio Republicans struggle with a corruption scandal, economic distress and rising voter unease, Democrats face a challenge in making the state a launching pad to seize control of Congress and the White House, leaders of both parties say.
 As Ohio turned from the primaries last Tuesday to its competitive thicket of contests this fall, party officials and analysts said one of the Democrats' most alluring targets, Senator Mike DeWine, seemed less vulnerable than he had earlier this year.
 And Democrats said that while they were hopeful they would be able to elect the first Democratic governor in 16 years -- filling the seat of Bob Taft, who is leaving office after a corruption scandal -- the fight will not be easy. 
 The intensity of political activity here underlies Ohio's status as the most contested political battleground in the nation, where nearly all of the forces shaping American politics today are on display.
 Currently, Republicans control the governor's mansion and both houses of the legislature. The two United States senators are Republican, and the party has a 12-to-6 edge in the Congressional delegation. And President Bush won Ohio in 2000 and 2004, in both cases helping tip the balance for his victories.
 Nevertheless, Democrats hope to make substantial gains here because of mounting displeasure with Mr. Bush over the economy, the war in Iraq and distress with the Republican leadership in the state.
 In one welcome turn for Democrats, two Republican members of Congress are vulnerable, victims of the curdled political environment, analysts said. 
 But Democratic hopes of knocking out a third Republican, Representative Bob Ney, who has been linked to the Jack Abramoff corruption investigation, were set back when the Democrats' favored candidate, Mayor Joe Sulzer of Chillicothe, lost to a lesser-known and politically inexperienced challenger, Zack Space.
 Further, those potential gains could be offset if Democrats fail to hold two Democratic seats that opened up when Representative Sherrod Brown decided to run for the Senate and Representative Ted Strickland entered the race for governor. ''The fall election is not going to be a cakewalk,'' said State Senator Charlie Wilson, the Democratic candidate to succeed Mr. Strickland.
 Nonetheless, Republicans are in as bad shape in Ohio as they are in anyplace in the United States, presenting the Democrats with their best opportunity this year. The major question is whether Democrats will be able to emerge from Ohio with incremental gains, or the kind of sweeping victories that could produce long-lasting changes in the national political landscape.
 Of the 18 Ohio Congressional districts, five seats are considered in play. Ideally, Democratic Party leaders said, they will gain at least three Congressional seats in Ohio -- Democrats need 15 nationally to take back the House -- along with a Senate seat and the governorship.
 In many ways, the political environment here mirrors the national one, with its brew of economic anxiety, corruption and voter weariness with one-party dominance. Beyond corruption and worry about Iraq, the contests in Ohio are shaping up as a face-off between two powerful forces in American politics: economic issues, led by job loss, trade and health care worries; and social issues, notably abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control.
 The Ohio Democratic chairman, Chris Redfern, said in an interview that national Democrats needed to ''focus on the governor's race above all'' to lay the groundwork for the 2008 presidential election and suggested that this was where the party had its best hope of success.
 But Mr. Redfern warned that Mr. Strickland's contest with J. Kenneth Blackwell, the hard-hitting Ohio secretary of state, could prove tougher than many Washington Democrats think.
 ''I'm cautiously optimistic about the governor's race, but I also really think this is going to be much more difficult than Democrats believe it will be,'' Mr. Redfern said. ''Huge resources will be poured into this race, and Ken Blackwell is going to come at Congressman Strickland with rhetoric that will be totally unlike anything we've ever seen.''
 There is no party registration in Ohio, but 40 percent of voters in 2004 said they were Republican, compared with 35 percent who said they were Democrat, according to a survey of people leaving the polls. Conservative Christians, who make up an estimated quarter of the voting population, proved critical to Mr. Bush's 120,0000-vote victory here in 2004.
 With seven highly-charged races being played against the ever-present backdrop of past and future presidential races, parts of Ohio are in the grip of the kind of political fury normally not seen until the final days of a campaign, with all the social and political cleavages on full display. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Blackwell -- a leading advocate of the state ban on same-sex marriage who opposes abortion in every instance, including to save the life of the pregnant woman -- led a crowd in prayer at an outdoor National Day of Prayer vigil. As those gathered bowed their heads and murmured chants of ''Thank you, Jesus'' in a light spring drizzle, Mr. Blackwell was forced to raise his voice to be heard over the din of banging pots and pans and chants by workers who had been forced out of their jobs demonstrating across High Street.
 The Democratic campaign to unseat Senator DeWine has been pivotal to the party's ambition for capturing the Senate. But those hopes have been dampened as Republicans began a barrage of attacks on Mr. Brown's positions on taxes, military appropriations and social issues. The attacks have been pressed by Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, who flew here last month to urge the mild-mannered Mr. DeWine to adopt the strategy to avoid defeat, Ohio Republicans said.
 Senator Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina, the head of the Republican Senate campaign committee, said attacks on Mr. Brown's ideology would compensate for what she acknowledged was a difficult atmosphere for Republicans.
 Mr. Brown is considered one of the more liberal members of the state's Congressional delegation; he supports abortion rights, opposed the constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage and voted against the war in Iraq.
 ''Sherrod Brown is out of the mainstream,'' Mrs. Dole said. ''I don't think his kind of liberalism will sell across the state. Drawing the contrast is the key here: it's the choice between the two candidates, despite the environment.''
 Mr. DeWine said he would wait until later in the year before drawing such distinctions himself. ''I am in the mainstream of the state, and I don't think he is,'' he said. ''I'm not going to spend a lot of time, at this point in the campaign, getting into this. It's a little early.''
 Mr. Brown, handing out leaflets at a coffee shop in Columbus on Monday, said Republicans were trying to take attention away from his focus on economic issues.
 ''Republicans are going to try to shift attention away from these economic issues and move the focus to social issues like abortion and gay marriage to fire up their base, but I don't think its going to work like it did in 2004,'' he said. ''People in Ohio are seeing now how corruption affects their pocketbook and how gas prices go up when a party corruptly allows oil companies to set policy, and how Medicare becomes impossible when you allow the pharmaceutical companies to dictate policy.''
 Democrats and analysts said here that in the governor's race Mr. Strickland was less vulnerable to that kind of attack -- he opposes gun control and represents one of the most conservative districts in the state -- but Mr. Blackwell said that would not deter him.
 ''We will both be asked to defend our positions on abortion, on marriage, on a whole host of issues, and people will be able to see how he measures up to their values,'' Mr. Blackwell said. ''Strickland will probably underestimate and underappreciate the degree to which my vision connects with a broad base of Ohioans.''
 Mr. Strickland said he would prefer to talk about economic issues. ''That would be wonderful,'' he said.
 But, he said: ''I am prepared to respond to whatever attacks come from him in these areas. I don't think most people in Ohio believe these are the issues that are central to the responsibilities of being governor.''
 State officials estimate that Ohio has lost more than 175,000 manufacturing jobs in the last decade and the number of adults in the state without health care has risen by 45 percent; a result is a decidedly anxious electorate where over 70 percent of respondents in some polls say the state is heading in the wrong directions.
 ''Things have really headed downhill in the country between the war and jobs and all these scandals,'' said Rachel Jackson, 36, a ''diehard Republican.'' 
 The political environment here has put two once-safe Republican members of Congress in jeopardy: Representatives Steve Chabot and Deborah Pryce.
 Mrs. Pryce been the target of nearly $100,000 worth of advertisements paid for by Moveon.org, a liberal group, attacking her for taking money from pharmaceutical companies. In a sign of White House concern about her prospects, Laura Bush, the first lady, came here this week to campaign for her.
 The corruption issue has given Democrats hope, though Mr. Ney said he was not worried. ''Let me be candid, in my race Abramoff is an issue,'' he said. ''But it is not the top issue. Voters in my district are focused on jobs, health care, gas prices and immigration.''

HEADLINE: Boeing Bets the House

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
ALL work had stopped at the cavernous Boeing assembly plant in Everett, Wash., just north of here. Five thousand rank-and-file workers and others stood idly, some eating airplane-shaped cookies, as they awaited the guest of honor, President Hu Jintao of China.
 On a screen above their heads, images of Boeing planes painted in the colors of various Chinese airlines soared to uplifting music that swelled in the background. Then, a series of inspirational words flashed on the screen -- Exploration! Optimism! Brilliant! Vision! -- as Chinese pilots, speaking in Mandarin (with English subtitles), said how much they loved to fly Boeing planes.
As the testimonials ended, Mr. Hu made his entrance, and he did not disappoint. Donning a Boeing baseball cap, he became the best salesman the company could have asked for. He talked about how many Boeing planes China has bought since 1972 -- 678, for a total of $37 billion. He noted that he had flown to the United States on a Boeing 747 and said that the Chinese people love Boeing. 
 ''Boeing is a household name in my country,'' he said, as the crowed cheered. ''When Chinese people fly, it is mostly with Boeing.'' 
 Caught up in the spirit of Mr. Hu's enthusiasm, the chief executive of Boeing's commercial aviation division, Alan R. Mulally, ended the event by pumping his fist into the air and shouting: ''China rocks!''
 As a public relations spectacle and customer-flattering exercise, the event was a smashing success for Boeing. Now the trick is to keep the lovefest going -- and not just with China, but with customers all over the world.
 In recent years, Boeing has stumbled badly, ceding its decades-long-dominance in commercial aviation to Airbus and becoming mired in a string of scandals over Pentagon contracts. The terrorist attacks of 2001 depressed demand at a time when the company's product line paled against appealing new planes from Airbus. In one year alone, from 2001 to 2002, Boeing's profits dropped 80 percent.
 Boeing's executive suite also became a revolving door, as ethical failures forced the resignations of two chief executives in little more than a year. The first, Philip M. Condit, departed in December 2003 amid a Pentagon contract scandal; the other, Harry C. Stonecipher, stepped down in March 2005 over his adulterous affair with a subordinate. The Pentagon scandal also led to a prison sentence for Boeing's former chief financial officer, Michael M. Sears.
 Boeing's ethical woes are still not over, so the company is not ready to declare a turnaround. It may have to pay more than $1 billion in fines to settle matters, and its top lawyer, Douglas G. Bain, recently warned that some people in the government believe that Boeing is ''rotten to the core.'' 
 But the view from Seattle, the headquarters of Boeing's commercial jet operations, has more of that Chinese pep-rally spirit than such gloomy talk might indicate.
 With revenue having grown for the second consecutive year, to $54.8 billion in 2005, and a record number of orders on its books, Boeing has had a huge gain in its stock price -- to more than $80 a share, more than three times its nadir of $25 in 2003. Boeing's 1,002 orders last year fell short of Airbus's 1,055. But Boeing's orders included more wide-body planes, which analysts valued at $10 billion to $15 billion more than Airbus's.
 But what is really driving the high spirits at Boeing -- and the high stock price -- is a plane that has not yet taken to the skies: the 787. It is Boeing's first new commercial airplane in a decade. Even though it will not go into service until 2008, its first three years of production are already sold out -- with 60 of the 345 planes on order going to China, a $7.2 billion deal that Mr. Hu cited in his presentation. Other big orders have come from Qantas Airways, All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines and Northwest Airlines.
 Big orders mean big money, of course -- and that is good, because analysts estimate that Boeing and its partners will invest $8 billion to develop the 787. Boeing is also risking a new way of doing business and a new way of building airplanes: farming out production of most major components to other companies, many outside the United States, and using a carbon-fiber composite material in place of aluminum for about half of each plane.
 IF it works, Boeing could vault back in front of Airbus, perhaps decisively. If it fails, Boeing could be relegated to the status of a permanent also-ran, having badly miscalculated the future of commercial aviation and unable to meet the changing needs of its customers. 
 ''The entire company is riding on the wings of the 787 Dreamliner,'' said Loren B. Thompson, an aviation expert at the Lexington Institute, a research and lobbying group in Arlington, Va., that focuses on the aerospace and military industries. ''It's the most complicated plane ever.''
 Boeing calls the 787 Dreamliner a ''game changer,'' with a radically different approach to aircraft design that it says will transform aviation. A lightweight one-piece carbon-fiber fuselage, for instance, replaces 1,200 sheets of aluminum and 40,000 rivets, and is about 15 percent lighter. The extensive use of composites, already used to a lesser extent in many other jets, helps to improve fuel efficiency. 
 To convince potential customers of the benefits of composite -- similar to the material used to make golf clubs and tennis rackets -- Boeing gives them hammers to bang against an aluminum panel, which dents, and against a composite one, which does not.
 At the same time, the 787 has new engines with bigger fans that are expected to let the plane sip 20 percent less fuel per mile than similarly sized twin-engine planes, like Boeing's own 767 and many from Airbus. 
 This is no small sales point, with oil fetching around $70 a barrel and many airlines struggling to make a profit even as they pack more passengers into their planes. 
 ''The 787 is the most successful new launch of a plane -- ever,'' said Howard A. Rubel, an aerospace analyst at Jeffries & Company, an investment bank that has advised a Boeing subsidiary. ''But,'' he added, ''the burden is that their engineering is as good as they say it is.''
 Mr. Thompson of the Lexington Institute says the risks are great with a program this ambitious. ''Right now, Boeing is perceived to have a world-beating product with the 787,'' he said. ''But if something went wrong, it would overnight change the perception of the company.''
 The 787 is designed to carry 220 to 300 people on routes from North America to Europe and Asia. Boeing is counting on it to replace the workhorse 767, which is being phased out, and, it hopes, a few Airbus models as well. Its advantages go beyond fuel efficiency: Boeing designed the 787 to fly long distances while keeping passengers relatively comfortable. 
 That approach grows out of another gamble by Boeing -- that the future of the airline business will be in point-to-point nonstop flights with medium-size planes rather than the current hub-and-spoke model favored by Airbus, which is developing the 550-seat A380 superjumbo as its premier long-haul jetliner. Flying point to point eliminates the need for most passengers to change planes, a competitive advantage so long as the Dreamliner is as comfortable and as fast as a bigger aircraft.
 Unlike the 767 and other planes designed and built in the 1980's and even the 90's, which were made to be pressurized to simulate the thin air found at 8,000 feet, the 787 will allow pressurization to be set for conditions at 6,000 feet. After putting some frequent-flier volunteers into a pressure chamber in Oklahoma to simulate flights of 9 to 15 hours, Boeing concluded that 6,000 feet was well below the level where most people experience the headaches and other symptoms of altitude sickness.
 And after talking with passengers around the world, Boeing designed the 787 to have higher humidity and more headroom than other airplanes, and to provide the largest windows of any commercial plane flying today.
 ''We are trying to reconnect passengers to the flying experience,'' said Kenneth G. Price, a Boeing fleet revenue analyst. With airlines squeezing every last cent and cutting back service, ''flying is not enjoyable,'' Mr. Price said. ''Every culture fantasizes about flying,'' he added. ''All superheroes fly. But we were taking a magical experience and beating the magic out.''
 Even more innovative for Boeing is the way it makes the 787. Most of the design and construction, along with up to 40 percent of the estimated $8 billion in development costs, is being outsourced to subcontractors in six other countries and hundreds of suppliers around the world. Mitsubishi of Japan, for example, is making the wings, a particularly complex task that Boeing always reserved for itself. Messier-Dowty of France is making the landing gear and Latecoere the doors. Alenia Aeronautica of Italy was given parts of the fuselage and tail. 
 Nor are these foreign suppliers simply building to Boeing specifications. Instead, they are being given the freedom, and the responsibility, to design the components and to raise billions of dollars in development costs that are usually shouldered by Boeing.
 This transformation did not come overnight, of course, nor did it begin spontaneously. Boeing changed because it had to, analysts said. 
 ''Starting in 2000, Airbus was doing well,'' said Richard L. Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, an aviation research firm in Fairfax, Va. ''Boeing had to reconsider how it did business. That led to the framework for the 787 -- getting the development risk off the books of Boeing and coming up with a killer application.'' 
 BOEING plans to bring the 787 to market in four and a half years, which is 16 to 18 months faster than most other models. All of that is good, Mr. Aboulafia added, if it works. It is a tall order for a wholly new plane being built with new materials, many from new suppliers and assembled in a new way. ''The 787 is operating on an aggressive timetable and with aggressive performance goals,'' he said. ''It leaves no margin for error.''
 Never before has Boeing farmed out so much work to so many partners -- and in so many countries. The outsourcing is so extensive that Boeing acknowledges it has no idea how many people around the world are working on the 787 project.
 Airbus, Boeing's sole rival in making big commercial airliners, is also making a big bet on the future, but in a different direction. The companies agree that in 20 years, the commercial aviation market may double, with today's big orders from China, India and the Middle East to be followed by increased sales to American and European carriers as they reorganize and reduce costs. 
 By 2024, Boeing estimates, 35,000 commercial planes will be flying, more than twice the number now aloft, and 26,000 new planes will be needed to satisfy additional demand and replace aging ones. But how passengers will get from place to place, and in what planes, will depend on whether Boeing or Airbus has correctly forecast the future.
 Boeing believes that passengers will want more frequent nonstop flights between major destinations -- what the industry calls ''city pairs.'' That is what led to the big bet on the Dreamliner, a midsize wide-body plane that can fly nonstop between almost any two global cities -- say, Boston to Athens, or Seattle to Osaka -- and go such long distances at a lower cost than other aircraft. 
 Boeing focused on the 787 after it dropped plans in late 2001 to build the ''Sonic Cruiser,'' a nearly supersonic aircraft, when its customers said they wanted a plane that was cheaper to operate, not faster.
 Airbus believes that airplane size is more important than frequent nonstop flights and that passengers will stick with a hub-and-spoke system in which a passenger in, say, Seattle, will fly to Los Angeles and transfer to an Airbus 380 to go to Tokyo before catching a smaller plane to Osaka. That view has led it to spend $12 billion to develop the double-deck A380, the largest passenger jet ever -- a bet that is as crucial to its future as the 787 is to Boeing's.
 ''We have a fundamental difference with Airbus on how airlines will accommodate growth,'' said Randolph S. Baseler, Boeing's vice president for marketing. ''They are predicting flat growth in city pairs. We are saying that people want more frequent nonstop flights. They believe airplane size will increase, and we believe that airplanes will not increase in size that much. Those two different market scenarios lead to two different product strategies.''
 The market, of course, will determine the winner, but given the industry's long lead times, that may not be clear for 10 to 20 years. For now, airlines have ordered 159 copies of the A380 -- which has a list price of $295 million and is scheduled to enter service this year -- and more than twice as many 787's, which list for $130 million and are scheduled to enter service in two years.
 Both sides are hedging their bets somewhat. To compete with Airbus in superjumbos -- a market that Airbus estimates at 1,250 planes in the next 20 years, and Boeing at only 300 -- Boeing is offering an upgrade of its 747, called a 747-8, which will have 450 seats and will use the fuel-efficient engines developed for the 787. The 747-8 has 18 orders so far. 
 To take on the 787, Airbus is offering the midsize A350, a retooled version of its A330. But it is having little success so far. Vagn Soerensen, the chairman of Austrian Airlines, has complained that the A350's operating economies did not match those of the 787, a view shared by Singapore Airlines and other big potential customers. Steven F. Udvar-Hazy, the chairman of the International Lease Finance Corporation, a major airline leasing company, stunned a trade meeting last month by saying that Airbus should scrap the A350 and come up with an entirely new design -- a move that could cost Airbus billions in development costs when it is already paying the multibillion-dollar bill for the A380.
 Mr. Aboulafia of the Teal Group said: ''There is no proof that the market is endorsing the A350. They don't have a single blue-chip customer.''
 Boeing's recent rebound in commercial aviation would have been difficult to predict in the early part of the decade. Back then, Airbus's popular A330's and A320's were hammering Boeing's twin-aisle 767 and single-aisle 737. During that period Boeing lost more than 20 percentage points of market share -- and 60,000 employees in the frantic cost-cutting that resulted.
 To fight back, Boeing encouraged the United States government to turn to the World Trade Organization to attack what Washington says are government subsidies to Airbus. Despite Boeing's improving fortunes, the case is still pending -- on the theory that any settlement would compensate for the past and make it harder for Airbus to get government aid if it wants to redesign the A350. It is expected to be decided in 2007.
 Since the filing of the case, however, the picture has brightened for nearly every Boeing plane. For instance, the 777, a long-haul twin-engine plane, has outsold Airbus's A340 because the Airbus plane has four engines -- a decided disadvantage in an era of high fuel prices.
 Airlines placed orders for 154 of the 777's last year, a record, while Airbus booked only 15 orders for the A340. The 777 has captured about 70 percent of all orders in its market since the A340 made its debut in 1997.
 ''The A340 is dying slowly and horribly,'' Mr. Aboulafia said. ''It is one of the more colossal failures in aviation. With higher fuel prices, no one wants four engines.''
 In the highly competitive market for single-aisle planes -- the workhorses that are used on most short-haul domestic flights and are the backbone of low-cost airlines -- the two companies have brisk sellers in the Boeing 737 and the Airbus 320. To compete, Boeing recently overhauled its 737 production line to cut final assembly to 11 days from 28.
 The 737 is considered the best-selling commercial jet in history. The 5,000th 737 was just put into service, and the current backlog is 1,000 orders. A big buyer of the 737 is now China, which placed an order for 150 to coincide with Mr. Hu's trip. Boeing's next big project will be to come up with a replacement for the 737; the new plane is expected to draw on Dreamliner technology.
 Yet as rosy as things seem to be at Boeing's commercial operations here, the company in general has still not emerged from the cloud of scandal. Boeing is working with federal prosecutors to settle a high-profile investigation into the theft of proprietary documents from Lockheed Martin. 
 Three midlevel Boeing employees were charged by the federal government with stealing the documents, which could have been used to help Boeing rig bids for government rocket-launching contracts. The government also stripped Boeing of $1 billion in rocket business.
 ON top of that, Boeing was found to have illegally recruited a former Air Force procurement official, Darleen A. Druyun, who had overseen Boeing contracts with the Pentagon and steered business to the company. Ms. Druyun ended up in prison, as did Mr. Sears, the company's former chief financial officer, who had recruited her. The scandal also caused the Pentagon to pull back from a $20 billion contract to use Boeing 767's as aerial refueling tankers and to open the program to competition from Airbus.
 Settling both these investigations could cost Boeing another $1 billion.
 In addition, Boeing just paid $15 million to settle federal accusations that it violated the Arms Control Export Act by exporting an electronic navigation chip that could have been used for military purposes. The chips, which have been used in the guidance system of Maverick air-to-ground missiles, were built into the navigation systems of 94 commercial jets Boeing sold to China from 2000 to 2003.
 Still, the Boeing chief executives who were on watch during these scandals have benefited handsomely from the rise in Boeing's stock. Recent company filings show that Mr. Stonecipher got $11 million from his Boeing performance shares and Mr. Condit got an additional $9 million from his holdings.
 Back in Mr. Mulally's office in Seattle, where the commercial aircraft headquarters stayed after the corporate office moved to Chicago in 2001, these scandals seem a million miles away. Rarely, he said, does the topic of scandal come up in conversation with potential customers. Most of the scandals, he noted, were in Boeing's military business.
 ''No impact,'' Mr. Mulally said, waving his hand as if to brush away the very idea. ''We haven't been in violation, and our commercial customers care about us.''
 Mr. Mulally's operation hasn't dwelled on these scandals but kept focused on the 787. ''It's a really big deal,'' he said. ''It's not like we bring out a new model each year.''

HEADLINE: In a 529 Savings Plan, the Number to Watch May Be 2010

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK

 BODY:
IF you tried to design a simple way for parents to put away money for their children's education, you would never come up with the so-called 529 state-sponsored college savings plan. Named after a section of the I.R.S. code, these tax-sheltered savings accounts are exceedingly complex and maddeningly idiosyncratic, offering an array of investment choices and tax-saving provisions that seem to vary capriciously from state to state. 
 Yet the plans surged in popularity four years ago -- spurred on by a benefit that was part of President Bush's tax package in 2001. While earnings on investments within the accounts had always been sheltered from taxes, the tax plan also made withdrawals from the accounts tax-free.
There was a catch, though. Like much else in the 2001 tax package, the provision for tax-free distributions from the 529 accounts was scheduled to expire in 2010. And with that once-distant date coming more sharply into focus -- the class of 2010 enters college in September, after all -- the national appetite for the accounts appears to be abating. 
 Growth in the number of new accounts slowed to an average quarterly rate of 4 percent last year from an average of 21 percent in 2002, according to the latest data from the Financial Research Corporation. ''This slowdown is chiefly attributable to uncertainty over the tax status of withdrawals after 2010,'' said David Pearlman, senior vice president and deputy general counsel at Fidelity Investments and chairman of the College Savings Foundation, which serves the education savings industry.
 So it is worth asking just how good 529 plans would be without that special tax treatment. Does it still make sense to open an account today if you end up paying taxes on withdrawals after 2010?
 First, Congress may decide to make the tax-free status of the withdrawals permanent. More than six million Americans now hold accounts, and many lawmakers from both parties support the proposal. ''I do expect that Congress will eliminate the sunset and make the tax exclusion permanent,'' said Joseph F. Hurley, the chief executive and founder of Savingforcollege.com, an informational Web site for parents and professionals. ''There's a lot of momentum building for that.'' 
 Currently, 62 senators and more than 120 members of the House of Representatives have been co-sponsors of bills to make the legislation permanent, according to the National Association of State Treasurers.
 Plans are open to people of all incomes. While the plans benefit high-income taxpayers the most, it appears that they are being used widely throughout the population. The College Savings Foundation and the Financial Research Corporation estimated that in the second quarter of 2005, some 68 percent of all accounts held amounts of $10,000 or less. A further 18.5 percent held balances of $10,000 to $25,000. And only 0.9 percent held balances of more than $100,000. 
 In addition, the 529 plans have become an important source of revenue for the investment management industry. In 2001, the plans totaled $9.2 billion of assets under management. Four years later, that figure jumped to $68.4 billion, and the Financial Research Corporation forecasts that it will grow to $227.9 billion by 2010.
 But what happens if Congress does not take action? Then only one aspect of the plans will disappear in 2010: the tax-free treatment of distributions. What would remain is the ability to save a lot of money: up to $300,000 in some plans, in a tax-deferred investment vehicle to use exclusively for college expenses. Additional state tax benefits and favorable financial aid treatment would also continue. 
 In fact, many Americans who find enrollment in 529 plans worthwhile under their current tax-free status would probably still find them worthwhile even if it expired, according to financial advisers. That is because the plans would still benefit those in high tax brackets who want to defer taxes and to shift the tax on investment income to the student, who is more likely to be in a lower tax bracket and may be able to offset that tax with education tax credits. 
 There is no simple rule of thumb, however, to help decide whether you should open a 529 account. As is the case in most tax planning, individual circumstances affect the outcome. In one example, Mr. Hurley of Savingforcollege.com has calculated the differences for $10,000 investments by a family with $200,000 in income, versus a family with $60,000 in income. According to his analysis, the lower-earning family would be better off avoiding a 529 account and putting money into a taxable fund instead. At a marginal tax rate of 15 percent, the tax savings are not big enough for that family to offset the additional costs of a 529 plan. 
 Those extra costs can be large. When you sign up for a college savings account, you choose among a state's designated managed funds. On top of the regular cost of managing the fund, there is often the extra cost of putting the program together and overseeing it. And states may also charge for administrative and marketing expenses.
 ''In most cases, 529 accounts have higher asset-based fees than if an investor was to buy a fund directly,'' said Kerry O'Boyle, a mutual fund analyst at Morningstar. 
 Even low-cost 529 plans typically cost more than regular mutual funds. For instance, Vanguard's options for 529 plans in New York currently charge 0.56 percent of assets a year. But Mr. O'Boyle points out that none of the underlying funds in those plans -- Total Stock Market Index, Total Bond Market Index, Inflation-Protected Securities, and Short-Term Reserves -- cost more than 0.20 percent to retail investors. So buying Vanguard funds directly would be cheaper than investing through the New York 529 plan.
 Then there is the question of investment returns. Because the plans don't yet have much of a track record, Mr. O'Boyle and his colleagues at Morningstar recommend that investors take into account far more than just a fund's underlying performance. They also recommend looking at factors like costs, portfolio construction and asset allocation, flexibility of the investment options and responsiveness to shareholders.
 Based on those factors, Morningstar FundInvestor annually lists what it considers the best and worst funds for investors. Most recently, its analysts picked among the best funds the Alaska T. Rowe Price College Savings plan and the Vanguard-managed Utah Educational Savings Plan Trust. Among the worst plans they found were Wyoming's College Achievement Plan managed by Merrill Lynch, and Arizona's Pacific Funds 529 plan, run by Pacific Funds. 
 Choosing a fund outside your own state can have a downside when it comes to taxes. 
 More than half of the states give tax deductions to residents who choose in-state 529 plans. But only if you live in Maine can you get such breaks for investing in other states' plans. Financial experts advise investors to assess their home state's plans first.
 GOING through a broker to simplify the search can also result in extra costs. A broker may recommend funds he knows well, but those may not turn out to provide the best tax benefits for each individual. And brokers often charge higher fees. Consider costs for one plan, Kansas Learning Quest, which can be bought directly, or through brokers. Investors pay 0.25 percent more a year in service fees and face a one-time sales charge of 3.25 percent if they buy the plan through a broker. 
 There is another consideration: the 529 plans are designed for people who are sure that their children will go to college and who can afford to lock away the money for years. If you use the money for any reason other than higher-education expenses, the penalty is 10 percent on the earnings portion of the money you withdraw. That's in addition to any taxes you owe on earnings.
 So when it comes to 529 plans, the possible expiration of current tax treatment may not be such a big deal. For most people, the bigger issue is whether a 529 plan is right for their situation -- even with the most favorable tax treatment.

HEADLINE: Getting Governors Island Right

 BODY:
As the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan told the story in an Op-Ed piece a few years ago, he and President Clinton were in a helicopter bound from Kennedy Airport to the United Nations when they found themselves over an island in New York Harbor. 
 ''What is that? '' the president asked. 
''Governors Island,'' Mr. Moynihan replied, explaining that the island, though once state-owned, had been occupied by the U.S. military free of charge for two centuries. Would the federal government consider selling it back? Sure, Mr. Clinton said -- for the price of one dollar (the island was costly to maintain, and the Coast Guard didn't need it). 
 That was in 1995. It took the intervention of President Bush to finally close the deal. But in 2003, the 172-acre property and its buildings (some drab military structures, others of historic value) reverted to the state's control, and is now in the joint custody of a city-state agency, the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation. 
 And what has New York done with its gift? Very little. One big reason is that it came with a huge catch: a way would have to be found to make the island self-sustaining to keep New York from being dragged deeper into debt. That in turn meant some commercial development to help finance the historic preservation, the parks and all the other amenities that would make the island a compelling destination.
 But what sort of development? A great museum? A university campus? Conference centers? An amusement park? A recreation complex like Chelsea Piers? All of the above? No obvious solution presented itself. Then along came Dan Doctoroff, Mayor Michael Bloomberg's economic czar, who took charge of the agency and sent out an R.F.P. -- a request for proposals -- from developers. 
 The fact that Mr. Doctoroff attached few firm guidelines to his request suggests that he was looking for a savior developer who would propose something -- almost anything -- that would work, as though the answers nobody had been able to find before would miraculously pop out of the envelopes, which will be opened next week.
 Mr. Doctoroff must move carefully. Herewith a few general principles to guide his thinking: 
 First and foremost, the plan for Governors Island must not be driven by deals with real estate developers. That happens far too often in this city. Governors Island is a public space and decisions about its future will require sustained public review and participation. 
 The city and state should assert themselves in determining the character of the island. Indeed, it would have been better to develop an overall plan setting a framework for parks and public spaces before issuing the R.F.P., much as was done before the development of Battery Park City. There are restrictions that came with the island's return, including requirements for 40 acres of parkland and the protection of historic structures, but beyond that there is little guidance. New York must insure that there are not just public spaces but grand public spaces, and be ready to pay for them.
 For their part, the preservationists must accept some major commercial buildings on the south end of the island (the historic structures are on the north end) as the price for the island's long -term viability.
 Though it is not strictly New York's problem, more attention must be paid to the 22 acres at the north end that Mr. Clinton designated as a national monument. This acreage includes two wonderful but dangerously rickety old forts -- Castle William and Fort Jay -- that themselves would be a powerful tourist attraction when restored. 
 We await the proposals.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
ON Wednesday, the White House proposed to overhaul fuel economy standards for automobiles by making them ''size based,'' with differing requirements for big and small cars. Automakers worry that any revisions will hurt their business; environmentalists oppose the administration's plan, and its earlier proposal for revising mileage standards for light trucks, as not going far enough. But a debate on Corporate Average Fuel Economy, known as CAFE, misses the point; if we are serious about reducing our dependence on imported oil, we need to shift our focus. 
 Our addiction to oil underlies the greatest threats to our country's stability and prosperity: we pump billions of dollars into fundamentalist ''petrolist'' regimes in the Middle East and release into the atmosphere carbon from petroleum products, perpetuating global warming and aggravating natural disasters from the Gulf Coast to the Indian Ocean.
The answer to these threats is research and innovation to commercialize new fuel technologies in partnership with America's farmers. Our national leadership must promote a market-based shift away from petroleum-based fuels toward renewable fuels produced in America with American technology. 
 The CAFE standard does nothing to encourage that change. It requires American automakers to build cars and trucks that meet a minimum standard of average mileage traveled per gallon of gasoline. But the current standard for minimum mileage traveled per gallon of gas consumed is both too low and focused on the wrong challenge. 
 We need to upgrade to a new CAFE: Carbon Alternative Fuel Equivalent. This new CAFE will measure ''petroleum mileage'' and give automakers incentives and credits for increasing ethanol consumption as a percentage of fuel use of their vehicles, not least by promoting flex-fuel vehicles, which can run on either gasoline or E85 fuel, a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. This approach promises several significant benefits. 
 First, it could set America free from its dependence on foreign oil. As Brazil's ''energy independence miracle'' proves, an aggressive strategy of investing in petroleum substitutes like ethanol can end dependence on imported oil.
 Second, switching from gasoline to ethanol produced from perennial energy crops like switch grass can slash our carbon dioxide emissions.
 Third, it could build on a comparative advantage of American automakers. American auto manufacturers are churning out hundreds of thousands of flex-fuel vehicles. Their foreign competitors make far fewer. Promoting these vehicles will help our automakers build on their already strong market share. 
 And fourth, by encouraging the production of ethanol and new renewable fuel technologies, this new CAFE standard could invigorate rural communities in America's heartland and innovation and research centers along its coasts. 
 This new CAFE would start us on our way to a very different future. And Congress can take an important first step by making it easier for consumers to buy E85 gas. Fewer than 1,000 of the nation's 180,000 retail gas stations offer E85, thanks largely to interference by big oil companies. Congress should take action to prohibit such anticompetitive practices. 
 So instead of squabbling over a mile a gallon here and a mile a gallon there, let's move to a new CAFE standard that offers Americans a fresh chance to work together to meet some of this country's most pressing challenges.

HEADLINE: Funds Cut, Gaza Faces a Plague of Health Woes

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: GAZA, May 4 

 BODY:
Hanin al-Hilo was screaming at the nurses at the main Gaza hospital, Al Shifa: ''If I called and said I was the son of Mr. Somebody, some big shot, I'd have a place!'' 
 But with a third of the hospital's dialysis machines awaiting repair and spare parts, Mr. Hilo, a policeman, and his father, sitting weakly in a wheelchair, had to wait in the corridor. Even those using the machines are not being given the normal dose of hormones and minerals, a nurse explained, because the hospital has run out. ''Soon they're going to need blood transfusions instead,'' she said.
With a sudden shortage of everything from disposable needles and adhesive tape to vital drugs, Gaza's once impressive public health system is running down fast under the dual pressure of aid cutoffs and the closing of the Karni crossing point with Israel.
 Already, says Al Shifa's general director, Dr. Ibrahim al-Habbash, the hospital can no longer provide chemotherapy for many forms of cancer, has only a few days' supply of important surgical drugs like atropine, adrenaline, heparin and lidocaine, and has used up its strategic three-month cache normally kept for a health crisis. 
 In addition, armed men have been forcing their way into the hospital demanding preferential treatment for relatives, clan members or friends, and authorization to travel outside Gaza for medical treatment.
 ''We've suffered in the past, of course, but in the last month, the problems have really increased,'' Dr. Habbash said. ''There are shortages of medications and disposables in all departments, we're trying to limit the operating list and people are suffering, even dying, because of these shortages.''
 Dr. Habbash hands over his list of urgent needs that he has passed on to the financially troubled Palestinian Ministry of Health. It includes numerous drugs and antibiotics, as well as plaster of Paris, syringes, disposable bed sheets and intravenous solutions, surgical gloves, suture sets and blood-testing needles.
 Mr. Hilo's anger, he admitted later, was increased by the frustration of a second month without salary, a situation suffered by every employee of the Palestinian Authority -- Gaza's largest employer -- including the hospital's 1,400 staff members, and many of the families of the patients.
 But his anger is a sign of the mounting frustration over the gaps in health care here, which are a result of a double crisis: the budget deficit in the Palestinian Authority -- which has worsened significantly since Israel stopped transferring tax collections, and the United States and the European Union cut off aid after the Hamas government took over -- and the inability to get goods into Gaza through the main crossing point at Karni, which the Israelis keep closing whenever there is a security alert.
 Since Jan. 1, Karni has been shut half of the time, according to James D. Wolfensohn, the former envoy of the international community, and an average of only 23 truckloads a day have left Gaza in that period, compared with a target of 150 a day. Produce has rotted, but crucial imports have also been held up. Though the lack of funds is a significant problem for the Palestinian health care system, supply shortages are less severe on the West Bank, where cargo crossings are less of an issue. 
 The Palestinian Authority is in part the author of these problems, for failing to stop attempted attacks on Karni, though Israel has been criticized by Mr. Wolfensohn and the European Union, and more quietly by the United States, for keeping the crossing closed. 
 Even before the Hamas victory, the authority was running a debt of $75 million a month because it raised salaries last summer and hired thousands of young armed men, causing the World Bank to cut off budget support. After the Hamas victory, Israel stopped handing over tax payments, and after Hamas took office, Washington and the Europeans suspended aid because Hamas refuses to recognize Israel and forswear violence.
 Both the United States and the European Union say humanitarian aid will get through -- but Washington does not consider government salaries to be humanitarian aid. There has been discussion of a new structure to funnel aid to health and education departments or individual Palestinians that would somehow bypass the Hamas government, but nothing has been decided.
 The results are severe in Gaza.
 A recent internal report by the World Health Organization, provided to The New York Times, portrays a crisis that is bound to worsen as the economic siege of the Hamas-run Palestinian Authority continues. The report forecasts a ''rapid decline of the public health system towards a possible collapse'' and ''no access or limited access to preventive programs'' like immunization for a large part of the population.
 Although some 70 percent of Gaza's 1.4 million people are refugees or their descendants, who get primary care from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, the organization runs only clinics, not hospitals. 
 According to another report, by Physicians for Human Rights/Israel, the Palestinian Authority provides 64.5 percent of general health needs, 77 percent of emergency hospital treatment and 76 percent of the needs of women and midwives. It also pays for the treatment in Israel and abroad of many difficult cases like those in pediatric oncology and pediatric heart operations, as well as various cancer and orthopedic treatments.
 ''Lack of funding for this system will lead to the deaths of thousands of people in the short term and extensive morbidity in the long term,'' the report says. The group, like the European Union, urges Israel to pay the Palestinians the $50 million or so a month it collects in tax receipts for the authority and to ease ''the policy of closure and curfew'' that is undermining the Palestinian ability to deliver services to people.
 Mark Regev, a spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry, said there had been no special restrictions on transferring medical supplies since Hamas took over. ''Israel wants to do all it can to avoid suffering among Palestinians,'' he said. ''But we have legitimate security concerns with an administration run by Hamas, which espouses terrorism against Israel.'' 
 The relief and works agency is the second largest employer in Gaza, and although it is paying salaries, ''We cannot substitute for or replace the Palestinian Authority,'' said its Gaza director, John Ging. ''We already expect accumulating strains on our current services,'' as refugees who work for the authority and have no salary turn to the agency.
 ''We're concerned about more instability, more insecurity, more poverty and more dependency'' on the agency, he said. The agency, he added, was trying ''to meet basic human needs at a subsistence level, but we can't provide the health, education and security services of the P.A.'' 
 The agency is already paying $78,000 a month for rent on shipping containers stuck at Karni, because the export blockage in Gaza means that once the limited cargo allowed into Gaza is unloaded, the empty containers may not return to Israeli territory, he said. ''We'd rather use the money for food.''
 In the dialysis ward of Shifa Hospital, Ahmed Shabat, 51, sits in fraying clothes. He must come every other day. ''This is my work,'' he says, then shows the swollen veins on his arms caused by a lack of mineral supplements normally provided. ''What is the relationship between humanitarian and political aims here?'' he asked. ''The United States is the mother of democracy. What is political about salaries to teachers and nurses? Please,'' he said, ''please don't mix humanitarian help with politics. Please separate the two.''
 Ismail Siam is watching over his sister, Asma al-Saidi, 53, who has metastatic breast cancer. She had radiation therapy, but a Tel Aviv hospital returned her to Gaza before chemotherapy because the Hamas-run government could not pay for it. Al Shifa does not have the required drugs, and so provides only analgesics to ease her pain.
 Mr. Siam, who works for the authority, alternates days here with his brother. Both live in Khan Yunis, farther south in the strip, and they are borrowing the $10 a day needed to travel here and back. Because the hospital lacks disposables, they also spend $100 every four days, he said, on laxatives, urine bags, catheters, anticonvulsives, feeding tubes and adhesive tape for their sister.
 ''I borrow from friends and have no more credit at the grocery store,'' Mr. Siam said. ''Unfortunately, the whole world has chosen to punish us for our vote for Hamas. And I also blame everyone who calls himself a Muslim and who does not help us.''

HEADLINE: Puerto Rico's Fiscal Woes Lead to Protests and Fears of Worsening Financial Fallout

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., May 7 

 BODY:
The Popular Democratic Party occupied Calle Fortaleza late Sunday morning, filling the narrow lane of tottering colonial facades spilling from the front gate of La Fortaleza, the governor's residence.
 The party's color is red, and members wear it on shirts, hats, socks, bandannas. Their flag of choice is the Puerto Rican one, and their man, Gov. Anibal Acevedo-Vila, was ensconced inside, a captive of the fiscal crisis that has hobbled Puerto Rico for a week.
''Vila is not alone,'' they chanted to the clacking of wooden noisemakers and tambourines. He stepped onto the balcony, briefly, to greet them.
 The opposition New Progressive Party started an hour later, with an evangelical service on Plaza de Armas and a slow, noisy march across Old San Juan to Calle Fortaleza. Their color is blue, and they carry the United States flag. Their leaders control both the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives, ensconced in the white-domed Capitolio on a seaside bluff a mile away. 
 ''The governor could immediately end this by signing the bills that we have placed before him,'' said Jorge Santini, the mayor of San Juan and the headliner of the opposition's rally. ''He is prolonging this crisis because he hopes to gain a political advantage.''
 Governor Acevedo-Vila also blames political calculation from the opposition.
 ''They think that if there is a crisis, the governor will get the blame,'' he said in a telephone interview Sunday evening. ''But that is not what is happening. People know that the House is the problem now.''
 In the end, the two sides were less than 10 yards apart on Calle Fortaleza, separated by wooden security barriers, a few dozen stone-faced riot police officers and the aquamarine awnings of a tourist boutique called Tropical Paradise. They sang. They chanted. They made rude gestures and tried to outshout one another. Both sides summoned the Almighty.
 ''The problem on this island right now is that the last election, in 2004, was too close,'' said Carlos Lopez, mayor of the resort town of Dorado and a supporter of the governor. ''Just a few thousand votes. Power is split. And so now, nothing gets resolved.''
 The fiscal crisis that has brought turmoil to Puerto Rico for a week has its roots in that razor-close 2004 election. The government has been unable to pass a new budget for two years, meaning that Puerto Rico continues to operate under the old one, even though costs have risen and the size of the government and the population have continued to grow.
 The result was that last week, Governor Acevedo-Vila said the federal government had run out of money, almost two months before the end of the fiscal year on June 30. He ordered a partial government shutdown, furloughing 95,000 civil servants -- more than half of them teachers -- and closing some 43 agencies, including the largest, the Department of Education, which tossed thousands of students out of school and ended daily school-lunch programs that many of the island's poor families depend upon to feed their children.
 The government shutdown has led to dozens of rallies and protest marches, including the ones on Sunday. The leaders of seven unions, including truck drivers and electrical workers, began the day promising to mount a general strike on Tuesday. But by day's end they altered their tune, saying they would aim at ''paralyzing the profits of the rich'' with a series of unspecified actions aimed at banks, big corporations and major shopping centers.
 ''This is the first time Puerto Rico has had to operate under such a divided government, and they're not used to it,'' said Angelo Falcon, president of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, based in New York. ''This thing is really out of control. And it's getting nasty.''
 Meanwhile, the man at the reluctant center of the current fuss, Alfredo Salazar, head of the Government Development Bank, had caught an early morning flight to New York where he hoped on Monday to persuade Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's not to downgrade Puerto Rico to junk-bond status.
 Although the teachers' next paychecks are not due until May 15, when the crisis will really hit home, business owners say they are worried that skittish consumers will stop buying, and they warn of potential private-sector layoffs. And at the local level, many of Puerto Rico's towns, which depend on federal support, have had to curtail municipal services like garbage collection. 
 The political parties here do not break down along class lines, or even along liberal-conservative ones. Instead, the central defining issue is Puerto Rico's future status. The opposition party wants it to become the 51st state in the union. Governor Acevedo-Vila's party favors the status quo, keeping Puerto Rico a territory.
 And a much smaller third party -- their color is green -- wants absolute independence for the island.
 Governor Acevedo-Vila says he needs $531.5 million to get the government to the end of the fiscal year. He wants Mr. Salazar to deliver a loan of that amount, but not until he and the legislature can agree on how to pay for it.
 The governor suggests a 7 percent sales tax, an idea that he borrowed from an old platform of the opposition party, which now renounces the idea. The opposition party chief, Pedro Rosello, himself a former governor, has suggested trying a lower sales tax.
 In the meantime, the Senate passed a 5.9 percent sales tax bill, which the governor said he would support if it was accompanied by measures like a higher tax on some corporations. The House has not taken action on the compromise.
 Jorge Silva, secretary for economic development and commerce, said estimates of economic losses from the crisis thus far ranged from $14 million to $20 million a day, though he said those numbers would inevitably rise if the crisis continued.
 And as the governor digs in his heels, opposition leaders claim the actual amount of money needed is around $350 million, much less than Mr. Acevedo-Vila says he needs. They say they have already passed enough bills to get Puerto Rico through the short-term crisis, partly by borrowing from next year's tax funds.
 ''I say to the governor, send the people to work again and we will continue discussing this,'' Mr. Santini said. ''All he must do is sign the bills that we have sent to him.''
 But Governor Acevedo-Vila says he is determined to find a long-term solution.
 ''I am insisting on a real solution to the current crisis, so we don't repeat the same crisis next year,'' he said.
 Many of the protesters, though, and others on the street are casting a skeptical eye on the behavior of both parties.
 ''This is nothing but a big power struggle between the two parties and even among those within the parties,'' said William Ortiz, vice president of the Teachers Association, which represents 28,000 of those laid off. ''And it is the public employees and the schoolchildren who are paying the price.''

HEADLINE: America's 'Near Poor' Are Increasingly at Economic Risk, Experts Say

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif. 

 BODY:
The Abbotts date their tailspin to a collapse in demand for the aviation-related electronic parts that Stephen sold in better times, when he earned about $40,000 a year. 
 He lost his job in late 2001, unemployment benefits ran out over the next year and he and his wife, Laurie, along with their teenage son, were evicted from their apartment.
They spent a year in a borrowed motor home here in the working-class interior of Orange County, followed by eight months in a motel room with a kitchenette. During that time, Ms. Abbott, a diabetic who is now 51, lost all her teeth and could not afford to replace them. 
 ''Since I didn't have a smile,'' she recalled, ''I couldn't even work at a checkout counter.'' 
 Americans on the lower rungs of the economic ladder have always been exposed to sudden ruin. But in recent years, with the soaring costs of housing and medical care and a decline in low-end wages and benefits, tens of millions are living on even shakier ground than before, according to studies of what some scholars call the ''near poor.'' 
 ''There's strong evidence that over the past five years, record numbers of lower-income Americans find themselves in a more precarious economic position than at any time in recent memory,'' said Mark R. Rank, a sociologist at Washington University in St. Louis and the author of ''One Nation, Underprivileged: Why American Poverty Affects Us All.''
 In a rare study of vulnerability to poverty, Mr. Rank and his colleagues found that the risk of a plummet of at least a year below the official poverty line rose sharply in the 1990's, compared with the two previous decades. By all signs, he said, such insecurity has continued to worsen. 
 For all age groups except those 70 and older, the odds of a temporary spell of poverty doubled in the 1990's, Mr. Rank reported in a 2004 paper titled, ''The Increase of Poverty Risk and Income Insecurity in the U.S. Since the 1970's,'' written with Daniel A. Sandoval and Thomas A. Hirschl, both of Cornell University.
 For example, during the 1980's, around 13 percent of Americans in their 40's spent at least one year below the poverty line; in the 1990's, 36 percent of people in their 40's did, according to the analysis. 
 Comparable figures for this decade will not be available for several years, but other indicators -- a climbing poverty rate and rising levels of family debt -- suggest a deepening insecurity, poverty experts and economists say. 
 More people work in jobs without health coverage, including temporary or contract jobs that may offer no benefits or even access to unemployment insurance. Medicaid is offered to fewer adults (though to more children). Cash welfare benefits are harder to secure, and their real value has eroded. 
 About 37 million Americans lived below the federal poverty line in 2004, set at $19,157 a year for a family of four. But far more people, another 54 million, were in households earning between the poverty line and double the poverty line.
 ''We don't track this group of people, and they are very vulnerable,'' said Katherine S. Newman, a sociologist at Princeton University who studies low-end workers. 
 Those suffering a nose-dive say the statistics do not begin to convey their fears and anguish. 
 Only a year ago, Machele Sauer thought she was entering the middle class. She and her husband, a licensed electrician, owned a large mobile home. He was starting his own business and Ms. Sauer, after bearing their fourth child, hoped to stop waitressing and be a stay-at-home mom. 
 ''We were the ideal family, the envy of others,'' she said recently as she collected free food and diapers at the Hope Family Support Center, a small charity in Garden Grove, Calif., in Orange County. ''And then, boom, everything flipped upside down.''
 Life fell apart last spring when her husband was arrested on theft charges, linked to a recent drug addiction she says she did not know about. Because of a prior record, he received a long prison sentence. 
 Now Ms. Sauer, 34, draws on the charity for goods and its director, Gayle Knight, for advice and emotional support, part of a grueling scramble to provide for her four daughters, ages 16 months, 8, 9 and 15. Many days over recent weeks, she dropped them at the baby sitter after school, worked the night shift as a waitress, picked up the sleeping children after midnight then woke up with the baby at 6:30 a.m. before preparing the older three for school. 
 At first she went on welfare, receiving $600 a month along with paid child care and counseling for herself and the children. As she resumed waitress work--four night shifts and two day shifts a week--she earned about $1,300 a month, which led her welfare payment to be cut to $300. 
 She receives $200 worth of food stamps that cover bills for just the first two weeks of each month, she said. 
 ''Now the van is breaking down,'' she said. ''With four kids it's really hard to hold a full-time job, and I need to make sure they do well in school.'' Her goal is to find a way to prepare for nursing school. 
 The Abbotts, too, sought aid from food banks and other charities, collecting weekly boxes of food and toiletries. 
 In Orange County, about 220,000 people received food from 400 local charities last year, according to the Second Harvest Food Bank, which distributes donations. Recipients include many families, often Hispanic, with several children and both parents working minimum-wage jobs. Over all, half the families seeking food had at least one working adult, according to a recent study by the food bank. 
 In the center of Orange County, a world away from its polished coastal towns, borderline poverty is common but seldom visible. On small streets behind strip malls and fast food restaurants, families, sometimes two of them, cram into small, aging bungalows. 
 What look like tourist motels along Beach Boulevard are mostly filled by working families or single people who stay for months or years, paying high weekly fees but unable to muster up-front money for an apartment rental.
 Mr. Abbott, now 58, eventually found a lower-paying sales job. With help from church members, the couple amassed the three months' rent of $2,700 required to rent a one-bedroom apartment in Anaheim. 
 Describing their last several years, Mr. Abbott kept circling back to the emotional toll. Motels, like the one they lived in for eight months for $281 a week, are ''dives,'' he said, ''with lots of screaming and fighting and cops being called.'' 
 ''It was really stressful,'' he said, ''and still you pay a lot of money.'' 
 In a new setback, Mr. Abbott has developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He recently had to stop working and go on state disability, which pays $1,436 a month and gives him health coverage. 
 Ms. Abbott has no health insurance -- if she gets sick, she says, she will go to a medical van that serves the homeless. But a generous dentist from church helped her get new teeth, and now she plans to hunt for work.

HEADLINE: Auto Trade Group Plans Ads on New Fuels

 BODY:
In an effort to show that it is environmentally friendly and to win over Congress, the auto industry is starting a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign promoting automobiles that use alternative fuels. 
 The campaign is aimed at Washington policy makers and will appear on Web sites and in publications that are frequently read by members of Congress and their staffs, according to The Detroit News, which reported on the campaign on Saturday.
Automakers from the United States, Japan and Europe -- including Ford, General Motors, Toyota, DaimlerChrysler, Mazda and BMW -- are among the companies behind the campaign. The effort is intended to fend off criticism from Congress that the industry has done little to improve fuel economy amid rising oil prices. 
 The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the trade group representing the companies, stresses that the industry has already invested billions to develop alternative fuel engines and that more than 41 models of alternative fuel vehicles are already on the market. 
 ''Automakers are part of the solution,'' the group says on the Web site, www.discoveralternatives.org. The alliance says that eight million alternative fuel cars are currently on the road, with an additional million available for sale. Next year, the alliance says, 35 more models of alternative fuel cars will be introduced. These are cars that can rely on gasoline, electric power, diesel, processed corn or natural gas.

HEADLINE: Funny Money on Iraq

 BODY:
President Bush is trying to score unearned points for fiscal rectitude by railing against the Senate's outsize $109 billion supplemental spending package, which includes money for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as hurricane relief. But the real scandal is Mr. Bush's own preference for financing much of the cost of the Iraq war outside the normal budget process. That is convenient for the administration, which does not have to count the money when it is pretending to balance the budget. But Iraq is not some kind of unexpected emergency, like Hurricane Katrina. It is a highly predictable cost, now amounting to about $100 billion a year, or just under 20 percent of total military spending. 
 Moving the war's financing off budget is no mere technical distinction. For one thing, it subjects the military's spending requests to less careful Congressional committee scrutiny than they would receive during the usual budget process. More important, this fiscal sleight of hand makes it that much easier for the Pentagon to duck the hard choices it desperately needs to be making between optional and costly futuristic weapons and pressing real-world needs.
 The Pentagon's latest $460 billion budget request reflects exactly the kinds of distortions that gimmicky cost-shifting produces. There is no serious pressure to economize to pay for those uncounted war costs. So the budget barrels ahead with unrealistic long-term spending projects that the services and the nation will ultimately be unable to afford, piling on stealth destroyers and air combat fighters designed for the cold war while soldiers go short of armor and adequate reinforcements in Iraq. 
 Making matters worse, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld shunted aside all pleas to expand the size of America's weary and badly overstrained ground forces to preserve even more dollars for wasteful weapons spending. 
 Congress would gladly vote the Pentagon every cent it needs to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan and rebuild its ground forces so that they are available for other military emergencies. But with so much of the war off budget, as it were, Congress is instead being asked to approve one of the biggest military budgets in American history for projects having little to do with current fighting. 
 The regular defense budget, at least, goes through protracted review by specialized authorization and appropriation committees that have some familiarity with military operations. That does not prevent a lot of pork being included. But the process is far more considered and transparent than the circuses that govern supplemental spending. 
 The Bush administration has not done a very good job of talking straight to the American people about Iraq. If it wants to start winning back some of its squandered credibility, honest budgeting would be one good place to start.

HEADLINE: Rove Is Using Threat of Loss To Stir G.O.P. 

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5 

 BODY:
To anyone who doubts the stakes for the White House in this year's midterm Congressional elections, consider that Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the Democrat who would become chairman of the Judiciary Committee if his party recaptured the House, has called for an inquiry into the possible impeachment of President Bush over the war in Iraq. 
 Or listen to Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, who would run the Senate Judiciary Committee if the Democrats took the Senate. Mr. Leahy vowed in a recent interview to subpoena top administration officials, if he got the chance, to answer more questions about their secret eavesdropping program and what he considers faulty prewar intelligence.
The prospect of the administration spending its last two years being grilled by angry Democrats under the heat of partisan spotlights has added urgency to the efforts by Karl Rove and Mr. Bush's political team to hang on to the Republican majorities in Congress. 
 Newly shorn of the daily policymaking duties he took on after the 2004 campaign and now refocused on his role as Mr. Bush's chief strategist, Mr. Rove is facing an increasingly difficult climate for Republicans, and an increasingly assertive Democratic Party. 
 The ambitious second-term agenda he helped develop has faltered even with a Republican Congress. His once-grand plans for creating a broadened and permanent Republican majority have given way to a goal of clinging to control of the House and Senate.
 The prospect of Democrats capturing either, however, may be one of the best weapons Mr. Rove has as he turns to what he has traditionally done best: motivating his party's conservative base to turn out on Election Day.
 Heading into the election, many conservatives are disheartened by the war in Iraq, upset at what they see as a White House tolerance for bigger government and escalating federal spending, and divided over issues like immigration. The abrupt resignation on Friday of the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Porter J. Goss, promised to feed the impression of an administration that is off balance. 
 But White House and Republican officials, trying to turn vulnerability to advantage, say conservatives could be united and re-energized by the possibility that Democrats could put Mr. Bush and his policies on political trial by winning control of even one chamber of Congress. 
 Senate Republicans sent out a fund-raising letter this week seeking to use that possibility to fire up the base, warning that a Democratic majority would put fighting terrorism ''on the back burner'' and that ''our worst fears'' could be realized. 
 The appeal is just one indication of how hard the White House and its Republican allies are likely to fight from now through Nov. 7 and of the challenge Mr. Rove faces in what could be the last campaign he orchestrates with the party. 
 At stake is not just what remains of Mr. Bush's hopes of making a permanent imprint on policy, but also whether Democrats will have a platform to define his presidency for history.
 With so much on the line, Mr. Rove has taken to traveling the country to form strategies with individual candidates and local parties while brainstorming with the president's political and policy teams on broad items the White House can pursue to help Republicans everywhere. He is focusing on only the major planks of Mr. Bush's agenda and not the minutiae of policy that had consumed hours of his day. 
 In regular West Wing breakfast sessions catered by the White House mess, Mr. Rove and the White House political director, Sara Taylor, have already been reaching out to nervous and vulnerable Republicans, three at a time, laying out an emerging three-prong attack on Democrats over national security, taxes and health care. 
 In meetings at the White House, aboard Air Force One and in candidates' home states, Mr. Rove is trying to rally Republicans to stand by the president and his agenda. 
 He has focused in particular on uniting them behind the administration's proposals to overhaul immigration, which include guest worker provisions that conservatives despise; the Iraq war, which has driven Mr. Bush's poll numbers sharply downward; and the Medicare prescription drug program, which the administration says will cost $872 billion from 2006 to 2014 and which Mr. Bush backed enthusiastically despite complaints from conservatives that it was a vast expansion of the social welfare state.
 Democrats need a net gain of six seats to win control of the Senate, and 15 for the House. With the overall outcome potentially coming down to one or two races, nearly every district and state seems to be getting some attention from Mr. Rove. He enlisted the president, and called on his own, to persuade Representative Elton Gallegly of California, a 10-term veteran, to reconsider a decision to drop his planned re-election campaign because of health worries. 
 Mr. Gallegly's decision threatened to jeopardize a seat the White House could otherwise count as safe. Mr. Gallegly quoted Mr. Rove as saying, ''You know how important this election is going to be to be to all of us.'' 
 Mr. Gallegly acquiesced and said his health fear had ultimately proved unfounded anyway.
 Mr. Rove's playbook is drawn straight from the one that worked for him in 2004: first, get conservatives fired up enough to vote, a particularly important goal in a midterm election, in which turnout is usually quite low. Second, make sure the election is not just about Mr. Bush's performance, but also about the choice between a Republican Party defined on its own terms and a Democratic Party defined on Mr. Rove's.
 ''We need to be really aggressive in explaining the sharp differences that exist between our candidates and their candidates on issues like taxes,'' Mr. Rove said in a telephone interview on Thursday as he headed to address a Republican dinner in Lancaster, Pa. ''We have to do a better job of pressing advantages that we have on Medicare, prescription drugs.''
 Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said Mr. Rove's task was tough but overdue. ''Part of the problem is, I don't think there's been that kind of communication or the attempt to build political consensus within the party,'' Mr. Cornyn said, while voicing confidence in Mr. Rove's ability to pull it off.
 Mr. Rove is also working in close contact with Ms. Taylor and the Republican National Committee chairman, Ken Mehlman, to put in motion the get-out-the-vote machinery Mr. Mehlman masterminded in 2004. They are refining state ''victory programs'' to identify potentially friendly voters who can be expected to receive messages about how the Democrats are ill prepared to fight terrorism or will undo tax cuts the president wants to make permanent.
 Democrats say that is an old ploy that will not work this year. ''The only things they can bring back this year are the old saws,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ''They just won't play. We're in a new world.''
 At this point in the last midterm elections four years ago, Mr. Bush's approval ratings were around 70 percent, making him a huge asset on the campaign trail for his party.
 Now the president's approval ratings are half that. The war has cast a shadow over the rest of the administration's agenda, and Democrats say some of the accomplishments Mr. Rove wants to highlight, like the prescription drug benefit, have troubled histories that make them less than ideal centerpieces for a campaign. And Mr. Rove remains embroiled in the federal criminal investigation into the disclosure of a C.I.A. officer's identity.
 But Republican and White House officials say that as the kinks subside the prescription drug plan will be a net positive for the party come November, just as Mr. Rove said that the passage of a sweeping overhaul of immigration law would please voters who wanted action from Washington.
 Republican and White House officials are also telling fellow Republicans that criticizing the president risks bringing the party down with him. At the same time, party officials have said they do not want the election to be a referendum on Mr. Bush.
 Democrats are determined to make it just that. They say they believe that talk of their plans to demand answers from the administration is a rallying cry for their core voters.
 ''I think when the Congress finally joins the American people, this president is going to have to not just show how stubborn he is by sticking out his jaw,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, who would be in line for the chairmanship of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee if Democrats took the House. ''He's going to have to answer some questions.''
 Mr. Rove said he was not worried. ''We won't see how that plays out because they're not going to win,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Cheney Lauds 3 Premiers For Efforts To Join NATO

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WOOD

DATELINE: DUBROVNIK, Croatia, May 7 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney spent the weekend in this picturesque Dalmatian port, his last stop on a visit to Eastern Europe and former Soviet bloc states.
 He met with leaders of Macedonia and Albania, as well as Croatia, and, before leaving Sunday, said that their efforts to join the European Union and NATO would help invigorate both institutions.
 Mr. Cheney's visit was a low-key finale to a strategically important trip, which first took him to Lithuania for a meeting with a number of Eastern European leaders, where he gave a speech criticizing Russia for restricting human rights and using its natural resources to put pressure on its neighbors. He later visited Kazakhstan, which the United States has been trying to develop as an source for oil. 
 Mr. Cheney told a group of prime ministers, ''It's very important -- both for NATO and the E.U. -- to take in new members, people who aspire to join the organization, help rejuvenate it.'' 
 Albania, Croatia and Macedonia form the Adriatic Charter, an association encouraged by Colin L. Powell when he was secretary of state to aid their attempts to join NATO.
 The visit was a reward for Croatia, which Mr. Cheney said had made substantial progress in recent years. It has shed its nationalist image and helped to bring its last remaining Croatian war crimes suspect, Gen. Ante Gotovina, to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Croatia is now regarded as the favorite among the former Yugoslav states to be accepted into the European Union and NATO.
 But Croatia has resisted American pressure to sign an agreement that would shield American soldiers from prosecution at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which the Bush administration has not recognized. The United States has cut aid to many nations that have refused to sign immunity agreements, contending that it was acting to protect American soldiers from politically motivated prosecution. Croatia has lost $5.8 million in military aid as a result.
 But now Croatian officials say they are trying to resolve the issue through a status of forces agreement, to prevent American personnel on Croatian territory from being transferred to the court.
 On Saturday, Mr. Cheney and his wife, Lynne, toured the old city in Dubrovnik, though it rained and they were subjected to the heckling of a lone Canadian student.
 Mr. Cheney's visit encouraged local officials to conclude that the Bush administration would stay involved in helping to resolve the problems remaining in the region from the inter-ethnic and political turmoil of the 1990's. 
 ''The three of us agreed that alongside the E.U., the U.S. should also be present in solving those issues,'' Ivo Sanader, Croatia's prime minister, told reporters after the meeting on Sunday.
 This is an important year for the region to try to settle issues festering from the war in Bosnia, which ended a decade ago. Negotiations on the future of Kosovo, the province of Serbia now controlled by the United Nations, are under way, and could lead to it becoming independent. 
 In two weeks Montenegro, which with Serbia makes up all that remains of the Yugoslav federation, will hold a referendum about whether it will sever its remaining ties with the government in Belgrade. 
 Mr. Cheney did not publicly address these issues, but his team sought reassurance from the Adriatic Charter nations that they would help to maintain the timetable, officials who took part in the discussions said.

Chiding Moscow Again
 SHANNON, Ireland, May 7 (Reuters) -- Mr. Cheney took Russia to task again on Sunday.
 Heading home from visits to Lithuania, Kazakhstan and Croatia, Mr. Cheney said he had heard repeated concerns about Russia's ''internal developments,'' as well as its use of energy resources to ''obtain leverage'' over its neighbors.
 He insisted, however, that Russia had nothing to fear from NATO, which has expanded eastward since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
 The vice president's plane touched down briefly at Shannon's airport on its way back to Washington.
 In response to concerns about the repercussions of his criticism, Mr. Cheney dismissed the notion that Russia would retaliate by hardening its position at the United Nations against an American-led effort for action against Iran over its nuclear ambitions.

HEADLINE: Iran Says It Will Spurn Any U.N. Nuclear Edict

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The Iranian government said yesterday that it would reject any United Nations resolution against its nuclear activities, and threatened to stop cooperating with the United Nations nuclear monitoring group, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
 ''If the Security Council adopts a resolution that does not officially recognize Iran's right, Tehran will not implement it,'' the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi, said in a news briefing in Tehran carried by the news agency IRNA.
He added that the involvement of the United Nations Security Council in Iran's nuclear case, and any ''incorrect decision'' by the Council, could turn the path of cooperation into one of confrontation. ''Any measure by the Security Council will have adverse impacts on the trend of the Islamic Republic of Iran's cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency,'' Mr. Asefi said. 
 He said that if Iran's nuclear program were taken up by the Security Council instead of the atomic energy agency, then ''Iran should not be expected to continue its cooperation with the I.A.E.A.'' 
 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said yesterday that international treaties became ''invalid'' as soon as they failed to secure the rights of nations. He said that if a nation's rights under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty were violated, ''Then that nation would revise its decision and the treaty would become invalid,'' the Iranian news agency reported.
 The remarks were the latest that Iran had issued in defending what it says is its right to develop its nuclear program, which it says is for generating power. Mr. Ahmadinejad announced a milestone in that program last month when he said Iran had enriched uranium to a low level for use in a power plant. The atomic energy agency noted in a report on April 28 that Iran had persisted in enriching uranium and had defied the United Nations Security Council's demands for information. 
 American, British and French officials are scheduled to meet in New York on Monday to chart a common position on Iran over its failure to comply with the informal Security Council deadline to suspend its uranium enrichment. Britain and France circulated a draft Security Council resolution last Wednesday demanding that Iran give up its nuclear program, which the West believes Iran is using to develop nuclear weapons.
 The measure was drafted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which makes compliance with resolutions mandatory and opens the way to penalties or military action against nations that defy them. But imposing penalties would require a second resolution.
 China and Russia, permanent Security Council members with veto power, have declared opposition to a resolution under Chapter VII.
 A majority of members of Iran's Parliament said in a statement yesterday that if the United Nations invoked Chapter VII, Parliament would call on the government to consider quitting the nuclear treaty, Reuters reported.
 The American ambassador to the United Nations, John R. Bolton, said yesterday that he believed that the resolution would move to a vote this week, with or without support from Russia and China, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Bolton said Parliament's threat would not deter a United Nations resolution. ''It shows they remain desperate to conceal that their nuclear program is in fact a weapons program,'' he said.
 Mr. Asefi criticized the resolution as being politically motivated. Vice President Dick Cheney said yesterday that Russia, as a member of the Security Council, was an important part of the effort to curb Iran's program. ''But it's important with respect to the Iranian situation that the international community come together and adopt a unified, effective position vis-a-vis Iran if we're going to avoid having a nuclear arms race in the Middle East,'' he said in an interview with NBC news.

THE LATEST RATE -- The main economic news of the week will be the midweek meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, where policy makers are expected to raise their benchmark interest rate by another quarter-point, to 5 percent. (Wednesday.) 


DELPHI IN COURT -- The Delphi Corporation's motions to void its labor contracts with the United Automobile Workers will be heard in bankruptcy court tomorrow or Wednesday. Delphi, an auto parts supplier that is under bankruptcy protection, says it needs to lower workers' wages to stay in business. The union has threatened to strike if the contracts are thrown out. Such a strike could hamper not only Delphi but also its biggest customer, General Motors, which spun off Delphi in 1999.

TO YOUR HEALTH -- Sometime during the week, the Senate is expected to vote on legislation that would pre-empt state laws and allow small businesses to pool health insurance coverage, increasing the number of people who would be able to obtain it. President Bush strongly favors such a law. The goal is to make health care coverage cheaper for smaller companies, but the legislation's opponents -- which include AARP, the American Cancer Society and the American Diabetes Association -- say the federal standards for insurance coverage will be weaker than the state ones they supersede and will thus erode consumer protection.

AND THE WINNER IS -- The National Magazine Awards will be handed out tomorrow night. This year The Atlantic Monthly received the most nominations (eight), followed by The Virginia Quarterly Review (six). The long list of nominees also includes The New Yorker, National Geographic, New York and Harper's, each of which received five nominations. The American Society of Magazine Editors, which sponsors the awards in conjunction with the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, will bestow the awards at a ceremony in Lincoln Center. (Tuesday.)

IT'S THE ECONOMY -- Economic reports this week include wholesale trade for March tomorrow; March retail sales, March business inventories and first-time jobless claims on Thursday; and, on Friday, the trade deficit for March and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for May.

PROFIT NEWS -- Earnings reports due out this week include Cablevision, Cisco, Disney, Lazard and US Airways tomorrow; Federated Department Stores and Toyota on Wednesday; and J. C. Penney, Kohl's and Viacom on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Homes Are Still Moving, But Buyers Gain an Edge

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Many Americans who planned on real estate as their path to wealth are beginning to find that there are limits to how high is up. 
 Blame market forces. As higher interest rates dampen demand in cities and suburbs that only a year ago were battlegrounds for fierce bidding wars among numerous buyers, sellers are grudgingly lowering their prices to drum up interest.
 A house at 57 Marina Boulevard in San Rafael, in Marin County north of San Francisco, was originally listed at $1.45 million. The owner recently dropped the price to $949,000 when a competing house on the same street lowered its price to $959,000, from $989,000. In the county, the prices of about a quarter of all listings have been reduced. County records show that 57 Marina Boulevard was sold in February for $700,000, so the owner, Dan Marr, is unlikely to lose money even at the lower price, though he may not make as much as he had hoped. ''I don't want to talk about it,'' he said. 
 It is getting tough out there for sellers. What is happening in Marin County is being repeated in cities and suburbs across the United States. Nearly a year after the sales of homes peaked, buyers are wresting control from sellers in many areas as inventories of unsold homes have grown, in some markets doubling. Few people are losing money after the run-up in housing prices in the last 10 years, but the air is coming out of the market.
 It is a slow leak, to be sure. The most widely used statistic to measure home values, the median home price, shows that once-hot markets like San Mateo, Calif., and Mercer County, N.J., are now registering year-over-year declines. In general, prices are still climbing, but they are doing so far more slowly in cities like Las Vegas and San Diego, which had been lucrative markets for speculators. 
 ''It's going from a seller's market to a buyer's market,'' said David Lereah, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. In March, ''price appreciation went down to 7.4 percent, from over 10 percent,'' he added. ''That most probably reflects that sellers are bringing their prices down.''
 As always, real estate remains intensely local and sellers have retained, or regained, control in some markets, because there are fewer properties to be had and demand is being bolstered by stronger job markets. Even in markets with growing inventories like Chicago, the situation is not uniformly weak in all neighborhoods.
 ZipRealty, the discount real estate broker, has found widespread price reductions in the multiple listing services used by all agents to advertise homes. Prices have been trimmed on 35.7 percent of all homes currently listed for sale in the Boston area, for example. The same is true for homes in San Diego, Sacramento, Los Angeles and Miami. And prices have been snipped on a quarter of the homes in Chicago, Washington and Baltimore. 
 In Silicon Valley, where jobs are coming back after the collapse of the technology bubble, Richard Calhoun, a real estate agent, said that the number of homes sold was now 85 percent of the 25-year average. A year ago, it was 30 percent above that average. In Santa Cruz, inventories have tripled to 124 days, from 42 days. 
 A result is that the median price of homes in San Mateo County dropped 2.7 percent, to $875,000, in March, from $899,000 a year earlier.
 ''It's clearly a slowdown,'' Mr. Calhoun, the Silicon Valley agent, said. ''But how can you complain when more than 50 percent of sellers are getting more than their asking price and when you have only two months of inventory when in other places four to six months is considered normal?''
 Elsewhere, for the first time in nearly a decade, you can smell the anxiety. The listing agent for a four-bedroom home on Scripps Trail in San Diego informed other agents in the multiple-listing service that a ''very, very motivated seller will entertain all reasonable offers'' and ''will help with closing costs.'' The house was listed in September at $810,000. After a previous price cut, the seller is now willing to entertain offers as low as $685,000. 
 The seller bought the house for $730,000 in 2005, according to county property records, for what the listing agent said were investment purposes. 
 Taking a loss is still rare for sellers, because homes appreciated so much in the 1990's and 2000's. Stephen and Brenda Abelkop bought their four-bedroom house in La Jolla, Calif., for around $850,000 about 15 years ago. 
 When they put it up for sale right after Thanksgiving, they followed their agent's advice to ask for $2.75 million. ''You price it for the market,'' Mr. Abelkop said. 
 But they didn't attract much interest. Inventories in the San Diego area have risen 25 percent in the last year, to more than 19,000 unsold homes, a record. So there is a lot more competition, even for a high-end property like the Abelkops' house, which has sweeping views of San Diego Bay. They recently dropped the price to a range of $2.5 million to $2.7 million and said the drop had resulted in more buyer visits.
 Some agents say setting price ranges attracts buyers who would otherwise walk away thinking the home was too expensive. Others say it is simply a sign of a wavering owner.
 Because sellers are not panicking, it appears unlikely that the real estate market will fall abruptly. ''Sellers remain optimistic,'' said Edward Leamer, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
 Mr. Leamer sees some evidence that the bubble is deflating slowly, but says he finds it striking that it has taken so long. For example, sales volume peaked in the San Diego area in the summer of 2003. Only in January did inventories begin to swell, hitting an eight-month supply of homes that month, and sellers began to get nervous enough to bring the prices down. 
 Inventories have since moved closer to a six-month supply of homes, which balances the volume between buyer and seller. 
 PMI, a company that tracks risk in the real estate market for mortgage lenders, said the chances were increasing that prices in San Diego would decline in the next two years. The company said the city had a 60 percent chance of a decline, up from 52.8 percent last summer. 
 Prices in most of California and the Boston-to-New York corridor could also fall, said Mark Milner, the company's chief risk officer. Its statistics, which lag the current market by about two months, show homes continuing to appreciate, but at a slower rate. 
 After open houses for their four-bedroom, two-story ranch house in Lawrenceville, N.J., brought in no offers, Mary Ellen and Anthony Pierrard are telling potential buyers they are willing to negotiate their $420,000 asking price and are even considering enlisting a real estate agent to help them market their home. That's a far cry from the couple's experience selling two houses on their own in Rockland County, N.Y., a few years ago.
 ''During the first open house for both, we received a minimum two to three offers,'' Mrs. Pierrard, a corporate employee relations manager, said. ''We sold them on the first day. Now, no one is even making an offer, period.''
 Robin L. McCarthy, a real estate agent who works in nearby Princeton, N.J., said homes were sitting on the market three to four months, when houses sold in as little as a few days a year ago. Houses that would have been the subject of intense bidding wars now sell for slightly less than asking price.
 ''Buyers are afraid that real estate prices are going to go down, so they are very careful,'' Ms. McCarthy said. ''They don't want to pay too much.''
 Thus far, prices have not fallen in any of the 375 largest American cities tracked by the PMI Group. But many are showing a sharp deceleration in price increases, among them Las Vegas, San Diego, Elmira, N.Y., and Lebanon, Pa. 
 Still, those cities are outnumbered by cities where prices are drastically accelerating -- like St. George, Utah; Binghamton, N.Y.; Boise, Idaho; Naples, Fla.; and most cities in Arizona. 
 ''We'd expect a soft landing in prices because, naturally, the economy is strong,'' Mr. Milner said. Unless a recession hits and people begin to lose jobs, house prices will fall slowly, most economists say. 
 In the new home business, large builders like Toll Brothers and Hovnanian Enterprises report that orders have fallen 4 percent to 29 percent but that average selling prices are still rising, albeit more slowly than six months ago. Nationally, however, the Commerce Department reported that median new-home prices -- half the homes sold for more, half for less -- fell 2.2 percent, to $224,200, in March from a year ago. It was the first year-over-year price decline since February 2003.
 Inventories are not high in every city. For a variety of reasons, mostly stronger job markets, sales and prices are picking up in markets like Houston, Boise and Dallas, which did not see a boom in recent years, experts say. 
 In Seattle, for instance, some buyers are enmeshed in bidding wars that push prices far beyond the asking price -- a phenomenon that was common in San Diego, Las Vegas and Washington only a year ago. Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a new online real estate service based in Seattle, has hired a champion video gamer, with great thumb-twitching skill, to speed data entry during the multioffer auctions. ''Polite, soggy Seattleites have become blood-thirsty cannibals,'' he said.
 Houston appears to be benefiting from strength in the energy industry, robust hiring and transplants from Louisiana. More than 100,000 hurricane evacuees are living in the city and its suburbs. Clint Simpson of Greenwood King Properties said that in the last month he had represented four home buyers who were relocating to Houston because their companies were scaling back operations in New Orleans. 
 ''Houses are getting multiple offers the first week on the market and many of them are going over list,'' he said.
 In March, sales of existing homes were up 22 percent from a year earlier and median prices rose 5.4 percent, to $143,310, according to the Houston Association of Realtors. Inventories fell by nearly 3 percent in the month.
 Formerly hot coastal markets and previously flat markets in the middle of the country have reversed their roles, said Mr. Lereah, from the Realtors association.
 In Chicago, real estate agents say each neighborhood is different. A high-rise building boom has created a glut of condos downtown and buyers can often negotiate free parking spaces, which previously would have cost $35,000. But the pickings are so slim in the popular Lakeview area north of the central business district that an agent, Brad Lipitz, recently found only three listings there. ''Chicago is comprised of many markets,'' he noted.
 In Southern Florida, agents and sellers say sales have slackened as inventories have ballooned, but they note that prices are not falling.
 Donna L. Lanzon sold her late mother's two-bedroom condo in Deerfield Beach in Broward County in March. The condo was initially priced at $250,000, but Ms. Lanzon reduced the asking price to $235,000 and sold the 1,260-square-foot, two-bedroom unit for $225,000 after three months on the market.
 Her agent, Cathleen Flanagan, who works for ZipRealty, said the growing inventory -- the Fort Lauderdale area had more than 20,000 homes for sale at the end of April, more than four times the level a year ago -- had forced sellers to rethink their asking prices and offer incentives, like increasing the commission of the buyer's agent to 4 percent, instead of following the usual practice of splitting a 6 percent commission between buyer's and seller's agents. One seller recently offered a free five-night Caribbean cruise for two. 
 Do the tactics work? ''Absolutely; it makes sense,'' Ms. Flanagan said. ''A lot of buyers' agents will go out there to see the home.''

HEADLINE: Sony to Sell PlayStation 3 For $499

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 8 

 BODY:
Sony said on Monday that it planned to sell the base model of its PlayStation 3 video game console for $499, a price that industry analysts said could put it at a competitive disadvantage to rival Microsoft and its Xbox 360. 
 Sony said that it also planned to sell a higher-priced model with a larger hard drive for $599. 
The console will be released on Nov. 11 in Japan and Nov. 17 in United States and Europe, Sony executives said. It will cost about $536 in Japan and $636 in Europe.
 The release date and prices, made public at a flashy news conference in Los Angeles, were disclosed with pomp and circumstance, befitting Sony's vigorous effort to keep itself fresh in the minds of video game players.
 Sony said it planned to ship six million consoles by the end of March 2007, including two million when the system is introduced in the fall. 
 The company had originally expected to begin selling the PlayStation 3 this spring, but said in March that it would postpone the release until November. The delay has given a full-year lead to Microsoft, which introduced its Xbox 360 last November.
 The 360 sells at two prices, $299 for a basic system and $399 for a ramped up one.
 Paul Jackson, a video game industry analyst with Forrester Research, said the price of the PlayStation would put Sony at a competitive disadvantage to Microsoft. The consoles will sell out at first because of the cult of PlayStation users, he said. But after that, he said, prices will have to come down quickly.
 At its announcement, Sony executives tried to make the case that the PlayStation 3 would be the most advanced game system to date, with enough features to justify its price.
 Some of the game players, analysts and journalists gathered at the news conference said they were not convinced.
 The system ''is as expensive as I expected, and that is to say it is outrageously expensive,'' said Chris Kohler, a freelance video game journalist and avid game player who lives in San Francisco. He said that Sony did not make a sufficient case that the console's features justify the cost. ''They didn't show it today.''
 He added, ''What they showed looked very much like the games you can get on the 360.''
 Sony also said for the first time that the hand-held controllers supplied with the games will enable players to manipulate activity on their television screens. For example, players will be able tilt their hands to make an airplane move to the left or right, or roll.
 Even at the price announced on Monday, Sony will probably sell the PlayStation systems at a substantial discount to what it costs to make them, analysts said. The gap is attributable to the high cost of the console's components, notably its powerful cell processor and a high-definition DVD format called Blu-ray.
 But the economics of the video game business can potentially support a model in which console makers subsidize their machines because they can make a lot of money by collecting royalty fees for games sold for those consoles. And further, Sony cannot afford to price its console too much higher than the 360.
 The news conference was timed to coincide with the industry's big annual trade show, an immersion into high-technology sensory overload known as E3, which starts Wednesday at the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
 The other console makers, Microsoft and Nintendo, have scheduled announcements for Tuesday.
 The business stakes are immense for all three, and for the hundreds of companies that make video games and accessories for the consoles, as well as the investors banking that the industry will continue to grow.
 Perhaps no company is in the spotlight this week like Sony. It is the reigning heavyweight champion of console makers, with its PlayStation 2 having sold more than 100 million units since it was introduced in 2000.
 Its dominance has been challenged by Microsoft, which sold around one-quarter that many Xboxes.
 Microsoft's introduction of the 360 was met with consumer enthusiasm, and a caveat. The company initially sold as many consoles as it could make, but that turned out not necessarily to be a function just of customer demand but also of Microsoft production snags that limited supply.
 Still, Michael Pachter, a video game industry analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities, said Microsoft would probably have sold 10 million Xbox 360 consoles by the time the PlayStation 3 reaches the market.
 Sony said it decided to delay the console's release to allow software developers to create games that take better advantage of the powerful processor and graphics technology of the PlayStation 3.
 Yet the delay has been painful for those software makers and their investors. Companies like Electronic Arts, a big video game maker, have said that the slower-than-expected transition to a new generation of consoles is one reason they are in a significant sales slump that it appears will last for at least a year.
 As for Sony, whether it can take over Microsoft's early lead depends in part on a business battle that is somewhat tangential to the console competition. In promoting Blu-ray as a high-definition DVD format, Sony is in a pitched battle with Toshiba, which is promoting a rival technological standard.
 If Toshiba wins out, Sony's heavy investment in Blu-ray, and its inclusion in the PlayStation 3, could wind up being a costly mistake. But if Blu-ray prevails, users could be drawn to the PlayStation 3 in part for its ability to play vivid movies.
 ''Blu-ray is going to decide it,'' Mr. Pachter said of the console wars. ''Consumers will pay more for a Blu-ray drive if we believe it has value.''
 He added that he thought Sony would prevail. ''Sony's going to kill Toshiba because it has to,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Optimistic, Democrats Debate the Party's Vision

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
With Democrats increasingly optimistic about this year's midterm elections and the landscape for 2008, intellectuals in the center and on the left are debating how to sharpen the party's identity and present a clear alternative to the conservatism that has dominated political thought for a generation.
 Many of these analysts, both liberals and moderates, are convinced that the Democrats face a moment of historic opportunity. They say that the country is weary of war and division and ready -- if given a compelling choice -- to reject the Republicans and change the country's direction. They argue that the Democratic Party is showing signs of new health -- intense party discipline on Capitol Hill, a host of policy proposals and an energized base.
But some of these analysts argue that the party needs something more than a pastiche of policy proposals. It needs a broader vision, a narrative, they say, to return to power and govern effectively -- what some describe as an unapologetic appeal to the ''common good,'' to big goals like expanding affordable health coverage and to occasional sacrifice for the sake of the nation as a whole. 
 This emerging critique reflects, for many, a hunger to move beyond the carefully calibrated centrism that marked the Clinton years, which was itself the product of the last big effort to redefine the Democratic Party. 
 This analysis is also, in large part, a rejection of the more tactical, consultant-driven politics that dominated the party's presidential and Congressional campaigns of the last six years -- the emphasis on targeted issues like prescription drugs for retirees and careful, constituent-based appeals. 
 ''What the Democrats still don't have is a philosophy, a big idea that unites their proposals and converts them from a hodgepodge of narrow and specific fixes into a vision for society,'' Michael Tomasky, editor of the liberal journal The American Prospect, wrote in a much-discussed essay in the May issue.
 A broader vision, many of these analysts say, will help the Democratic Party counter the charge, so often advanced by Republicans, that the Democrats are merely a collection of interest groups -- labor, civil rights, abortion rights and the like -- each consumed with their own agenda, rather than the nation's.
 John Podesta, who heads a center-left research group, the Center for American Progress, says an appeal to the common good ''gets away from what we've sort of gotten used to in the last couple cycles -- a pollster-driven niche idea framing -- toward a larger vision of where you want to take the country.'' 
 Democrats and progressive intellectuals have a history of debating philosophies and world views. Sometimes those debates result in a consensus and even a winning campaign, like Mr. Clinton's; sometimes the results are irrelevant in the rush of real-world campaigning.
 This discussion, still early, is bubbling up in journals like The American Prospect; research organizations like the Center for American Progress, The Third Way and the Democratic Leadership Council; a wave of new books; and -- especially -- among bloggers who are demanding that the party become more assertive in fighting for what it believes in. 
 The frustration with consultants -- and their impact on Democratic politics -- is widespread among the Internet pundits, and at the heart of several recent books, including ''Crashing the Gate,'' co-written by Markos Moulitsas, founder of the blog the Daily Kos. In another, ''Politics Lost,'' Joe Klein mourns the passing of a more authentic, preconsultant politics that he argues was embodied by Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 campaign. 
 Even the film industry recognizes the mood; ''Bobby,'' an account of June 5, 1968, the day Kennedy won the California primary and was assassinated, is scheduled for release in November. 
 This discussion of first principles and big goals marks a psychological shift for many in the party; a frequent theme is that Democrats must stop being afraid, stop worrying that their core beliefs are out of step with the times, stop ceding so much ground to the conservatives.
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, ''One of the most successful right-wing ploys was to demonize any concern about the distribution of income in America as, quote, class warfare.'' 
 Many of these analysts argue that Republicans have pushed the ideological limits of the American people so far -- notably, with Mr. Bush's tax cuts for the affluent and his effort to partly privatize Social Security -- that Americans are ready for something different. Elaine Kamarck, a former top aide to former Vice President Al Gore, argues that the combination of the Sept. 11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina has driven home to Americans the need for strong and effective government, ''and gets us back to our strengths -- a government that can deliver.''
 William Kristol, a leading conservative thinker and editor of The Weekly Standard, counters that parties are ultimately defined not by big visions from intellectuals but by real positions on real issues.
 ''Foreign policy is critical,'' said Mr. Kristol, whose magazine was considered an important influence on the Bush administration's foreign policy. ''Do they share a basic understanding that there is a global war on terror, and Iran is a threat that has to be dealt with? Is the next Democratic presidential nominee going to raise taxes or not?''
 He added, ''It needs to be brought down to earth.'' 
 Many of these Democratic and liberal analysts acknowledge as much; they have a huge challenge on foreign policy, with divisions over the war in Iraq hanging over every philosophical discussion. There is more of a broad consensus on domestic policy, like the need to expand access to college and health care, but Democrats can still muster a good internal fight over whether to raise taxes and on whom, or how to deal with trade and a globalized economy. 
 Moreover, any party, in the end, is essentially defined by its presidential nominee.
 Potential Democratic presidential candidates are already getting pulled into this debate. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York drew fire from Mr. Moulitsas, in an essay in The Washington Post on Sunday, as being too careful, thinking too small, essentially being a throwback to an outmoded centrism.
 But as Representative Rahm Emanuel, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, puts it, ''The conversations we're having now are essential,'' in part, he argued, because the last two presidential elections ''were more about biography than about a view of government or a vision of the future for this country.'' 
 Mr. Emanuel, a former Clinton White House adviser, plans to weigh into the debate with a book coming out this August called ''The Plan -- Big Ideas for America's Future,'' written with Bruce Reed, another former Clinton White House aide and president of the Democratic Leadership Council.
 The debate begins with a diagnosis of the problem: 15 years ago, in the runup to the Clinton campaign, influential Democratic thinkers argued that the party had lost three presidential races in a row because it was too liberal and had lost touch with the middle class. These days, some analysts argue it has become so tactical and so prone to compromise that not enough Americans know what it stands for. John Halpin and Ruy Teixeira of the Center for American Progress recently described it as an ''identity gap.'' 
 Mr. Tomasky argued in his article that ''the party and the constellation of interests around it don't even think in philosophical terms and haven't for quite some time. There's a reason for this. They've all been trained to believe -- by the media, by their pollsters -- that their philosophy is an electoral loser.''
 Mr. Tomasky argues that the Democratic Party needs to stand for more than diversity and rights; it needs to return to its New Deal, New Frontier and Great Society roots and run as the party of the common good -- the philosophy, he says, that brought the nation Social Security, the Marshall Plan, the Peace Corps and civil rights legislation. After years of what he calls ''rapacious social Darwinism'' under Mr. Bush, Mr. Tomasky argues that the country is ready for the idea that ''we're all in this -- postindustrial America, the globalized world and especially the post-9/11 world in which free peoples have to unite to fight new threats -- together.'' 
 Peter Beinart, editor-at-large for The New Republic, argues for a new Democratic foreign policy in a new book, ''The Good Fight,'' saying liberals need to reclaim the tough-minded approach they brought to the cold war -- recognizing the need for strong engagement in the fight against totalitarianism and for democracy, but doing so through international institutions. 
 Mr. Beinart, who backed the war in Iraq but now says, ''I was wrong,'' said there were ''important cautionary lessons'' for supporters of that war about the dangers of ''apocalyptic thinking'' and the conviction that quick action is essential. On the other hand, he said, ''It was the wrong lessons of Vietnam that led the Democratic Party off the cliff into mass opposition to the gulf war'' in 1991.

HEADLINE: Exiles in 'Tehrangeles' Are Split On How U.S. Should Sway Iran

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 3 

 BODY:
With neon signs in Persian decorating the window of the Woodland Hills Market -- ''Kabob'' glowing in bright red, ''Iranian Market'' in pea green -- this corner grocery store could just as well be in Tehran as in the heart of ''Tehrangeles,'' as Iranians everywhere call their largest exile community.
 Products labeled in Persian and English reflect the dual identity of most customers, who find themselves particularly torn these days, wanting change in Iran but dreading what further sanctions or military action would do to Iranians. 
''I love my country, but I hate these mullahs,'' said Houshang Samandi, a television director for an Iranian satellite channel whose life in Los Angeles remains so completely Iranian that after 14 years he still asks a fellow exile to translate the word ''sanctions.''
 ''Sanctions will only harm the ordinary people,'' Mr. Samandi said. ''If there is a military attack, they will be killing my people. But if they don't attack, the mullahs will never leave.'' 
 The debate over whether the United States could better influence events in Tehran by using diplomacy or by flexing its muscle, taking military action to try to knock out the Islamic republic's growing nuclear program, rages with particular ferocity in this city as well as in academic exile circles across the country. 
 After weeks of heated arguments, a distinct split has emerged. A majority oppose any military attack, convinced that it would only cement the mullahs in power and repeat the chaos in Iraq on a far bloodier scale. Some people in this group push a more subtle approach that they hope will collapse the government from within, while fretting aloud that subtle diplomacy has become something of a lost art in Washington. 
 ''The Iranians see the failure of the Bush government in Iraq, so they can see for themselves that this is not the solution,'' said Homa Sarshar, a freelance journalist and the founder of a center that collects oral histories of Iran's once thriving Jewish community. ''Trying to promote democracy would be better than spending money on an invasion or another war.''
 Some Iranian exiles relish the thought of any military attack. But they tend to be those who lost property in the revolution or aging members of the ancien regime who describe themselves without irony as de Gaulles awaiting a triumphant return. 
 The exile community of at least 500,000 has carved out a distinctive subculture here. At the Encino Town Center, two of six movie screens show Iranian movies, while young adults pack a nearby cafe, called the Spot in English and Buddies in Persian, smoking water pipes long into the night.
 ''Regime change would make an attack unnecessary, but I'm not sure there is time to organize an effective nationwide opposition to this regime in such a short period,'' said Faryar Nikbakht, a businessman shopping at the Ketab Bookshop. American hostility toward the mullahs means that Iran is one of the few countries in the Muslim world where many in the general population like the United States. Some exiles say an attack would most likely destroy this support. 
 ''The place that the Americans hold in the minds of the Iranians right now couldn't be bought with millions of dollars of propaganda,'' said Shahram Homayoun, an Iranian journalist who runs Channel 1 television, one of about 25 satellite stations beamed toward Iran, from above a dentist's office. 
 Mr. Homayoun, like many exiles, imagines treating Iran rather like South Africa in the apartheid fight, banning it from all international organizations, embargoing its sports teams, barring its officials from traveling in the West and seizing the rulers' assets abroad. 
 Those exiles would even like to see Iranian oil embargoed, an extremely unlikely prospect in view of prices for crude oil.
 The nuclear crisis has prompted many exiles to urge Washington to work harder to harness Iranians' widespread frustrations so they will force their government to change. The exile critics reject the Iraq model of trying to forge sidelined exiles into a government.
 Reza Pahlavi, the 45-year-old son of the deposed shah, commands little more than nostalgia. The best organized opposition group, the People's Mujahedeen, garners some support in the United States Congress but is seen by many Iranians as an Islamic-Marxist cult. 
 The intellectual heart of those pushing for change from within is the Hoover Institution at Stanford, where Prof. Abbas Milani, head of the Iranian studies program, along with Michael McFaul and Larry Diamond, experts on the collapse of Communism and building democracies, direct the Iran Democracy Project. They want a new United States foreign policy built around engaging Tehran, with just enough diplomatic relations to create a platform to support the beleaguered reform movement in the country. 
 ''The more they beat the drums of war here, the more Ahmadinejad can shut down the democratic movement,'' Professor Milani said, referring to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
 He proposes forceful speeches by American leaders that repeatedly call for democracy in Iran and the lifting of most United States economic sanctions so that the government can no longer blame them for its disastrous economic policies.
 He also wants independent radio and television stations dedicated to beaming serious news and discussion into Iran. Other means of influence would include establishing some American diplomatic presence in Tehran, much like the interests section in Havana, basically used to speak out in support of dissidents. 
 Supporters of the Iran Democracy Project say the United States, by playing the role of a distant, yet supportive and vocal uncle, could galvanize the younger generation in Iran to widen the fissures in the government and change the country.
 More than 60 percent of the 70 million Iranians are younger than 35, and they often seethe at the lack of economic opportunity and personal freedom.
 ''I think the youth of Iran will do that job,'' said Hamid R. Moghadam, 49, an Iranian-American businessman in San Francisco who helps finance the Iran Democracy Project. ''You don't need the Marines in there.''

HEADLINE: Orphans Of The Storm

BYLINE: By Irwin Redlener. 
Irwin Redlener is the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia and the president of the Children's Health Fund.

 BODY:
IF you thought that the government's response to last year's Hurricane Katrina was a shocking display of mismanagement and incompetence, you should see what's happening to the displaced children of families now trapped in FEMA's trailer parks and other shelters. 
 Hurricane Katrina and the floods that followed destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes, forcing out more than one million people. Some families have found housing and jobs in communities that could accommodate the influx, but a far bleaker reality faces the rest.
FEMA has not released exact numbers, but school officials estimate that displaced children from Louisiana alone number more than 125,000. Most of their families were living in poverty before the hurricane. Now they subsist in tiny trailers, hastily assembled by the government in remote fields with few dependable services, little access to community resources and no sense of when they will be able to return to some version of normal life. 
 Several recent studies, including one by Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health and the Children's Health Fund, reveal that unmet health care needs among these displaced families are far worse than any of us imagined.
 One in three children in FEMA-subsidized shelters has at least one chronic illness like asthma requiring medical care. Half of the children who had access to medical care before the storm no longer do. And although nearly half the parents in the shelters report that their children exhibit symptoms of emotional or behavioral disorders, the evaluation and treatment they urgently need is almost impossible to secure. 
 Health isn't the only problem for those languishing in FEMA shelters. Nearly one in four school-age children is either not enrolled in school or misses 10 days of class every month. Many who do attend school in their temporary host communities find the classrooms overcrowded, the staff exhausted and stress levels unbearably high. 
 Thanks to the hard work of local officials and Congressional delegations from the affected states, billions of dollars will be available to repair levees, rebuild communities and re-establish the economy of the Gulf Coast. But this will take years, far too long for the children who are now suffering and waiting in FEMA's shelters. They urgently require an emergency relief package that directly addresses their most pressing health care needs. 
 For $100 million -- a small fraction of the billions allocated for reconstruction -- the government could support a force of at least 200 pediatricians and family doctors, 100 specially trained mental health workers, 25 mobile medical units and a much strengthened school-based health care network throughout the gulf region. It could also put vital health care information in a computer database and set up virtual access to medical centers for children who can't get to specialists' offices.
 We are watching the worst children's health crisis in modern American history unfold in the gulf area. After the trauma of Hurricane Katrina, this secondary disaster -- again under the auspices of the United States Department of Homeland Security -- may have far more serious consequences. Thousands of children are now seemingly abandoned by a federal government still unable to function effectively when it counts the most.

HEADLINE: Chief Calls Deal a Dream For Wachovia

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
Like other banking executives these days, Wachovia's chief executive, Kenneth Thompson, has been doing some California dreaming. 
 He realized those ambitions late Sunday, when he announced that his bank would acquire the Golden West Financial Corporation, a giant in the California mortgage business, in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $25.5 billion.
''This is a dream come true,'' Mr. Thompson said yesterday. Mr. Thompson's dreams, however, are the stuff of some investors' nightmares. 
 Worried that California's red-hot housing market is poised to cool, investors drummed down Wachovia's stock 6.7 percent yesterday.
 ''Golden West might be the best- run thrift in the country,'' said Christopher Whalen, a managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics, ''but it looks like Wachovia is buying it in a speculative bubble and that makes me nervous. I think Wachovia wanted to take this off the table before J. P. Morgan or anyone else could buy it, but I wonder whether they are going to regret this later on.''
 From Mr. Thompson's perspective, the deal with Golden West -- the nation's second-biggest savings and loan behind Washington Mutual -- finally gets him a platform to offer banking services in California, one of the fastest-growing economies in the country. The deal also greatly expands Wachovia's mortgage-lending business -- all for about a 15 percent premium over Golden West's closing stock price on Friday. 
 ''This is an incredible franchise that we're buying for a 15 percent premium,'' Mr. Thompson said.
 Wall Street analysts, however, worried about Golden West's prominence in the option adjustable-rate mortgage, a loan it has marketed for more than two decades. Indeed, 99 percent of Golden West's $122 billion loan portfolio is made up of option A.R.M.'s.
 ''They are really a single-product-focused company and have been since the early 1980's,'' said Fred Cannon, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
 These loans have been marketed aggressively in recent years by Golden West and others as a way to make home-buying more affordable for lower-income consumers or speculators in the housing market.
 Option A.R.M.'s let borrowers effectively choose how much they want to pay each month. More and more borrowers have been choosing to pay the minimum or pay only the interest on the loans, ignoring the principal altogether. 
 Regulators, however, are worried that lenders have lowered underwriting standards to continue to push the product into the mainstream audience and, worse yet, that borrowers will be shocked when the rates on their mortgages suddenly reset and their payments surge. 
 Even Mr. Thompson has mentioned the growing risk in this business, pointedly telling investors at a financial services conference in New York last fall that Wachovia did not offer option A.R.M. loans. 
 Yesterday in a telephone interview, Mr. Thompson said his comments reflected the risk in the option A.R.M. market over all, but that he was ''won over'' by the quality of the loans in Golden West's portfolio. 
 The co-chief executives who have been at the top of Golden West for more than 40 years, Herb M. and Marion O. Sandler, both in their 70's, said they pursued a merger with Wachovia because they recognized that Golden West's growth would eventually slow because of its concentration in one type of loan.
 ''We thought that we needed to have a much fuller product line,'' Ms. Sandler said.
 Saying she was ''surprised'' by the market's sour reaction to the deal, Ms. Sandler said she and her husband were aware of the problem of unsophisticated consumers being sold option A.R.M. loans and had made it a practice to sell such loans only to people who were appropriate customers for them. 
 ''But we have been offering this product for over 20 years and we have a pristine portfolio,'' she added. ''We have a real great advantage with this product because we know how to sell it and we know how to service it and we are not at all concerned about the risks in the portfolio.'' 
 Golden West has survived numerous housing cycles and other periods of general financial stress, including the savings and loan crisis of the 1980's, but it did take its share of lumps in the mid-1990's, said Richard X. Bove, an analyst with Punk, Ziegel & Company. ''There's no indication that this thrift has the ability to avoid developments altogether in the housing market,'' he said.
 Ms. Sandler also took issue with critics who said she and her husband were merely ''cashing out'' or selling their company at the top amid expectations that the housing market in California is in a downturn. 
 ''We were not out shopping the company around saying, 'Oh boy, we have to get out,'' said Ms. Sandler, who added that there was a succession plan in place at the company. ''We were not panicked and said, 'let's find a sucker out there who's stupid enough to buy us. ' '' 
 Rather than receiving a large severance package, Ms. Sandler said, she and her husband would profit only from the sale of their shares -- which, at 10 percent of the company's stock, are valued about $2.6 billion under the terms of the deal. 
 Shares of Golden West rose 6.2 percent yesterday, to $74.90. Under the deal, Golden West shareholders are receiving 1.051 shares of Wachovia stock and $18.65 in cash for each share. Merrill Lynch, Wachovia Securities and the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell advised Wachovia, while Lehman Brothers and the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz represented Golden West.
 While the Sandlers did not sign an employment agreement with Wachovia to help in the transition, Ms. Sandler said they planned to stick around for a while. ''I will stay with this company and I will do what needs to be done to make this merger a success,'' she said.

 When Fed policy makers meet on Wednesday to set overnight interest rates, they will almost certainly increase them by another quarter-point, to 5 percent. And investors will search for any clues about a pause in further rate increases.
 But a growing number of economists are looking at a different possibility: that changes in the global economy could keep pushing up long-term interest rates long after the Fed stops raising its benchmark rate. 
 The result would be a mirror image of the ''conundrum'' that perplexed Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, all last year. The conundrum was that long-term interest rates remained low and overall credit conditions relatively easy even as the Fed raised short-term rates.
 Now, even as Fed bankers indicate that they may be near the end of their increases, the long-term interest rates that determine home mortgage rates and companies' borrowing costs have crept higher.
 Increased anxiety about future inflation has been partly to blame, analysts say. But long-term rates have edged up around the world, suggesting that global forces are at work. 
 Japan, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, is growing faster than it has in more than a decade, and the nation's central bank, which has kept interest rates negligible, is expected to start raising them again. European growth, though rising more slowly than in the United States, is accelerating, and the European Central Bank, after pausing in April, is expected by many to resume increases. Its benchmark short-term rate, at 2.5 percent, has been raised twice since December.
 Meantime, China's economy surged by nearly 10 percent last year, and Chinese leaders promise to spur the kind of domestic demand that would keep more money at home.
 Higher growth leads to more competition for investment capital, which tends to drive up interest rates. And as rates rise in foreign countries, there is less incentive to seek higher returns in the United States. 
 That could pose a challenge for Ben S. Bernanke, who took over as Fed chairman in February. Mr. Bernanke has argued that the combination of low interest rates and the United States' expanding trade deficit stemmed in part from a ''global savings glut'' -- a vast pool of idle money in Asia and other parts of the world that found its way back into the United States.
 As Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig, sees matters: ''It looks increasingly obvious that there is a boom on the globe today; it's just not happening here. That in turn would suggest that the moderating activity here in the United States may not elicit lower interest rates. What was a conundrum for Greenspan then becomes a problem for Bernanke.''
 Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States economist at Citigroup, said that speculation about the changing global demand for money had helped feed a run-up in long-term rates.
 ''I think people are speculating about this, speculating that growth rates may converge, that savings will come more into balance and that there is going to be a draw on capital that's going to suck money out of the United States,'' Mr. DiClemente said.
 To be sure, part of the recent rise in long-term interest rates reflects worries about inflation. 
 One proxy for inflation worries is the gap between yields on conventional Treasury debt and the yields on inflation-adjusted Treasury securities, or TIPS. 
 That gap widened last month to 2.8 percentage points, from 2.7 points, and much of the widening occurred after Mr. Bernanke told lawmakers that the Fed might temporarily stop its rate increases.
 Recent economic data about inflation has been mixed. Overall consumer prices have climbed markedly, largely because of oil prices; the Fed's preferred gauge of core inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, is up about 2 percent over the last 12 months. 
 That is about the upper limit of what Mr. Bernanke has described as his comfort zone for inflation. Meanwhile, growth in the United States was much faster in the first quarter than most economists had expected. And while job creation slowed to 138,000 in April, unemployment was only 4.7 percent and hourly wages climbed 3.8 percent over the last year -- the biggest jump in five years.
 But many analysts say the inflation outlook remains fairly tame. Nonfarm productivity, the amount of output for each hour of work, rose at an annual pace of 3.2 percent in the first three months of 2006. 
 Higher energy prices seem to have had little impact on other consumer prices, and corporate profits are so high that many companies can absorb higher wages without raising prices.
 The view of Fed officials that they are near the end of their rate-raising efforts is predicated on the expectation that the nation's growth will slow from an annual pace of 4.8 percent in the first quarter to about 3 percent in the second half of 2006. But even if the Fed is sanguine about inflation, global forces could push up borrowing costs. 
 An increase in global interest rates would not necessarily be bad news for Mr. Bernanke. Higher long-term rates would help cool down American economic growth, and the housing market in particular, without requiring the Fed to take more action on its own. 
 But higher global rates could also slow the United States economy enough to increase unemployment.
 Either way, analysts said, the economy is more dependent on global forces than was true a decade ago. 
 ''It is more exposed because of the fact that it needs massive amounts of cash from the rest of the world,'' said Nigel Gault, senior economist at Global Insight, a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass. ''In a strange way, the world is riskier for the United States if everyone else is doing better.''

HEADLINE: As Cuba Plans Offshore Wells, Some Want U.S. to Follow Suit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8 

 BODY:
In 1977, the United States and Cuba signed a treaty that evenly divided the Florida Straits to preserve each country's economic rights. They included access to vast underwater oil and gas fields on both sides of the line.
 Now, with energy costs soaring, plans are under way to drill this year -- but all on the Cuban side.
With only modest energy needs and no ability of its own to drill, Cuba has negotiated lease agreements with China and other energy-hungry countries to extract resources for themselves and for Cuba. 
 Cuba's drilling plans have been in place for several years, but now that China, India and others are involved and fuel prices are unusually high, a growing number of lawmakers and business leaders in the United States are starting to complain. They argue that the United States' decades-old ban against drilling in coastal waters is driving up domestic energy costs and, in this case, is giving two of America's chief economic competitors access to energy at the United States' expense. 
 ''This is the irony of ironies,'' Charles T. Drevna, executive vice president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, said of Cuba's collaboration with China and India. ''We have chosen to lock up our resources and stand by to be spectators while these two come in and benefit from things right in our own backyard.''
 The United States Geological Survey estimates that the energy field on Cuba's side alone may have 4.6 billion barrels of oil and 9.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. That much energy is equivalent to just a few months of the United States' total energy consumption.
 The survey does not specify how much of an energy reserve is on the United States' side of the Florida Straits, just north of Cuba. But almost all of the country's Outer Continental Shelf, waters within 200 miles of shorelines, has been off limits to drilling since the early 1980's because of Congressional bans and executive orders.
 President Bush, who renewed the 1977 treaty last December for two years, has cited China's growing demand for oil and international efforts to obtain it as prime reasons for high gasoline prices. The latest version of the administration's national security strategy, issued in March, warned that China's leaders were ''acting as if they can somehow 'lock up' energy supplies around the world.''
 To Mr. Drevna and others who are lobbying Congress to end the prohibition, energy exploration in coastal waters represents a strong step toward energy independence and lower prices.
 The Interior Department estimates that the Outer Continental Shelf has more than 115 billion barrels of oil and 633 trillion cubic feet of natural gas available for extraction. At current levels of consumption, that would satisfy the nation's oil needs for about 16 years and its natural gas needs for about 25 years. 
 Opponents of drilling in United States waters are equally passionate in their arguments, saying that drilling for oil off the coast poses environmental risks and that drilling for finite supplies undermines long-term conservation solutions. They also say modest supplies of additional oil would not necessarily lower gasoline prices in the United States because oil is traded on a world market.
 But drilling proponents say the time has come to end the bans, especially with plans by China and India to capture oil and gas so close to the United States shoreline.
 ''My fear is for the future of America,'' said Representative John E. Peterson, Republican of Pennsylvania, who has collected more than 160 co-sponsors for a bipartisan bill that would open coastal waters for development of natural gas. ''We have a natural gas crisis, and it's the biggest threat we have to the American economy.''
 Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho, took narrow aim at the activities planned for the Florida Straits and recently complained on the Senate floor, ''Red China should not be left to drill for oil within spitting distance of our shores without competition from U.S. industries.''
 Cuba has divided its side of the Florida Straits into 59 lease areas. As of the end of February, foreign countries had secured the rights or were negotiating the rights to 16 of them, according to Cuban government documents provided by the Cuban Interests Section in Washington.
 Kirby Jones, founder and president of the U.S. Cuba Trade Association, a group that promotes United States business interests in Cuba, said Cuba had signed agreements with companies from China, India, Spain and Canada. 
 At a recent trade conference in Mexico City arranged by Mr. Jones, Cuban officials invited American oil companies to bid for the other leases on the Cuban side of the Florida Straits even though drilling in Cuban waters would violate the United States' longstanding trade embargo against Cuba.
 The purpose, Mr. Jones said, ''was to let the American oil executives know what is happening in Cuba.''
 United States oil companies would have a right to bid for Cuban leases under legislation Mr. Craig is drafting. Dan Whiting, his spokesman, said the measure would seek an exemption like the one created several years ago for United States companies to sell food and medicine to Cuba. But an exemption for drilling seems uncertain, given the large number of lawmakers staunchly opposed to any economic relationship with Cuba as long as Fidel Castro is president.
 Mr. Craig's measure would be one of several Senate bills aimed at drilling in coastal waters. Two pending measures would approve operations in a small tract of the Gulf of Mexico, one of the few coastal areas where drilling is allowed. And a measure introduced two weeks ago by Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, who opposes drilling within 150 miles of Florida's coastline, would block renewal of the 1977 treaty and then deny foreign companies access to United States markets if they continued to drill in waters close to Cuba.
 Mr. Peterson said his bill focused only on natural gas because of its importance to the American manufacturing industry, particularly chemical companies, which spend huge amounts on natural gas to make their products.
 The average price of a gallon of gasoline has increased by 126 percent since early 2000, to a current average of $2.96 per gallon, according to the Energy Information Administration. Natural gas prices have jumped by 152 percent in the same period, to $6.56 per thousand cubic feet. It is a rate the National Association of Manufacturers says has contributed to the loss of more than 3.1 million jobs since 2000 through plant closings and relocations offshore.
 Mr. Peterson's bill is one of several proposing to open coastal waters that House lawmakers are expected to consider before long. Brian Kennedy, a spokesman for Representative Richard W. Pombo, Republican of California and chairman of the House Resources Committee, said Mr. Pombo planned to introduce a bill that would give states control of the first 125 miles of waters beyond their shorelines.
 Last week, American business executives visited lawmakers on Capitol Hill to lobby for any change in policy that would open up coastal waters, particularly those near Cuba.
 ''It's such an easy fix,'' said John Paro, president and chief executive of the CPH Holding Corporation, a chemical company in Chicago. ''We have the supply, and it's close. I just wish the public would recognize how easy this problem is to deal with.''

HEADLINE: Iranian Writes to Bush; No R.S.V.P. Is Likely 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 8 

 BODY:
In a diplomatic overture that was immediately dismissed by the United States, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran sent a lengthy letter to President Bush over the weekend offering what an Iranian spokesman called ''new ways'' to resolve the crisis over Iran's nuclear program.
 The letter, described in Tehran as the first direct communication from an Iranian leader to an American president since 1979, was said by the spokesman to analyze ''the roots of the problems'' with the West. But American officials said it was a meandering screed that proposed no solutions to the nuclear issue. 
''This letter isn't it,'' Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in an interview with The Associated Press in New York. ''This letter is not the place that one would find an opening to engage on the nuclear issue or anything of the sort. It isn't addressing the issues that we're dealing with in a concrete way.'' 
 American officials said the letter, which was not released, was 16 pages in Persian and 18 pages in an English translation that Iran had provided. The officials said the letter had offered a philosophical, historical and religious analysis of Iran's relationship to the West, and asked questions about the cost to the world of the establishment of Israel, while another section asserted that Western-style democracy had failed humanity.
 Some American officials said the letter appeared to be aimed at disrupting talks on Iran among top envoys of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. The United States ambassador to the United Nations, John R. Bolton, suggested that Iran was throwing ''sand in the eyes'' of diplomats.
 The officials were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the letter. 
 Ms. Rice met Monday with her counterparts from five countries at a dinner to discuss Iran, but the indications were that the United States and the Europeans remained at odds with Russia and China.
 She is to address the Security Council on Tuesday on American recommendations to carry out the accord to end the war in Sudan.
 Another urgent matter on her agenda was the Middle East, where there appeared to be a growing difference of views between the Bush administration and some European allies. European officials say they are increasingly worried about the freeze on payments to the Hamas-led Palestinian government, which is causing shortages of medicines and blocking salaries for civil servants.
 Last month President Jacques Chirac of France urged President Bush to join a trust fund administered by the World Bank to pay the salaries, circumventing the leaders of Hamas, which won parliamentary elections earlier this year.
 The United States is arguing that European, Arab and American donations must not support a government led by a party that refuses to recognize Israel and that condones or even carries out attacks on Israelis.
 Ms. Rice is to meet Tuesday with Russian, United Nations and European envoys on Hamas, and the meeting may prove contentious. Iran was the focus of a separate disagreement between the United States and France on the issue of a proposed resolution on Lebanon. France wants the resolution to focus on getting Syria to recognize Lebanon and stop interfering in its affairs. The Bush administration wants the resolution to rebuke Iran as well for interfering in Lebanon.
 By all accounts, the most pressing matter before the United States at the United Nations is Iran. As always, the West is trying to get Iran to stop certain nuclear activities it believes to be a front for making weapons. Iran argues that it has a right to carry out these activities, which it says are for civilian nuclear energy. 
 Britain and France have proposed a resolution demanding that Iran comply with requests from the Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency to suspend its enrichment of uranium, end construction of a heavy-water reactor and negotiate the future of its nuclear program.
 Their draft resolution would invoke Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, implying that a failure by Iran could lead to further Council action, including economic penalties. Russia and China oppose invoking the chapter, fearing that the West would be paving the way for economic or even military actions.
 Russia has led the opposition to a tough resolution on Iran, but on Monday the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, Wang Guangya, said that because Chapter 7 ''is about enforcement measures,'' it is inappropriate at the present. 
 American and European officials say the choice is whether to push a resolution through under Chapter 7, and hope Russia and China do not veto it, or to water down the resolution to get Russian and Chinese support.
 Mr. Bolton said Russia and China could come up with alternative language that would also imply that the demand by the Council was ''mandatory'' for Iran. But he said no such language had been submitted.
 Some European diplomats argue that it is more important to get a unanimously supported resolution than a strong one backed by only some Council members. In effect, they say, a mixed signal is worse than a weak but unanimous signal.
 Complicating matters is the tense state of relations with Russia right now. Vice President Dick Cheney may have damaged the chances of getting Russian help on Iran because he has recently assailed Russian policies as antidemocratic and said Russia was trying to use energy as a political weapon.

HEADLINE: After Shootout, Palestinians Try to Calm Infighting

BYLINE: By GREG MYRE

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 8 

 BODY:
The main Palestinian political parties, Hamas and Fatah, sought to reduce tensions on Monday after a predawn shootout in the southern Gaza Strip left three of their members dead and 10 people wounded in the worst internal Palestinian violence since the Hamas-led government came to power. 
 Members of the two factions have battled periodically since the militant Islamic group Hamas won the Palestinian elections in January, ending decades of political dominance by Fatah, the party of the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas. But the clash on Monday was the most heated so far.
The Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya, a leader of Hamas, said he had ''issued necessary measures to end the bloodshed and tension.'' 
 Fatah leaders, including Azzam al-Ahmad, who leads the faction in Parliament, called for calm.
 On Saturday, Mr. Abbas and Mr. Haniya met in Gaza City, and the two were expected to hold further talks on the friction between their rival parties and the worsening Palestinian financial crisis.
 Each side blamed the other for the trouble that began before dawn on Monday. Fatah gunmen kidnapped several members of Hamas in a farming village outside Khan Yunis in southern Gaza, Hamas officials said. At about the same time, Hamas members kidnapped several Fatah men. Gun battles broke out soon after, with Hamas members firing an antitank rocket at Fatah gunmen in a jeep, according to witnesses and the Palestinian security forces.
 When the shooting ended around daybreak, two Fatah members and one Hamas member were dead. Most of the wounded were civilians who had been caught in the crossfire, Palestinian security officials said.
 In the West Bank city of Ramallah on Monday, the offices of the Palestinian Parliament caught on fire, forcing an evacuation of the building. The blaze was apparently caused by an electrical problem, officials said, and no one was injured.
 Meanwhile, a World Bank report issued Monday said that international aid to the Palestinian Authority had dropped more sharply than anticipated, and that 2006 may become ''the worst year in the West Bank and Gaza's dismal recent economic history.''
 The Palestinians have depended heavily on foreign aid, which has totaled about $1 billion annually in recent years. But since Hamas came to power in March, the United States, the European Union and Israel have all suspended direct payments to the Palestinian Authority.
 The World Bank report warned that the Palestinian Authority's continued inability to pay government salaries ''could precipitate breakdowns in discipline among the Palestinian security forces, making it difficult for government, commerce and relief efforts to operate.''
 ''Complex structures such as school systems are not machines to be switched on and off at will,'' the report added.
 In a letter to the so-called quartet of international peace mediators -- the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia -- Mr. Abbas called Monday for international aid to resume.

HEADLINE: Infants Dying for Lack of Basics, Report Says

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
More than four million newborns worldwide die each year in their first month of life, comparable to the number of babies born in the United States annually, Save the Children reported Monday. 
 Many of those infants could be saved with simple, inexpensive items, like sterile blades to cut the umbilical cord, antibiotics for pneumonia and knit caps to keep them warm, the group said in ''State of the World's Mothers 2006,'' a new report. Ninety-nine percent of newborn deaths are in developing countries, where such items are often not widely available.
 The deadliest time for children is in the hours after birth, and the deadliest places are the poorest corners of world. South Asia and Africa have the highest rates of newborn deaths, Save the Children said. ''The first day of life is the most dangerous day a human being has,'' said Charles MacCormack, president of Save the Children.
 While many countries have significantly lowered mortality rates for children younger than 5 in recent decades, the group said, little progress has been made globally in preventing the deaths of newborns and their mothers.
 But researchers for Save the Children, a nonprofit group that works in more than 40 countries, found that some developing countries that have made newborn and maternal health a priority -- among them Indonesia, Eritrea, Nicaragua and the Philippines -- have succeeded in cutting newborn death rates.
 Countries that are performing worse than expected compared with nations at similar levels of wealth include Angola, Ivory Coast, Mali, Pakistan and Sierra Leone. 
 In the United States, 4.7 newborns die of every 1,000 born, compared with 12 per thousand in Vietnam, the developing country with the lowest rate, and 65 per 1,000 in Liberia, which has the highest rate.
 ''Three out of four newborn deaths could be avoided with simple, low-cost tools that already exist,'' Melinda Gates wrote in an introduction to the report. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has given $110 million to support Save the Children's work to reduce newborn and maternal mortality.
 President Bush's budget for the 2007 fiscal year proposes spending $323 million on maternal and child health programs in the United States Agency for International Development, less than the $356 million Congress appropriated last year. Save the Children is supporting a House bill that would instead increase financing. Mr. MacCormack said the amount of such aid had been flat through the past three administrations.
 While the Bush administration's proposed budget would reduce spending for such programs within the aid agency, administration officials note that it would sharply increase spending on AIDS and malaria, afflictions that kill hundreds of thousands of babies and children, particularly in Africa.
 Successful countries have made it a priority to provide prenatal care, birth attendants and immunization programs to prevent tetanus in newborns and mothers, the report said. Parents also must be educated about the importance of breast-feeding from the very start, the group recommended, and not introduce other liquids that contain dirty water and can cause diarrhea, often deadly to a weakened newborn.
 Another way to reduce deaths is to give women access to modern contraceptives, the group said. Birth control, it said, allows enough time between births to preserve the mother's health and reduce the likelihood that their babies are born with low birth weights.

HEADLINE: Scary Birds Are Back, This Time With Flu

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
It is comforting to know that even in a global pandemic of flu, the French can be faulted. 
 ''Fatal Contact: Bird Flu in America,'' a made-for-television movie tonight on ABC, imagines what could happen if bird flu mutated into a virus that was transmitted easily from human to human: millions die, the economy collapses, people riot, and there is almost nothing to be done.
France is the first country to develop a vaccine, but its leaders refuse to share the patent; finally, after the international community threatens sanctions, the French surrender. However gratifying, that fantasy is one of the sillier conjectures in the film. France would have no reason to prevent other countries from reproducing the vaccine, and even if it did, nearly all countries have laws that allow them to violate patents in emergencies. 
 Most of the film's other assumptions are grim but not preposterous. Its worst-case scenario led flu experts to express concern that the film was sensationalist and could needlessly panic viewers. But ''Fatal Contact'' is not harebrained science fiction. As many as 50 million people died in the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic. There are plenty of experts who say that the strain of avian flu known as A(H5N1) could mutate and spread efficiently among humans. In real life, scientists have said publicly what one movie epidemiologist says to another after the first human case is diagnosed: ''It's not a question of if, but when.'' 
 ''Fatal Contact'' is a May sweeps movie, not a public service message, so it is hardly surprising that it errs on the side of Armageddon, but that does not mean it is irresponsible. It is a soberly and compellingly told tall tale, and quite alarming. 
 At the very least, ABC's disaster movie will encourage viewers to wash their hands more often. 
 The film begins with a flock of migrating geese in flight, their wings flapping to ominous Hitchcockian music. (This is not your parents' ''Birds.'') The film then locks on to a handful of central characters whose entwined experiences define and track the pandemic. Some survivors are more resilient than others, but most overcome despair and rise to the occasion. 
 An American businessman flies to Hong Kong. In Guangdong Province in southern China, soldiers storm an outdoor market, forcibly confiscating chickens from terrified peasants. The American visitor negotiates production rates with a manager on a factory floor; a worker on the assembly line coughs. By the time the American is relaxing on the long flight home, his germs are spreading from paper napkin to martini olive to sleeve.
 He dies not long after he returns to his wife and children in Richmond, Va., and becomes patient zero in a public health emergency so vast that no federal agency, state or community is even remotely prepared to handle it.
 Meanwhile, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the country's top epidemiologist, Dr. Iris Varnack (Joely Richardson), is in a black slip, smoking a post-coital cigarette and warning her lover not to expect much follow-up. ''I'm better in small doses,'' she tells him.
 The sex and tobacco are sweeps red herrings, however: once her pager goes off, Dr. Varnack is on her way to China to check out reports of human-to-human transmission of the avian flu. By the time she is summoned to Washington by the secretary of health and human services, Collin Reed (Stacy Keach), she has no good news to share. 
 ''We believe the ultimate global loss of lives could reach as high as 150 or 350 million,'' she says.
 From then on, the film ticks off an exponential death toll. By Week 2, 157 have died worldwide. By Week 12, the number reaches 12.5 million.
 The long and lean Ms. Richardson (''Nip/Tuck'') looks terrific in a white hazmat suit, but her low-key, almost blank affect is a bit odd for the role. The stilted dialogue does not help. ''There's going to be a long and brutal ordeal that will rip apart the fabric of society,'' she warns. Dr. Varnack is on the front line of the worst crisis of the 21st century, but most of the time she seems stoned.
 The governor of Virginia, Mike Newsome (Scott Cohen), decides he wants to be ''proactive'' and puts endangered neighborhoods in quarantine and barricades his staff and family in a guarded, bio-secure location that Dr. Varnack dismisses as a ''fortress of solitude.''
 In New York a nurse named Alma Ansen (Justina Machado) finds herself overwhelmed working at a makeshift flu center consisting of tents erected at the bottom of a subway station. Her husband, Curtis (David Ramsey), a National Guardsman, is redeployed to New York from Iraq to maintain order in the panic-stricken city. In Richmond Denise Connelly (Ann Cusack), the widow of patient zero, becomes a community organizer, helping stranded neighbors find scarce help and provisions.
 In the early days grocers scandalously increase prices: a pound of coffee sells for $19. Within a few weeks supermarket aisles are as barren as Russian stores in Soviet times.
 ''Fatal Contact'' is not very elegantly filmed, but some scenes cannot help being striking: one night Governor Newsome sees garbage trucks dump piles of bodies, wrapped in plastic bags, into a giant landfill. 
 Ordinary American citizens rally, but ''Fatal Contact'' does not have a Disney ending. Just as the pandemic is beginning to slow in the United States, Dr. Varnack is summoned to Angola to track a new and even more lethal strain of bird flu. 
 Influenza comes in waves; disaster movies aim for sequels.

HEADLINE: A Science Advocate and 'an Endangered Species,' He Bids Farewell

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On the walls of the Capitol Hill office of Representative Sherwood Boehlert are framed copies of laws he has helped shepherd through the legislative process -- the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, the NASA Authorization Act of 2005, the Nanotechnology Act of 2003. 
 In 24 years in Congress, Mr. Boehlert, a Republican from Utica, N.Y., who is chairman of the House Committee on Science, has been a strong advocate for science and the environment. As such, he has sometimes found himself at odds in Washington with the leadership of his own party.
 ''This is a town,'' he said, ''where everyone says they are for science-based decision making -- until the science leads to a politically inconvenient conclusion. And then they want to go to Plan B.''
 In March, Mr. Boehlert announced he would not run again.

Q. In all your years in Congress, can you recall a time when science issues were as politicized as they are today?

A. Making science political is just a part of the current times. And I've never seen a time on Capitol Hill when there has been as much partisanship as there is right now. The tolerance level is at an all-time low. 
 It's not just about science. But guess what: the good news is that people are finally talking about science. There didn't used to be many conversations about science. That's healthy.

Q. Is partisanship part of the reason you will retire after this year?

A. It's a combination of factors. I certainly don't like the fact that partisanship is more intensive than ever. But I thought long and hard about this. It's just time for me.
 I don't like, week after week, flying back and forth, sometimes getting up at 4 in the morning. I went through a triple bypass two years ago. I don't want to go on here forever. I don't want to be carried out on a stretcher or in a box. I'll be 70 in September. Even a Duracell battery wears down.

Q. You're considered a moderate Republican. Does it sadden you that you're often described as one of the last of a breed?

A. It makes me sad to think that people speculate that my kind of public official is an endangered species.
 When I was a kid at Utica College, my governor was Nelson Rockefeller and my senators were Kenneth Keating and Jacob Javits, all progressive Republicans. And they taught me very early that government was about improving the lot of others. 
 I remember Nelson Rockefeller had a campaign poster: ''If fish could vote, they'd vote for Nelson Rockefeller.'' That was because he was so sensitive to the environment. And I've long felt that Republicans shouldn't cede the issue of the environment to the other party.

Q. What would you say have been your most important legislative accomplishments?

A. I'm proud of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which helped launch the war on acid rain. That's on the plus side of the ledger. On the negative side, much of what we have accomplished has been damage prevention.
 In 1995, for instance, after Newt Gingrich became speaker, there was this feeling that there'd been too much government regulation. There were 17 ''riders from hell'' in the E.P.A. appropriations bill that, in one form or another, were going to damage existing environmental regulations. I led opposition to that. And we defeated all 17.

Q. Your main legislative effort has been a measure to mandate an increase in fuel efficiency standards on new cars -- corporate average fuel economy standard, the so-called CAFE standards. That's never passed. Why?

A. Well, we've tried, three times over six years. Each time, we get closer. Last October, when another energy bill came to the floor, I tried again by offering an amendment.
 I went to the Rules Committee, and the Republican leadership said: ''Look, you already had a vote on this in this Congress. What's changed?'' 
 I said, ''Hurricane Katrina and $3-a-gallon gasoline.'' They did not allow the House to consider my amendment because they took an unofficial count and discovered it might pass.
 For years, I've been trying to get the message out: we can do something about the gasoline supply by increasing fuel efficiency in cars.

Q. You must have been astonished to hear recently that President Bush, in response to rising gas prices, is asking Congress for the authority to impose higher CAFE standards on passenger cars.

A. Not at all.
 Hope springs eternal. You know, I've been in President Bush's company several times recently, and I've never missed the opportunity to bring up CAFE standards. 
 Just last week, I met with Jim Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and suggested that at the upcoming meeting between the president and the heads of the Big 3 auto companies, CAFE standards be an agenda item. He indicated it would be part of the discussion.
 Later, I received a copy of a letter from the secretary of transportation, Norman Mineta, to leaders in the House and Senate. It was somewhat ambiguous, but it suggested that we have to have CAFE standards. How the administration deals with it and how I might are likely to be different. But we're beginning to close the gap. 

Q. The president also made a renewed call for oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Why does that idea surface every time there's a fuel price rise?

A. It's not a very good idea. You'd get more fuel savings sooner with my proposed increase in CAFE standards than you would get if you drilled in ANWR -- and that's if the most optimistic projections of economic recoverable oil from there are accurate.
 This keeps coming up because the Alaskan representatives in the House and Senate keep pushing it. They're influential. 
 Every one of their constituents stands to benefit economically from that. If you live in Alaska, a family of four gets about $10,000 in oil royalties per year. If you drill in ANWR, they'll get more.

Q. If your party maintains control of the House in November, your successor as chairman of the Committee on Science will most likely be Ralph Hall of Texas, described on his own Web site as ''an ardent supporter of legislation benefiting the oil and gas industry.'' How would his leadership differ from yours?

A. He is the heir apparent because he is the most senior member -- and a highly respected member. But there's no guarantee that the most senior member will get it.
 You know, Ralph Hall has a great wit. He says that I've never seen a tree I didn't want to hug, and he's never seen a cemetery that he didn't want to drill in. 
 We are dramatically different in many respects. But he is a supporter of federal investment in science. 
 If he were to assume chairmanship of the Committee on Science, he'd be an advocate of more investment in science.

Q. If you were writing a headline summarizing your career, how would it read?

A. ''He cared, and he tried to make things better.'' I know, that's so corny.


CORRECTION-DATE: May 20, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in Science Times on May 9 in the form of a conversation with Representative Sherwood Boehlert of New York, the departing chairman of the House Science Committee, included an incorrect figure from him for the annual payment from oil royalties that the State of Alaska awards to each citizen. In 2005, it was $845.76 per person, or $3,383 (not $10,000) for a family of four. (The highest payment, in 2000, was $1,963.86 per person.)

HEADLINE: U.S. Newspaper Circulation Fell 2.5% in Latest Period

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Daily circulation of American newspapers continued to slide during the six-month period that ended in March, dropping 2.5 percent from the same period a year ago, according to figures released yesterday by the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
 Sunday circulation fared even worse, dropping 3.1 percent. 
 The figures are comparable to the declines of the previous six-month period, which were the steepest in any comparable six-month period in the last 15 years.
 ''This is just another installment in a long, continuing saga'' of the newspaper industry in transition, said Colby Atwood, a newspaper analyst for Borrell Associates.
 ''Newspaper readers tend to be older and they're dying and they're not being replaced by younger people, who tend not to read the papers much,'' Mr. Atwood said. Those younger readers are flocking to the Internet and other niche media.
 As of March, daily circulation had dropped to 45,414,979. Circulation in March 2005 had been 46,589,261. Daily newspaper circulation reached its peak in 1984, at 63.3 million. 
 Executives at the Newspaper Association of America said some patterns emerged in the figures, including the biggest papers and the smallest papers being better able to maintain their circulation than medium-size papers. Papers along the Atlantic Coast generally fared better than those along the Pacific Coast, the executives said. Other variations were probably due more to marketing decisions by individual publishers than to any broad trends, they added.
 Of the 25 biggest papers in the country, 20 reported drops in circulation. Of the five that did not drop -- USA Today (2,272,815), The New York Times (1,142,464), The Chicago Tribune (579,079), The Star-Ledger of Newark (398,329) and The Detroit Free Press (345,861) -- the gains were all less than 1 percent.
 The losses were much more striking. Circulation at The San Francisco Chronicle fell by more than 15 percent, to 398,246, and at The Boston Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Company, by more than 8 percent, to 397,288. Both papers attributed the sharp declines largely to deliberate strategies of eliminating free copies that advertisers found of little value because those receiving them did not want them.
 ''We did this eyes wide open,'' said Patricia Hoyt, a spokeswoman for The Chronicle. She said the strategy, which began with a circulation drop of more than 16 percent in the six-month period ended last September, was now completed and the paper would be more in line with the rest of the industry in the next cycle.
 A spokesman for The Globe, Alfred S. Larkin Jr., said that apart from the deliberate reduction in circulation, the paper had been hurt by a continuing lag in the New England economy. Moreover, he said, the region has an especially high rate of high-speed Internet users and many of them are going to the newspaper's Web site, boston.com. 
 The newspaper association said traffic to newspaper Web sites was up 8 percent in the first quarter. Revenue from online advertising is increasing 25 percent to 30 percent a year, the association said, though it remains a small portion, perhaps 5 percent, of newspapers' overall revenue.
 Mr. Atwood of Borrell said that even at current rates, it would take years for Web sites to make up in advertising revenue what the newspapers are losing.

HEADLINE: State Proposals on Illegal Immigration Largely Falter

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
Lawmakers in dozens of state legislatures, impatient with Congress's lack of action to overhaul immigration law, have proposed hundreds of measures on the issue this year, most aimed at restricting illegal immigrants' access to public benefits and drivers' licenses. 
 But few bills to clamp down on illegal immigration have made it into law, meeting determined resistance from unlikely alliances uniting Latino community groups and civil liberties advocates with law enforcement officials and local chambers of commerce.
 The array of state initiatives reflect uneasiness among voters across the country about the growing presence of illegal immigrants, especially in states -- like North Carolina, Tennessee, Colorado and Arizona -- where immigrant populations have surged in recent years. 
 ''It was a way to wake up the federal government to do something, after they let down the entire country on illegal immigration,'' said Steve Gallardo, a Democratic state representative in Arizona, where the Legislature has been battling nonstop on the issue since January. 
 So far this year, no fewer than 461 bills related to immigration have been offered in the 43 states where legislatures have been in session, according to a survey by Ann Morse of the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures.
 Proposals have been offered to bar immigrants who cannot prove legal status from obtaining nonemergency health benefits, in-state rates of tuition and financial aid for college, and unemployment assistance. A host of bills sought to ensure that workers had legal documents and to enforce sanctions against employers who hired illegal immigrants. Other measures proposed authorizing local and state police agencies to enforce federal immigration laws.
 One of the most significant bills to win passage was in Georgia, which adopted a broad measure barring illegal immigrants from many state benefits, requiring employers to verify the status of workers and mandating that jailers alert federal officials to anyone incarcerated who is in the country illegally.
 But a count compiled by Ms. Morse last week found that only 19 measures had been enacted nationwide, and just 12 of them imposed on illegal immigrants any restrictions that were significant.
 ''There were a slew of punitive measures introduced across the country,'' said Tanya Broder, a lawyer in Oakland, Calif., with the National Immigration Law Center, which promotes immigrant rights and monitors legislation on the issue. ''But most of them either failed upon consideration by legislatures, or were narrowed to the point where they are largely symbolic.'' 
 In Tennessee, which the Pew Hispanic Center estimates is home to 100,000 or more illegal immigrants, at least 20 immigration bills have been introduced in the last year. The resulting clash centered on a drivers' certificate the state created in May 2004, which authorized illegal immigrants who lived there to drive but which could not be used as an identity document for any other purpose.
 Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, suspended the program in February after the arrest of a Knoxville resident who had been ferrying in illegal immigrants from New Jersey. She had been allowing them to use her address to obtain certificates so that they might try to drive in other states.
 Republican lawmakers led a campaign to cancel the certificate outright and impose other curbs on illegal immigrants. ''We're a country where people all their lives have to obey the laws,'' said State Senator Bill Ketron, a leader of the effort. ''Those who come here illegally don't pay any attention to those laws. That's what's dividing our country right now.'' 
 But the campaign ran up against concerted opposition from an alliance of groups that had gained lobbying skills in defending the certificate program. 
 Stephen Fotopulos, policy director for one such group, the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, said, ''There's a lot of frustration in our state with the broken federal immigration system, and people unfortunately have decided that anti-immigrant rhetoric will be politically advantageous.'' 
 Although the certificate program remains suspended, the attempts to cancel it were defeated. But one of Senator Ketron's bills, requiring that the drivers' license examination be given only in English, passed the Senate and is still moving forward in the lower house. 
 In New Mexico, Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat, declared a state of emergency last year because of growing violence at the Mexican border, but efforts to revoke a state law that allows illegal immigrants to obtain drivers' licenses were beaten back.
 Immigrant rights groups forged alliances with local sheriffs and businesses three years ago to win enactment of that law, which permits applicants for drivers' licenses to present alternative forms of identification if they have no Social Security or visa number.
 ''We worked hard building those relations with law enforcement,'' said Marcela Diaz, director of Somos un Pueblo Unido (We Are a United People), a group that spearheaded those efforts. ''When it comes to passing these laws, we face no strong organized opposition.'' 
 In Virginia, where the Pew center estimates 250,000 illegal immigrants live, some 40 immigration measures have been offered this year. Most have sought to expand on restrictions in a bill enacted in March 2005 that bars illegal immigrants from state benefits including Medicaid and welfare. But so far only one new measure has passed, ordering law enforcement officials to report illegal immigrant minors who commit serious crimes to federal immigration authorities.
 In Virginia elections last November, Republican candidates trumpeted plans to get tough on illegal immigration. But some discovered that the issue had unexpected wrinkles.
 One of them, State Senator Emmett W. Hanger Jr., was a prime mover of the 2005 bill. This year he offered a proposal to deny in-state college tuition to illegal immigrant students -- with some important exceptions. His proposal would make those students eligible if they had graduated from Virginia high schools and were seeking to become United States citizens, and if their parents had been living and paying taxes in the state for three years. 
 Mr. Hanger said he drafted the exemptions after legislative hearings where one witness, an illegal immigrant student, had just returned from a military tour in Iraq.
 To his surprise, many of Mr. Hanger's Republican allies from the 2005 legislative fight deserted him over the new bill, maintaining that he was encouraging lawbreakers. 
 ''But I picked up some new friends,'' he said, among liberal groups that mobilized behind his cause. 
 The most contentious debates have probably been in Arizona.
 In November 2004, the voters there led the nation on restrictive measures by adopting a ballot initiative, Proposition 200, that barred illegal immigrants from receiving taxpayer-financed health and welfare services. In the last year the Legislature, spurred by a Republican representative, Russell K. Pearce, has passed a series of new restrictive measures. But Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, has stopped a number of them with her veto.
 This month Ms. Napolitano signed a measure that laid out in more detail the requirements on immigrants to prove they are here legally before receiving health benefits, a refinement of Proposition 200. But she vetoed a bill that would have made illegal immigrants' presence a crime under trespass laws, and another that would have required her to dispatch National Guard troops to guard the border.
 Mr. Pearce said of the governor, ''Why would you sit by and tolerate the destruction of our American neighborhoods and the insecurity of our borders?'' He has prepared a broad new proposal to strengthen sanctions against employers who hire illegal immigrants and to provide millions for new border and immigration patrols by state law enforcement agencies. 
 While most of the clashes across the country have involved proposed restrictions on illegal immigrants, some states have voted to expand access for them. On April 13, the Nebraska Legislature overrode a veto by Gov. Dave Heineman, a Republican, and allowed illegal immigrant students to pay in-state college tuition. 
 And there is good news for party-going illegal immigrants in Wyoming. A measure recently adopted there ensures that they are eligible to rent kegs of beer.

HEADLINE: A Resurgence in the Bronx Is Finally Putting the Grand Back in the Concourse

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
During one of the Grand Concourse's low points, in the 1960's, the city's Parks Department decided not to replant grass in the boulevard's median. Instead, it poured cement and painted it green.
 It was an indignity for a street that had once been the Bronx's most prestigious address -- a Park Avenue at middle-class prices. 
At 4.5 miles, the Grand Concourse is neither the Bronx's longest street, nor its busiest, but since it was completed 97 years ago, it has been a barometer of the borough's economic vitality -- its successes and failures reflected in the fading mosaics and fresh graffiti painted on the six-story Art Deco and Art Moderne apartment houses that line it.
 Now, as it approaches its centennial in 2009, the Grand Concourse is at the center of a flurry of activity correlating with the Bronx's economic resurgence, including an $18 million project to rebuild the Concourse near Yankee Stadium; an $8.2 million expansion of the Bronx Museum of the Arts, scheduled to be finished in October; and a city program that offers low-interest loans for the rehabilitation of some prewar rental buildings.
 The projects include the redesign of Lou Gehrig Plaza -- between the Grand Concourse and Yankee Stadium -- which is being used as a parking lot for the Bronx County Courthouse but will be transformed into a formal plaza and terraced park. The Concourse itself will get new trees, flowers, streetlights, bike lanes and cobblestone sidewalks. Within a few blocks of the boulevard, a $325 million glass and aluminum criminal courthouse is nearing completion, and a new $800 million stadium for the Yankees is scheduled to open in 2009.
 ''To Bronxites, the Grand Concourse has always been the elegant boulevard,'' said Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx borough historian. ''As a showcase, as a symbol, it stood a lot for what the Bronx is and was.''
 The Grand Concourse starts its gently winding path north at 138th Street in the South Bronx and ends just short of Van Cortlandt Park at Mosholu Parkway in the northern part of the borough. Officially the Grand Boulevard and Concourse, it was conceived by a French civil engineer and modeled after the Champs-Elysees in Paris as a scenic path for the wealthy to get from Manhattan to the large parks of the Bronx.
 The northern portion, from 161st Street, was completed in 1909, while Mott Avenue was renamed and became the southern section of the concourse in 1927.
 After the subway under the Concourse opened, in 1933, developers rushed to build apartments along the street. Almost all of them were five or six stories tall. Building any higher required fireproof construction, which was more expensive.
 To lure tenants north from the Lower East Side and other parts of Manhattan, builders included grand lobbies, courtyards, elevators and sunken living rooms, and sufficient windows to provide sunlight and cross-ventilation -- features relatively foreign to the tenements from which many of the new tenants were drawn.
 An address on the Grand Concourse became a mark of social status. Among the street's residents from the its glory days, from the 1930's to the early 1960's, were Stanley Kubrick, Roberta Peters, Milton Berle, Penny Marshall and E. L. Doctorow.
 But the Concourse was not immune once the Bronx began its economic slide in the 1960's. Urban-renewal projects forced many poor black and Puerto Rican New Yorkers from their neighborhoods to the South Bronx. The ethnic shift led to fear among the Concourse's longtime residents, an angst that some said was whipped up by politicians and real estate speculators. Within a few years, many of those residents moved away, drawn to Riverdale and to the vast new Co-op City.
 ''The street was very vulnerable to any kind of change, because everybody came here at the same time,'' said Sam Goodman, an urban planner in the Bronx borough president's office, who has lived on the Grand Concourse since he was a child.
 Like most of the South Bronx, the Grand Concourse -- particularly the section south of Fordham Road -- was threatened by arson, crime and neglect throughout the 1980's. But unlike much of the South Bronx, not a single apartment building along the street was destroyed. And because no buildings burned down, the boulevard avoided large rebuilding projects that would have changed its character. As a result, the street looks much the same as it did 50 or 60 years ago.
 Some buildings, however, never recovered from neglect and eventual abandonment. The Concourse Plaza Hotel, built in the 1920's, whose guests included President Harry S. Truman and Yankee stars from Babe Ruth to Billy Martin, became a home for welfare families in the 1960's. Its deteriorating grandeur led John Cassavetes to shoot scenes there for the 1980 film ''Gloria'' that needed gloomy interiors. Eventually, the hotel, including its grand ballroom, was gutted, and it is now a home for the elderly. 
 The Andrew J. Freedman Home, a block-long Italianate Renaissance mansion built at 166th Street by a former owner of the New York Giants baseball team, opened in 1924 as a home for the formerly wealthy who had suffered reverses. Today, the future of the building, owned by the Mid-Bronx Senior Citizens Council, a nonprofit group, is in doubt. Only the basement of the four-story building is in use, by a variety of social service providers.
 Many other buildings along the street, however, appear to be in the midst of their own rebirths. Executive Towers, a 24-story co-op building with uniformed doormen, built in the 1960's, has gone from near insolvency and just one-third occupancy in the late 1980's to offering one-bedroom apartments for $180,000 today.
 Two years ago, Lukas Herbert, an urban planner who works for Westchester County, bought a one-bedroom apartment in Executive Towers for $65,000.
 ''I'm pretty much expecting the neighborhood to continue to improve,'' said Mr. Herbert. ''I don't know why it wouldn't. The building stock is amazing.''

HEADLINE: At Trial on Subway Bomb Plot, Informer Finishes Star Turn

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
At midday yesterday, a paid police informer, the key witness against a young Pakistani immigrant charged with plotting to blow up the Herald Square subway station, ended eight days on the witness stand.
 It was an unusually long stretch for any witness in a criminal trial, and it had clearly left him ragged.
But it was also an unusual performance, one in which the informer, Osama Eldawoody, 50, seemed both numbingly obsequious and frustratingly recalcitrant. 
 Even the assistant United States attorney who called him as a witness sometimes looked impatient, particularly when Mr. Eldawoody wandered off on tangents, occasionally turning to address the jury directly as he spoke of the more than a dozen recordings he had secretly made of the bomb plot.
 Mr. Eldawoody's performance could have a significant impact on the outcome of the trial in United States District Court in Brooklyn. His credibility is at the heart of the government's case, because defense lawyers have argued that he entrapped their client, Shahawar Matin Siraj, 23, and was himself the driving force behind the plot.
 The jurors appeared frustrated at times with Mr. Eldawoody.
 A slightly built man with tousled, jet-black hair, he was prone to fidgeting on the stand. He often gestured with a white ballpoint pen, sometimes wagging it back and forth like an admonishing finger, sometimes stabbing it in the air for emphasis. He spoke often in disjointed phrases.
 During nearly four days of cross-examination last week, the panel listened for hours as he gave the same answers over and over again.
 ''Possible,'' he said in response to scores of questions.
 ''Very possible'' was his reply to scores of others.
 He would often end his answers with a seemingly incongruous ''Thank you.''
 Yesterday, on at least two occasions, Mr. Eldawoody seemed almost to rebuke Mr. Siraj's lawyer, Martin J. Stolar, with the lawyer-like complaint that the question contained two separate inquiries.
 ''These are two different points,'' Mr. Eldawoody replied when Mr. Stolar asked whether he had told the defendant that he might have liver cancer and stomach cancer.

Bombs, Marriage, 'Pizza'
 The first week of Mr. Eldawoody's testimony was largely dominated by the young defendant's own sometimes giddy, high-pitched voice.
 The jury heard hour after hour of recordings of Mr. Siraj's conversations with the informer, who in effect annotated the tapes for the prosecution from the witness stand.
 At a few points on the recordings, Mr. Eldawoody, an Egyptian-born nuclear engineer, sounds almost fatherly, taking a gentle tone. He can be heard offering Mr. Siraj guidance not only on bombs and nuclear weapons but also on marriage.
 Mr. Siraj seems at times obsessed with the idea of obtaining nuclear weapons, although he emphasizes to the informer that he wants to carry out attacks that will cause only economic damage, killing as few people as possible.
 He also says he doesn't want to make a martyr of himself, because he wants to be able to keep carrying out attacks.
 On one recording, Mr. Eldawoody makes a half-hearted attempt to explain to Mr. Siraj -- whose own lawyer has described him as ''not the brightest bulb on the chandelier'' -- the difference between neutron and biological weapons. On another, Mr. Siraj asks whether atomic weapons and nuclear weapons are the same.
 On the recordings, Mr. Siraj seems occasionally to be entranced by his own view of a terrorist's tradecraft.
 At one point, he tries to explain to the older man how they can alert their confederates that a bomb has been placed in the subway. ''You have to call the brother, 'Hello, brother, I did my job, that's it, I deliver the pizza, O.K.? I deliver the pizza, O.K.' ''

Defendant's Demeanor
 While Mr. Siraj often sounds animated on the tapes, his demeanor in court during the first week was subdued and stoical.
 He seldom looked at the witness or at the jury. Seated between two of his three lawyers, he occasionally whispered to one or the other.
 Several times he looked into the courthouse gallery, where his grandparents and his father sat almost every day, sometimes accompanied by his uncle, who owns the Islamic bookstore where he worked. His mother waited in the hallway outside the courtroom, because she is expected to be called as a defense witness and cannot therefore listen to the proceedings.
 But his expression has changed little.
 He spent most of the first week of testimony hunched over a legal pad, scribbling or doodling with his face barely six inches from the page.
 During the cross-examination of Mr. Eldawoody, he became more animated, following in a book of transcripts as his lawyer played several tapes.
 His appearance changed dramatically in the middle of last week, however, after prosecutors played in court a secretly recorded videotape in which he was heard discussing the bomb plot.
 The warden at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Mr. Siraj is being held, ordered him into solitary confinement for his own protection, out of what he said was concern for his safety, according to Mr. Stolar. For two days, the young man appeared haggard and unshaven before the jury, wearing trousers and a sweater instead of his previous suit and open-collared shirt.
 Mr. Stolar said the warden had eventually been convinced that it would be safe to return Mr. Siraj to general population, and yesterday the defendant appeared rested and clean-shaven and was back in his suit.

HEADLINE: Rents to Rise At Least 3%, And Tenants Howl in Anger

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
The board that sets rents for the one million rent-stabilized apartments in New York City proposed tentative increases last night of 3 to 6.5 percent on one-year leases and 5 to 8.5 percent on two-year leases, setting the stage for increases that are likely to be larger than last year's when the board holds a final vote next month.
 Last night's vote by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, in a raucous meeting in which hooting and bellowing tenants often drowned out the proceedings, came on the heels of a recent board report that apartment owners' costs had risen by 7.8 percent in the last year, driven by a 22.8 percent rise in fuel costs and a jump in real estate taxes. 
The vote was 5 to 4, with the board's two tenant members and two owner members voting against the proposal and its five other members in favor of it. Marvin Markus, the board chairman, who made the proposal, said last month that it would be a ''serious challenge'' to hold this year's increases to last year's levels of 2.75 and 5.5 percent, respectively, for one- and two-year leases.
 The proposed rent rise comes at a time when real wages, or earnings adjusted for inflation, have fallen in every borough but Manhattan, according to federal statistics released this year. At the same time, landlords have insisted that past rent increases have not kept up with costs, giving some owners no choice but to sell to speculators.
 ''I see two New Yorks,'' Adriene Holder, a tenant board member, said at the hearing. ''I see one increasingly affluent. And I see another one increasingly, increasingly becoming more poor.'' She added, ''Landlords are hardly impoverished, landlords are hardly hurting, landlords are hardly poor.''
 But Steven J. Schleider, an owner member, said the ranges recommended last night were too low and failed to recognize what he said was a cumulative increase in operating costs of 31 percent over the past three years. In an interview after the vote, he said, ''It sends a signal to landlords of barely profitable apartment buildings that it's time to get out.''
 The board will hold two public hearings and a public meeting on the proposal next month, then will hold a final vote on June 27, settling on specific guidelines, not a range. In the past, the board's final votes have not deviated sharply from its preliminary ones. In theory, the board has the right to vote above or below the proposed range.
 The meeting last night, in an auditorium at Cooper Union, proceeded with all the orderliness and calm of a British soccer match or a Roman gladiators' fight. Tenants marched, chanting, outside the building; then several hundred filled the hall and shouted down the speakers, insulted the board members, chanted, drummed and hooted.
 At one point, a woman rose from her seat and began a lengthy monologue about her own housing troubles, cheered on by the audience. When she made her way, still talking, to the floor in front of the stage, where she was immediately engulfed by television cameras, Mr. Markus briefly adjourned the meeting and walked off the stage.
 After the board returned, the tenant board members proposed a one-year rent freeze, which the board voted down, 7 to 2. Next, the owner members made their own proposal for a 7 percent increase on one-year leases and a 7 percent increase on the first year of two-year leases, with the second year's increase to be determined next year. As an alternative, they proposed a 6 percent increase on one-year leases and 9 percent for two-year leases.
 Their proposal, too, failed 7 to 2.
 The proposal that finally passed applies to rent-stabilized apartments and lofts. The board also voted 5 to 4 in favor of a proposal for increases of up to 2 percent for rent-stabilized hotels, like residential hotels, rooming houses and single-room-occupancy hotels.
 The board rejected a motion by Ms. Holder to deny rent increases to owners of buildings in which at least a quarter of all the units are no longer rent-stabilized -- instances in which the owners collect market rents from a significant number of tenants -- as well as to owners with serious outstanding building code violations.
 Mr. Markus said the city's corporation counsel had prepared a 10-page memo that said Ms. Holder's proposal was ''not consistent with the powers of the Rent Guidelines Board.''
 Jumaane D. Williams, the executive director of Tenants and Neighbors, a statewide tenants organization, objected later in an interview not only to the size of the proposed increases, but also to Mr. Markus's use of ranges instead of specific percentages, which he and others complained makes the proposals more difficult to oppose.
