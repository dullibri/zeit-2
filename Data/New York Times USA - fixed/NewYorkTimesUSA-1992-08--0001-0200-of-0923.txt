HEADLINE: Small Towns Team Up to Fight Bleak Futures

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARNOLD, Neb.

 BODY:
This is one of the little towns that America apparently does not need anymore. Not in the days of shopping malls and Interstate highways, which never came to Custer County.
As in so many isolated pockets on the Great Plains, the population has been falling, hollowed by a shrinking farm economy. In 1990 the county had 12,000 people, down from nearly 30,000 in 1930. A Rutgers University study named Custer County as one of the dying places that might as well be swept clean of the last remaining residents, with its 3,072 square miles turned over to the bison. 
 But with towns, as with people, the will to survive does not always fade with a bad prognosis. "It's easy to run away, to go somewhere bigger, like everyone else," said Janet Larreau, a 32-year-old native of Custer County who moved home from Denver a few years ago. "But some of us have decided to stay. This is our way of life. And it's worth a fight."
In the exodus from rural America, these are the people who have chosen to stay behind. Using some creative strategies as a slingshot against the Goliath forces of a "bigger is better" economy, the little towns of Custer County have banded together for survival.
In a grass-roots effort to survive, the county residents have put their hopes in an innovative plan to foster a new concept of community that rural sociologists say could be a model: the countywide Main Street. The idea originated about a year ago with a volunteer group called the Nestbuilders' Network, whose members work to foster cooperation between individuals and communities.
Residents agree that none of the 12 little towns in the county can make it alone. They are simply too small. But if they pull together as a county, they might be able to achieve what economists call "critical mass," or the level needed to sustain a community.
If the town of Arnold does not have a pharmacy, for example, people are encouraged to shop in the next little town that has one rather than drive 45 miles to a big discount store in North Platte.
The effort to survive has forced people to set aside the old rivalries that have simmered for generations between the little towns. For years, it was not uncommon to hear a resident of one town boast that he would not set foot in a neighboring town.
"People used to say, 'Oh, I won't shop in Anselmo, say, because they beat us in football four years ago and I hate them,' " said Sandy Hatch, a representative of the Nestbuilders Network. "But people have come to realize: If we're going to survive, we have to stick together."
The civic support does not come without a price. People know they could buy goods more cheaply at a shopping mall. But people like Patricia Crow, who farms here with her husband, Darrell, said those extra dollars would not seem worth it if a local store closed.
"If everybody's going to shop at Uncle Sam's," said Mrs. Crow, referring to the Wal-Mart in North Platte, "then all the money ends up in a big corporation, and we're out in the cold."
Custer County's plan has stirred the interest of scholars who study ways to stem the decline in rural regions. A team of Iowa State University professors recently visited the county to document its approach, which will be used as part of a video primer for other struggling little towns.
"They have learned to cooperate, rather than compete," said Peter Korsching, the director of a rural development program sponsored by the United States Agriculture Department, which paid for the Iowa State study. "What's interesting is that they're doing it all by themselves."
Like the pioneers of a century ago, who braved Nebraska winds and snow in sod houses and earthen dug-outs, their challenge is to find ways to adapt in a changing and still harsh country.
Rather than venture out to a new world, as their ancestors did, their mission is to save the old one.
 
Battling for Life And Her Hometown
 When the old Watson's Grocery, which had been selling goods at the corner of Arnold and Custer Streets since 1946, decided to close its doors last year, people here assumed that another ghost would haunt the business district.
Since 1980, a movie theater, a hardware store and a service station have stood empty.
But Chris Meyer, whose youngest child was about to enter school, turned to her husband, Jim, an electrician for the town, and said, "What do you think?"
Arnold, their hometown, had been a wonderful place to raise four children. If they believed in the town and what it stood for, they decided, they had a responsibility to put some chips on the table.
They invested every penny of Mr. Meyer's retirement fund in the store. And they painted a new sign on an outside wall with a message: "Meyer's Market: Established 1991."
The grocery store will hardly make them wealthy. Just to make ends meet, they keep it open from 7 A.M. to at least 6:30 P.M. Monday through Saturday, and from 9 to 2 on Sundays.
On many weeknights, Mrs. Meyer or one of her clerks is still checking groceries at 9 P.M. When a worried parent calls at midnight, looking for aspirin for a sick child, she goes down to the store and opens up. Groceries are delivered for free. "If we just work hard enough," Mrs. Meyer said, "this town is going to make it."
Mrs. Meyer, 29 years old, knows something about fighting against the odds. When she was 25, she learned she had cancer. "I thought, if I can just make it until I'm 30," she said. "Let me have that much. Just let me become 30 years old."
She looked across the table at her four children, who had met her and her husband for lunch at the Model Cafe. "I've been lucky," she said. She lost a part of her tongue and the use of her salivary glands. But the cancer has not reappeared.
For now, she and her husband are looking forward to the big barn dance and party they are holding on Aug. 1.
"Her brother's in a country band, and he's going to play," Mr. Meyer said. "And he does Garth Brooks better than Garth Brooks. It's going to be one heck of a celebration."
Chris Meyer is turning 30.
 
Brainstorming To Bring in Money
 This is a place where people over 60 eat for half-price at the Model Cafe, where the owner, 83-year-old Marjorie Hagler, bakes homemade pies that draw customers from all over the county. It is a place where slips of paper appeared in every mailbox in town one recent Saturday morning, reading simply, "Althea needs help with her house." By noon, an army of volunteers had arrived at the woman's home.
On Mother's Day, a small-plane crash took the life of a 14-year-old boy, and by dark nearly every one of the town's 671 residents had come with food and embraces for the shuddering parents. Through their tears, the family members wondered what they were going to do with 36 canned hams.
Once a month, the Nestbuilders' Network meets to plot the survival of Custer County.
At the end of each meeting, they have what they call a "wild and crazy" session to brainstorm for new ideas. There are two rules: No one can laugh at an idea, and no one can say, "That won't work."
At one session, they tried to figure out a way to bring tourists to this remote stretch of Nebraska. But what did the countryside have to offer?
"There's plenty of wind," said somebody, half in jest.
"That's it," someone else replied. "Everybody liked to fly kites as a kid. We'll have a kite-flying festival."
The celebration drew visitors from seven states, and the stores and restaurants of the county profited.
At another meeting, it was mentioned that many people here make things as a hobby, like quilts, clocks and bookshelves. Why not pool their creations, someone suggested, and sell them. The Devil's Den, a crafts cooperative, now employs a full-time worker.
And residents of the county have been busy coming up with their own ideas. A farmer who groused about having to drive 35 miles to buy a nail, for example, opened a lumberyard. It now employs three people.
The town governments have started to keep in close touch, finding out the others' needs so they can buy in bulk and save money. Civic and business leaders check around the county to make sure that festivals or special sales do not conflict.
The efforts in Custer County have won praise from the Center for the New West, a research organization that has conducted a study on ways that small towns can survive.
"Rather than wallow and lament about the old days," said John Shepard, of the Center for the New West, "the people of Custer County have discovered that they can make big differences in small ways."
But the people in Custer County say they welcome, indeed recruit, new residents. Mindful that people in bigger places often complain about high prices and violent crime, they put together a brochure and mailed it to every graduate of Custer County schools.
"We sent them a letter that said, 'You can turn your kids loose here and not worry about it,' " said Mrs. Hatch, of Nestbuilders. "You can walk around at midnight with peace of mind."
In a few cases, the brochures have fallen into the hands of people who had never heard of Custer County and are now residents.
 
For Recruiters, The People Payoff
 When they were living in Michigan, the noise and clutter of urban life sometimes seemed about to swallow Steve and Robin Clouse. They had always lived in metropolitan areas, but they yearned for a place with open spaces and with people who didn't seem to be in such a hurry.
"I always wanted to live in a place where people waved at you when you drove down the street," Mrs. Clouse said.
A neighbor, who had lived in Custer County, showed the Clouses the brochure. "This looks like what you're looking for," the neighbor told them.
The couple made a few telephone calls and did some research. They learned that nice houses sell for about $30,000, sometimes less, in Custer County. And they found out that the teacher-to-pupil ratio was 14 to 1. In their 6-year-old daughter's class in Lansing, there were 33 students.
Mr. Clouse, a 38-year-old handyman who builds and remodels homes, was told that a worker could keep busy as long as he did not mind driving some distances between jobs.
They packed and headed for Custer County last spring. On the day they arrived, two people were waiting at the house they had rented to help them unpack. A woman came to clean the carpets. A man with a tractor plowed them a garden.
"I was shocked," Mrs. Clouse said.
"This is paradise," Mr. Clouse said.
So far, he has been able to find work without a problem, though he sometimes has to drive 30 or 40 miles to a job. But he can cover that distance in half an hour, the same time he often needed to go 8 or 9 miles in Lansing.
Mrs. Clouse stays at home with their baby, and neighbors routinely stop to visit and ask if she needs a sitter for a while, just so she can take a break.
And their daughter has already made plenty of new friends. One of them took her home to a ranch last week.
"She even got to watch them brand cattle," said Mr. Clouse, with a note of awe. "I just wish I could have gone."

HEADLINE: BUSH AIDE ASSAILS U.S. PREPARATIONS FOR EARTH SUMMIT

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
President Bush's top environmental adviser has sharply criticized the Administration's handling of the recent Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, saying it was slow to react to crucial issues, late in assembling a delegation and unwilling to devote sufficient resources to the meeting.
The criticism by William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the chief of the United States delegation to the Rio summit, was made in a memorandum that he circulated to 12,000 agency employees two weeks ago. The memorandum was first disclosed today by The Associated Press. 
 Mr. Reilly has often been in conflict with Vice President Dan Quayle and other top officials who have sought to temper environmental policies advocated by the E.P.A. director.
 
No Intention to Resign
 Despite the tone of the memorandum and its wide circulation within the agency, Mr. Reilly said in a telephone interview today that he had no intention of resigning.
"I'm just communicating to my own people about something that was a very severe disappointment to them," Mr. Reilly said. "Their concern was how, in a country that brought the best environmental performance record to Rio, did we manage to become the focus of such criticism."
Nonetheless, the memorandum could be read as an effort by Mr. Reilly to restore his standing among environmentalists, some of whom have expressed disappointment with his inability to gain Administration approval for more aggressive environmental programs.
Today, Mr. Reilly chose his words carefully in explaining why he wrote the memorandum. "We prepared for Rio in the midst of political and economic preoccupations that were a distraction," he said. "The preparation clearly suffered. This was a public-relations disappointment. I set out in this memorandum to explain why we received such criticism."
Whatever Mr. Reilly's intent, the memorandum is likely to provide new ammunition for Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential nominee, and Senator Al Gore, his running mate, who are already pressing an attack against President Bush for what they see as his failure to protect the environment.
Although Mr. Reilly complimented Mr. Bush in the memo for appearing at the summit after initially threatening not to attend, he implicitly criticized him by assaulting the Administration's whole approach to the meeting.
The White House did not reply to several requests for comment on the E.P.A. Administrator's memorandum.
In the memorandum, Mr. Reilly lashed out at the White House decision not to sign the biodiversity treaty to preserve the world's plant and animal species. He said the decision received so much criticism that other ideas put forward by the United States at the international conference were drowned out.
"Why did the United States play such a low-key defensive game in preparing for Rio?" Mr. Reilly asked in the memorandum. "We assigned a low priority to the negotiations of the biodiversity treaty, were slow to engage the climate issue, were last to commit our President to attend Rio. We put our delegation together late, and we committed few resources. No doubt, this contributed to negative feelings toward the United States."
 
'Like a Bungee Jump'
 Mr. Reilly also responded to his opponents in the Administration who embarrassed him at the start of the June summit by disclosing a confidential memorandum in which Mr. Reilly had urged the White House to change its position on the biodiversity treaty.
"For me personally, it was like a bungee jump," Mr. Reilly said in the memorandum. "You dive into space secured by a line on your leg and trust it pulls you up before you smash into he ground. It doesn't typically occur to you that someone might cut your line."
Though Mr. Reilly heads the Government's environmental agency, many experts say his authority has been greatly diminished in recent months and that it has been assumed by Vice President Quayle, who heads the Council on Competitiveness; Richard G. Darman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget; Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Clayton Yeutter, the President's domestic policy adviser.
The memorandum is the most biting criticism that Mr. Reilly has publicly leveled at his opponents in the White House. Moreover, it comes as the White House is trying to pull itself together and present a unified message on how it intends to handle important domestic issues in a second term, among them the economy and the environment.
In public, and in private meetings at the White House, Mr. Reilly has argued without much success this year that the Administration's year-old program of halting environmental regulations, proposing to rewrite environmental laws, and weakening existing statutes will not attract the crucial suburban voters in California, the Middle West, and the Northeast who may well hold the key to victory in the fall election.
 
Response to Supportive Staff
 David Cohen, Mr. Reilly's spokesman, said today that the memorandum was a response to a message of support from 3,000 agency employees upon his arrival in Washington after one of the most difficult and emotionally trying diplomatic missions a United States delegation chief has ever experienced. The employees said Mr. Reilly was a "tremendous asset" to the E.P.A. and a "source of inspiration" to his staff.
It is no secret in Washington that President Bush's environmental and economic advisers have been at odds since the start of the Administration in January 1989. Mr. Reilly and his allies, among them Michael R. Deland, the chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, and Robert E. Grady, the acting Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, agree that economic growth is compatible with a clean environment protected by tough rules.
Mr. Reilly also says ecological problems like climate warming, depletion of the earth's protective ozone shield, deforestation and loss of species are growing worse. Mr. Reilly has been an advocate for strong international agreements to halt global environmental problems that he considers a threat to all life.
 
Administration Hostilities
 Mr. Reilly's opponents in the Administration, particularly Vice President Quayle and the staff of the Council on Competitiveness, believe that some amount of pollution and other environmental tradeoffs are necessary to advance the economy, particularly during a recession. They have sought to weaken some regulations, such as those in the 1990 Clean Air Act, to make them friendlier to business. They have taken a dim view of scientific claims that global warming and loss of species are growing worse, and they have rejected appeals by the environmental community to take much stronger measures in battling global ecological problems.
But not until the Earth Summit had the extremely personal nature of the high-level battles in the Administration broken into public view. When Mr. Reilly proposed in the confidential memorandum in June that the White House change its position on the biodiversity treaty, his opponents, alarmed that he might succeed, disclosed the memorandum.
The disclosure seemed intended to diminish his standing at the Rio conference. But it also had the effect of embarrassing President Bush, who condemned the disclosure and ordered an investigation into its source.

HEADLINE: Census Reveals Changes as It Paints a Picture of Metropolitan America

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
If metropolitan New York seems foreign to the rest of America, that's because it is.
Nearly one in five residents was born abroad. Nearly one in three residents speaks a language other than English -- and almost half of those acknowledge that they don't speak English very well. 
 In Jersey City, a mecca for Cubans, other Hispanic immigrants and people from India, 3 in 10 residents is foreign-born -- a higher proportion than in any other major metropolitan area except Miami. Among residents of New York City and three counties to the north -- Westchester, Rockland and Putnam -- nearly 4 in 10 said they speak a language other than English at home, and more residents arrived from abroad than moved from another state.
More than one in six of the nation's new legal immigrants in the 1980's settled in the New York region. Among all of the nation's metropolitan areas, about 1 in 10 residents is foreign-born.
The Census Bureau also reported Thursday that New York State was the biggest loser in net migration from 1980 through 1988. The state lost 1,399,000 people -- 478,000 of them to Florida, which recorded the biggest gains of any state.
The census figures sketched an exotic profile of a region that sprawls across three states and is changing in measurable ways beyond the most visible one, its complexion.
Although direct comparisons with 1980 are difficult because the Census Bureau reconfigures metropolitan areas every decade, some broad changes can be discerned.
During the 1980's, the percentage of people graduating from high school and from college climbed. So did the proportion of women in the labor force, although it is still lower than the average of all metropolitan areas.
 
Drop in Poverty?
 The overall poverty rate in the region also dipped, but that improvement may have disappeared. The census measured income for 1989, but since then the Northeast has been struck by a lingering recession that has helped swell the welfare rolls in New York City to more than 994,000 at last count -- the highest level in 16 years.
The census quantified broad disparities among the components of metropolitan New York, which in addition to the city includes Long Island, the lower Hudson Valley, Northern New Jersey and Fairfield County in Connecticut.
Median household income -- the point at which half the households received more and half less -- ranged from $30,917 in Jersey City to $57,876 in Stamford. The Government defines a household as people, related or not, living in a single housing unit.
The $38,445 median for the entire metropolitan area was substantially higher than the $32,086 average for all of the nation's metropolitan areas.
Across the nation, 12.1 percent of people in metropolitan areas were living below the federally defined poverty level. In the New York metropolitan area, Bristol and Danbury had the lowest poverty rates, below 4 percent. Long Island and Middlesex, Somerset and Hunterdon Counties in New Jersey were slightly higher.
The highest rate was 17.5 percent in the five counties within New York City and the three counties just to the north, where nearly 6 in 10 female-headed households were living in poverty. Those eight counties reported the lowest percentage of married-couple families -- 41.6 percent -- and the highest percentage of people living alone -- 36.9 percent.
 
Young at 34
 The median age of people in New York City and the three counties immediately north of the city -- 34 years old -- was on the low end for the metropolitan area.
Households were largest on Long Island -- 2.99 people, compared to 2.56 in New York City and Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties. Long Island also had a higher proportion of people born in the state in which they now live -- nearly 9 in 10 -- than the entire New York metropolitan area and than the average for metropolitan areas in the nation.
Stamford had the highest percentage of college graduates -- 43.7 percent -- compared to an average of 25.8 for the metropolitan area. The figure for all metropolitan areas in the nation was 22.5 percent.
New York City and Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties led the nation in the percentage of commuters who use public transportation -- nearly half. Even commuters in the suburbs used mass transit at a higher rate than the 6.5 percent average for commuters in all metropolitan areas. In the entire metropolitan area, though, the proportion of people using mass transit declined to 26 percent from about 30 percent in 1980.
Among the metropolitan area's more than seven million housing units, fewer than 1 percent lacked complete plumbing and fewer than 5 percent had no telephone. There were slightly more houses or apartments with no bedrooms than with five or more bedrooms.
Fully 10 percent of people in the region have lived in the same house or apartment for three decades. About one-third moved into their homes since 1985.
Of the 8.7 million employed in the metropolitan area, about 5.4 million of them were in executive, administrative, managerial, sales, clerical or professional occupations. More than 210,000 were in protective services -- almost four times as many as in farming, forestry and fishing. About the same number -- 1.2 million -- were employed in manufacturing and in retail trades.
The New York metropolitan area's population rose by 3.1 percent in the 1980's -- close to the rate in the nation's non-metropolitan areas.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Outlines Welfare Plan Before California Audience

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIVERSIDE, Calif., July 31

 BODY:
President Bush came to this city today to promote welfare reform, an issue his advisers say is hot among the middle-class voters his campaign so urgently needs to reach here.
But the President's own message in a state where he badly trails the Democratic Presidential nominee, Bill Clinton, was markedly tepid. And even his aides allowed that the proposals he brought with him had virtually no prospect of becoming law any time soon. 
 The day's main event, a Rotary Club breakfast before about 1,000 overwhelmingly white listeners, only underscored the continuing fits-and-starts nature of Mr. Bush's re-election bid, as he chose today not to attack the Democrats, as he had done on Thursday. The polls show that the President trails Mr. Clinton by as many as 34 percentage points in California, even as the number of days left to campaign has dwindled to fewer than 100.
On the last day of a two-day effort to repair his ties with California conservatives, the President flew at sunrise to Riverside, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, to visit an employment bureau and issue a legislative proposal for welfare reform.
His speech largely repeated the Administration's contention that the welfare system locks the poor into a cycle of dependency and that innovation by states and cities -- not more Federal money and rules -- can best break that cycle.
 
Proposals to Trim Welfare
 "Welfare was designed to be temporary, temporary," Mr. Bush told the Rotarians. "But today, more than half of all recipients receive a check for eight years, and we can't afford that."
He pledged to craft a better system that would reward responsibility and tell recipients to "get a job or get off the dole." And he said he supported state programs that would reduce or deny benefits to some welfare recipients who continued to bear children they could not afford to raise.
"I know this is a tough call, a tough system," he said. "But so is a system in which poverty is handed down from generation to generation."
A few yards away, aides handed out a thick outline of Administration proposals to give states more freedom to decide how to spend the $150 billion spent by the Federal government on welfare each year.
The ideas included one to allow states to devise new incentive programs to encourage welfare recipients to find jobs and one to combine cash and Food Stamps for food, housing and Medicaid into programs governed by one set of rules.
The Administration would also encourage employers to hire the poor by allowing employers, in some cases, to pay them less than the minimum wage or union rates. And it would give states more freedom to make welfare seem more like regular pay.
 
Congress Unlikely to Act
 Mr. Bush's welfare expert, Gail Wollensky, said the Administration wanted "to try to encourage changes that will promote and encourage employment, savings, responsible childbearing, families that stay together, making sure that if they don't stay together, the dad pays." She said the proposals would be sent to Congress as a bill within a few weeks.
But Congress will recess in two weeks for the campaign season and is unlikely to take up any new legislation when it returns after the November elections.
The proposal appeared to be intended less to influence lawmakers than to address charges by Democrats and critics in the welfare establishment that Mr. Bush has been urging welfare reform but has never produced a list of changes.
After Mr. Bush's speech, his aides passed out a three-page news release attacking welfare proposals by Mr. Clinton as well as Mr. Clinton's welfare record as Governor of Arkansas. Bush aides contended that welfare administrative costs there had risen 30-fold since Mr. Clinton took office.
Later, Mr. Clinton responded by saying, "It's simply not true."
But that mention of Mr. Clinton was the only one today in a campaign stop curiously devoid of criticism of Mr. Bush's rival.
Only Thursday, in Orange County, Mr. Bush had lashed out at Mr. Clinton's proposals on military spending and foreign-affairs experience. Aides said Mr. Bush's attack on Mr. Clinton in Orange County had been added fairly late to his planned speech at the President's own insistence.
Asked why Mr. Bush had not inserted similar bristles into his remarks at Riverside, one Bush aide replied, "We weren't that organized."
In a small but telling slip today, the President himself seemed to symbolize the uncertainty of his own campaign.
Mr. Bush tripped over a stock line that he uses in speeches these days, reminding audiences that he would jump feet-first into campaigning after the Republican convention in mid-August.
He promised soon "to roll up my sleeves and go after them and tell the American people what is really going on."
"But let me just tell those of you who are interested in politics, you wait two years from now. . . ." Then he corrected himself: "I mean two weeks from now."

 Companies
Paramount Communications is getting into the theme park business. It agreed to pay $400 million for Kings Entertainment, which operates five parks in the U.S. and Canada. [Page 39.]
Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger, a mutual fund sponsor, will be acquired by Franklin Resources for $913 million, the highest price ever paid for a mutual fund business. [39.]
McDonnell Douglas said second-quarter earnings dropped 50.6 percent, to $38 million, largely because of higher costs for developing a proposed 600-seat jumbo jet. [41.]
Aetna Life posted a second-quarter loss of $20 million after charges to eliminate 4,800 workers and costs related to an Olympia & York financial guarantee. [41.]
Arthur Andersen was sued for $400 million by the Federal Government, which accused the accounting firm of malpractice in the failure of a leading Houston savings institution. [41.]
British Telecom and Motorola are planning less expensive video conferencing equipment combining a picture telephone, fax machine and data transfer terminal in a personal computer. [41.]
Mabon Securities' managing director of institutional equities resigned and about 15 percent of the firm's 59-member equity department was dismissed. [41.]
Apple will introduce a software package intended to make its Macintosh computer easier to use. [41.]
 
 The Economy
Factory orders climbed in June, helped by rising demand for big-ticket items, but personal income was flat, forcing consumers to dig into savings to produce a modest spending rise. [43.]
Farmers earned less for their crops but spent more to grow them in July, as costs for fuels and feeder cattle rose while prices for oranges, hogs, corn and soybeans fell. [43.]
 
International
Latin America's debt crisis is not yet over despite recent refinancing agreements with major lenders, international analysts say. The region is still burdened with more than $435 billion in loans, and the annual interest payments will put a heavy drag on the economies of these countries for years. [1.]
The House voted to raise import duties on mini-vans and sportutility vehicles to 25 percent from 2.5 percent by reclassifying them as trucks instead of cars. If the measure becomes law, it would increase retail prices as much as $4,000. [39.]
The Russian city of St. Petersburg gave quick approval for R. J. Reynolds to buy a cigarette manufacturer there because cigarettes, which are in short supply, provide short-term comfort to workers in these uncertain times. [39.]

Wall Street extended its winning streak to a fourth session -- barely. The Dow Jones industrial average ended 1.89 points higher, at 3,393.78, but gained 108.07 for the week. [42.]
Treasury bond prices fell after a fresh round of economic data suggested that the economy was slowly recovering. [42.]
The dollar declined after trading in a very narrow range throughout the session. Gold prices rose 90 cents in New York. [49.]
Fears over a coming general strike in South Africa sent platinum futures soaring $7.40 an ounce, to $385.10. [49.]

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Party Chief Assails G.O.P.'s 'Sleaze' Strategy

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
Turning up name-calling in the Presidential campaign another notch, the chairman of the Democratic Party today described the Bush-Quayle campaign's recent strategy as "state-of-the-art sleaze."
This came after a senior Republican aide referred to Gov. Bill Clinton as a "philandering, pot-smoking draft dodger." 
 The comment about Mr. Clinton appeared in an article today in The New York Times that described the subtle ways Vice President Dan Quayle and other campaign surrogates have been trying to chip away at the Arkansas Governor's image by reminding voters of the personal accusations that have been hurled at Mr. Clinton.
The comment was by Mary Matalin, the Bush campaign's political director, who was asked whether Bush-Quayle officials were trying to draw personal accusations about Mr. Clinton into the campaign. Her response was: "We've never said to the press that he's a philandering, pot-smoking draft dodger."
 
'Lexicon of Lies'
 Asked in turn about that remark, she said: "That's the first time I've done that. There's nothing nefarious or subliminal going on."
Today, the Democratic national chairman, Ronald H. Brown, issued a statement that stepped gingerly around direct criticism of Ms. Matalin, using the occasion instead to assail Mr. Bush. He said the remark was a deliberate attempt by the White House to divert attention from the weak economic figures that emerged Thursday.
"A few months ago George Bush ordered his staff, in writing, to 'stay out of the sleaze business,' " Mr. Brown said. "Today that statement joins the lexicon of lies that include 'read my lips,' '30 million jobs in eight years,' 'kinder, gentler nation,' 'Clarence Thomas is the most qualified person in the country to sit on the Supreme Court,' and 'Dan Quayle is growing into the job.'
"I'll say this for the Bush-Quayle campaign," he added. "Their tactics are state of the art sleaze."
The Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee, Senator Al Gore, also criticized Mr. Bush, saying he had failed to keep his promise "to keep this campaign on the issues and out of the mud."

HEADLINE: Paramount Joins the Theme Park Bandwagon

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
After months of speculation that it would make an acquisition, Paramount Communications Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to buy a group of regional theme parks for $400 million.
Paramount said it would acquire the Kings Entertainment Company, a private concern that owns Kings Dominion, near Richmond; Great America, in Santa Clara, Calif., and Carowinds, near Charlotte, N.C., where the company is based. 
 Paramount, based in New York, will also buy Kings Island, a park near Cincinnati that is owned by the American Financial Corporation and managed by Kings Entertainment, and the 20 percent of Canada's Wonderland, near Toronto, owned by Kings Entertainment.
Paramount said Kings Entertainment was expected to have 1992 revenues exceeding $250 million and earnings of $63 million before interest, taxes and depreciation, an increase of about 10 percent from 1991.
Analysts had said for months that Paramount might buy NBC or make another major acquisition. The purchase of Kings Entertainment, however, is not expected to preclude additional purchases by Paramount, which had revenues last year of $3.9 billion and has a cash hoard of $1.5 billion from the sale in the 1980's of several nonentertainment assets.
Analysts generally viewed the acquisition of Kings Entertainment favorably, saying it would slightly increase Paramount's earnings per share, was low risk and would have little financial consequence.
Investors, however, apparently took a different view. Paramount's stock fell $1.625 yesterday, closing at $45.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.
"I think the Street is saying that on the surface, it does not have a great strategic fit; it is a nice business, but it does not go anywhere," said Emanuel Gerard, a partner of Gerard, Klauer & Mattison, an investment firm.
"The street was hoping Paramount's cash would be used in a major strategic acquisition that might lead in a new direction," Mr. Gerard said. "And it seems to be getting used in small pieces that have no dramatic impact."
Ray Katz of Shearson Lehman Brothers noted there were also hopes that Paramount would be sold.
It has become a trend for entertainment companies to acquire theme parks. The Walt Disney Company, with its Disneyland and Disney World parks, and MCA Inc., with its Universal Studios parks, have been successful in marketing products and establishing recognition for characters created for their films and television programs. And last year, Time Warner Inc. bought a stake in Six Flags Entertainment, a chain of six regional amusement park.
Paramount has a number of properties that could be used in a theme park setting. These include the "Addams Family," "Star Trek" and "Top Gun" movies; the "Cheers" and "McGyver" television shows, and the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books published by its Simon & Schuster unit. Paramount also owns Madison Square Garden and said that its experience in staging live events there gave it the skills to book events at each of the theme parks, which can hold from 8,000 to 13,000 people.
Kings Entertainment has rights to Hanna Barbera characters until 2009. Among them are the Flintstones and Yogi Bear.
Paramount's chairman, Martin S. Davis, said the deal would give Paramount the opportunity to further exploit its film, television and publishing assets as well as to expand its live-entertainment abilities.
Gordon Crawford, senior vice president of the Capital Research Company, whose firm is the largest shareholder in Paramount, with about 4 percent, backed the acquisition. He said theme parks had become an integral part of the entertainment business because they allowed film companies to cross-promote characters they own.
At the Six Flags park in the Chicago area, for example, Time Warner has a new Batman ride, Batman stunt show and a fireworks and laser show. It also owns the rights to cartoon characters like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, which have long been featured at the Six Flags parks.
MCA's Universal Studios Florida offers rides based on several Universal names, including E. T. and King Kong. Disney has rides based on Snow White and Alice in Wonderland and live shows based on its movies "The Little Mermaid" and "Beauty and the Beast."
The financier Mario Gabelli, whose Gabelli & Company owns a 3 percent stake in Paramount, said the Kings theme parks were "nice properties."
"They are reasonably steady cash generators," he said, "and it looks like a conservative, financially opportunistic acquisition, but it is not material."
Kings Entertainment parks are regional, attracting mostly visitors from a 150-mile radius. The Disney and MCA parks are called destination parks, because they attract visitors from around the world.
In general, the theme park business has been a good one, although it has been hurt by the recession. At parks run by Kings, attendance fell to 11.2 million in 1991 from 11.3 million a year earlier. The company expects 11.4 million visitors this year.
Paramount is unlikely to pay for the entire acquisition in cash. Mr. Gabelli estimated that the deal could add about 8 cents net a share to Paramount's earnings.
One executive with knowledge of the two companies said: "The parks generate enough cash to cover the interest expense whether Paramount borrows the money or pays out of its own cash. So Paramount has not impaired its ability to undertake any other acquisition."
 
Retaining the Chief
 Paramount said Nelson Schwab, who leads the group of investors selling Kings Entertainment and serves as the company's chairman and chief executive, would continue in those positions in a new theme park unit being created at Paramount.
The American Financial Corporation said its segment of the transaction is expected to be completed by Oct. 1. It bought Kings Island from Kings Entertainment in 1987.

 HARD TIMES IN CONNECTICUT
In yet another sign of Connecticut's economic fall from grace, the nation's wealthiest state has seen the number of its residents receiving food stamps nearly double in the last three years. The increase has been considerably steeper than that of either the nation as a whole or of New York and New Jersey. Experts say it is largely a function of the sharp reversal in the fortunes of a state whose economy was booming in the 1980's. Page 28.
 
 SEARCHING FOR KIN
Gordon Clark Ramsey, a 51-year-old professor at the University of Hartford, fears he may be among the last descendants of Stephen Hopkins, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. But he may find out otherwise on a beach in Warwick, R.I., next month when at least 500 people from around the country are expected to gather for a one-day party. Anyone who was ever related to a Hopkins, however remotely, is invited. Mr. Ramsey will attend, searching not so much for roots, he said, as for relatives. Page 28.
 
 PROFILE OF THE METROPOLITAN REGION
If metropolitan New York seems foreign to the rest of America, that's because it is. Nearly one in five residents was born abroad. Nearly one in three residents speaks a language other than English -- and almost half of those acknowledge that they don't speak English very well. Page 7.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
To Clinton, at Crest of Popularity, Smiling Is Easy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., July 31

 BODY:
In Bill Clinton's profession, smiling is an essential job skill and an ingrained habit.
Mr. Clinton's smile is one of the best, even by the demanding standards of his line of work. It runs an unusually varied gamut, from a full-beam grin that denotes honest fun, to a slightly quizzical, open-jawed look of modesty, to a small, seductive curve delivered with a shy glance from under half-lowered eyelids, with the lower lip lightly bitten. 
 Riding the crest of his own popularity, Mr. Clinton campaigns most days from early in the morning until late at night, and during most of that time, he is smiling. (He alternates greetings as he goes down the line: "Hi. Hello. Hi. Hello. Hi. Hello.") He smiles as he dandles more babies than a portrait photographer. ("Aw, that's a beautiful baby," he says.)
He smiles in the face of adversity, as he did in La Grange, Ill., on Tuesday, when a young man repeatedly addressed him as "Slick Willie," and in New Orleans on Wednesday, when he cheerfully suggested that a heckler at his evening speech shut up.
This morning, an easy day with only one public event here in the morning and a speech before the National Bar Association in St. Louis in the evening, Mr. Clinton, under the lights and lenses of the cameras, played at playing basketball with a group of neighborhood children at the North Little Rock Community Center. He was more game than his game was good; he hit only 4 of 11 shots, repeatedly forgot to dribble the ball and displayed the reaction time of, well, a large middle-aged man. But he kept smiling.
In most politicians, most of the time, such relentless beaming would seem false, particularly in the case of a politician in trouble (such as Mr. Clinton was during the dark days of spring), when the line between a frozen smile and the rictus of rigor mortis is easily crossed. The interesting thing about Mr. Clinton's sunniness is how appropriate it looks.
 
Easy to Stay Cheerful
 The days since the end of the convention that nominated him as the Democratic choice for President, beginning his great, though possibly evanescent, rise in the polls, have been the summer of Mr. Clinton's content. He seems to be having the time of his life, and no wonder. He is on a roll of historical proportions, and he is spending his days doing what true politicians truly love: talking at length to admiring crowds.
It is hard to say exactly how much Mr. Clinton talks in a given day, but it is a lot. Four half-hour speeches, plus four 15-minute segments of chatting his way through the crowd would give him (at an average speed of 90 words per minute), 16,200 words right there, and that does not count all the talk that goes into lesser events of the day, the interviews and news conferences and fund-raisers. The total for a full 12-hour day of campaigning must run to a minimum of 40,000 words, or about half the length of a modest book.
Yet Mr. Clinton, in his current ebullience, seems to find this hardly enough. In the town-meeting-style events favored by the candidate, he often takes questions for 40 or 50 minutes, and he generally answers each one with a mini-speech of enough length and depth that his questioners generally get tired and sit down well before the end of his answers to their queries.
There is something about the town meetings that suggests a game -- "Ask Mr. Policyman" it might be called -- that Mr. Clinton genuinely enjoys, perhaps because he always wins. He sits with easy confidence in the middle of whatever group his campaign has gathered, apparently secure in the knowledge that he can pull, from the storage files of his mind, enough bits and pieces of past speeches, policy papers and legislation to handle almost any question.
But it is more than a mere grasp of policy that Mr. Clinton displays in this kind of setting. He seems to have, these days at least, a winner's confidence that he can talk his way through whatever the moment brings. When, this morning, a teen-ager asked him to discuss his reaction to "all those allegations about your wife" that had come up earlier in the campaign, Mr. Clinton chuckled and said easily, "Oh, I though it was kinda overdone." Then he moved seamlessly into the thought that "we can spend too much time looking at yesterday when we ought to be looking at tomorrow."
Mr. Clinton's desire to talk even encompasses his previous tormenters, the reporters. Very late Tuesday night, after a 16-hour day, the candidate wandered back into the press section of his campaign plane for a chat. He started on politics, moved to varied matters of policy -- health care, abortion, the economy, industrial planning, the regulation of breast implants, to cite a few -- and went on to discuss his current favorites among books and movies, the state of the American psyche ("very fragile"), his daughter, Chelsea, and her progress at language camp, and other thoughts as they came up in questions or in his mind.
He was offhandedly candid about subjects that would more safely be avoided. He told of an encounter with an adolescent boy at a recent speech. The youth, he said, told him that his father had fought in Vietnam and suggested that he doubted Mr. Clinton's fitness for the Presidency because of his successful efforts to avoid service in the war.
"I said to him, 'I deeply respect what your father did, and I applaud it, but you don't know what you're talking about, and you can't know, 'cause you weren't there, and I hope you never have to learn.' "
The following night, Mr. Clinton made another appearance in the back of the plane, this time after a 16-hour day chasing votes in Louisiana. A reporter handed him a copy of the latest issue of "Weekly World News," the front page of which was dominated by a "world exclusive photo" of Mr. Clinton shaking hands with a slit-eyed creature the publication claimed was a visitor, and Clinton supporter, from another planet.
Laughing, the candidate examined the front page, and said, "I want you to know, I'm broadening my base." He added, "I promised you an inclusive Administration and this means it." Poking mild fun at his own rhetoric, he said, "I mean, we are all one family, right?"
A reporter mockingly accused Mr. Clinton of "intergalactic pandering" to secure the alien vote.
"Yes, I promised them I'd keep the space station," Mr. Clinton said.

U.S. Sues S.& L. Auditor for $400 Million

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
The Government filed a $400 million suit today against the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & Company, charging it with malpractice in the failure of a leading Houston savings institution, the Ben Franklin Savings Association.
The suit is the largest ever brought by the Resolution Trust Corporation against lawyers or accountants -- a key target in the Government's effort to make wrongdoers accountable for the multibillion-dollar savings and loan crisis. 
 The R.T.C., the Government's savings and loan cleanup agency, charged Arthur Andersen with professional negligence and breach of contract in auditing Ben Franklin between 1984 and 1988.
Ben Franklin collapsed in 1989 at a cost of almost $1 billion to taxpayers.
 
Deception Charged
 The suit contends that Andersen agreed to management's use of accounting gimmicks to hide a deteriorating financial condition, thus deceiving regulators and failing to alert anyone to the high level of risk.
An R.T.C. spokesman, Steve Katsanos, said the suit was significant because of "the extensive malpractice and negligence found." He said it was filed after months of futile negotiations between the R.T.C. and the Chicago accounting firm.
Arthur Andersen said in a statement that its professional services were not to blame for Ben Franklin's collapse and that the savings and loan's "problems were directly related to the collapse of oil prices in 1986 and other related economic forces affecting the Southwest at that time."
Arthur Andersen had issued caveats to its audit reports in 1986 and 1987 and declined to give an opinion on the accuracy of Ben Franklin's financial statements in 1988.
 
Litigation Increased
 Federal regulators in recent months have stepped up suits against lawyers, auditors and others who advised failed savings institutions. Resolution Trust, for instance, brought a $275 million suit against the New York law firm of Kaye Scholer Fierman Hays & Handler and froze its assets, forcing it into a $41 million settlement.
In the Andersen suit, filed in Federal court in Illinois, the Government contends the firm should have expanded the scope of its audits so it could assess Ben Franklin's risk level. Its parent, the investment banking and commercial real estate firm Security Capital Corporation of New York, which acquired it in 1981, was not experienced in the savings industry, the suit states.
Ben Franklin grew by buying a residential mortgage firm, pushing investments in high-risk adjustable mortgages with graduated payments and teaser rates, buying undeveloped land at inflated prices and lending to out-of-state commercial real estate projects, the suit said, financing all this by offering above-market interest rates to attract deposits.
"Andersen's acts or omissions concealed the true extent of Ben Franklin's financial problems and exacerbated the association's unhealthy condition," it said in the suit.

McDonnell Douglas Posts 50.6% Drop in Earnings

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, citing sharply higher research spending on a proposed 600-seat jumbo jet, said yesterday that second-quarter earnings dropped 50.6 percent, to $38 million, or $1 a share, from $77 million, or $2.01 a share, a year ago. Revenue in the quarter dropped 1.4 percent, to $4.89 billion, from $4.96 billion a year ago.
Analysts said the earnings were far below expectations for the St. Louis-based company, with many on Wall Street having expected earnings to exceed $2.25 a share. They said that negative factors besides the jumbo-jet project included sharply lower earnings from the C-17 military transport program and unexpectedly low earnings from the MD-11, the long-range civilian jet that competes with strong-selling products from Airbus, the European consortium. 
 The jumbo-jet project, known as the MD-12, was delayed earlier this summer. McDonnell Douglas, short on cash, could not find a financial partner to share the $5 billion development costs, and airlines did not seem enthusiastic about buying a new product while their industry was in recession.
 
Stock Price Suffers
 The market yesterday took 8.4 percent off McDonnell Douglas's stock price. It closed at $36.75 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, down $3.375.
McDonnell Douglas was once the world's second-largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft after Boeing, which has half of the commercial market. But McDonnell Douglas was quickly overtaken in the early 1990's by Airbus, which makes a wide variety of medium- and long-range jets that compete nearly across the board with Boeing. McDonnell Douglas now has about 20 percent of the market, about the same as Airbus, but with a much smaller backlog of orders than the Europeans.
The world's airlines wildly over-ordered aircraft in the late 1980's and in 1990; when the global recession hit, they furiously canceled orders. Much of their present fleet remains idle, making purchases extremely unlikely for some time. With military spending also slumping in the aftermath of the cold war, McDonnell Douglas finds itself in the painful position of trying to develop new aircraft at a time when few customers even want to buy its present models.
Jerry Cantwell, an aerospace analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company, said he had expected McDonnell Douglas to report earnings of about $2.25 a share and was surprised when they came in at $1.
Mr. Cantwell said that 60 cents of the shortfall were a result of lower revenues from the C-17 project, the giant plane that can carry jeeps and other planes for rapid deployment of military forces.
McDonnell Douglas said the $34 million charge it took for the C-17 was a result of increased costs and higher reserves for the project. Another 20 cents a share, or $11 million, came from a write-off in a laser communications program and lower earnings from the space station project.
Most surprising to Mr. Cantwell was the level of spending for the MD-12 jumbo-jetliner project, equal to 25 cents a share, or $14 million more than Mr. Cantwell had expected.
Also unexpected was another 10 cents to 20 cents in what Mr. Cantwell called "missing earnings" from the MD-11, one of the company's two lines of commercial aircraft. "I don't know why MD-11 isn't doing better," Mr. Cantwell said.
In the second quarter, commercial aircraft predominated, with revenue from civilian jets increasing 19.4 percent from the quarter a year ago, to $2.15 billion. McDonnell Douglas worked off its commercial backlog, which totaled $26.4 billion as of June 30, down 20 percent from the level a year earlier. But civilian-jet earnings dropped 62 percent, to $20 million, from the level a year earlier, mainly because of the MD-12 program.
Military aircraft revenue dropped 18.7 percent, to $1.74 billion, and earnings dropped 37.7 percent, to $66 million. Revenue from missiles and space systems rose 4 percent, to $820 million, while earnings dropped 18.6 percent, to $48 million.

HEADLINE: House, Tougher on Trade, Votes High Mini-Van Duties

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
With election-year pressure building in Congress for a more confrontational trade policy, the House voted today to raise the import duties on mini-vans and sport utility vehicles to 25 percent from 2.5 percent by reclassifying them as trucks instead of cars.
If it becomes law, the change would increase the retail price of imported mini-vans by an estimated $3,300 to $4,000. 
 In the Senate, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said in an interview that he planned to reintroduce a comparable measure that was vetoed by President Bush.
Mr. Bush has said he will veto the House bill as well if it is approved.
The lopsided House vote of 273 to 112 reasserted the lawmakers' desires to sound tough on trade. The House separately passed a broad trade bill three weeks ago. That measure would set strict deadlines for the Administration to impose sanctions on foreign countries that refuse to lower barriers to American exports.
On Thursday, the Senate amended this year's energy bill to tighten American trade laws. The amendment would make it more difficult for foreign companies to avoid paying punitive duties for dumping, or selling their goods at unfairly low prices.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, which writes trade laws, had blocked Senate action on trade legislation for the last several months, saying that he needed to consider the issue first and hold a series of hearings.
The Senate action Thursday came on a bill sponsored by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, in an attempt help the Smith Corona Corporation. The company announced last week that it was moving its typewriter manufacturing operations to Mexico from Cortland, in upstate New York. Smith Corona's chairman, G. Lee Thompson, complained then that his Japanese competitors were skirting the dumping laws by setting up plants in the United States, assembling imported parts here.
 
A Broader Measure
 The House bill was part of a broader measure renewing temporary tariff reductions for 240 categories of goods, mostly chemical compounds that are scarcely made in the United States but are needed by American industry to make other products.
Congressional budget rules require that new bills provide for gains in Federal revenues to offset any losses they might bring about. The Ways and Means Committee chose the tax on mini-vans and sport utility vehicles to balance the loss from the other tariff reductions.
Advocates of today's bill increasing duties on mini-van and sport utility vehicles pointed out that these vehicles are classified by the Government as trucks for purposes of emissions control and calculating the fuel economy of each auto maker's fleet. These vehicles also tend to be produced at truck plants on assembly lines also used to build pickup trucks, which are subject to the 25 percent tax.
The bill's mostly Republican opponents pointed out repeatedly during debate on the House floor that the United States would be breaking with an international practice of classifying the vehicles as cars. They also noted that the United States imposed its truck tariff, one of the world's highest, during a 1964 trade war with European countries that were restricting American chicken exports.
Only 23 Democrats and 89 Republicans voted against the bill today, while 206 Democrats and 66 Republicans supported it. Detroit's Big Three auto makers and the United Automobile Workers lobbied heavily in favor of the measure, while dealers in imported cars opposed it.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Food-Stamp Numbers Soar

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., July 31

 BODY:
In yet another sign of Connecticut's economic fall from grace, the nation's wealthiest state has seen the number of its residents receiving food stamps nearly double in the last three years.
The increase in food stamp recipients in Connecticut, which has been considerably steeper than that of either the nation as a whole or New York and New Jersey, is largely a function of the sharp reversal in the fortunes of a state whose economy was booming in the 1980's, experts say. 
 "When jobs were going begging in Connecticut, we had a smaller proportion of our population on food stamps than other states with higher unemployment rates," said Claudette Beaulieu, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Department of Income Maintenance, which administers the Federal program in the state.
While the number of food stamp recipients in the United States dipped slightly in May, according to Federal Government statistics released today, the 36.7 percent increase nationwide in the last three years -- from 18.8 million in 1989 to 25.7 million in 1992 -- has been far outpaced by the surge in Connecticut.
 
76.5% Rise in Connecticut
 In the state, the number of individuals receiving food stamps increased from May 1989 to this May by 76.5 percent. The 203,775 individuals on Connecticut's welfare rolls in May was nearly twice the total in May 1989, when there were 115,480 recipients. By comparison, in New York State, the numbers have increased 29.8 percent to 1,904,663 in May, from 1,467,463 in May 1989. In New Jersey, the numbers increased about 44 percent to 497,077, from 345,271.
Throughout Connecticut, state welfare officials and social workers say they have seen an unprecedented number of new applications for food stamps. They also say a striking number of recent applicants are unemployed or underemployed people who have never been on welfare and feel both desperation and shame at having to apply.
"We see people just like us every day," said Mary Ann Beauregard, a caseworker in the Stamford office of the Department of Income Maintenance. "It's frightening. People say they never would have expected this, and they hate being here."
Officials for the Agriculture Department's Food and Nutrition Service, which oversees the food stamps program, acknowledge that the sour economy is pushing more people into poverty.
But Harold T. McLean, the agency's Northeastern regional administrator, also said there were "a jumble of reasons" for the increase. He said they included simplifying the application process for food stamps, increased outreach by state welfare departments, particularly to the homeless, and changes in immigration laws that make former illegal aliens eligible for food stamps.
 
Qualifying for Food Stamps
 To be eligible for food stamps, net household income must be at or below the poverty level, which is defined for a family of four as $1,117 per month. Food stamps can be used to buy any foods other than prepared foods and alcohol, and the average monthly benefit per person is about $69.
Some Connecticut social workers believe that Connecticut's increase has been, at least partly, a consequence of the steep reduction in state General Assistance benefits that resulted from last year's budget cuts. Last October, the state put a $400 cap on what it would reimburse needy individuals for rent, and as of July 1, the maximum monthly cash benefits for an employable individual were cut to $314, from $515.
"Because aid was cut so drastically, some people may no longer be eligible for state financial assistance, so we tell them to apply for food stamps," said Cathy Gasparino, a senior social worker with the Greenwich Department of Social Services.
But Ms. Beaulieu of the Department of Income Maintenance said that most, if any, effects of the state cuts had not yet been felt.
Although the ranks of Connecticut residents on food stamps increased in every month from November 1989 through April, the largest increases occurred in 1990 and 1991, when the rolls swelled by 25 percent and 22 percent. In the first five months of this year, the number of recipients increased 4 percent.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday, with intermediate-term securities taking the hardest hits, after a fresh round of economic data suggested that the economy was slowly recovering.
The price of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell 13/32 point, or $4.06 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, was 7.45 percent, up from 7.42 percent late Thursday.
"Some of the numbers are begin 
 ning to look a little more robust," Paul McCormack, head government-securities trader at Chase Securities Inc., said of the economic numbers.
Mr. McCormack said dealers were afraid to be caught with heavy supply. If the economy improves, interest rates would move higher and erode the value of their investments.
Mr. McCormack said the heaviest selling was among the intermediate maturities, where the market has a heavy supply.
 
Factory Orders Rise
 In a sign that the United States economy may be picking up steam, the Government reported a stronger-than-expected 2.3 percent rise in June factory orders. Durable goods for June were revised to a gain of 2.7 percent from a previously reported 2.3 percent.
Personal income was reported flat in June, while economists had expected a downturn. Personal consumption rose five tenths of a percent, about even with expectations.
The Chicago Management Association's monthly index, a measurement of purchasing activity by the nation's companies, rose in July to 59.2 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis from 55.7 percent in June.
Somewhat offsetting those data was a report that the University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index fell to 76.6 percent in July, revised from an earlier estimate of 77.1 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term maturities fell between 3/16 and 5/16 point, intermediate maturities fell to between 7/16 and 11/16 point and long-term issues were down 13/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all Treasury issues outstanding with maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.54, to 1,262.68.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 3.24 percent as the discount remained stable at 3.18 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 3.36 percent as the discount rose 3 basis points, to 3.27 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 3.60 percent as the discount rose 4 basis points, to 3.47 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, The Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10011/32 , down 1/4 point. The average yield to maturity was 6.19 percent, up from 6.17 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Broad Decline While Gold Prices Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined yesterday on world currency markets after trading in a very narrow range throughout the session.
Gold prices rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery rose 90 cents to settle at $357.40 an ounce. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $357.50, up 80 cents an ounce. 
 The dollar should have drawn some support from a Commerce Department report that showed orders to United States factories jumped 2.3 percent in June, the best gain in 11 months and a hopeful sign that the economy was maintaining at least a modest pace of recovery. Economists had expected a rise of about 1.4 percent.
But further data proved to be conflicting. The Commerce Department said Americans' personal income failed to grow in June, which caused traders to question the pace of economic recovery.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 127.30 Japanese yen, from 127.77 yen at Thursday's close. Later in London, it was unchanged at 127.30 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 127.15 yen, down from Thursday's 127.50 yen.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9205, from $1.9185 late Thursday. In New York, it cost $1.9270 to buy one pound, more expensive than Thursday's $1.9260.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.4745 German marks, down from 1.4780; 1.3155 Swiss francs, down from 1.3165; 4.9800 French francs, down from 4.9895; 1,114.75 Italian lire, down from 1,116.75, and 1.1843 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1827.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.4805 German marks, down from 1.4825; 1.3185 Swiss francs, down from 1.3215; 5.0040 French francs, down from 5.0045; 1.6680 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6715; 1,119.25 Italian lire, down from 1,120.25, and 1.1842 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1828.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $357.75 a troy ounce, from $356.55 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $357.80 from $356.10. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.08 to close at a bid $357.67.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
New Withholding On Pension Plans

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
PEOPLE who take lump-sum distributions from qualified retirement plans beginning next year will find their money reduced by a 20 percent withholding tax, unless they arrange to have the plan administrator transfer the money directly to an I.R.A. or other qualified plan.
The new withholding, a result of legislation signed by President Bush last month and intended to pay for the extended unemployment benefits that Congress voted, will affect more people than just retirees. Often, people who leave jobs -- whether they are laid off or quit -- choose to take any funds they have vested in pension plans aslump sums to be rolled over into I.R.A.'s, rather than leave money in original plans and receive pensions from former employers at retirement. 
 At present, people have 60 days to roll such lump sums over into I.R.A.'s with no tax consequence. This allows people who have temporary cash-flow problems because of layoffs or job changes to dip into retirement funds, as long as they are able to pay themselves back and get the money into an I.R.A. in time.
But if they fail to get the money into an I.R.A. within 60 days, income taxes, and generally a 10 percent penalty for people under age 59 1/2, will be due. For residents of New York and other high-tax states, that can mean half the money goes to pay Federal and state taxes and penalties.
"By mandating the withholding, the new law encourages people who do not have an urgent need for the money to continue in some type of retirement plan," said Avery E. Neumark, a partner in Weber, Lipshie & Company, a New York-based certified public accounting firm. Many people who intend to get the money into an I.R.A. within 60 days fail to do so, he added, creating a problem that could be avoided by arranging a direct transfer.
But for people who need the money, he said, "it requires additional monitoring and planning." One possibility is to arrange to have the retirement-plan administrator transfer the money into an I.R.A., then withdraw money from the I.R.A. for up to 60 days. Annual tax-free I.R.A. rollovers of up to 60 days would still be allowed.
"People who have the option of taking a lump sum distribution this year or next may want to take it before the end of the year, when the rule goes into effect," Mr. Neumark said. "It's a planning opportunity."
Vincent D. Vaccaro, partner in charge of personal financial services at Coopers & Lybrand, cited another opportunity: the new law is more liberal than present law in allowing people who are leaving a job to take part of their vested retirement funds as a lump sum and have the plan administrator transfer the rest, even if it is less than half the total, to a defined contribution plan at a new employer or to an I.R.A.
Mr. Vaccaro added that he generally advised clients to keep money in qualified retirement plans, including I.R.A.'s and 401(k) plans, as long as possible to take advantage of tax-deferred compounding of interest. Most who are changing jobs want to move such funds into a defined contribution plan at a new employer, if possible, or into an I.R.A., he said, so the new law would impose no hardship.
"It's the financially unsophisticated who are going to get hurt," he said, the people who withdraw their retirement savings and then think about where to deposit them.
Mr. Neumark pointed out that for such people, the 20 percent withholding was not likely to cover the total tax liability. A person who is laid off midway through the year, for example, could receive six months of earned income and a severance package, as well as a distribution from the retirement plan. As a result, he or she could well be in the top Federal, state and local tax brackets and would also face the 10 percent penalty if under age 59 1/2. Such people would have to pay any taxes owed by the following April 15.
The 20 percent withholding will also apply to hardship distributions from 401(k) plans, which the law allows for specified needs, Mr. Neumark noted, so someone who needs $8,000 for a medical emergency, for example, would have to take out $10,000 because $2,000 would be withheld.
David A. Berenson, national director of tax policy for Ernst & Young in Washington, said, "One of the real sleepers is the cost of compliance." Employers have payroll withholding systems in place, he noted, and that means, essentially, that private business is paying accountants, bookkeepers and clerical staff to perform tax collection work.
"That's a very expensive compliance system," he said. And beginning in January, the additional withholding requirement will cause those expenses to grow, which can be significant for people who own their own businesses. Less directly, higher administrative costs will have an effect on how much people receive from defined contribution plans.

HEADLINE: Incentives Offered to First Chicago Trust

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration has offered a range of tax abatements and other financial incentives to the First Chicago Trust Company of New York, in an effort to keep it from moving its headquarters and 1,000 jobs to New Jersey.
City and bank officials said no agreements had been made yet. A First Chicago spokeswoman, Lisabeth Weiner, said the company was actively negotiating with the city, and was investigating alternatives to its headquarters now located in lower Manhattan. 
 She said the company may, in the end, renew its lease at 30 West Broadway, a 15-story building at the corner of Park Place. First Chicago's lease expires at the end of 1994. But Ms. Weiner said First Chicago Trust was also considering sites in New Jersey, downtown Brooklyn, midtown Manhattan and lower Manhattan.
The offer attracted attention at City Hall because First Chicago Trust's parent company has close ties to Barry F. Sullivan, the city's top economic development official. And the offer comes at a time when the city's real-estate glut has made it less dependent on offering subsidies to keep big business from fleeing to the suburbs or other states.
 
Unusual Arrangement
 The situation points out the difficulties of the unusual arrangement Mayor David N. Dinkins made when he appointed Mr. Sullivan as deputy mayor for economic development. Mr. Sullivan, the retired chairman of the First Chicago Corporation, receives a $780,000-a-year salary as a consultant to First Chicago. He has agreed to give his $112,000-a-year city salary to charity.
At City Hall, high-ranking officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said an intense campaign was under way to keep First Chicago Trust in lower Manhattan, or lure it to Brooklyn.
The officials also said the company was being offered tax abatements, subsidized electricity and other incentives that the city has offered corporations since the mid-1980's.
City officials said that Mr. Sullivan was not involved in the negotiations. He was recruited to serve as a deputy mayor by David Rockefeller, the chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank. He began serving under Mayor Dinkins in March, after retiring last year as the chairman of the First Chicago Corporation, which is based in Chicago and ranks among the nation's largest banks.
Mr. Sullivan joined the Dinkins administration with the stipulation that he would remain a consultant to First Chicago, and would avoid any conflict of interest by steering clear from business deals between New York City and his corporate employer. Many New York City business people applauded the arrangement as a way of attracting a nationally prominent business leader to a government job.
 
Pace of Relocations Slows
 "Barry Sullivan is simply not involved in this at all," said Carl Weisbrod, the president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the city's second ranking economic development official.
Mr. Weisbrod is negotiating with First Chicago Trust. In an interview, he declined to say what economic inducements were being offered to the company, saying only that "incentives have been discussed."
First Chicago Trust is one of the largest companies that processes stock transfers, computes and distributes dividend checks, distributes quarterly earnings statements and provides other corporate services.
If the company leaves New York City, real-estate experts said it would buck a trend, or at least the beginning of one. With rents declining, and landlords offering incentives to potential tenants, the pace of corporations leaving Manhattan has slowed sharply over the last two years.
Indeed, some experts in the real-estate industry have begun to suggest that public incentives from City Hall, an economic imperative of the 1980's, were becoming a waste of tax money in the 1990's.
But at City Hall, officials said negotiations with First Chicago, minus Mr. Sullivan, continued. And at First Chicago, Ms. Weiner said, "we are considering options."

HEADLINE: To Pick a Sofa, Lift It, Squeeze It and Don't Forget to Sit on It

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
Full of complicated secrets, difficult to keep out of sight and extremely long lived, the wrong sofa can cause as much frustration and as many tears as a neurotic relative who moves in and refuses to leave. Buying the right sofa, with a solid frame, top-quality cushions and a durable, good-looking fabric can involve intensive research, something not many consumers seem willing to undertake.
"People just sit on our sofas and say to themselves: 'Is it comfortable? Do I like the fabric? How much is it? I'll take it,' " said Mark Heidorn, the manager of the Door Store at Lexington Avenue and 53d Street.
 
Consumers Are Getting Wiser
 Only since the recession has the tide of swift sofa decisions shown real signs of receding. Comfort, style and price are still of great importance, but "people are starting to ask more technical questions than ever before," said Jeanie Viars, who works in fabric development and merchandising at Thomasville Furniture Industries, which has its headquarters in Thomasville, N.C. "There are so many things out there that are overpriced. You can put the most dynamite cover on something that just won't last." 
 Sofas vary tremendously in cost, shape, size and fabric. You can spend a few hundred dollars for a simple polyester-covered love seat to more than $10,000 for suede- and fabric-covered custom sectionals as long as limousines. Despite these variables, certain quality standards can be universally applied.
Manufacturers and consumer advocates alike recommend studying the furniture's frame first: long, graceful curves and other generous proportions are costly and tricky to build and thus indicate high quality. Then, lift one end of the sofa, to see if it feels unexpectedly light, or jiggles, sags or creaks as it is raised.
"Those are very bad signs," said John Kozloff, the general sales manager for Maurice Villency, and for Roche-Bobois in New York.
Another bad sign, he said, is the sales representative who cannot answer questions about the hidden construction details of the sofa. The frame should be made of a hardwood like maple or birch at least an inch and a quarter thick. Joints should be put together with screws, dowels and glue. This much strength may sound like overkill, but it will keep the sofa from falling apart during years of intensive use. The legs should be integral to the frame rather than simply screwed or glued on.
The frame should be not only sturdy, but also well padded (to make it comfortable for people to perch on sofa arms or backs and to keep the fabric from wearing prematurely). Squeeze the arms and back; the less frame you feel, the better. Feel for the springs, too; they should be bouncy and close together, whether they are spirals, the most expensive kind, or long S-shaped wires, which are tauter but no less durable.
Cushions should fit the frame without gaps or overcrowding, and should be made of a polyurethane foam, ideally one whose density is at least 1.8 pounds per cubic foot (sales representatives will be able to supply density statistics). Down is also acceptable, but is costly and can require constant fluffing. Shredded foam can lose its shape after minimal use and is best avoided, Consumer Reports said in its January 1989 article on buying upholstered furniture.
But even the fanciest springs and fillings will not always pass the ultimate test: sit on the sofa for a while and see how it feels. Consumer Reports recommends plopping down for up to 15 minutes, paying particular attention to the sofa's ability to support your back without pitching you forward. And be sure that the seats are not so low and deep you have trouble getting up from them.
 
What You See Is What You'll Get
 Cushion covers should fit their contents snugly, without loose corners. Seams and welts should be crisp and straight; so should skirts (ideally with a lining and weights, to maintain good form in the long run). Patterns should be symmetrical, both horizontally and vertically.
If the sofas in a store's showroom do not meet these standards, the sofa you order in some other fabric is not likely to be better.
Your final sofa decision, the fabric, can be the most difficult. Choices include nylon, polyester, cotton, linen, rayon, acrylic, wool and olefin (an especially inexpensive synthetic) as well as blends of any of the above, plus leather and vinyl. Every choice has advantages and disadvantages: synthetics can pill but otherwise wear fairly well; leather can get scratched but feels good against the skin, and vinyl washes easily but sticks to you.
Be sure to ask for the largest swatch the store can provide, so that you can get a good idea of how your fabric will look in sofa form. Take it home. You may even want to try sitting on the swatch to see if it is a pattern you will want to live with for a decade or two.

HEADLINE: A Globo-Cop No Longer

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis; Flora Lewis is Senior Columnist of The New York Times.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
It's like what Mark Twain said about the weather. Everybody talks about a coherent new U.S. foreign policy, and nobody makes one. Almost nobody. America's role in the coming era ought to be a lively part of the Presidential debates. So far it has been relegated to the question of experience in the old order, without clear ideas of how the U.S. should act in a world it cannot dominate by itself and cannot afford to ignore. That underlies all the floundering over Bosnia and Iraq.
Three little noticed Senate speeches by Joseph Biden, Democrat of Delaware, lay out a well-rounded concept for how to proceed, with legislative proposals. He starts with the evident truths that "domestic renewal must be the highest American priority" to assure a strong base and that the new agenda must have broad public support. He rejects isolationism and "America as globo-cop" as dangerous and probably impossible. "Our challenge," he says, "is to determine the nature of American internationalism." 
 And that, he suggests, must be a mission "to finish the job that Woodrow Wilson began," with a vision of collective security and of enlarging the definition of security to include economic well-being and environmental protection as well as defense.
Mr. Biden proposes a new definition of "containment," not aimed at an enemy power but at the spread of weapons of mass destruction. For that, he would seek an agreement with Russia on a ceiling of 500 nuclear warheads each (dramatically below levels now projected), and a ban on all nuclear tests and on production of weapon-grade fissile material. France, Britain and China would be asked to join a treaty setting strict limits on nuclear arsenals. India would be offered a permanent U.N. Security Council seat on condition of renouncing all nuclear arms ambitions, which would probably bring a similar pledge from Pakistan. Germany and Japan would also be offered permanent seats upon reconfirming their non-nuclear policies.
A bill on "weapons proliferation containment" would provide for a high-level U.S. official to oversee a coordinated policy against providing international benefits to all states in violation of nonproliferation standards. China would be denied most-favored-nation trade status if it continued arms sales that cause destabilization.
To strengthen security cooperation and help the U.S. generate international support for peacekeeping actions, Mr. Biden would seek agreement to make NATO forces available to the U.N. and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, in both of which the U.S. has a veto. NATO's integrated structure "constitutes an asset unique in the world," which should be put to new use, not left to atrophy, he rightly notes.
The U.N.'s capacity to act would be strengthened by implementing the Charter's provision for standing ear-marked forces, with 3,000 to 8,000 U.S. troops to be contributed at the President's discretion.
Mr. Biden proposes a National Security Budget Act that would put all foreign policy and defense spending in a single budget category. "Our national security is put more at risk by failing to fund the World Bank than by not buying another Seawolf sub," he said. A combined security budget would permit direct debate on whether arms or aid gave better protection.
The Senator's several legislative proposals add up to a balanced foreign policy committing the U.S. to act with others for peace and prosperity in a regular, predictable way. This is far-sighted. It should launch a needed debate.

HEADLINE: Indian Children Work in Family Economic Unit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 9 report on the purported widespread use of bonded child labor in the carpet manufacturing industry in Northern India, though compellingly written, gives an inaccurate picture of the true state of carpet manufacturing in India for two reasons: 
 (1) It relies on unsubstantiated (and unattributed) estimates of the actual magnitude of bonded child labor, and (2) it fails to note that children in India typically labor alongside adult family members in agriculture, carpet weaving and other economic activities, much as children did in 19th-century rural America.
Certainly, there is a problem of bonded child labor in India. However, to state that estimates of the children's work force "range from 300,000 to over a million" gives an impression that the problem is widespread and endemic in the carpet industry.
A visitor to the looms of Uttar Pradesh Province, India's bread basket, will see men, women and children working side by side on carpet looms. The overwhelming majority of the young people that one sees working on looms belong to a local family unit. They are paid a proper wage by their employer (and so are their parents). They go home at night with their parents, attend compulsory school regularly, and when they are not tying carpet knots, they are just as likely to help with the planting or harvesting of crops and the care of farm animals or of younger siblings.
Carpet weaving itself, though perhaps tedious work by Western standards, is neither dangerous nor exhausting (unlike the work you briefly mention that is done in "quarries, brass smelters, glass factories, and match and explosive plants"). No machines or chemicals are used, but only woolen yarn and hand-held tools.
All children in India are required to attend schools, a traveler in the weaving belt sees children in school throughout the countryside. Moreover, the Government of India has recently sponsored vocational centers in the carpet belt, where weaving skills, hygiene and academic subjects are taught.
The Government recognizes, in effect, that carpet weaving is an important and respectable source of income.

HEADLINE: Census Reveals Changes as It Paints a Picture of Metropolitan America

BYLINE: By Felicity Barringer

 BODY:
Some three decades after the word "megalopolis" started competing with its predecessor, "metropolis," for a place in the American consciousness, these unweildy mixtures of city, suburb and sprawl have become home to more than three-quarters of the American population, or 193 million people.
 While most people know a metropolitan area when they see it, the Census Bureau must apply legal criteria to decide where they begin and end. The legal definition requires at least two urban centers, specified rates of population growth and density, and specified commuting patterns. For laymen, it is enough to think of them as economically linked regions sharing traffic jams, sports teams, television stations and supermarket chains. 
 This week, the bureau released the 1990 census data for these areas, and simultaneously reported on the internal migration flows of the 1980s, explaining in part how the urban areas that dominate their states became what they are today.
 More than a third of the migration during the decade affected five large states -- New York, Florida, Michigan, Texas and California. Among the four regions, the ebb and flow of population was most clearly felt in the South: 11.7 million people moved in and another 10 million (sometimes the same people) moved out from 1980 through 1989.
 Buried in the population report, beneath the news of gains in the South and West and losses in the Northeast and Midwest, may be the kernel of another trend. Year by year during the 1980s, the West and South attracted fewer people and exported increasing numbers, slowing their net growth rates. Year by year, the Northeast and Midwest stabilized or reduced their losses, while the number of people they attracted slowly increased.
 One of the report's authors, Larry Sink, suggested these figures may eventually be seen as the beginning of the end of westward migration, the signature tune of American demography.

 CORRECTION:
An article and a chart on Saturday about the 1990 census gave differing rates of population growth for the New York metropolitan area during the 1980's. The rate of 3.1 percent, cited in the article, reflects growth in the area when its boundaries are held constant. The rate of 12.2 percent, listed in the chart, reflects growth when the area is expanded beyond its 1980 boundaries, to 1990 boundaries as defined by the Census Bureau.

HEADLINE: The Comeback Trail

BYLINE: By Ian Fisher

 BODY:
IT WAS ALMOST by chance that Patty Galliardo returned to high school. When she was 14 years old her Mexican-American family moved back to Los Angeles after a few years in Mexico, but she did not go back to school. She had forgotten whatever English she had learned.
There were other obstacles, too. Like most dropouts, Ms. Galliardo had a vague notion that she ought to get her diploma. But she had hated school -- the teachers did not care, she said -- and after so long an absence from the classroom she did not know where to turn. Then a friend, also a dropout, told her about an out-of-school program that offered a flexible schedule, a close relationship with teachers and, most important, a clear path to earning her degree. 
 "First of all, my tutor, she was nice and understanding," Ms. Galliardo, now 20, said in a recent interview. "I liked her and I could talk to her and really tell her what problems I had since it was only me and her."
Ms. Galliardo's path to her diploma, one she is still treading, illustrates many of the problems facing students who have already dropped out of school. In an educational system that pours most of its money into dropout prevention, the recovery of those who do drop out is largely overlooked.
But Ms. Galliardo's experience with a Los Angeles program called Options for Youth, which over the last five years has brought in 6,000 students who had dropped out, also demonstrates the potential of innovative school re-entry programs, many educational experts say. They say that the alternative -- ignoring dropouts as lost educational causes -- is both dangerous and costly.
 
A Population Destined for Trouble
 "You have to have the courage to find the funding for both prevention and for young people who have already left school," said Toni D. Schmiegelow, executive director of the City Volunteer Corps, a volunteer service and educational program in New York City where nearly two-thirds of the participants are school dropouts. Unless both prevention and re-entry are attempted, Ms. Schmiegelow said, the young people who are not trying to complete their education "are going to get in trouble and end up in the criminal justice system."
According to the National Dropout Prevention Center at Clemson University, in Clemson, S.C., 83 percent of all prison inmates are school dropouts.
The center's director, Jay Smink, said that focusing only on reaching students who are at risk of dropping out of school can mean giving up thousands of youngsters as lost. "They not only drop out of school," Mr. Smink said. "For most cases, they drop out of society. In the very worst cases they do become jobless, they do run away from home or become homeless, or they are floating somewhere in society."
Mr. Smink said that most students in danger of dropping out can be identified in junior high or before; so most of the money -- he estimates between two-thirds and three-quarters -- is aimed at preventing the problem.
But even with the best intentions, the best programs and the best counseling, school systems have trouble finding students who have left school, let alone bringing them back into class.
David E. Engel, professor emeritus at the University of Pittsburgh, said that when he tried recently to contact 48 dropouts by mail for a study in Pittsburgh, half the letters were returned with the addressee unknown. Professor Engel said that he and staff members could reach only two of the dropouts by telephone. When they finally set up one interview, the young man never showed up and his telephone, researchers found, had been disconnected.
"At that point," Professor Engel recalled, "we said, 'What in the world do we do?' You have to be a private detective to track down these people."
Professor Engel's study, which is not complete, focuses on dropouts who returned to school, or to a General Equivalency Diploma program, through the Pittsburgh Job Corps. He said he found a strong will among the students to return.
 
'Economic Reasons' the Biggest Factor
 "I would say that economic reasons, employment, were the largest single factor by far" that explained this determination to complete their education, he said. "I don't think there were any in our group who returned for the love of learning."
Professor Engel added: "These kids are much more serious in terms of the future. I think that they have begun to learn the good old middle-class value of delayed gratification."
That is why successful recovery programs, many of which are private partnerships with public schools, frequently pair course work with practical training that can help school dropouts find jobs. Some programs, for example, require students to take classes in computer literacy or other vocational training. Many, like Options for Youth in Los Angeles, offer mentoring and independent study for students who may work or have other reasons they cannot attend a regular school.
Of the 2,000 students Options for Youth served last year, 45 percent were school dropouts; others had been expelled, were teen-age mothers without day care or had fallen far behind in course work. At the end of the year, roughly a third had dropped out of the program, but 800 returned to regular school and the balance remained in the program working on their degrees.
The techniques adopted by dropout recovery and re-entry programs are often similar to those used in prevention programs in that they focus on the individual student and try to build self-esteem and confidence. "Really what we do is ask the question, 'Why are you here, why are you on this earth?' " said Pam Hall, a co-founder of Options for Youth. "We help them develop a dream. What we have found is that these kids have not been able to dream since they were 10 years old."
 
Teen-Age Mothers Show Motivation
 Not surprisingly, the programs work best for students who find that dream or who discover a reason to better themselves. One group that does especially well are teen-age mothers, like Elsa Cervantes, now 22, who is married and living in Los Angeles and who wants to attend college. Ms. Cervantes dropped out of San Fernando High School at age 14 when she had her first baby, and returned four years later with help from Options for Youth.
"It was something I wanted for my children," she said. "I didn't want them to say, 'You dropped out of school.' "
Ms. Cervantes graduated in 1990 and made sure her family had a camera at the ceremony. "I wanted proof, pictures and everything," she said.

HEADLINE: Bridging a Gap

BYLINE: By Roberto Suro

 BODY:
IT'S MIDSUMMER, the season when untold numbers of students quietly decide to take an extended, and often permanent, leave of education. Having graduated from middle school in June, they simply do not show up for high school next month.
No educator can reliably predict which students in the spring will become the dropouts of summer, since these youngsters disappear without a whimper and with no warning. And no agency or research group has their measure, since most dropout statistics deal with the high school years. But many middle-school administrators -- especially in low-income areas -- know the reality and have the anecdotes and the data to prove it. 
 "Look at your neighbor," Joe Trevino, principal of Edison Middle School in Houston's dominantly Hispanic East End, told graduating eighth graders in May. "Unfortunately the statistics tell us that between the two of you, only one is going to graduate from high school."
 
A Temptation to Blame the Children
 In response, some school districts across the nation are instituting "bridge programs." The services vary but the object is the same: to carry students through the summer between middle school and high school by bolstering their academic weaknesses, acquainting them with a new school culture and a new style of learning, and sometimes offering them money to stick with school. But these programs are still the exceptions.
"The temptation is to blame the kids, but they are just indicators of how poorly most schools handle the transition from middle school to high school," said Joyce L. Epstein, co-director of the Center on Families, Communities, Schools and Children's Learning at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
There is no way to measure how many students drop out after middle school because most school systems focus on high school dropouts, calculating the difference between the number of youngsters in ninth grade and the number who graduate four years later.
The Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics will start tracking dropouts from seventh through 12th grades in the coming school year. But several grim estimates already have emerged from a study published by the center in April: Some 6 percent of all eighth graders, and nearly 15 percent of eighth graders categorized as being of low economic status, had left school before completing 10th grade. These calculations were based on an ongoing survey of more than 24,000 students nationwide, which began in 1988 when those students were in eighth grade.
Although school systems are organized in many types of grade spans, nearly three-quarters of all public school students make the move to high school after eighth grade, according to Ms. Epstein. This transition period is attracting scholarly attention, as educators question the structure of a system that often treats students like children through junior high or middle school, then abruptly asks them to act like young adults.
It is a time, too, when "students reach a real break point in their education," said Robert Crain, a researcher at the National Center for Research on Vocational Education, at Columbia University's Teachers College.
"Suddenly they are confronted with a choice," Mr. Crain said, "and given that opportunity, some just decide not to go on." Not going on, middle school administrators add, is particularly attractive to students from low-income and immigrant communities, who are often 16 or 17 years old instead of the standard age of 14, having started late, missed years or been held back.
Mr. Trevino agreed that summer after eighth grade is a dangerous season. "When they come here, they are still little kids, and I think it is hard for them to leave," he said. "But by the time they finish they feel grown up. Over this summer they are so disconnected that it's easy for them to forget about school."
Addressing his school's graduating class in May, Mr. Trevino tried to offer an educational fact of life that would be hard to forget: that society's chain of prerequisites moves from high school graduation to college diploma to a good job. And over and over, he came back with the same plea, "The first thing you have to do is show up when school starts in August."
But for many students at Edison, as elsewhere, jawboning isn't enough. Mr. Trevino said that some will move on from Houston to another American city or back to Mexico or Central America, which is common along the border states; many others will have to work to help support their families. As for others, "I wish I had the answer," he said. "I really wish I did."
 
Half Make an Effort to Curb Dropouts
 A survey of 2,400 principals whose schools include a seventh grade found that about half conduct some kind of program to stop this volatile mass from dropping out, said Ms. Epstein, who helped conduct the study. Most bridge programs involved inexpensive activities: middle-school students visiting high schools for an introduction to the building and curriculum, or meetings among administrators and counselors from both schools, to provide continuity in oversight.
Thirty-one percent of the schools in the study went slightly further, bringing parents into high schools so they would understand what their children face and to draw them into participating in these children's education. Thirteen percent of the schools held summer sessions for recent middle-school graduates at their new high school -- everything from Introduction to High School 101 to highly structured academic programs.
One academic program is conducted in Houston by Jefferson Davis High School and the middle schools that feed into it. For 20 days of summer, up to 150 incoming ninth graders go to the high school for help in math, reading and writing. The visits also enable students to become familiar with the campus and its curriculum. Local companies pay for their fall school supplies, amusement park tickets and a $5-a-day stipend.
For Charles Perez Jr., the inducements worked. A 14-year-old at Houston's Marshall Middle School, he was worried about his weak grades. Now he says: "I'm sure I'll finish school. I'm not worried about myself."
But inducements are not always enough. Charles has at least two friends who won't be joining him at Jefferson Davis in the fall. "One needed to get a job," he said, "and the other just didn't like school because he was 16 already and too old for his class."
 
Some Must Work to Help Families
 Lois Range, director of the program, said, "Believe it or not, some eighth graders have to work to support their families, and what we offer is just not enough." Last year, with an organized recruitment effort involving teachers, local business executives and community organizations, Jefferson Davis drew 132 students, Ms. Range said. This year, without a similar effort, only 49 students signed up.
Since 1985 the public schools in Portland, Ore., have participated in an ambitious bridge effort, the Summer Training and Education Program, developed by Public/Private Ventures, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit organization that focuses on low-income youths. For seven weeks, eighth and ninth graders identified as coming from low-income families spend four mornings a week taking classes in the high school, and afternoons working for nonprofit organizations. Public and private money finances the program and a stipend for students.
Replicated in more than 100 communities nationwide, Step serves more than 20,000 students at a cost of approximately $2,000 per student, and has yielded encouraging results, such as improved student test scores. "Kids do well while they are involved," said Kurt Shovlin, who coordinates Step in Portland. "They increase their skills in reading and math and have a lower incidence of teen parenting. The dropout rate is lower overall while the kids are involved."
But without continued support for youngsters who cross the bridge into high school, the effects of Step fade. "The fact of the matter is that short-term programs do work," said Michael Bailin, president of Public/Private Ventures. "The problem is that there is no quick fix. The environment from which kids come and their circumstances will ultimately prevail."

In the U.S., Silenzio on the Set

BYLINE: By ANDY MEISLER; Andy Meisler has written about television for TV Guide and California magazine.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
If "A Fistful of Dollars" and those other Italian shoot-'em-ups were spaghetti westerns, what is "Lucky Luke"? This 10-episode comedy western series, made for Italian television, is based on a popular French-language comic book, used American writers and a mostly American cast (including guest stars like Julie Hagerty, Madeline Kahn and John Saxon), and was produced and directed by the Italian actor Terence Hill, who also stars.
But unlike those old Clint Eastwood movies, which were filmed in Italy, "Lucky Luke" was shot in English just outside Santa Fe, N.M. 
 "I couldn't find a better place to make it," says Mr. Hill, who changed his name (from Mario Girotti) to be seen as an Italian actor with an American connection. Mr. Hill has been a major star in Europe for three decades, mostly for his portrayal, in Italian movies, of prototypical American cowboys, gangsters and detectives. "The people who financed 'Lucky Luke' wanted to shoot it in Spain, but I convinced them otherwise."
Indeed, in the last few years, he and several other veterans of the spaghetti wars have gone straight to the source for their Americanized adventures. Instead of producing American-style films and programming in Europe, some Italian film makers now find it economically wiser to transplant themselves to America. In the bargain they get a chance to match their European views of American culture with authentic American settings.
While there is no single source that counts Italian productions made in this country, the number appears to have grown. According to William Immerman, a film producer and attorney who handled negotiations for "Lucky Luke" and other Italian projects, "Based on the activities of my clients, there has been a great increase in the number of movies and TV programs made here using Italian crews working side by side with Americans. I'm aware of at least 10 in the last two years."
Recent examples include "Extralarge," a detective series for Italian television that was shot entirely in Miami and stars the Italian actor Bud Spencer (formerly Carlo Pedersoli) and Philip Michael Thomas, late of "Miami Vice." "Gilda," a made-for-TV movie about a businessman who buys a Hollywood studio, was filmed partly in Los Angeles. "Un Amore Americano," a mini-series starring Brooke Shields and the Italian actor Carlo Bellepiane, was shot in Iowa and Illinois.
Italian audiences have enthusiastically embraced the hybrids. "Normally, people love these westerns and gangster movies," says Allesandra Comazzi, entertainment editor for the Italian newspaper La Stampa. "Actors like Terence Hill and Bud Spencer are loved in Italy. And the view of the United States makes the appeal greater."
An Italian television network executive based in the United States says: "American culture is very big in Italy. Sometimes I think it's even bigger over there than it is here. And you have to remember that for the last 10 or 15 years, American shows like 'Hunter' and 'MacGyver' and even the old 'Starsky and Hutch' were very popular. By shooting in America, they spin off the popularity of those shows." (He declined to be identified because his job is to interest American television companies in co-producing movies and mini-series in Italy.)
Made-for-Italy productions are usually edited there, where the English soundtracks are dubbed in Italian. "This is not a problem," insists Mr. Hill. "Dubbed American movies are part of our culture."
The phenomenon is not entirely new. Sergio Leone made movies entirely or in part in the United States, as has Lina Wertmuller. But recently, several factors have speeded up the movement west: American films are becoming more popular abroad as the film business grows increasingly international (several Italian film companies have opened American subsidiaries); in addition, business-hungry towns far from Hollywood extend warm welcomes to foreign film crews.
"Europe is very expensive now," says Antonio Avati, a 20-year veteran of the Italian movie business. "So it's possible to make films in America very cheap."
Cheap, of course, is a relative term in film making. Favorable exchange rates, nonunion American crews and cooperative local film commissions enable Italian film makers to export their own personnel and equipment and shoot for about the same amount they would spend in Europe -- with the bonus of authentic American locations. The cost, on average, is $2 million each hour episode, twice as much as Americans spend.
Mr. Avati spends six months each year in Davenport, Iowa, where his company, Duea Films, has an office. In the last three years, he and his brother Pupi, who writes and directs, have filmed four movies for both theatrical release and television in and around Davenport. Why there?
"During the 60's my brother was a clarinet player in a traditional jazz band," Mr. Avati says. "He has this very, very great love for the music of Bix Beiderbecke, and we wanted to make a film about his life." Because Beiderbecke was born in Davenport, the two men went there to scout locations and solicit financial backing.
"Believe it or not, we found that we could buy the house in which Bix Beiderbecke was born," says Mr. Avati. "We shot part of the film in it." Afterward, they left the house as a shrine and set up an office in Davenport.
The American Gothic scenery and the Iowa summer heat add a realism not easily achieved on a Los Angeles sound stage.
Although most of the Italian productions are offered to distributors in the United States, it is unlikely many Americans will ever see them. Networks here traditionally have little use for obscure foreign films or 6- to 10-episode television series (the normal European length).
Also, in most instances, the content wouldn't play here. For example, Mr. Hill's "Lucky Luke," like many of the new hybrid productions, is a slightly cockeyed look at the old Hollywood frontier myths. "It's sort of a cross between 'Cat Ballou' and 'Mr. Ed,' " Mr. Immerman says. Mr. Hill plays Lucky Luke, a sheriff who can draw his gun faster than his own shadow, an ability duly demonstrated via editing. His faithful horse, Jolly Jumper (voice courtesy of the country singer Roger Miller), acts as a narrator of sorts, making wry comments only the audience can hear. Occasionally he bursts into song.
Lucky Luke's girlfriend is played by Nancy Morgan, an American actress who is married to the actor John Ritter. "I met the original artist of the Lucky Luke comic books," Ms. Morgan recalls, "and he told me that when he was a little boy in Belgium he had gone weekly to see Tex Ritter movies." Tex Ritter was Ms. Morgan's father-in-law.
The set felt different from that of most American productions, she says. For one thing, the usual catered buffet was missing. But there were compensations. "Every afternoon at four, the wife of Amadeo, our transportation coordinator, would come over and make vast quantities of espresso."

American Dance Festival: A Far-Reaching Beacon

BYLINE: By Anna Kisselgoff

 BODY:
At the American Dance Festival in Durham, N. C., last month, no one batted an eyelash when a young Maori woman from New Zealand joined her American, Norwegian and Czechoslovak counterparts in a work by Liz Lerman, a choreographer from Washington.
Once focused almost exclusively on modern dance in the United States, the festival has lately had a more pronounced international accent. This summer, Americans still dominated the student body and performance series at the festival's home on the Duke University campus: Pilobolus led off the season, and the Paul Taylor Dance Company wound it up last weekend. 
 But there was also an emphasis on choreographers from Spain and Latin America, some of whom were part of the International Choreographers Workshop that the festival established in 1984 with the United States Information Agency. To call the workshop a phenomenal success would be an understatement. In many ways, it is an extension of the festival's historic role.
When Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey and other pioneers of American modern dance gathered each summer at the festival's precursor at Bennington College in Vermont in the 1930's, it was to teach and choreograph in a community of their own. Modern dance was then a burgeoning art form and far from being accepted in the United States.
At the festival in Durham, the interchange is now on an international level. There are striking parallels between American modern dance's early struggle for recognition and the situation abroad today. Choreographers who depart from tradition in Asia, Africa, Latin America and especially Eastern Europe, where ballet has been dominant, often feel isolated and like underdogs.
An Israeli choreographer, Anat Daniely, recently thanked the festival's director and associate director, the husband and wife team of Charles and Stephanie Reinhart, for providing a place where she could be "understood."
The concept of the festival as an international haven for those who wish to choreograph and study is not limited by geography. The festival is expanding its "mini-ADF" projects, in which teachers and companies travel to other locales.
ADF/Moscow (Aug. 31 to Sept. 13), a true experiment, will expose Russians for the first time to a concentration of American modern-dance classes and performances. The model here is the distilled package of companies and wide-ranging classes sent to Japan in 1984 and 1986. This will also be the third year that ADF/Seoul is taking place in Korea (for two weeks, through Aug. 14).
The most unexpected twist in this expanded activity is the new three-week mini-festival (through Aug. 21) in Salt Lake City at the University of Utah. Among the 10 companies will be four Latin American groups, whose choreographers attended the International Choreographers Workshop.
The most striking response to all these efforts occurred last weekend, when the 11 Latin American choreographers in Durham announced the formation of a committee to share information and training among dancers in Central and South America, while remaining linked to the festival. They wrote: "Dance in Latin America is a necessity of expression that has been systematically sidelined, repressed or adulterated according to religious, economic, political or social interests." Expressing a wish to go beyond "forms implanted by Western civilization," the writers said, "we want to rediscover what is ours . . . to recover the authentically Latin American."
The tone was polemical and politicized. The Reinharts, however, view this manifesto as an expression of social activism that is now current in American modern dance as well (AIDS themes being the most obvious example).
The fight against injustice as they see it, the Latin choreographers suggest, can take many forms. One of the signers, Susana Reyes from Ecuador, danced two solos that were clearly in tribute to Indian populations of the Andes. Yet artistry raised them above propaganda. "Internal Beauty of Woman" offered a portrait of feminine strength, an image of an Andean woman in her various aspects: mother, wife and peasant. "Flight of the Curiquingue," which refers to an Andean bird, included fleeting allusions to Indian stamping rhythms. But the idiom was personal and put a creative gloss on mimetic rituals.
Jimmy Ortiz from Costa Rica offered a more direct social critique in his "Historias de Flosculos." A program note spoke of "the internal world of Costa Rica today." But Mr. Ortiz's evocation of a decadent society finally caught in a downpour of sand is a warning to any social elite.
Although too long, the piece was full of movement ideas. Miss Reyes tended to use a conventional dance flow. But Mr. Ortiz and his company, Losdenmedium, fused abstract gestures with technical bravura and rough-and-tumble partnering. Like so much Latin American fiction, the piece had a hallucinatory atmosphere, and Mr. Ortiz's refusal to structure movement logically contributed to this impression.
A footnote: The intermingling of dance cultures that the festival has furthered so innovatively is documented in the powerful photographs that Jay Anderson has taken of foreign and American choreographers since the festival moved in 1978 to Duke from Connecticut College (to which it transferred in 1948 from Bennington). A new festival booklet, "ADF Durham: The First 15," demonstrates again that Mr. Anderson's performance shots are among the best around.

The Not Ready for Prime Time Conventions

BYLINE: By Walter Goodman

 BODY:
Since the producers of the made-for-television extravaganza that opens in Houston this month have the luxury of going second (the only luxury they seem to enjoy at the moment), they have no excuse for not picking up tips from the laggard ratings of last month's Democratic exercise in New York. Here then, in a nonpartisan effort to help the Republicans put on a better show, are some suggestions.
The Democrats' theme of unity was a dramatic disaster. What viewer wants unity in prime time? The most inspiriting moments in Madison Square Garden were produced by supporters of Jerry Brown, the noncomforming, nonsupporting candidate who provided a semblance of news to occupy network reporters for a couple of nights. 
 So when the convention begins, two weeks from tomorrow, the Republicans will want to give some prime time to the debate on abortion. And Republican losers like Pat Buchanan and David Duke can help disperse the smog of gentleness and kindness that might otherwise send viewers to "The Simpsons." Why not invite Mr. Duke's admirers to parade in costume?
On the other hand, prudence and taste suggest that some Republican figures be kept off the podium and, if possible, out of the state. The Democrats were not careful enough in this regard. Even as they were distancing themselves from Washington insiders, they allowed Jim Wright, the former Speaker of the House, whose political career is as bankrupt as some of his acquaintances' savings-and-loan associations, to take a chair in the Texas delegation, where the cameras could catch him.
The model for Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle to imitate is the discreet Mr. Gore, who managed never to be caught within a city block of Edward I. Koch, his chief New York supporter in his unimpressive try for the 1988 Presidential nomination. The Republicans would be especially well advised to make sure that John Sununu, the limousine conservative, is kept off the premises. That could be difficult since Mr. Sununu, who used to lord it over the White House staff, has replaced Mr. Buchanan as a resident noisemaker on CNN's "Crossfire" and so can flaunt press credentials. A glimpse of him on convention nights might stir some irritating memories among taxpayers.
In this season of the outsider, the Republicans, now in the 12th year of their White House incumbency, will have to strain to present themselves as the dispossessed, particularly without the speech-writing skills of Peggy Noonan, who has said she will not serve the re-election team. The woman who turned on those thousand points of light four years ago would have had no trouble dimming a little history.
Enter Ronald Reagan. As the incarnation of the Republican heyday, he will be acclaimed in the Astrodome, where he is scheduled to appear on opening night. But the significant audience, of course, is out there, in front of the television set, and the message seems to have gotten around that something went awry during what Democrats like to call the Reagan-Bush Administration.
No problem. The Great Communicator, who could deny or forget Iran-contra and so much else without endangering his popularity, should be able to ignore unemployment, the national debt and other inconveniences in his famous tube-friendly way.
Family values promise to be the hot theme in Houston. Unlike Mr. Clinton, neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Quayle has come up with a sibling who is a recovering alcoholic. Moreover, they will have to compete with the pictures of the Clinton and Gore clans; all those blonds can really fill a stage.
Unfortunately for Mr. Quayle, his brood (three children) is slightly outnumbered by Mr. Gore's (four), and he is in no political position to deliver a testimonial to family planning. Still, the Vice President can always charge the Gore children with having elitist skills in spelling. That should go over, since so few Americans really like people who can spell.
Mr. Bush has five children to Mr. Clinton's solitary Chelsea, not to mention a dozen grandchildren. But at least one Bush son has been soiled by the savings-and-loan finaglings, raising the question of just what sort of values were passed along in this family.
The safest move here is to keep everybody behind the ample skirts of Barbara Bush, of whom no Democrat dares say an unkind word. For purposes of distraction, a sly reference to Gennifer Flowers (not, of course, by the President himself) may be passed on to a reporter, and that accommodating subject can be counted on to make herself available to any cameras that show up.
With little to celebrate in terms of domestic accomplishments, convention planners are bound to fall back on the war in the Persian Gulf. A stirring short movie can be concocted out of television clips of smart weapons and victory parades, or maybe a made-for-television drama, with Schwarzenegger playing Schwarzkopf. Better still, an air strike on Baghdad, cameras invited, could be scheduled for nomination night.
One final annoyance: the Democrats, in their convention and immediately after, as they sped from east to midwest, projected youth and energy. Mr. Bush, well known for not having noticed the recession until it was a year or so old, has not been a vision of vigor.
What to do? Easy. Show the war movie twice. America is accustomed to summer reruns.

The Riverfront Plan Shifts to Low Gear

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
THIS city's plan for a single cohesive riverfront development has been ambushed by a recession, slack demand for new housing and the travails of a real estate market in decline.
Instead of high-rise apartment and office towers at the Delaware River's edge, the parcels have sprouted smaller, less expensive projects that go up quickly, like restaurants, nightclubs and open-air markets.
They provide a modest income for some owners of property that otherwise would have lain fallow, as well as jobs in what is emerging as a regional playground and shopping center. 
 Two years ago, a city agency, the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation, envisioned not only the complexes of high-rise office and residential towers, but also office buildings and hotels. These were to have bracketed Penn's Landing public space and to have been connected by an esplanade.
But after Willard Rouse, the Philadelphia development company, withdrew in early 1989, convinced there was no way to make the 37-acre project profitable, smaller developers took on parts of the development.
Five new nightclubs or restaurants have opened this summer. And two weekend flea markets have opened, the larger covering an acre beneath multicolored tents at Vine Street and the north side of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, which spans the river between Philadelphia and Camden, N.J.
The other, the RiverMarket site on the river's edge near Tasker Street and Delaware Avenue, totals 18 acres, not all of which is now used. The market opened during the Fourth of July weekend and has not yet reached its peak.
AT least two planned residential developments have been shelved. One, Portside, envisioned as 286 high-rise condominium units, ran aground for lack of financing even before any physical work was done. And at Liberty Landing, a $300 million mixed-use development that last year was being re-evaluated for the combination of office, housing and hotel elements, weeds have nearly obscured the optimistic blue sign announcing the project, which also never even reached the groundbreaking stage.
The only housing actually built was not started from scratch but was a renovation at two municipal piers, 3 and 5, which jut into the river with a marina between them just south of the bridge.
The former was converted into 96 fee-simple town houses, the latter into 172 rental apartments, by a joint venture of three Philadelphia partners, Silver Harting & Company, the Edward S. Brown Group and the Radnor Corporation. The rentals range from one to three bedrooms, with rents of $700 to $3,000 a month.
Rudy Hanisch, a Radnor senior vice president, said that six town house units were presold and that they got a lukewarm reception when they went on sale shortly after completion in 1990, selling out only after prices were cut to below market value.
"This case is illustrative of the cyclical nature of real estate," he said. "We made the decision to go forward in 1987, real estate values peaked in 1988 and by the time we delivered the units in 1990 the cycle was declining."
Instead of the $300,000 market value the company predicted, the units sold for an average price of $170,000 earlier this year, part of a $1.3 billion write-off taken by Radnor's parent company, the petroleum giant Sun Company, Mr. Hanisch said. From its peak in 1988, real estate values dropped by 30 percent by 1991 in Center City.
Sales of luxury condominium units slowed at the same time, to under 200 closings downtown at more than $150,000, he said.
"We came to the conclusion that we had a disproportionate percentage of the market and had to sell them below cost," Mr. Hanisch said. "I'm personally bearish on real estate values and levels of activity in the Delaware Valley for the rest of the decade. America's appetite for the good life has slowed."
Mr. Hanisch said the grand riverfront plans predicted for 30 years by city officials were expensive and came apart just as demand for new offices and housing was softening throughout the region.
The downtown feeling of Philadelphia neighborhoods like Rittenhouse Square and Society Hall is not available on the waterfront because it is severed from the city by Interstate 95, despite bridges for pedestrians and vehicles.
A brief drive along Delaware Avenue offers many sights that suggest the state of flux on the riverfront. Tropical theme bars look out on dredge barges moored on the New Jersey side and on a state prison in Camden. Orange and tan self-storage lockers line one side of the six-lane street across from the tony Katmandu nightclub.
One pier near Spring Garden Street is used for a trash transfer station and storage yard for city garbage trucks, another is the city's main impounding lot for towed cars.
Still, the Comfort Inn, with 180 rooms at the south end of the Ben Franklin Bridge near Penn's Landing, about a 10-minute drive from Center City, had an occupancy rate in 1991 somewhere above 70 percent, when the rest of the city was in the mid 60's, said a hotel industry analyst, Peter Tyson, of Peter Tyson & Associates.
EVEN the name Delaware Avenue was changed to Columbus Boulevard by the City Council, despite public opposition, to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage.
Yet most highway signs still direct motorists to Delaware Avenue and there is no plan to change them.
Highway access has been the lifeline for such projects as the Riverview Plaza, a $30 million retail center farther south near warehouses and plants that once served the city's thriving port and manufacturing, both of which have been withering for years.
Bart Blatstein and Marc Haber, principals of Tower Investment, bought a narrow parcel between Tasker Street and Washington Avenue on the landlocked side of Delaware Avenue knowing that an exit ramp from I-95 would be able to bring motorists to their doorstep.
The 150,000-square-foot center includes a multiscreen movie theater that opened last November and draws people from both states. There are 30,000 square feet of occupied offices space in Riverview Plaza, with a potential for 220,000 more in a vacant warehouse, according to Mr. Blatstein. There is also a Staples office products store and several restaurants, food shops and small stores. Plans have been drawn for a second retail component across Delaware Avenue in a former sugar refinery.
"There were no movie theaters at all in South Philadelphia, so people went over the Walt Whitman Bridge to South Jersey," Mr. Blatstein said. "Residential may not be an important part of the waterfront. The holding actions may be a year, it could be 10 years. If they're making money, why tear it down to build housing?"
Indeed, although planning maps still indicate that Marina Towers will rise where the Katmandu nightclub now stands, the club's owners are fashioning their own long-term expansion plans. Three partners, Stuart Harting Lance Silver and David Preefer, were involved in the Pier 3 and 5 project and said they see potential for new hotel or conference center facilities, but not residential growth.
Among the factors that have fueled growth along the riverfront are Camden's aquarium, which opened in February, and a new ferry service linking the two cities. Most vital was last year's opening of half a dozen new I-95 off-ramps up and down the riverfront and of the Vine Street Expressway, which offers quick east-west travel to the city's other major highways.
Seeing the crowds of cars bouncing over the freight railroad tracks that still rut Delaware Avenue and slow traffic, Marvin Venable started Venable's Philadelphia Water Taxi, using three 26-seat boats to ferry passengers north and south among the clubs and restaurants and the Camden ferry.
Only three restaurants now operate all year, but the success of summertime clubs that close has prompted some restaurateurs to explore year-round ventures. A Texas-based nightclub company, Dave & Buster's, is negotiating to open a recreation center in an enclosed pier owned by Bell Atlantic Properties and, several blocks inland, a 4,000-seat concert hall and an adult-entertainment nightclub are under construction.

HEADLINE: Grand Central

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The story on May 3 headed "Grand Central Owner Seeks Broader Use of Air Rights" about the desire of the Penn Central Corporation to reallocate and replan the development of Grand Central Terminal once again highlighted the need for some driving, forceful planner of the style and substance of Robert Moses in the City and State of New York. 
 We have yet to find the counterpart of a Robert Moses who, in today's world, can articulate the long-range vision for major developments such as Lincoln Center, or the state parkway system, or the Triborough Bridge and then have the political, economic and social diplomacy to have these "grand visions" approved by city, state and Federal bureaucracies. So, for several decades now we watch the miniminds and the macro-bureaucracies play their misguided monopoly games with the major center-city development -- the Grand Central Terminal.
Why don't we take the terminal by eminent domain out of the hands of all these competing "fiefdoms" -- Penn Central, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, the Landmarks Preservation Commission, the City Planning Commission among them -- and create an independent, quasi-governmental "authority" like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey?
The Grand Central Terminal Authority, with one roof and one staff, could create a central city development that not only uses the air rights, but develops the ground rights appropriately and for the benefit of all the citizens of New York.
Since such a new authority would require state legislation, I would recommend that the Governor and the Mayor appoint a public-private task force to review and prepare the necessary guidelines for preserving and expanding the use and "quality of life" for Grand Central Terminal and its environs.

HEADLINE: New Haven Seeks League of Its Own

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
GEORGE BUSH played there. So did Ted Williams, who in a pre-season game against the New York Yankees hit a titanic home run that old timers in the New Haven area still talk about. Much later, former New York Mets pitching star Ron Darling performed there before going on to the big leagues.
Since it opened in 1927, Yale Field, the home of Yale's baseball team, has been one of the most beautiful ball parks in the country. Yet, once the Bulldogs' season ends in late April or early May, it sits unused throughout most of the spring and all of the summer. 
 But if Edward Massey, a Ridgefield businessman and Yale alumnus, has his way, Yale Field will become home to a team in the Double-A Eastern League in 1994.
With the university's support, a group headed by Mr. Massey, which includes several other Yale graduates, recently applied to the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, the governing body for minor league baseball, for a Double-A expansion franchise. New Haven is one of 13 contenders for one of the two AA franchises that will be created because of the addition to the National League of two new teams starting next season, the Colorado Rockies and the Florida Marlins. Other applicants include Portland, Me., Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island and Atlantic City.
 
The Best by Babe's Standards
 But as Mr. Massey points out, his group has something special going for it -- a charming, old-fashioned ball park with a covered concrete grandstand adorned on the outside, appropriately enough, with ivy and with a playing surface that Babe Ruth once described as the best he had ever seen. Ruth made his comment after presenting a copy of his autobiography to Mr. Bush, then the Yale captain, before a game at Yale Field in June of 1948, two months before the Babe died of cancer.
"When you have Yale Field to start with, you're in pretty good position," said Charles Eshbach, the president of the Eastern League, who lives in Plainville and would like to see a team in New Haven. "But it would have to be modernized," he said.
Mr. Massey, who graduated from Yale in 1964, said that if his group was awarded a franchise he would spend about $2.5 million to install lights, build clubhouses under the grandstand and install new seats to increase the capacity to about 8,000 from the present 5,300. This is in addition to the $3.5 million cost of the Eastern League franchise. "All of the money will come from the private sector," said Mr. Massey, the president of U.S. Home Care which is based in Hartsdale, N.Y. with three offices in Connecticut. "In making the necessary improvements, we're going to make sure that Yale Field retains its old-fashioned charm," he said. "It's a beautiful ball park and we don't want to change the flavor of it."
If Mr. Massey's group obtains a franchise, it would give the Eastern League two Connecticut teams. Currently, the Boston Red Sox Double-A team is based in New Britain, where it moved in 1983 after 10 years in Bristol. For a while in the 1970's and 80's, the Eastern League had three teams in Connecticut -- in Bristol, West Haven and Waterbury. But the West Haven franchise -- affiliated for eight years with the New York Yankees and for three years with the Oakland A's -- folded after the 1982 season, while the Waterbury franchise ended in 1986.
 
An Economic Boost for New Haven
 In recent years, minor league baseball has enjoyed a revival with attendance increasing in virtually every minor league. As a result, more and more cities have been bidding for minor league clubs and, in the process, the cost of franchises has soared. In the eight-team Eastern League, for example, attendance records were broken in each of the last three seasons.
Ticket and concession prices at minor league games are far cheaper than at major league ball parks. Prices for Eastern League games average $4, Mr. Eshbach said, which is about $6 less than tickets for big-league games. "And we don't charge for parking," Mr. Eshbach said.
A minor league franchise could also be economically beneficial to the New Haven area. Mr. Eshbach said it was estimated that every dollar spent at a minor league game -- for tickets, refreshments, souvenirs and other items -- generates $7 in revenue for the community.
Because of its proximity to New Britain, the New Haven franchise would require a waiver of territorial rights by the New Britain club's owner, Joseph Buzas. However, Mr. Eshbach said that Mr. Buzas had already agreed to waive his territorial rights since he felt that a team at Yale Field would produce an in-state rival for his club.
 
A Turnaround for Yale
 In the past, Yale had not been receptive to having a minor league team play at Yale Field, which is situated directly across from Latham Field House and Yale Bowl on Derby Avenue, which is also Route 34. In 1981, for example, David Goldstein, the owner of the West Haven A's of the Eastern League had tried to move his team from Quigley Stadium to Yale Field, which is also situated in West Haven, near the New Haven City line. But Frank Ryan, who was then Yale's athletic director, opposed the plan, and two years later the West Haven franchise folded.
But in recent years Yale officials have changed their stance about having a commercial enterprise use the the hallowed turf at Yale Field, largely because of the economic climate that has forced Yale to eliminate some sports teams.
"I would like to see it happen," said Harold E. Woodsum Jr., the Yale director of athletics. "It would be great for Yale and for the community. As it is, it sits unused all summer, and that's a shame. In this day and age, we should use such a beautiful facility as much as we can. I've touched all the bases at Yale, and there's a lot of support from all of the senior officials I've talked with. And I don't think we'd have any trouble working out a lease with Ed Massey and his people."
Mr. Woodsum, a one-time star receiver for the Yale football team, said he did not foresee any conflict in playing time between the proposed minor league team and the Yale varsity. The Eastern League season begins the second week in April, but both Mr. Massey and Mr. Eshbach said that the minor league team's home schedule could be arranged so as not to conflict with the Eli games at Yale Field during that month.
Though New Haven is only 75 miles from New York City, neither Mr. Massey nor Mr. Eshbach said they thought that the proximity of two major league teams would affect their attendance. "Because of the high prices and the distance, I don't think most baseball fans in the New Haven area go in to New York for a big league game very often," Mr. Eshbach said. "And we're talking about a situation in New Haven which would be much more affordable to the average fan."
 
Fan Potential
 In addition to an excellent ball park, easily accessible from the Wilbur Cross Parkways and Interstates 91 and 95, Mr. Massey also cited the large population base. "There are approximately 850,000 people in the New Haven area alone, and the market is very strong demographically," he said. "And I think we also would draw well from Fairfield County and other nearby areas."
Mr. Massey's interest in trying to get a franchise for Yale Field came about by happenstance. "Chris Getman, a classmate of mine who is a broker in New Haven, called me and asked if I would help in an effort to renovate Yale Field," he said. "Once we heard that two Double-A expansion franchises were going to be available, we began pursuing the idea of a minor league team."
"We want to bring a wide range of people into the team ownership, including a lot from New Haven and Yale," Mr. Massey said. So far, in addition to Mr. Massey and Mr. Getman, others involved in the venture include Carter LaPrade, a New Haven attorney and member of the Yale class of 1965.
Though Yale Field is in West Haven, the team would carry a New Haven name, Mr. Massey said. That proposal was endorsed by Mr. Eshbach who pointed out that many sports franchises carry the names of cities other than the communities in which they play. "Look at the New York Giants and the New York Jets, who both play in New Jersey," he said said.
 
Seats of Honor
 The Eastern League president said that applications for the two Double-A franchises were reviewed on July 12 by the Double-A expansion committee of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues. After visiting the proposed sites, the committee will make its decision, perhaps as early as next month, but more likely at the baseball winter meetings in December. Mr. Massey said that letters from New Haven Mayor John C. Daniels and West Haven Mayor H. Richard Borer supporting a minor league franchise at Yale Field had been sent to the expansion committee.
Though the relatively narrow wooden seats at Yale Field are scheduled to be replaced if Mr. Massey's group is granted a franchise, one seat would remain untouched. That, Mr. Massey said, is the special double-seat that was built for President William H. Taft, who taught at Yale, his alma mater, after leaving office and before being named an Associate Justice of the United State Supreme Court. Mr. Taft weighed more than 300 pounds.
"If we get the franchise, we'd like to put a plaque on the Taft seat," Mr. Massey said. "After all, besides being a Yale alumnus, Mr. Taft was President of the United States." And, apparently, a Yale baseball fan to boot.

HEADLINE: For Retirees, No Place Like Home

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
WHEN Samuel and Germania Boyd of Pine Brook, N.J., made their retirement plans in the mid-80's, they briefly considered moving to one of the many South Florida adult communities to which, for decades, legions of retirees have migrated.
Instead of moving to the Sunbelt, though, the Boyds decided to stay put; they bought a new home only 70 miles away, in the Greenbriar Woodlands adult community in Toms River, N.J.
"I am a native of New Jersey, and I have come to like the seasons in New Jersey," said Mr. Boyd, who is 69 years old. He and his wife moved to Greenbriar Woodlands after he retired from an executive position at Westinghouse in Newark five years ago. 
 "Besides," added Mrs. Boyd, who is also 69 and also worked at Westinghouse, "we didn't like drifting away from our family and roots."
Despite the significant number of retirees who move long distances to settle in planned adult communities in places like Boca Raton, Fla., and Sun City, Ariz., more of them do as the Boyds have done. They choose locations for retirement that are close to where they lived and worked.
Indeed, in a survey conducted by the American Association of Retired Persons in 1990, 84 percent of those over 55 surveyed agreed that: "What I would really like to do is stay in my home and never move."
"There is a trend to move closer to children and grandchildren, more than in previous generations," said William E. Becker, a consultant in Teaneck, N.J., who specializes in marketing and developing adult communities. "Wanting to move away to a Sunbelt state was more prevalent until the early 1980's."
That assessment is consistent with 1980 census data showing that 75 percent of Americans do not leave home after retirement; 21 percent move within their home state and only 4 percent move out of state. And of those 4 percent who do move out of state, most retire at vacation destinations within their own regions. About a quarter of the out-of-state moves are to planned adult communities in Sunbelt states.
"I wouldn't expect it to change much in the data from the 1990 census," said Dr. Charles F. Longino Jr., a sociologist at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., who has studied retiree migration patterns.
This relative lack of migration by the elderly has helped make places such as southern New Jersey and Cape Cod, Mass., havens for recent retirees in the Northeast. Ocean County, N.J., alone has 76,429 retirees living in 48,373 units in 60 adult communities. Many of the county's adult communities -- including Greenbriar Woodlands, a four-year-old village of about 750 one-, two- and three-family homes that cost $159,950 to $207,000 -- are clustered around Lakewood, Point Pleasant and Toms River.
"The most important retirement area in the United States besides Florida and Arizona and southern California is southern New Jersey and, in particular, Ocean County," said Michael L. Tenzer, the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of Leisure Technology of Los Angeles, which operates six adult communities in New Jersey and on Long Island.
ADDING to the increasing number of retirees in the Northeast is the new phenomenon of older retirees -- those 75 and older -- moving from retirement communities in Florida to assisted-living facilities or nursing homes in the Northeast near where they once lived or where their relatives now live.
"A lot of them are coming back from Florida because they have family up here, and it makes life easier for them, having children and grandchildren around," said Edith Weatherby, a representative of Water Ridge, a three-year-old, 94-unit assisted-living facility in Stamford, Conn. "And a lot of them just don't like the warm weather all year round."
Despite the number of retirees staying in or returning to the Northeast, the development of adult retirement communities is not booming these days. "An exception is in the Midwest and some places on the West Coast," Mr. Becker said. "The East Coast is, relatively speaking, dead."
The current housing slump is also making it difficult for many would-be retirees to sell their homes, or is forcing them to sell for less than they anticipated 5 or 10 years ago.
To be sure, many soon-to-be retirees bought their primary housing years ago, and they may be more willing to settle for less than those who bought at higher prices more recently. Even so, Mr. Becker noted, the capital from the sale of these homes often finances the entire purchase of a retirement home in an active adult community.
In some cases, though -- such as those who lived in rent-regulated New York City apartments -- they may dig deep into savings or sell a weekend or vacation home to buy into a retirement community.
"Seventy percent of the people who move here pay cash, and usually it comes from them selling their homes," said Doug Delano, a vice president and general manager at Heritage Hills of Westchester, an 1,850-home adult community in Somers, N.Y., where new one- to three-bedroom units range in price from $160,000 to $380,000 -- roughly what they were five years ago. Resales run from $135,000 to $400,000.
Generally, said Mr. Becker, only 70 percent of the cash from the sale of a home goes toward buying a residence in an adult community, with the balance going into savings instruments that generate income. With this income, plus pension and Social Security payments, the average retiree has an annual cash flow of $25,000 to $35,000, not including part-time jobs, which about 30 to 40 percent of retirees take, either for the extra money or the mental stimulation.
THE price of an average adult-community home in the Northeast these days, according to Mr. Becker, probably ranges from about $100,000 to $175,000 for a 1,200-square-foot, detached, two-bedroom house with a garage. Larger homes, of course, would cost more, and an attached town house may cost as little as $80,000. Annual association fees generally range from about 0.75 to 1 percent of the purchase price.
"They are this inexpensive because they are not built in high-density areas," he said. "You think these communities are for the rich because of the way the developers promote them."
Economics aside, the adult community industry is also facing a demographic decline over the next five to seven years, as the number of Americans who are expected to reach retirement age dips slightly.
These retirees are, for the most part, people now 55 to 65, born during the Great Depression and World War II, when the birth rates were low.
Industry analysts point optimistically to the 32 million members of the post-World War II baby boom, who are now 30 to 46, and the oldest of them are expected to start retiring in less than 10 years. But making such long-term predictions is highly speculative.
Perhaps the biggest variable is predicting what the average retirement age will be in 10 years. Though that age has been declining for the last decade, many believe it may soon start to rise for baby boomers because of increased longevity, declining real incomes, a shortage of younger workers and a variety of other social and economic factors.
Further, no one knows what the laws will be in the next decade concerning issues such as mandatory retirement ages, or whether adult communities will be able to legally deny membership to those under a certain age.
Currently, a community can restrict its residents to families in which at least one person is 55 years old if 80 percent of its occupants are 55 or older; if the community provides facilities or services specifically designed for older people, and if it publishes and adheres to policies that show a clear intent to provide housing for people over 55.
"There is a long-term trend toward earlier retirement, but eventually we see that trend bottoming out," said Dr. Longino, of Wake Forest University.
Then there are questions about whether the baby boomers will seek out the same type of retirement villages as their predecessors.
"This isn't very easy to predict," said Eric S. Belsky, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. "But there is a large wave approaching retirement, and you are going to see an increased demand for retirement communities."
In the meantime, adult community developers, such as the Marriott Corporation, based in Washington, are emphasizing new full-service, or continuing-care, retirement communities that offer a range of care and services and cater to those who are younger and seek independent-living life styles as well as those older retirees who need assisted-living facilities or full-time nursing care.
Marriott, which already manages a traditional adult community, Leisure Park in Lakwewood, N.J., and newer full-service retirement communities in Edison, N.J., and Mountainside, N.J., is considering building others in Paramus, N.J., and Wayne, N.J., as well as in other sites in Connecticut and Pennsylvania.
"MOVING is a traumatic event for most retirees, so now they need only make one move on one campus, unless they need a hospital situation," said Darryl R. Callahan, executive director for the National Association of Senior Living Industries in Annapolis, Md.
Developers are also targeting that comparatively small number of retirees that are now in their 50's and early 60's. Many of these individuals, like the members of the World War II generation before them, have the prospect of substantial benefits from private pension plans as well as Social Security. Often they are retiringat a younger age than they had expected or hoped, because of layoffs and early retirements connected to the recession. But their incomes may have risen substantially in the 80's.
"It makes for a unique group of retirees," Dr. Longino, the sociologist, said.
These younger retirees, with spouses sometimes in their early 50's and even 40's, are seeking communities that belie the traditional image of retirement. For example, those who move into planned communities want tennis courts and golf courses instead of shuffleboard and bingo.
"We had people who said, 'Why are you moving to an old-age community -- you're not old?' " said Christine Goodman, who moved to Greenbriar Woodlands five years ago, when she was 52; at the time, her husband, James, was 55, the age minimum for the community. "I said, 'If I don't like it I'll just leave.' "
Though they are less mobile than in their youth, people in their 50's and 60's do move and for a variety of reasons: if their children have just left home; if they become infirm; if they divorce; if a spouse dies; if the head of the household retires.
Often, an adult community becomes an attractive place to move because younger retirees sometimes start to feel culturally and socially isolated living in neighborhoods filled with younger people.
Surprisingly, perhaps, frigid Northeast winters are not a deterrent to these retirees; many of them are "snowbirds," who visit other relatives in Florida or have condominiums or second homes there.
"Most of us are in Florida for at least a month," said Mr. Goodman, who moved to Greenbriar Woodlands after selling his home in Brielle, N.J., about 10 miles away. "And remember, we don't have to shovel the snow here."

Philadelphia Riverfront Plan in Low Gear

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
This city's plan for a single cohesive riverfront development has been ambushed by a recession, slack demand for new housing and the travails of a real estate market in decline.
Instead of high-rise apartment and office towers at the Delaware River's edge, the parcels have sprouted smaller, less expensive projects that go up quickly, like restaurants, nightclubs and open-air markets. They provide a modest income for some owners of property that otherwise would have lain fallow, as well as jobs in what is emerging as a regional playground and shopping center.
Two years ago, a city agency, the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation, envisioned not only the complexes of high-rise office and residential towers, but also office buildings and hotels. These were to have bracketed Penn's Landing public space and to have been connected by an esplanade.
But after Willard Rouse, the Philadelphia development company, withdrew in early 1989, convinced there was no way to make the 37-acre project profitable, smaller developers took on parts of the development.
Five new nightclubs or restaurants have opened this summer. And two weekend flea markets have opened, the larger covering an acre beneath multicolored tents at Vine Street and the north side of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, which spans the river between Philadelphia and Camden, N.J. The other, on the river's edge near Tasker Street and Delaware Avenue, opened during the Fourth of July weekend and has not yet reached its peak.
At least two planned residential developments have been shelved. One, Portside, envisioned as 286 high-rise condominium units, ran aground for lack of financing even before any physical work was done. And at Liberty Landing, a $300 million mixed-use development that last year was being re-evaluated for the combination of office, housing and hotel elements, weeds have nearly obscured the optimistic blue sign announcing the project, which also never even reached the groundbreaking stage.
The only housing actually built was not started from scratch but was a renovation at two municipal piers, 3 and 5, which jut into the river with a marina between them just south of the bridge. The former was converted into 96 fee-simple town houses, the latter into 172 rental apartments, by a joint venture of three Philadelphia partners, Silver Harting & Company, the Edward S. Brown Group and the Radnor Corporation. The rentals range from one to three bedrooms, with rents of $700 to $3,000 a month.
Rudy Hanisch, a Radnor senior vice president, said that six town house units were presold and that they got a lukewarm reception when they went on sale shortly after completion in 1990, selling out only after prices were cut to below market value.
"This case is illustrative of the cyclical nature of real estate," he said. "We made the decision to go forward in 1987, real estate values peaked in 1988 and by the time we delivered the units in 1990 the cycle was declining."
Instead of the $300,000 market value the company predicted, the units sold for an average price of $170,000 earlier this year, part of a $1.3 billion write-off taken by Radnor's parent company, the petroleum giant Sun Company, Mr. Hanisch said. From its peak in 1988, real estate values dropped by 30 percent by 1991 in Center City.
Sales of luxury condominium units slowed at the same time, to under 200 closings downtown at more than $150,000, he said.
"We came to the conclusion that we had a disproportionate percentage of the market and had to sell them below cost," Mr. Hanisch said. "I'm personally bearish on real estate values and levels of activity in the Delaware Valley for the rest of the decade. America's appetite for the good life has slowed."
Mr. Hanisch said the grand riverfront plans predicted for 30 years by city officials were expensive and came apart just as demand for new offices and housing was softening throughout the region. The downtown feeling of Philadelphia neighborhoods like Rittenhouse Square and Society Hall is not available on the waterfront because it is severed from the city by Interstate 95, despite bridges for pedestrians and vehicles.
A brief drive along Delaware Avenue offers many sights that suggest the state of flux on the riverfront. Tropical theme bars look out on dredge barges moored on the New Jersey side and on a state prison in Camden. Orange and tan self-storage lockers line one side of the six-lane street across from the tony Katmandu nightclub. One pier near Spring Garden Street is used for a trash transfer station and storage yard for city garbage trucks, another is the city's main impounding lot for towed cars.
Still, the Comfort Inn, with 180 rooms at the south end of the Ben Franklin Bridge near Penn's Landing, about a 10-minute drive from Center City, had an occupancy rate in 1991 somewhere above 70 percent, when the rest of the city was in the mid 60's, said a hotel industry analyst, Peter Tyson, of Peter Tyson & Associates.
Even the name Delaware Avenue was changed to Columbus Boulevard by the City Council, despite public opposition, to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage. Yet most highway signs still direct motorists to Delaware Avenue and there is no plan to change them.
Highway access has been the lifeline for such projects as the Riverview Plaza, a $30 million retail center farther south near warehouses and plants that once served the city's thriving port and manufacturing, both of which have been withering for years. Bart Blatstein and Marc Haber, principals of Tower Investment, bought a narrow parcel between Tasker Street and Washington Avenue on the landlocked side of Delaware Avenue knowing that an exit ramp from I-95 would be able to bring motorists to their doorstep.
The 150,000-square-foot center includes a multiscreen movie theater that opened last November and draws people from both states. There are 30,000 square feet of occupied offices space in Riverview Plaza, with a potential for 220,000 more in a vacant warehouse, according to Mr. Blatstein. There is also a Staples office products store and several restaurants, food shops and small stores. Plans have been drawn for a second retail component across Delaware Avenue in a former sugar refinery.
"There were no movie theaters at all in South Philadelphia, so people went over the Walt Whitman Bridge to South Jersey," Mr. Blatstein said. "Residential may not be an important part of the waterfront. The holding actions may be a year, it could be 10 years. If they're making money, why tear it down to build housing?"
Indeed, although planning maps still indicate that Marina Towers will rise where the Katmandu nightclub now stands, the club's owners are fashioning their own long-term expansion plans. Three partners, Stuart Harting Lance Silver and David Preefer, were involved in the Pier 3 and 5 project and said they see potential for new hotel or conference center facilities, but not residential growth.
Among the factors that have fueled growth along the riverfront are Camden's aquarium, which opened in February, and a new ferry service linking the two cities. Most vital was last year's opening of half a dozen new I-95 off-ramps up and down the riverfront and of the Vine Street Expressway, which offers quick east-west travel to the city's other major highways.
Seeing the crowds of cars bouncing over the freight railroad tracks that still rut Delaware Avenue and slow traffic, Marvin Venable started Venable's Philadelphia Water Taxi, using three 26-seat boats to ferry passengers north and south among the clubs and restaurants and the Camden ferry.
Only three restaurants now operate all year, but the success of summertime clubs that close has prompted some restaurateurs to explore year-round ventures. A Texas-based nightclub company, Dave & Buster's, is negotiating to open a recreation center in an enclosed pier owned by Bell Atlantic Properties and, several blocks inland, a 4,000-seat concert hall and an adult-entertainment nightclub are under construction.

Rare Daguerrotype Raises Questions

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
IT is a frustrating puzzle for historians: The photographic process was introduced in New York City from France in 1839, but the earliest views of the city date from 1853. Written accounts describe exhibitions of early daguerreotype views of New York, but none survive, whereas such views exist for Boston, Philadelphia and other cities.
Now a Connecticut collector, Joseph Buberger, has cracked the puzzle with a daguerreotype of Chatham Street. But it is a crack that still wants widening, because research indicates the small, silvery image dates from no earlier than 1848. 
 Louis Daguerre perfected the first photographic process in 1839, using a silvered metal plate. Details reached New York City in September 1839 when D.W. Seager exhibited a daguerreotype view of St. Paul's Chapel in a drugstore at 263 Broadway. At about the same time, Samuel F.B. Morse made a daguerreotype of City Hall Park and some sweeping scenes from rooftops. These and other early views have been lost, and the earliest firmly dated photos are usually considered those from wax paper negatives made by Victor Prevost in 1853. This gap has long troubled photo historians.
Now Mr. Buberger has announced the discovery of a daguerreotype view of Chatham Street -- later called Park Row -- a few blocks northeast of City Hall. He announced it as the work of a well-known family of daguerreotypists, William, John and Richard Lewis, because their address at the time, 142 Chatham Street, corresponds to the vantage point of the photo.
The Lewises were listed as "machinists" at that address beginning in 1843, adding "daguerreotype apparatus" to their directory listing in 1847. They moved out in 1859, dating the photograph as at least between 1847 and 1859, and perhaps as early as 1843. Under such circumstances, it might or might not be earlier than the Prevost negatives.
But there was a street-numbering change on Chatham Street. The number of the building from which the daguerreotype was made was, in the mid-19th century, not 142 but about 86 to 96 Chatham. There are only two traceable daguerreotypists at that address, Thomas Yearwood, there only in 1850, and John J. Woodbridge, who is listed as an artist at 90 Chatham Street beginning in 1848 and then as a "daguerrean" from 1851 to 1853. No sign or building changes offer closer dating than that.
This discovery, which Mr. Buberger bought from an antiques dealer on behalf of Daniel Wolf, a New York dealer, modestly pushes back the starting date for surviving photography of the city.
Woodbridge both lived and worked at 90 Chatham, and his neighbors did the same -- a gold beater at 88, a wig maker at 92 and Perkins and Brother, carpet dealers, in the two-toned building in the center of the daguerreotype at the corner of Pearl and Chatham Streets.
TAX records suggest the dark, six-story building in the distance was built in 1837, and over a decade later it is still a skyscraper to its neighbors. Just beyond it, a colonnade forms the front of the Chatham Theater, built in 1839. According to Mary C. Henderson's book "The City and the Theater," this was the site of the New York premiere of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" in 1852 -- perhaps even when this picture was taken.
In the distance, the triangular Chatham Square opens up, with East Broadway receding in the center. The area around the Square had been urbanized early in the 19th century and by mid-century was a middle-grade section of open-air auctions, hotels, markets and stores. The entire area has been rebuilt with the Chatham Green housing, Police Plaza and other buildings.
By the date of the picture, daguerreotypes had exploded in popularity; research by Jaine Liveson, an intern in the Print Room of the New-York Historical Society, shows there were 50 "daguerreotype likeness" studios in New York City in 1850, most within a few blocks of the Woodbridge/ Yearwood studio.
Mr. Buberger believes that since there was little market for street views, the photographer was just "having fun, playing with his equipment." Perhaps it was artist Woodbridge contemplating a career switch to photography; daguerreotype portraits were far more economical.
The daguerreotype itself is in the "half plate" format, 4 1/2 by 5 1/2 inches, with an embossed brass border. The image is sharp, but also white and silvery -- tip it one way and the image goes from positive to negative, another way and it just disappears.
Mr. Buberger says it is "not really" for sale; he and Mr. Wolf are trying to arrange the gift of the image, which they value at $150,000, to an institution like the New York Historical Society.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: London Offices;
In a Glutted Market, Age-Old Practices Give Way

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
WITH more and more space flooding into an already glutted London office market, many of the age-old British leasing practices that heavily favored the landlord over the tenant are finally starting to crumble.
As a consequence, commercial tenants will no longer have to sign up for a minimum of 25 years. Nor will they have to assume full responsibility for repairs during the lease period, although they may still be responsible for paying the property taxes. 
 Such terms, which used to make leasing space in London so burdensome, grew to be the norm following decades of shortages caused, in part, by highly restrictive planning and zoning regulations.
"It was more like a feudal system than a normal business relationship," said Geoffrey Marsh, managing director of Applied Property Research, a statistical service that monitors central London real estate.
The easing of those regulations by the Thatcher Government followed by the 80's construction binge ended all that. Today, the oversupply -- and thus the rise of tenant power -- has been further enhanced by shrinking demand, intensified by the fact that so many companies who might have otherwise moved are still locked into top-priced, 25-year leases signed as recently as five years ago.
The situation locks even interested players in place, since finding a subtenant at anywhere near the same price is tantamount to impossible.
Thus, an unprecedented 40 million square feet is available for rent in the central London, which comprises the City, the West End and the Docklands, reports Ralph Pearson, a director of Chestertons, a local property brokerage.
This represents an overall vacancy rate of around 18 percent, rising to 25 percent in the City where modern office towers -- many still empty -- stand in close encounters of the most jarring kind with the noble architecture of Robert Adam, John Nash and Sir Christopher Wren.
As a consequence, asking prices per square foot in Central London, which had been among the highest in Europe, have become far more competitive, down about 40 percent from a peak of about $125 in 1988 to around $65 today, and still falling, say brokers.
Even this disguises the true extent of the problem, they say, because deals are being struck for as much as 20 percent less, made even lower by free-rent concessions ranging from several months to two years.
Further concessions are being won in the form of caps on the cost of repairs. And though, on paper, the 25-year lease remains the norm, break clauses at five-year intervals are increasingly common.
"The tenant has become king," said David Beales, a property partner with Slaughter and May, a firm of London lawyers specializing in commercial leasing.
SO FAR, however, the relaxation is proving as ineffectual in improving demand as is the recent drop in interest rates in the United States.
One manifestation of the extent and intractable nature of the gridlock was a decision in March by the Westminster Council to ban the hundreds of large "To Let" signs littering the facades along some of the great historic streetscapes, as though London itself had been humbled into holding a giant going-out-of-business sale.
These billboards had become ignoble symbols of the wider economic woes facing Britain today, showing up in newspaper cartoons and even theatrical productions as the icons that best depicted the despair of the 1990's.
Ironically, it was the prevailing 25-year lease, seemingly as immutable as the monarchy, that at the height of the 80's led to the current oversupply, recall brokers, drawing the international investment community interested in the emerging European Community from competing commercial centers such as Paris, Brussels and Frankfurt.
Investors from Abu Dhabi, for instance, completed One Knightsbridge, a 7-story, 141,000-square-foot structure facing Hyde Park in September 1991. Itis still empty. A Dutch company built Henrietta House near Oxford Street, a 9-story, 96,000-square-foot building that is nearing completion and has yet to sign up a tenant.
Further compounding the problem was the added money pumped into property following the deregulation of the British financial markets in 1987. At the time, many of the great financial houses of the world rushed to seek a presence in the City.
They welcomed the chance to finance lavish office towers for themselves with extra space left over for speculation, said Colin Hargreaves, the partner in charge of City leasing for Healey & Baker, another firm of London property brokers, in an interview in his offices in Austin Friars, a Dickensian alley near the Bank of England.
It turned out to be the worst of investments. Many of these branch offices have since contracted or disappeared from London. Meanwhile, some of those projects are only now reaching completion, worsening the glut.
A further depressant has been Canary Wharf, the vast office development going up in East London. Olympia & York, its Canadian developers, is in bankruptcy and the best of its anticipated anchor tenants, like the American Express Company and Texaco, are pulling out for fear of being left in a ghost town.
Thus anyone in a position to make a move faces opportunities this summer that couldn't be finer. Coca-Cola, for example, has just taken 80,000 square feet of brand-new space for its British headquarters in Hammersmith at the western end of Central London, consolidating operations out of three different locations.
Jonathan Bekenn, financial director for United Kingdom operations, said that since it was a major user and a high-profile tenant, the developer was willing to purchase lease obligations at one of its former and largest sites.
Moreover, Coca-Cola was able to bypass a traditional commercial lease entirely by "buying" a 185-year occupancy agreement that gives it, in effect, ownership of the property. "It was an incredible deal," he said, noting that the location was also highly desirable, midway between the fashionable neighborhoods of Mayfair and St. James and the airport.
A HAMMERSMITH location is also being sought by the British division of the Walt Disney Company which has been expanding into shops and consumer products over here, too. Interestingly, both Coca-Cola and Disney refused to consider any of the vacant space in the City or the Docklands, despite fire-sale terms, because so many of their employees live in the western suburbs, which would have created a commuting nightmare.
It's been a bonanza, too, for smaller firms moving into the area. Consider the experience of Dimensional Fund Advisors of Santa Monica, Calif. Last fall, while seeking to establish a London branch for its emerging European investments, it was able to afford the cachet of an address in Mayfair.
Deborah Ferris, administrator of its London office, said it had also decided that a City location, though more appropriate, was out of the question because of commuting difficulties. Further, its visiting American institutional clients tend to stay in Mayfair hotels.
It now has a 10-year lease on 2,000 square feet in fashionable Berkeley Street with a 5-year break clause. The details were not revealed. But brokers say it's probably costing around $45 a square foot. "Everything couldn't have been easier," said Deborah Ferris, administrator of the London office. "We even got it all fitted out without any delay."

HEADLINE: New York Banks Are Fumbling a Service They Tout

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA

 BODY:
Every investor is fair game in an all-out advertising blitz by New York banks to win new customers. For a 25-year-old eager to be in growth stocks or a 50-year-old on the prowl for municipal bonds, the city's banks have a pitch: Just bring your money to us, and we'll sell you mutual funds or annuities right in our lobby.
But it might not be that easy, based on a walk-in survey of 13 banks and savings and loans around Manhattan. At 9 of the branches, a visitor found employees ill-equipped to answer questions about alternative investments, and often so unaggressive that neither the address nor phone number of a customer was requested for follow-up. Banks may be whetting customers' appetites for investments, but they are fumbling badly when would-be customers show up. 
 As interest rates fell last year and bank customers shifted billions out of certificates of deposit in search of higher returns, the banks began a marketing counterattack: Fifty banks in the New York metropolitan area spent $6 million through June of this year to advertise the availability of mutual funds and other investment products, compared with $1.1 million through June 1991.
Banks are under pressure to push sales of their investment products, said James McDermott, banking analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. "With the loss of C.D. money, they need to wring out new revenue sources."
That's a goal best met by banks in the area they know best -- selling to existing customers. But "there may be a dimensional gap with the walk-in customer," Mr. McDermott said. "You've got a whole culture in transition," and that may account for banks' dropping the ball when a noncustomer expresses interest in a nontraditional product. The learning curve had better rise quickly, he added: "It defies logic in this low-rate environment that they aren't trying to develop as successful a customer list as they can."
Yet New York bank employees were anything but aggressive when a potential customer walked in. At the Manufacturers Hanover bank at Delancey and Essex Streets on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, for example, a large poster touted the "power investment products" of Hudson Valley Financial Services. But the bank officer on duty was unable to provide any information about Hudson Valley or other securities.
In response to a question about the products, he handed the potential customer a pamphlet for Chemical Securities Brokerage Service, an investment operation unrelated to Hudson Valley. And, like many others, he did not ask for the visitor's name, address, income or amount of investment contemplated -- standard practice at any brokerage house. (In those few cases where the visitor was asked for name and employment, accurate information was given.)
At the Chemical Bank on 42d Street near Third Avenue, there are displays of promotional materials for Cornerstone Funds, but no representatives to answer questions. Asked for information about Cornerstone, an employee at the service desk said, "We can't give investment advice." When the visitor asked how to get more information, he said, "Call the 800 number," and walked away.
Bank spokesmen noted that marketing these investments is breaking new ground for them. At Chemical Bank, Leonard E. Malhim, managing director of investor services, said training would improve as banks get more experience in selling investments.
Mr. Malhim also said would-be customers who go to branches with "sufficient traffic" would find full-time investment consultants on hand. But not even the busy Grand Central area branch had a representative on hand during the key lunch period.
Richard Ferrone, manager of the Invest Financial Corporation's products at Lincoln Savings Bank suggested that banks are so busy coddling existing customers that new walk-ins may get short shrift. "We do a lot of our selling from inside the bank, reaching out to existing customers," he said. Like other bank executives learning of deficiencies in their in-bank sales efforts, Mr. Ferrone was surprised and apologetic to hear how passive the sales force had been when the Canal Street branch was visited.
Lincoln Savings, like most others, relies on an outside mutual fund company to supply its investment products, and then gets a cut of the sales. Though the Lincoln branch does have a full-time Invest salesperson, most other banks visited rely instead on roaming representatives, who cover two or more banks. The truly persistent investor can make an appointment.
But for impatient customers there is frustration in trying to get information quickly:
* At the Manhattan Savings Bank at the corner of the Bowery and Canal Street, the familiar lion of the Dreyfus mutual funds adorns two walls. But bank employees were unsure where a customer could go to learn about the products. After asking three bank employees for help, a visitor was sent to a woman who apologized that the bank only sold Dreyfus bond funds. And then, speaking of a Dreyfus tax-free fund the bank did offer, she said, "I can't sell you this," explaining the interest rate was just "1 percent or A cautionary tale of some investment advice received by two widows at a bank. Your Own Account, page 14.
something." Apparently few customers make queries about mutual funds. "I'm surprised you asked," she said.
* At Lincoln Savings on Canal Street, a visitor had to wait 15 minutes to talk to a representative of Invest, a subsidiary of the Kemper Corporation, for two minutes. The staffer had little to say about the mutual funds and annuities Invest sells. Asked to explain the products, she said: "A bond fund is less fluctuating. A stock fund will fluctuate a lot more but still less than an individual stock." She did not ask for the customer's name, income or investment needs, and provided a pamphlet only after being asked.
* At First Federal Savings and Loan on Third Avenue near 40th Street, there is a desk for a MONY Securities Corporation representative, but nobody was there. A bank employee reached the MONY representative at another branch but he was not available that day. Showing initiative, the staffer asked the visitor: "Is it possible you could see him tomorrow?" Similarly, there was no one to see at the East New York Savings Bank on Broadway at 86th Street, though pamphlets on its "Investment Centre" were available.
Service wasn't as inadequate at every branch. At the Marine Midland Bank at Chambers Street in lower Manhattan, the visitor, after a five-day wait for an appointment, was able to meet with a representative of Cigna Securities. In a 30-minute chat, the adviser took time to ask the right questions, as did advisers at Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank.
One broker at the Citibank at 86th and Broadway went to great pains to be sure that the $10,000 a customer wanted to invest would not be the pool of money needed in an emergency. Another at Chase lucidly explained that, unlike bank deposits, the investment products he sold were not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
But even at these banks, investors should beware the quality of advice and level of market sophistication. At Marine Midland, the adviser warned not to withdraw custodial money even to pay a child's tuition before age 18; to do so would entail a financial penalty. An I.R.S. spokesman says there is no penalty to withdraw money spent on the child, regardless of age. A Chase representative referred twice to the existence of 36,000 mutual funds -- but there are 3,400.
Of course, some investors may prefer the passive, soft-sell at the banks, at least when compared with the more aggressive approach of the brokerage houses. Edward Diamond of Dime Savings Bank said, "We certainly don't train our people to be passive," but "one of the things we can offer is an unintimidating, low-pressure approach to investing."
Several bankers also expressed hope that their cautious approach would ultimately pay off, as investors conclude that they do not employ the slicker salespeople of brokerage firms. "We'd rather take a slower approach and sell less product because, frankly, I don't want to get burned by this," said David Rosen, director of marketing at Republic National Bank, which owns Manhattan Savings.
Still, said Mr. McDermott, of Keefe Bruyette, banks have a lot of work ahead of them to settle in as investment advisers. "Banks were in the dark ages not long ago," he said, "and now they're competing against entities that can sell funds through 800 numbers." They can't afford to let live leads walk out the door, he added. "So they have got to get their act together on marketing."
 
 
WHEN A PRO IS ON THE LINE
 Compare the banks' method of selling investments with the more aggressive way brokerage houses handled a potential new customer in a telephone spot-check of four firms.
At Merrill Lynch, a broker immediately asked where a caller had her money now and then sought background information. While the broker did not ask for current income and ultimately recommended a mutual fund the caller thought too risky, he did get an address to mail further investment material and made several follow-up calls.
A Dean Witter broker asked a caller excellent background questions that would help her determine the sort of investment suitable for the caller, and then made an appropriate recommendation for the $10,000 available. Likewise at Shearson, the caller was asked specific, relevant background questions.
A Prudential Securities broker didn't press for a phone number or address, but did give the kind of sales pitch that should remind the consumer to review closely any "sell," hard or soft. Without asking for financial information, the broker immediately recommended buying stocks in Florida and Texas utilities, making the dubious observation that "Florida is not exposed to recessions because it is mostly residential." He then touted a particularly risky real estate company stock.
In the end, the Shearson broker was honest enough to give perhaps the best investment advice of all: "If you're really telling me that you have $10,000 and want to keep it liquid, you should probably keep it where it is."

CHASE MANHATTAN said an "investment specialist" is immediately available in major branches, including Times Square, but no one was on hand at that branch. An appointment was, however, set up for the same day.

CHEMICAL said customers see investment advisers after an employee gets basic information, but no one could answer questions at its 42d and Third or Canal Street branches or at its Manufacturers Hanover branch at Delancey and Essex. One employee said banks can't give investment advice.

CITIBANK said representatives advise putting aside three to six months of emergency expenses, but that goal was not mentioned at one branch. Branches at Grand Central and at 86th and Broadway were visited.

DIME SAVINGS said representatives are sure to get a customer's address or phone number for follow-up, but a salesperson at Madison and 48th never asked for an address or phone number after a 30-minute chat.

EAST NEW YORK SAVINGS did not return phone calls about its procedure. No representative was available at 86th and Broadway to talk about its Liberty Securities mutual funds.

FIRST FEDERAL said an Investment Center representative spends 30minutes getting information from prospective customers, but a representative at 40th and Third was not available that day.

LINCOLN SAVINGS said brokers spend from 20 minutes to four hours getting to know a customer, but a representative at Canal Street spent just two minutes, asking no questions about background and never asking for name, address or phone.

MARINE MIDLAND said brokers meet with customers immediately or within several days. An appointment was made for five days later. A poster touting investment products was in view of F.D.I.C. signs at the Chambers St. branch; an F.D.I.C. sign was also alongside pamphlets describing investment products.

REPUBLIC said "any trained customer service rep" could help on queries about Dreyfus funds, but it took three tries to find someone at its Manhattan Savings branch at Bowery and Canal. At the Republic at 40th and Third, an adviser provided a list of mutual funds and a phone number to call.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Letdown After the British Election

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
The London stock market fell to a new low for 1992 last week as the enthusiastic response to the Conservative Party's victory in national elections and signs of an economic recovery in April and May have proved to be short-lived.
As the realities of a weak economy have taken hold, the Financial Times index of 100 leading stocks has fallen 12.4 percent from its all-time high on May 11, and closed Friday at 2,399.6, down 12 points on the day. 
 The market ended the week higher than the 1992 low of 2,348 set on Monday, but analysts said the improvement was an adjustment to the rapid decline of the past few months, and not a fundamental change brought on by improved prospects for corporate profits or the economy.
"Expectations after the election were simply too high," said George Hodgson, chief equity strategist at S. G. Warburg & Company, London. "The general message from companies has been that profits are weak. And while we continue to hope that the economy will recover, the recent indicators have been disappointing."
Paul Walton, British equity strategist for James Capel & Company, a London-based securities firm, said the weakness in the economy and corporate earnings led him to cut his estimate for the Financial Times index to 2,850 at year end, from 3,000.
While it is clear, Mr. Walton said, that the British economy is now limping because of the proclivity of consumers to save rather than spend, it is important to remember that the accumulation of savings is the fuel for the next growth phase in the economy. The current tendency by corporations to cut jobs, he added, is, of course, helping to keep consumers cautious. But, eventually, the efforts at cost control will bear fruit in the form of large gains in profits -- and higher stock prices.
Corporate profits might grow by a disappointing 5 percent this year, Mr. Walton said, but the increase next year could be on the order of 25 percent rather than the 10 percent now expected by large institutional investors.
Steven H. Nagourney, chief global analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York, is not convinced that the recent problems will be resolved any time soon. He recommends that investors with a truly global stock portfolio keep 7 percent invested in London, even though companies whose primary listing is on that exchange account for 11.5 percent of the global total.
Mr. Nagourney said British companies have more work to do in cutting jobs in order to restore their profitability and investor appeal.
He noted that British businesses, once among the most profitable in Europe, are now more middling, as their return on equity fell to 12.4 percent in the past year, from 15.2 percent a year ago and 17.1 percent over the past five years. As businesses continue to respond by cutting back employment, it will be that much harder for consumer confidence to rebound, he said.
Some aspects of the British economy's malaise are eerily similar to those of the United States. The weakness in real estate markets has dealt a blow to both economies, with the greatest damage occurring in areas where incomes and property values were highest.
In Britain, the southeast part of the country, including Greater London, is the equivalent in some ways of the once overheated and now depressed real estate markets of the American East Coast, from Virginia to New Hampshire. Housing starts are weak, and the decline in home values has eroded consumers' wealth to such an extent that it has curbed their willingness to spend on other goods and services.
But unlike the situation in the United States, the British real estate market is hamstrung by high interest rates. By contrast, lower rates in this country have succeeded in stimulating the residential housing market and given consumers a chance to increase their spendable incomes by refinancing older, high-rate mortgages.
Although some British bankers and business leaders have been calling for lower rates and a devaluation of the pound -- moves that would make it easier for British companies to sell products abroad and perhaps stimulate more demand in the domestic economy -- Government officials have not chosen to follow that policy. Tight monetary policy and high interest rates have brought inflation down to 4 percent or less, from 10 percent a year ago, and Government policy seems intent on continuing that trend.
Indeed, Mr. Nagourney does not expect the London stock market or British industry to be rescued by any quick decline in rates or currency devaluation.
"The Government sees its job as creating conditions for stable prices," he said, "and the job of business is to become more competitive in that environment."
To the extent that lower interest rates are the key to improvement in the British economy, the fate of London stock prices is not entirely within the control of British consumers or their Government.
Higher interest rates in Germany, where the Bundesbank raised its discount rate to 8.75 percent, from 8 percent, earlier this month, was a blow to the London market because it dampened hopes of any quick decline in British rates.
Analysts do not expect German officials to move to lower rates until late this year at the earliest, and perhaps not until the second quarter of 1993.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Stocks Surge, And Wall Street Is Surprised

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
The American stock market is high but unhappy. There are a million worries out there, and a lot of confident bears. By contrast, the bond market is high and quite pleased with itself.
Last week gave a rude shock to the stock market bears, even as it stunned the bond market bulls by abruptly halting the rise in bond prices just as all the news seemed to be pointing ever upward. Consumer confidence might have plunged, but the stock market soared, with the Standard & Poor's 500 reaching a record level and the Dow Jones industrial average coming close. For a few minutes, the 30-year Treasury bond yield was at a 1992 low of less than 7.4 percent. But it edged back up by the end of the week. 
 What's going on here? Are investors somehow newly confident about a rapid recovery? That would explain the price action, but the reality is probably more a matter of market sentiment and the way markets can confound consensus expectations.
Bond market participants have been so bullish, and so fully invested, that there just wasn't enough cash available to sustain the rally. At the end of June, bond mutual funds that invest primarily in this country had just 4.8 percent of their assets in cash, a record low and half the level of three years ago.
But bearishness has been edging up for months in the stock market, as many stocks were decimated and traders began to look for the next one that would break down. By last month more shares had been shorted, in expectation of falling prices, than ever before. And while the public kept pouring money into stock mutual funds, the professionals who ran them thought they knew better and refused to invest the cash. From March through June, investors put $3.9 billion into aggressive growth funds, the ones that buy the small stocks that have suffered the most. But the managers dumped a net $900 million of stocks.
Mutual funds now are the biggest players in the stock market, and a collective refusal to buy has an impact. Those who focus on the Dow were waiting for a bear market, but small-stock buyers had suffered through one. The Nasdaq industrial average plunged 21 percent from its February high to its July low.
George Vanderheiden, who runs Fidelity's growth fund operations, is one who thinks the best prospects are in beaten-up small stocks. And he has a precedent to point to: the summer of 1976, the last time a Republican incumbent appeared to be in danger of losing.
Then, as now, the Dow was close to a record while the Nasdaq indexes had fallen sharply. And while the Dow was a disaster from then on, falling 25 percent from the end of July 1976 through February 1978, the Nasdaq industrials were busy rising, adding 10 percent over the same period.
There is no guarantee that will happen again, and Mr. Vanderheiden admits to being nervous over valuations. But he is quite likely right to feel there is more safety in buying stocks that have dropped rather than in continuing to push the big Dow stocks to ever higher highs.

Clark Clifford: B.C.C.I. Dupe or a 'Face for Rent'? 

Clark M. Clifford, the 85-year-old former Defense Secretary, was a poker-playing buddy of Harry Truman and one of Washington's savviest insiders. But when it came to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, he said he had been duped. Mr. Clifford and his law partner, Robert A. Altman, were indicted on criminal charges by New York State and Federal prosecutors last week and charged with taking about $40 million in bribes from B.C.C.I. and concealing B.C.C.I.'s ownership of First American Bankshares Inc. Mr. Clifford, who was First American's chairman and whose law firm represented B.C.C.I., said he did not know it owned the Washington bank. "It's absolutely impossible for him not to have known," said Rachel Ehrenfeld, a legal scholar at New York University. "He is what the Swiss call a face for rent." Mr. Clifford vowed to fight for the rest of his life, if need be, to clear his name.

Ford Has a Nice Profit, but . . .
 
After surviving one of its worst years ever, the Ford Motor Company seems to have regained its strength; it had a second-quarter profit of $502 million, compared with a loss of $394 million in the same quarter last year. But analysts and Ford's chairman Harold A. Poling remain cautious about the rest of the year because of the lumbering pace of the economy. "It will continue to be difficult to achieve healthy results in today's environment," Mr. Poling said in a statement.

Honda Holds the Line on Jobs
 
While Ford looks cautiously ahead, the Honda Motor Company said last week that it will begin applying the brakes. Honda, whose Accord is now the nation's No. 1 seller, told its suppliers last week that it will trim production at its two American plants, which was 451,197 units last year, by 105 cars a day. Sales of Accords are down about 11 percent. But unlike the Big Three, Honda will stay true to its Japanese roots; it won't be sending workers home while it slows the line. "We will not stop the line and we will not lay off any of our associates," said Jeffrey Leestma, a Honda spokesman.

Number-Crunching Photons
 
These days, the computer industry loves togetherness. It has already created the U.S. Memories and Sematech consortiums, and a myriad of corporate alliances around the world. Last week, A.T.& T., General Electric, Honeywell and I.B.M. said they will jointly undertake research to develop faster computer circuits. The circuits will be designed to increase the speed at which data are transferred from the number-crunching parts of the computer to its memory by using photons of light instead of electricity. The light will be generated by dozens of tiny lasers. By working together, the companies "hope to drive down the cost enough so a lot of photonics go into computers," said Phil Anthony, a department manager at A.T.& T.'s Bell Labs.

Guilty Verdict for Ostrander
 
Michael R. Milken, the imprisoned head of Drexel Burnham Lambert's junk-bond operations, may have vouched for her, but a jury in a Manhattan Federal court nonetheless went ahead and convicted Patricia Ostrander of taking bribes. Mrs. Ostrander, who had been a fund manager at Fidelity Investments, was accused of taking money from Mr. Milken in exchange for buying hundreds of millions of dollars of junk bonds for her fund. Mrs. Ostrander was accused of being bribed by investing $13,200 with Mr. Milken in 1985, which grew to $736,800 in just one year. She took the money without informing her superiors at Fidelity. In his testimony, Mr. Milken said his dealings with Mrs. Ostrander were legitimate. Mrs. Ostrander, whose lawyer said she will appeal the conviction, is facing a sentence of up to 13 years in prison and a fine of $750,000.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Darman Dispenses the Blame
 
When he addressed the House Budget Committee last week, Richard G. Darman, President Bush's budget director, did what he could to place blame for the economy's petty pace of growth everywhere but the White House. Mr. Darman said the economy's poor showing during Mr. Bush's term -- it grew by just eight-tenths of 1 percent annually over the last 13 quarters -- was due to: 1) a credit shortage; 2) Iraq's invasion of Kuwait; 3) Federal Reserve Board policies that stifled monetary growth, and 4) Congress's refusal to approve Mr. Bush's tax bill. But this Garden-of-Eden strategy (Adam blamed Eve, after all) only served to upset the committee's members. "Does the President accept any responsibility whatsoever for the situation in the economy?" asked Leon E. Panetta, Democrat of California. "I can't speak for the President," Mr. Darman said.

Spending Turns Downward

If growth is the salve that heals all economic wounds, it's time to send out for a new tube. According to the Commerce Department, gross domestic product expanded by a slim 1.4 percent in the second quarter, down from 2.9 percent the quarter before. Most alarming were the figures, also released last week, showing that consumer spending had actually decreased by 0.3 percent in June, after growing by a strong 5.1 percent the quarter before. "It all reflects a struggling recovery," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities. "My forecast is for 2 percent growth in the second half of the year. But 2 percent doesn't get you much job growth. The Administration must be disappointed."
 
Consumers Won't Budge

When it comes to the economy, consumers are the engine. Their purchases account for about two-thirds of all economic activity. When they're confident, they spend; when they're worried, they keep a tight watch on their billfolds. As measured by the Conference Board's index, confidence plunged in June to 61.0 from 72.6 the month before. That suggest consumers are not likely to open those wallets soon. "People are obviously worried about the job market," said Fabian Linden, who directs the survey.

Sprightly Home Sales
 
At least one area of the economy is showing a little pizazz. Sales of new homes jumped 7.9 percent in June, the first increase in four months. Sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 572,000 in June, up from 530,000 in May, the departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development said last week. That's good news for other parts of the economy because once people buy a new home they have to furnish it. Recent interest-rate cuts and the Senate Finance Committee's approval of a tax credit for home buyers who have not owned a home in three years are expected to keep sales from slipping. "There's no question that July and August should be better because of the interest-rate cut and the tax credit," said Daryl Delano of Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass.

Paychecks Aren't Any Fatter
 
One of the reasons Americans are losing confidence is that most of them are failing to see their income grow. According to the Commerce Department, personal income was almost unchanged in June. Americans earned a statistically insignificant $1.9 billion more in June than in May. "Things are slowly improving but really with glacial speed right now," said Bruce Steinberg an economist at Merrill Lynch in New York.

 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Talk, Yes. About Trade, No.
 
For two years, American and Japanese negotiators have been talking about ways to bring down Japan's trade surplus under the Structural Impediments Initiative. During that time, Japan's surplus actually grew: It is expected to reach $50 billion this year, up from $43.4 billion last year. If the talks have not produced results, perhaps the problem is not who is talking, but what they're talking about. Last week, the Americans pressed Japan about improving its infrastructure, toughening its antitrust laws and letting American companies open stores in Japan. Japan pressed America to cut the Federal deficit. But they did not talk about trade. "The talks from the very outset were viewed in the medium- and long-term context," said Olin L. Wethington, assistant secretary for international affairs at the Treasury Department.

Japan's Rate Shift a Yawn
 
When Japan's central bank ratcheted up its interest rates late last year, it did it to slow down an overheated economy. The result was not a slowdown, it was a slump. Last week, at the prodding of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and to help prevent complete meltdown on the Tokyo stock market -- it has fallen to 1986 levels -- the central bank lowered its discount rate, to 3.25 percent from 3.75 percent. But the Nikkei average of 225 stocks barely budged, moving to 15,910 at the close of the week, from 15,703.53 on Monday. Japan's rate cuts are like "putting lotion on a sunburn: it takes the sting out but it doesn't remove the real problem," said Paul Summerville, chief economist at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo.

No Loot From the Olympics
 
America may have been glued to the tube as Mark Lenzi won a gold in diving on Wednesday and Kim Zmeskal stepped out of bounds on her gymnastics floor exercise on Thursday. But not enough advertisers have signed up as sponsors and not enough Americans are watching the Olympics on pay-per-view cable to make the games profitable for NBC. NBC paid $401 million for the rights to show the games. Despite high ratings, the networksaid it will lose about $30 million on the Olympics.

 BODY:
THE look for next spring is wrap skirts, hair pulled back in brightly colored scarfs or snoods, sheer blouses under man-tailored jackets and lots of sexy decolletage.
Trouble is, we're talking about men. 
 The spring 1993 men's fashion season opened in New York last week, and while it reflected a new sophistication brought by women's wear specialists now designing for men, some of it was truly hysterical. About the only things missing at some shows were push-up bras and sequins. (Michael Kors did show gold leather jeans, which will certainly take you from day into evening.)
Defining moments: at the Perry Ellis show in Central Park, when the model came out wearing cotton leggings, Chelsea boots and a denim jacket wrapped around the waist, looking like a winsome Petruchio on his way from the Delacorte Theater to dinner at Claire. Or Donna Karan's show, where muscular he-men wearing pareos, Polynesian-style sarongs, sat on chairs and seemed at a loss whether to cross their legs or not.
Underlying the men's wear collections was what seemed to be a shared belief among designers that as America emerges from economic recession, men's life styles are changing. Men are dressing more casually and working more at home, where the computer and the fax machine have made the rituals of the office unnecessary.
Calvin Klein is reassembling the men's wear uniform for the jeans generation, a generation he helped to shape. At his show the models wore little cotton Muslim skull caps or bandannas knotted over their heads, for the brain-surgeon look.
Most of Mr. Klein's styles melded sportswear -- hooded sweatshirts, hopsack shorts, linen sweaters -- with tailored clothes cut in featherweight fabrics. Trousers were often held up with rope belts. Ties were often abandoned in favor of shirts open to the waist. A double-breasted suit in paper-thin gray flannel was worn with sandals.
"Men need a cool way of wearing a three-piece suit," Mr. Klein said. "You can wear a suit with a sportswear attitude. That's the way I like to dress."
The program notes for Ms. Karan's spring collection said: "Take the sexiness of Indiana Jones. The earnestness of Mr. Smith in Washington. The relaxed glamour of Gary Cooper." You might want to add, the come-hither charm of Dorothy Lamour. But Ms. Karan's wild idea -- to put male models in sarongs, garments both men and women wear in the tropics -- should not detract from her considerable accomplishments in men's wear after three seasons.
Ms. Karan's tailored clothing, which is manufactured by Martin Greenfield Clothiers in Brooklyn, is terrific. The suits have the kind of drape that recalls 1930's Hollywood glamour, but the fabrics and mixing suggest a more modern sensibility.
Ms. Karan said, "You take your silk blazer, your linen pants, your Lycra shirt, and you throw it all together." Well, when you put it that way, it all makes perfect sense.
The Perry Ellis men's collection, which has been known for fairly classic tailored clothes, emphasized sexy sportswear: Versace-like printed linens, mesh shirts, stretch jeans, safari jackets and psychedelic orange-and-red casual wear. This was more a collection for people who live and work in discos.
"We don't do strange clothes," said Joseph Abboud at his showing Monday evening in Astor Hall at the New York Public Library. Instead, Mr. Abboud makes full-cut classic double-breasted blazers, nice white linen suits and unusual dinner jackets, like a navy blue linen with black satin lapels.
Massimo and Lella Vignelli showed a minimalist collection of loose-fitting Nehru jackets, blouson tops and drawstring pants. It was if Yohji Yamamoto had done the costumes for "Doctor No."
Tommy Hilfiger, a designer with a preppie Americana bent, showed a star-spangled array of safari, nautical and tennis looks. Mr. Hilfiger, whose name means volume at retail, actually had guys come out in seersucker suits with bucks and bow ties and straw boaters. Long may he wave.
Giorgio Armani invaded New York Thursday to show his Le Collezione line for men and women, at the Guggenheim Museum. This collection, which is not his top of the line, kept up the devolution of the men's suit, as the models came down a buckling runway wearing mismatched jacket and pants, shirts untucked. These days only women are allowed to look as neat as a pin in a man's suit.
Michael Kors's ideas for spring included drawstring tops, gingham checked pants and bodyshirts (T-shirt and briefs attached) for easy riding. He also showed monotone looks, like all seersucker -- matched tie, shirt and suit -- or all-white cotton pique.
Are men actually vain enough to be remotely interested in this stuff? Well, at the Kors show on Monday, the male models did pushups backstage before coming down the runway in bathing suits. They wanted to be sure their pecs were properly pumped.

GRAPHIC: Photos: DONNA KARAN -- The sarong skirt for men, by Donna Karan, was the talk of the week's men's wear shows. It had its masculinity shored up by a garrison belt. Ms. Karan's tailored clothing was full cut and draping, in the Hollywood manner, as in this slouchy gray suit. CALVIN KLEIN -- The brain-surgeon look, from Calvin Klein, who infused the traditional three-piece suit with a sportswear sensibility. Soft, featherweight fabrics, including basket-weave and silk-linen mixes, were layered in a melange of tones and textures. GIORGIO ARMANI -- When suits were shown, their formality was usually disrupted, as with the untucked shirts in Giorgio Armani's Le Collezione line. Mr. Armani showed both men's and women's styles on a runway constructed in the Guggenheim Museum. PERRY ELLIS -- Cotton tights and Chelsea boots looked awfully casual for a fashion show (Did the model forget his skirt?), but there they were, at the Perry Ellis spring presentation in Central Park. Casual but sexy sportswear looks ruled the runways. MICHAEL KORS -- Michael Kors goes for the gold in his leather jeans. The designer also showed a sleeveless gold leather jacket, as well as drawstring tops, gingham checked pants and bodyshirts (T-shirt and briefs attached).

HEADLINE: More Posturing on Iraq Can Only Lead to More Infant Deaths

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Time to Punish Hussein -- Again" (editorial, July 24) offers the same stale thinking behind the Bush Administration's failed policy on Iraq. We do not mean President Bush's coddle and confront strategy (following a venerable tradition in American foreign policy, from Ferdinand Marcos to Manuel Antonio Noriega), which you have rightly exposed and denounced. Rather, we refer to the belief, repeated as an article of faith in previous editorials on Iraq, that the sanctions in force are a proper means to confront Saddam Hussein, and need only be strictly enforced to be effective. 
 The basic flaw in your thinking (and the Administration's) is that it fails to distinguish between Saddam Hussein and Iraq's 18 million citizens. Treating an entire people as the enemy is exactly the kind of thinking that has spawned decades of hatred and conflict in the Middle East.
It is indisputable that almost two years of sanctions (not to mention 43 days of war) have not loosened Saddam Hussein's grip on power, but instead have inflicted devastation on the most vulnerable sectors of the Iraqi population.
We participated in two Harvard study team surveys of health and welfare in postwar Iraq. Our studies demonstrated that the war's destruction of Iraq's infrastructure, coupled with sanctions, have resulted in a tripling of infant and child mortality since the war. This has meant at least 100,000 postwar deaths among children younger than 5, children of the poor and powerless.
Without the sanctions-breaking trade with Jordan that you denounce, casualties from hunger and disease would be higher. And why single out Jordan for punishment ("it too could be liable to sanctions"), when Turkey and Iran are playing the same game in northern Iraq, and thereby helping sustain thousands of Kurds?
New thinking and new policy is needed in Iraq and the entire Middle East to overcome the blind hatred that has spawned repeated wars. It is too easy, too destructive, to keep up an aggressive posture of confrontation and macho showmanship, and then blame the other side when the war of words leads to unnecessary bloodshed.

Bush and Clinton Open Fire On the Foreign Policy Front

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NO attack should be unexpected in a Presidential campaign, but there is still something jarring when the Republicans' first substantive foreign policy criticism accuses the Democrat of being "reckless" about Bosnia. After all, for most of the last 30 years Republicans said Democrats who ran for President were timid or weak, if not downright cowardly.
But this is the first election since 1936, or 10 years before Bill Clinton was born, that is being conducted when the United States was not imperiled by one or more big bad countries. So foreign policy is bound to play a different sort of election role, and almost certainly a smaller one. In the old days, foreign policy "literally vetoed people," said Representative Newt Gingrich, the No. 2 House Republican. "If you couldn't handle foreign policy, you couldn't handle the Presidency." 
 And even though foreign policy had been almost politically invisible until last week, it is sure to be argued over the next three months. There are a variety of reasons, not excluding the relevance of a surehanded foreign touch to a successful Presidency.
But that's not the first reason.
The primary reason the Bush campaign launched a foreign policy attack on Bill Clinton last week is that it doesn't have much else going for it at the moment. As recent Gallup and Harris Polls show, handling foreign policy is an area, perhaps the only one, where the public still has more confidence in Mr. Bush than in Mr. Clinton, and by a big margin. In a July 17-19 Harris Poll, for example, Mr. Bush was preferred 64 to 28 percent as more likely to be effective in foreign policy.
So it makes tactical sense for the Bush campaign to try to turn some public attention toward foreign policy, even if its first effort was spectacularly inept. It accused Mr. Clinton of being reckless in saying the United States should be ready to use air strikes to support United Nations efforts to aid civilians in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That was a policy Dick Cheney, the Secretary of Defense, said he agreed with the next day, and one that Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, had urged a month earlier. That wasn't all that was wrong with this effort; to call the Democrats reckless (meaning too aggressive) undercuts a basic Republican argument; as Mr. Gingrich would pose it, the G.O.P. should say the Democrats accept international weakness by urging defense cuts and protectionist trade policies.
In general, however, the Bush attacks are likely to focus on the difference between experience and inexperience. On Monday in Michigan, Mr. Bush argued that when a President answers the telephone in a middle-of-the-night crisis, "The American people need to know that the man who answers the phone has the experience, the seasoning, the guts to do the right thing."
 
Ready Answers
 The Democrats do not seem to fear that argument. Their quick response is a kind of "sez who?" Mr. Clinton said that someone who promised, "Read my lips, no new taxes" had no business asking for trust. And Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, his running mate, said that if Mr. Bush was so smart, how come "Saddam Hussein is thumbing his nose at the world"? But the Democrats also have a strategy that goes beyond one-liners. As Anthony Lake, a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Clinton, said last week, "At a moment when history has turned, experience is not necessarily the first qualification." There are differences, he said, "between being locked into foreign policies that reflect the thinking of the last decade and promoting foreign policies designed for the next decade."
Mr. Bush has some reasons to rely on generalizations about experience. Perhaps his most profound accomplishment is to have come through the breakup of the Soviet Union peacefully, but, as Prof. Barbara Bardes of Loyola University in Chicago noted, "you don't get any points for not getting in trouble." In addition, Mr. Bush's most dramatic success, building a coalition that drove Iraq from Kuwait, has, in Saddam Hussein, a mocking aftertaste that Mr. Gore drove home. Not that the Democrats take the offensive on Iraq; indeed, Mr. Clinton goes to great pains to emphasize he supported Mr. Bush in the war and in recent actions.
But specificity matters to Mr. Clinton. It appears that the only way to cut down that 64 to 28 margin is to argue policy in specific terms and seem knowledgeable. The very statement about Bosnia that the White House flippantly challenged, for example, is a detailed call for international action there.
It is not Mr. Clinton's first such precise statement. But for most of this campaign, attention has been on domestic matters. Mr. Lugar feels that the lessons of last fall's special election in Pennsylvania, when Senator Harris Wofford won by urging attention to domestic problems, have been overlearned by all candidates, especially Mr. Bush. He says the President would be wise to discuss America's role in the world, to make a case for NATO, to discuss relationships with Japan, and above all to explain the "correlations between the domestic economy and the world picture, especially our access to markets."
A Clinton partisan, Representative Lee Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, said he wanted to hear the candidates display a "recognition that a strong economy and community underpin our ability to lead the world." And he urged a discussion of a new set of foreign policy concerns, from nuclear proliferation to the environment, and a hard look at whether policy institutions shaped in the cold war remain adequate.
Although there are risks for Mr. Bush in getting into foreign policy issues, it is his strong suit. It evokes the stability and safety that re-election implies. And though there are risks for Mr. Clinton in changing the subject from the economy, convincing voters that he can handle foreign policy will help him to still other doubts.
So even if foreign policy is not the same absolute test for a Presidential candidate as it once was, it still matters. As Mr. Gingrich said, "Even though it's not now a matter of survival, it's a matter of safety." Therefore, he said, the foreign policy test "is a low hurdles race when it used to be a high hurdles race."

Where a Player Can Strike Out and Stay at the Plate

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
IT'S been a rough year for seers.
First there was going to be a hot race between Bill Clinton and Mario Cuomo. Next there was going to be a brokered Democratic convention. And then Ross Perot was supposed to choose Jeane Kirkpatrick for his running mate and throw the election into the House of Representatives. 
 From the start of this election season, the nation's political pundits have been wrong in their campaign forecasts more consistently than they have been right. That has not, however, prevented the pundits, who populate shows like CNN's "Capital Gang" and fill the editorial pages of newspapers and magazines, from continuing to make predictions. But it has raised the question of whether anything can be said in advance that is reliable about the 1992 election, save that those who venture predictions are going to wind up being embarrassed.
"Everybody ought to be very humble about going out on a limb about anything except that things change," said Morton Kondracke, a regular on NBC's "The McLaughlin Group," who has made his share of bum predictions. "And we probably ought to be humble about that, too."
Pundits and political scientists alike say that one reason this election has been so taxing for oracles is that Americans themselves have become less predictable. They are becoming less attached to political parties and more likely to vote for a candidate on individual merits than as a representative of a particular ideology. When new information about a candidate is introduced, voters' opinions can swing wildly. "I think passions are held less strongly," said Michael Barone, an occasional pundit and senior writer at U.S. News & World Report. "People are less partisan in an important sense, and that makes it harder to predict."
The pundits' crystal balls began clouding over last summer when "Hotline," a newsletter for political junkies, convened a bipartisan panel of 50 consultants and asked them to start prognosticating. The group had no trouble coming up with the odds-on favorite for the Democratic Presidential nomination: Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.
By the time winter rolled around, Mr. Clinton had emerged as the pundits' favorite choice for the nomination. But if anyone thought that former Governor Edmund G. Brown of California would pose the most enduring threat to Mr. Clinton's nomination, they weren't saying so publicly. In fact, a majority of the Democrats on the "Hotline" panel predicted that Mr. Brown would drop out of the race after the New Hampshire primary. The tendency of this year's predictions, said Doug Bailey, the publisher of "Hotline," has been "remarkably wrong."
The pundits should have had an easier time calling the Republican primaries correctly, given that one of the candidates was the incumbent President. But even there, they had problems. Early in the year, many predicted that Patrick J. Buchanan would humiliate President Bush by winning more than 40 percent of the vote in New Hampshire, a figure considered a benchmark of a serious candidacy. Bob Novak, the columnist, predicted 41.9 percent. Mr. Buchanan ended up with 37 percent.
Still, the pundits did not give up on Mr. Buchanan. A few days after New Hampshire, Margaret Warner, a reporter with Newsweek magazine, and Mark Shields, a syndicated columnist, predicted on "Capital Gang" that Mr. Buchanan would win the Georgia primary. Instead, George Bush won with 64 percent of the vote.
The rise and fall of Ross Perot was so dramatic -- and so unprecedented -- that almost everyone with a claim to punditry managed to get at least part of the story wrong.
In June, the "Hotline" panel predicted that Mr. Perot would pose a serious third-party challenge in November, and a majority of the panelists from both major parties projected that the election would go to the House of Representatives. Appearing on ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley," George Will declared: "The basic outcome of this election is already known: We are going to have a weak plurality President."
When it came time for the pundits' favorite guessing game -- "Who will be the Vice-Presidential nominee?" -- their crystal balls were once again, it seems, filled with static.
In February, William Safire declared in The New York Times that Senator Kerrey would be the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate. (At the same time, Mr. Safire predicted that the economy would "turn up briskly." His forecasting abilities had been more acute in his column last Dec. 30, however, when he said that Bill Clinton would be the Democratic candidate.)
 
Calendar of Nonevents
 In May, the "Hotline" panel predicted Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey would be named. And in June, Chris Matthews of The San Francisco Examiner asserted on "The McLaughlin Group" that Senator Daniel P. Moynihan of New York would be Mr. Clinton's choice.
In all fairness, blaming political pundits for getting it wrong is like blaming weather forecasters. They make their best guesses based on the prevailing winds. But given the track record of the Beltway pundits, voters may do just as well to turn to Jean Dixon, a syndicated astrologer who dabbles in politics, and who has offered this sure thing for November: George Bush on the third.

HEADLINE: Families See Park Plan As Threat to the Land

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PEMBROKE, Me.

 BODY:
Albert Cusick's ancestors migrated to America's eastern edge two centuries ago, claiming the unbroken pine forests and the rocky tidal shore surrounding a sparkling inlet on the Maine coast.
Not much has changed since then around what is now called Young's Cove. Wildflowers splash the ridges with brash strokes of red and purple. Bald eagles circle lazily on warm air currents. This stretch of seaside ground is as wild and unsullied as any on the East Coast, and because of that the Government has decided it wants it all, about 600 acres, for enlarging a national wildlife refuge. Mr. Cusick owns 100 acres, and seven other families own the rest. 
 Mr. Cusick's neat little Cape Cod house, and those of his neighbors, seem an unlikely setting for fury against the Government. But that is precisely what has developed since the Fish and Wildlife Service announced two years ago that it wanted to protect the refuge, Moosehorn National Wildlife Refuge, by expanding its boundaries.
 
'Doesn't Make Any Sense'
 "The Constitution of the United States said we can own this property, and my family has for 206 years," said Mr. Cusick, a 60-year-old retired marine who served in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. "Then the Government turns around and said they want it because they think they can manage it better. I'm no college boy, but that doesn't make any sense to me. What's happening to us just isn't right."
The refuge's manager promises that land will be bought only from "willing sellers," but that has done nothing to calm Mr. Cusick's concerns or those of his neighbors. Despite his appeals not to be included in the refuge's new boundaries, the Government listed Mr. Cusick's property this year as a priority for purchase.
Joseph Turner, who lives next door to Mr. Cusick with his wife, Pauline, said: "For the love of Mike, it scares me every day. They do one thing and say another, and I really fear for my kids and their kids being able to come back here. What the Government wants, the Government gets."
The struggle between property owners and the Government for control of Young's Cove is a microcosm of hundreds of land fights now being waged around New England and the rest of the country. Leaders of the Young's Cove battle formed a protest group, the Washington County Alliance, that has joined with 400 other groups in a national movement to halt Government land acquisitions for parks, refuges and recreation areas.
 
Movement Gaining Steam
 The property-rights movement has made its presence felt in Congress, state legislatures and the courts, stirring a backlash against environmentalism that has attracted considerable support from conservatives in the Bush Administration.
The Administration supported a South Carolina landowner, David H. Lucas, who sued to overturn state environmental restrictions on beach-front development; in June, the Supreme Court sent the issue back to a lower court. . And Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and Vice President Dan Quayle have developed an election-year strategy for shoring up the President's conservative base by supporting the property-rights movement. They are courting voters in the Northeast and West whose land was taken by the Government under the right of eminent domain or who have had the use of their land restricted under Federal laws like those that protect wetlands.
But leaders of the movement distrust the White House. They say President Bush has nearly doubled the budget for land acquisitions and has cited the purchase and preservation of private property as one of the most important facets of his environmental program.
In 1991, the latest year for accurate figures, the Government spent $293 million to buy almost 318,000 acres of land, more than in any year since 1978.
 
Lujan Expresses Sympathy
 When asked to explain this seeming contradiction, Mr. Lujan issued a statement through his press secretary, Steven Goldstein, saying he was sympathetic to the property owners' complaints. "My view," he said, "is that only certain sites deserve protection."
Mr. Goldstein added, "As far as buying land, this looks to me like we're damned if we do and damned if we don't."
Indeed, at the heart of the conflict are two distinct theories about land conservation. National environmental groups believe that public ownership represents the best way to preserve wild lands and protect species from development. They point to Yellowstone, Yosemite and Acadia National Parks as evidence that public stewardship of the nation's natural heritage benefits everyone.
Property-rights leaders reply that private landowners are more likely to care for land than bureaucrats who have no personal or financial stake in the property. They say national parks like Yosemite and Acadia, which is down the road from here, are being ravaged by overuse that has left campgrounds in tatters, trails in disrepair and landmarks defaced by litter and graffiti.
"I don't know what gives the Government any right to think they can take care of land better than we can," said Mark E. Madden, a retired Boston detective who is Mr. Cusick's brother-in-law and lives here in the summer.
At least for the time being, groups like the Washington County Alliance have helped slow the momentum of Federal and state efforts to preserve wilderness areas. Two years ago, the United States Forest Service and the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and New York proposed land-use restrictions on 26 million acres of forest land from northern New England to the Adirondacks.
 
Environmentalists Lose Fight
 But last year, at public hearings on the northern forests in Bangor, Me., property-rights advocates outnumbered environmentalists 3 to 1. Their protests at the hearing prompted both of Maine's Senators, George J. Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader, and William S. Cohen, a Republican, to withdraw their support for the land-use plan. The legislation was not enacted.
The environmentalists place part of the blame for their losing battles on New England's flat economy. "We take the position that the people fighting us are a distinct minority," said Everett Carson, the executive director of the Maine Natural Resources Council, a state environmental group based in Augusta. "In a down economy, it's a perfect time for a shrill anti-environmental message to really have some impact."
The fight here in Pembroke, a community of 850 people, came after developers bought a few acres along Bellier Cove, which borders the Moosehorn National Wildlife Refuge, with the idea of building houses. The Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages 90.7 million acres, considers Moosehorn, which was established at the time of the Depression, one of its most important holdings in the East because of its value as a nesting and breeding sight for migratory birds. The 22,975-acre refuge teems with river otters, black bears and woodcocks.
 
Backing for the Expansion
 Fearful that the development would intrude on the refuge, the Government joined with environmentalists to block the project. In 1990, the Government proposed a 2,705-acre expansion to protect Moosehorn, including the 600 acres around Young's cove. The Administration and Congress approved the expenditure of $2 million to begin buying the land.
The Moosehorn expansion has attracted support here. Douglas Mullen, the refuge's manager, said many landowners had agreed to sell and others were waiting to sell. "We are purchasing land only from willing sellers," he said.
But Mr. Mullen's assurances have not quelled the fears of those living around Young's Cove. "The question always is how bad do they want it," Mr. Cusick said. "What gets me is we have no say. If they want it bad enough, they can take it."

HEADLINE: Governors Develop Plan to Help Preschool Children

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., Aug. 1

 BODY:
The National Governors' Association opened its annual meeting today by issuing a bipartisan blueprint for the states to improve children's readiness for school, the nationwide educational goal that had divided Republicans and Democrats.
The report, developed by a panel of governors and 2 corporate executives over the last year, said the states should meet three objectives: more and better preschool programs for all poor and disabled children; improved health and nutrition programs for preschool children, and improved social services to help parents better prepare their children for school. It did not say how much these programs would cost. 
 In 1990 the governors and the Bush Administration adopted six national goals for the year 2000, saying schools would need to meet them all if the nation was to remain competitive. There was wide agreement that improving readiness was the most important, because so many children start school with health and family problems that hinder their ability to learn and that plague them throughout their schooling. But the governors were divided on how to measure readiness and on what steps to take to attain it.
 
Intense Political Interest
 Today the panel seemingly resolved that dispute with its bipartisan report, which also listed 14 benchmarks the states could use to measure their progress. "Too many children are not prepared to start school," said Gov. George V. Voinovich, a Republican from Ohio and chairman of the committee that produced the readiness report. But he said the recommendations and benchmarks offered in the report were "based on the premise that education and school readiness are the best investments we can make."
The four-day governors' meeting will also address health, fiscal and economic-development issues, but the emphasis will be on education, which has attracted special interest in this election year. The Democratic Presidential candidate, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, was one of the first governors to support legislation to overhaul schools, and he has emphasized that in his campaign. President Bush has proclaimed himself the "education President," and his Administration, with the governors' association, conceived the six national goals.
The five other goals are: to make American students the best in the world in science and math; to improve high school graduation rates by 90 percent; to have students leaving the fourth, eighth and 12th grades demonstrate competency in a basic academic curriculum; and to insure that every adult will be literate and every school will be free of violence and drugs.
 
Most Disagreements Resolved
 In their discussions on the readiness goal, Democrats generally favored programs that would enlist parents in teaching their preschool children basic skills that would help prepare them for school. Republicans said that such programs would infringe on the privacy and values of families.
There was also discord over money, with Democrats calling for more Federal spending on the Head Start program for disadvantaged youngsters.
Although some differences still exist, particularly on how much money should be spent on the readiness goal, Republican and Democratic governors said they resolved their significant differences through a series of meetings.
"The debate was very tough and partisan," said Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, a Democrat who takes over this week as chairman of the governors' association. "But we've moved closer to one another."
Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri, a Republican on the panel, agreed. "Governors, both Republicans and Democrats, are trying to get the job done," he said.
 
Efforts Already Under Way
 There were no Bush Administration officials at the conference today, a spokesman for the governors' conference said, but Education Secretary Lamar Alexander is expected to attend the meeting on Monday morning.
The panel's 24-page report, "Every Child Ready for School," listed a variety of programs that states can use to meet each of the three objectives, and it praised states that are making efforts to meet them.
New Mexico, for example, was singled out for increasing state subsidies to programs for needy and disabled preschoolers. Missouri is expanding a statewide program to enroll welfare recipients in a program that helps parents teach their children basics like numbers and the alphabet. And to improve the health of young children, California has expanded services for maternity, childbirth and infant-care services for low-income women who are uninsured.
As for measuring gains, the report urges states to keep statistics on the percentage of children under age 5 who are enrolled in Head Start and other publicly supported preschool programs, and on the percentage who have been inoculated for an array of childhood diseases.
But Mr. Romer acknowledged that more specific benchmarks would be difficult to draw, because there is still some disagreement over what constitutes good measurements of readiness for school.
 
Likely to Cost Billions
 Several governors said the absence of cost estimates was intentional. Virtually all states face budget problems and each state was left to follow the recommendations as their budgets allowed, governors said. But several governors acknowledged that attaining the readiness goal would cost the states billions of dollars over all.
Education policy experts say the states have done a credible job so far, but that their efforts are still far short of what is needed to achieve the national readiness goal by 2000. In a 1991 survey by the Carnegie Foundation for Advancement of Teaching, more than half of 7,000 kindergarten teachers said their students came to school with health, nutritional and family problems that hindered their ability to learn. The same sampling of teachers said the situation had worsened in the last five years.
"The agenda is clear, and the goal is right, but we still haven't shown the energy and organization and frankly the deep commitment that the task requires," said Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation, who has been the most forceful advocate for the readiness goal. Copies of the report are available for $16.95 from the National Governors' Association Publications, P.O. Box 421, Annapolis Junction, Md. 20701.
Besides Governor Voinovich, the panel's chairman, and Governors Ashcroft and Romer, these are the members of the National Governors' Association Action Team on School Readiness:
Gov. Bruce King, Democrat of New Mexico.
Gov. Pete Wilson, Republican of California.
Gov. Michael N. Castle, Republican of Delaware.

HEADLINE: Bank Charges Embarrass the Saudis

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO with JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Early last month, as top officials of the Federal Reserve were about to publicly accuse Saudi Arabia's biggest bank and its manager of violating United States banking laws in connection with a multibillion-dollar fraud, the kingdom's top regulators and their lawyers rushed to contact Fed officials, hoping to settle the matter quietly.
If the Federal Reserve publicly announced its charges, the Saudi Government, the United States' most important ally in the Persian Gulf, would be linked to the growing scandals involving the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and King Fahd would be personally embarrassed. 
 What is more, the Saudis said, if regulators shut down the American operations of National Commercial Bank, the kingdom's biggest and most prestigious bank, the Saudi banking system would be jolted even as the economy still reeled from the financial burdens of the Persian Gulf war.
 
 
Entreaties Aren't Heeded
 After six days of intense, secret negotiations, the Saudis gave up, going away red-faced and empty-handed. The Fed made the charges public.
The Saudi bank is charged with failing to report purchases of stock in First American Bankshares, the largest bank holding company in Washington, which was illegally and secretly controlled by B.C.C.I. The purchases, made in concert with the bank's former chief executive, Sheik Khalid bin Mahfouz, were made from an affiliate of B.C.C.I. and involved loans from National Commercial Bank to people acting on behalf of B.C.C.I.
American regulators last month ordered National Commercial to close its New York branch. At the same time, the Saudi bank sold off its huge silver holdings in an effort to raise cash quickly, causing silver prices to drop sharply in markets around the world.
In recent months, the B.C.C.I. scandal has grown from a criminal investigation of a huge fraud by rogue financiers -- perhaps the largest financial fraud ever -- to envelop some of America's staunchest allies in the Persian Gulf. And the diplomatic ramifications have left the State Department and some other American officials queasy.
In addition to examining the roles in the scandal of some of Saudi Arabia's most prominent businessmen, many of whom have links to the royal family, investigators are now looking at the actions of members of the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates. Family members were the principal owners of B.C.C.I. when it was shut down last year. While the family members have portrayed themselves as the biggest victims of the fraud, some investigators have publicly questioned whether they helped to carry it out.
 American officials say they are certain that the royal family is deeply shaken, fearful that a scandal could erode confidence in the kingdom's once-unassailable banking system.
"It is obviously a major banking crisis and a serious problem," said one senior Administration official who closely follows the issue, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. "They are concerned about what implications it will have for the Saudi banking system as a whole. We have told them their concerns have been noted and the best thing to do is to clean up the whole B.C.C.I. mess."
At one point, King Fahd took the highly unusual step of calling in the United States Ambassador, Charles W. Freeman Jr., to express his surprise and dismay that a local prosecutor in New York City had indicted Sheik Khalid, a descendant of the esteemed family that co-founded National Commercial Bank. Until recently, Sheik Khalid was its chief executive.
The King sought to distance himself from Sheik Khalid, saying that it was unfortunate that a Saudi might have run afoul of American banking regulations, but stressing that the banker's actions had nothing to do with the Saudi Government and banking system, said senior Administration officials who were briefed on the meeting.
 
 
Ties to Royal Family
 But Sheik Khalid is not just another banker, and National Commercial is not just another bank. Sheik Khalid is viewed as the personal banker to King Fahd; the bank, which is rooted in a decades-old money-changing operation in Mecca, is inextricably linked to the Saudi Arabian economy and its Government.
At one point, King Fahd made an extraordinary request to Mr. Freeman: would United States banking authorities make an official statement attesting to the strength and independence of the Saudi banking system? Mr. Freeman, uncomfortably, had to say no, telling the King that the United States Government could not interfere in a criminal investigation or publicly pass judgment on the strength of another country's banking system.
"The Ambassador said that the individual bank has to be judged on its merits," one senior Administration official said. "You can't give a Good Housekeeping seal of approval to it."
 American officials say they have done nothing to interfere with the investigations of other prominent Saudi businessmen and had nothing to do with negotiations that led to a sudden and dramatic plea agreement on Monday by Sheik Kamal Adham, a former chief of Saudi foreign intelligence.
Dean St. Denis, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said the agency had no discussions with the Central Intelligence Agency or the State Department about its investigations of Saudi businessmen connected to B.C.C.I. Peter Earnest, a spokesman for the C.I.A., would say only that the agency has a policy "of not commenting on the affiliation of any individual or lack thereof with the C.I.A." Through a spokesman, Edwin D. Williamson, the State Department's legal adviser, declined to comment.
The C.I.A. has acknowledged that it used B.C.C.I., but has insisted that its involvement with the shadowy bank was confined to legitimate banking activities. Agency officials have declined to discuss details of the involvement, asserting that public disclosure could jeopardize intelligence operations. The C.I.A. first received information in the 1980's about B.C.C.I.'s illegal control of First American.
 
 
Baker Said to Avoid Issue
 And senior Administration officials and people close to the Saudi Government say both sides are eager to play down the impact of the banking scandal on American-Saudi relations. They note that the issue was not raised when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d met privately with King Fahd or when he dined with Prince Saud al-Faisal during a visit to Saudi Arabia in July.
And, these officials say, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador to Washington, has not made an issue of the matter in meetings with the State Department and White House.
 Other officials and people close to the Saudi Government say the issue is so embarrassing to King Fahd that it would be out of character for him to raise it in a one-on-one meeting with the Secretary of State. Family connections may have inhibited the two princes from speaking out. One defendant in the case, Sheik Kamal, is the uncle of Prince Saud and of Prince Bandar's wife.
As a measure of the close relationship between the King and the people involved in the case, the lawyers for Sheik Kamal warned American prosecutors that their client would have to get the King's permission before cooperating with an investigation, one law enforcement official said. The prosecutors were unmoved, and the sheik pleaded guilty to fraud charges and agreed to pay $105 million in fines.
B.C.C.I., which was chartered in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands and had branches in 70 countries, was closed in July 1991 by banking regulators of various nations, who accused it of worldwide fraud. Liquidators have been unable to find much of the bank's assets, which were reported to be $20 billion shortly before the shutdown.
 
 
U.S. Lawyers Indicted
 On Wednesday, the bank's principal American lawyers, former Defense Secretary Clark M. Clifford and his partner, Robert A. Altman, were indicted on charges of helping B.C.C.I. gain control of First American, and of accepting bribes from B.C.C.I. Both men pleaded not guilty.
Law enforcement officials say the next phase of the B.C.C.I. investigation will focus on other Saudis, including Sheik Abdul Raouf Khalil, an obscure businessman who worked in Saudi intelligence under Sheik Kamal and went on to become a senior member of Saudi intelligence, according to past and present Western intelligence officials.
The Fed has accused both sheiks of helping B.C.C.I. secretly purchase First American. State charges were filed in New York because First American owned a bank there.

Chart: Saudis Affected by the B.C.C.I. Scandal
 
Sheik Kamal Adham
 
This former director of Saudi Arabian intelligence, who pleaded guilty last week to a violation of New York banking laws, was accused of acting as a front man on behalf of B.C.C.I. in its secret purchase of First American Bank in Washington. He has agreed to cooperate with American law-enforcement officials who believe that, among other things, he may be able to provide information on B.C.C.I. connections to intelligence communities around the world.
 
Sheik Khalid bin Mahfouz
 
A former top officer of the National Commercial Bank, the largest bank in Saudi Arabia, and the personal banker of Saudi's King Fahd, is charged with defrauding B.C.C.I. customers of $300 million from 1985 to 1991. He was a director of the bank and is also accused of conspiring with bank executives to mislead auditors and regulators about the extend of his own holdings in the bank and about the bank's financial condition.
 
Sheik Abdul Raouf Khalil
 
This wealthly real estate and electronics investor is described by American officials as a senior officer in Saudi intelligence. He has not been charged with a crime, but the Federal Reserve has moved to bar him from U.S. banking, charging that he, too, acted as a front man on behalf of B.C.C.I. in its secret takeover of First American Bankshares.
 
King Faud
 
During the B.C.C.I investigations, King Fahd summoned American Ambassador Charles Freeman, expressed deep concern and ask that the United States state publicly that the scandal had nothing to do with the stability and honesty of Saudi banking. The American response was essentially that was impossible because its judicial system operates independently. The case is said to have put a strain on relations between the United States and its close Mideast ally.

HEADLINE: High Court Says Haitians Can Be Sent Home

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
The Supreme Court today permitted the Bush Administration to continue to send Haitians picked up at sea back to their homeland while the Court decides whether to review the legality of President Bush's order to return them.
The Court granted a request by the Justice Department to stay a ruling on Wednesday by a Federal appeals court in New York that had effectively nullified the Administration policy. The stay will remain in effect while the Justice Department and lawyers for the Haitians prepare their arguments on the merits of the case. 
 Justices Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens dissented from the decision to lift the stay, arguing that the Justice Department offered only a vague statement of possible harm to foreign policy if the return policy was halted.
 
A Threat of Persecution
 But the justices said the refugees "face the real and immediate threat of persecution, terror and possibly even death at the hands of those to whom they are being forcibly returned."
Lawyers say they expect the Supreme Court will agree to accept the case because two Federal circuit courts have issued conflicting opinions in the last year on whether Federal immigration law required the Administration to extend protection to refugees picked up in international waters, outside United States territory.
In February, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta ruled that the right to apply for asylum applied only to aliens who had arrived in the United States. On Wednesday the Federal appeals court in New York, overturning a ruling in June by a Federal judge in Brooklyn, decided 2 to 1 that that such protection extends beyond American territory.
President Bush issued a directive in May ordering that Haitians fleeing in boats for the United States be halted by the Coast Guard and escorted back to their shores without being interviewed by immigration officials on their reason for fleeing. Since then the exodus from Haiti has largely stopped.
Some 37,000 Haitians had been picked up by the Coast Guard since a military coup overthrew Haiti's President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on Sept. 30, 1991, and thousands were being housed at an American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
But at the end of June, the Administration began to empty the Cuban camp, sending those who qualified for asylum to the United States and those who did not back to Haiti.
Critics of the repatriation policy call it a violation of internationally recognized human rights. The Administration has maintained, however, that the fleeing Haitians are escaping economic conditions, not political repression.
 
Judges Evenly Divided
 Eight Federal judges have ruled on whether the immigration legislation at issue extends beyond American territory and they have been evenly divided, four concluding the statute does apply in international waters and four deciding it does not.
In its action today the Supreme Court gave the Justice Department until Aug. 24 to defend its policy and two more weeks for lawyers representing the Haitians to submit their response. The department has maintained that reversing the policy would lead to a mass exodus of refugees.
But lawyers for the Haitians said today that they intended to ask for an expedited hearing before the Court, given the imminent threat to their clients.
"We're going to ask the Supreme Court to hear the case on an expedited basis because of the daily harm to our clients who are being forced to return to Haiti," said Lucas Guttentag, the director of the immigration rights project in New York for the American Civil Liberties Union.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Anti-Quayle Rumbling Hasn't Ended

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Although Vice President Dan Quayle insists that the issue is closed, the question of whether he should stay on the 1992 Republican ticket remains a major topic at the top levels of the party.
With President Bush having also said repeatedly last week that there would be no change, few senior Republicans are willing to discuss the matter publicly. But promise them anonymity, and a substantial minority of state officials, leaders on Capitol Hill and even Cabinet members readily express their antagonism and especially their wish that Mr. Quayle would take himself out of the running. 
 "The President isn't going to demand he get off the ticket," a leading Midwestern Senator said. "But a lot of us wish he would fall on his sword, go in and tell George Bush he was quitting for the sake of the party."
Such attitudes are fueled by the conviction that something must be done soon to persuade the electorate to give Mr. Bush "a second look," much as Democrats thought Bill Clinton had to do at the Democratic convention. Some dramatic gesture is needed, an anti-Quayle Cabinet member argued, "to take the public's eye off the economy and the tax increase and focus instead on what a second Bush term might deliver."
As Mr. Quayle's defenders assert, that could be accomplished just as well, and perhaps better, by developing programs and a theme for the President's re-election bid, but no new programs are on the drawing board. So the search for a scapegoat continues.
"The real trouble is that they have no strategic plan and no substantive program," said Edward J. Rollins, the former White House political director under Ronald Reagan whose heretical behavior in working for the campaign of Ross Perot has not severed his ties to many top Republicans. "I don't think they're going to get a second look, because Quayle isn't the problem. Bush is the problem, and he's not going to change."
 
'No Strategic Master Plan'
 In California this week, the President seemed somewhat more combative, but his campaigning still lacked focus, and one of his senior advisers conceded, "There is still no strategic master plan in sight for the fall."
The conservative columnist George Will, who has never liked Mr. Bush much, went so far this week as to suggest that the President should say "the heck with it, I've got fish to catch and grandchildren to catch them with." If he does not, Mr. Will wrote in a column that stunned Republican politicians, "he almost certainly will lose, perhaps in a landslide that does considerable damage to his party."
Similar calls came from other strong backers of former President Ronald Reagan who have faulted the Bush Administration for its lack of an ideological rudder. Among them were Burton Yale Pines, a conservative policy analyst, who said on CBS's "This Morning" program that Mr. Bush should "do the honorable thing and abdicate," and Richard A. Viguerie, a conservative fund-raiser, who urged Mr. Bush to step aside in favor of Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d joining him as his running mate.
But the main focus remains on Mr. Quayle. Calls for his removal are fed, especially on Capitol Hill, by fears that a Bush-Quayle ticket will drag Republican senators and others down to defeat. Many of those who want Mr. Bush to keep Mr. Quayle want him to dump either the budget director, Richard G. Darman, or Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady or both. Some of the panic-stricken lawmakers are beginning to talk about the Republican debacle of 1964.
Polls show that as much as 60 percent of the electorate says that Mr. Quayle should go, which gives the continued muttering plausibility.
In that context, an advertisement placed in The Washington Post by L. E. Thomas, an auto dealer in northwest Florida who has been a leading Republican organizer and fund-raiser since the Nixon era, attracted much more attention than it would normally have done. Mr. Thomas, a former state party chairman, urged Mr. Quayle to pull out for the good of the ticket.
Like many others who make such appeals, Mr. Thomas disapproved of the choice of Mr. Quayle for Vice President in the first place. David Beckwith, the Vice President's spokesman, also called attention to Mr. Thomas's support of Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, a Democrat, asserting that Mr. Thomas is no longer "a Republican in good standing."
But Mr. Thomas is not alone in keeping the subject alive and thereby continuing to undermine the Vice President's already tenuous credibility.
 
More Public Advice
 An editorial in the current issue of National Review, William F. Buckley Jr.'s conservative journal, describes Mr. Quayle as "a class act" who would "have made a good President." But it says that his "lightweight public reputation is beyond repair" and constitutes "a liability at a time when a strong ticket is indispensable" to the Republican campaign.
Mr. Bush, the article asserts, should have accepted Mr. Quayle's earlier offer to resign, and it argues that a conservative like Mr. Kemp or Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on the ticket could turn things around even now.
One of the few anti-Quayle senators still discussing the subject publicly is Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, who told a group of broadcasters this week that "these things are always open." He strongly suggested that the Vice President would be removed from the ticket before the Republican convention, which begins Aug. 17 in Houston.
But friends of Secretary of State Baker, who is widely expected to move into the White House this month as a kind of supermanager of the Bush campaign, describe him as "unwilling to push for Quayle's downfall" because it would unleash a firestorm of conservative antagonism, even if another conservative joined the ticket.
Mr. Baker has never had strong links to the Republican right wing, and he cannot afford to strain relationships further if he has any hope of running for President himself in 1996, as many Republicans believe he does.
The conviction remains strong in the party that Mr. Baker will, in fact, take over the management of the Bush operation, despite reports during the last week that the President had told his Cabinet that no decision had been made. If, after so much publicity, Mr. Baker does not come to the aid of his old friend, it would be another blow to Mr. Bush's lagging campaign.

HEADLINE: STATE LEGISLATORS ARE LEAVING OFFICE IN RECORD NUMBERS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
A third of the state legislators in the nation are giving up their seats this year in an exodus that experts say is the largest in more than 30 years.
The turnover, which experts say is sure to be swollen further by the defeat of some incumbents in November, parallels a high number of departures by members of Congress. 
 Federal and state legislators have said they are leaving for many of the same reasons, including a desire to retire or because their districts were redrawn or eliminated as a result of redistricting after the 1990 census. But others blame the recession of the 90's, saying it has made their jobs painful and turned constituents against them.
 
'Uglier and Meaner'
 "Politics has gotten uglier and meaner," said Sam Hunt, 50 years old, a two-term member of the North Carolina House. Mr. Hunt said he decided to give up his seat to devote more time to his family and his electrical supply business in Burlington.
This year's extraordinary turnover was the topic of a major speech and many hallway conversations in Cincinnati, where a thousand legislators gathered last week for the annual convention of the National Conference of State Legislatures.
"I've begun to feel like the singer of 'Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie,' " Paul B. Burke, president of the national conference, told 4,500 assembled legislators, spouses and staff members on Tuesday. Mr. Burke, who is President of the Kansas Senate, quoted some lyrics from the 1971 song, "American Pie,"-- " 'Bad news on every doorstep; I couldn't take one more step' " -- before recounting some likely results.
 
Majorities of Freshmen
 He said that about 40 percent of the legislators in Connecticut and Georgia could be new next year, that a third of Maine's senators who are up for re-election are not running and that a majority of members in the New Hampshire House and the Kansas Senate could be freshmen next year. He said that most committees in the Kansas Senate would have new members as chairmen because the heads of nine major committees had chosen not to seek re-election.
"This is the largest turnover I think we've seen since the mid-1960's," said William T. Pound, executive director of the national conference, an educational and research organization based in Washington.
The conference, which compiles statistics on legislative members, has tracked turnover only since 1979, but Mr. Pound and other experts estimated that the rate has been fairly consistent at 20 percent since 1964 and 1966, after the United States Supreme Court ruled that state legislatures had to be equally represented according to population. The court-ordered changes in districts that resulted caused sharp increases in the turnover rate comparable to this year's.
Mr. Pound said the conference's surveys of its members indicated that 2,500 of the nation's 7,500 state legislators were expected to retire, return to work full time at their businesses or professions, seek other offices or be defeated in races against another incumbent in primaries. The 2,500 seats does not include any estimate for the number of incumbents who might be defeated in the 6,079 legislative races in November.
 
Party Control May Change
 About 20 percent of the legislators are not facing re-election this year because five states have no election and, in most states with races, only half of the senate seats are on the ballots.
Political analysts say the elections could change partisan control of one or, in a few cases, both chambers in a dozen states where one party holds a narrow majority.
The turnover in the state legislatures parallels that in Congress, where freshman legislators may occupy a third of all House seats, according to a projection by Norman J. Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, who noted that nearly 100 members had already said they were not returning.
Public policy experts say they are not concerned by the large turnover, which was common earlier in this century but add that legislators' declining job satisfaction poses a serious threat to democracy.
"Legislators are getting bashed brutally, and I don't think they deserve it," said Allan Rosenthal, director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. "The danger is that many good people will not run for office, or if they do, they won't stay long."
In two dozen interviews with legislators, including a geography professor from Connecticut, farmers from Kansas and a real-estate broker from Ohio, all mentioned many pressures and stresses, among them time and money.
Legislators complained about missing family events and having to let their businesses flounder because they had to work long hours as lawmakers. Even in states with short legislative sessions, lawmakers said they were busy year-round performing committee work, helping constituents, attending community meetings, raising money and campaigning.
 
Many Cite Low Pay
 Yet, experts say, the pay of most legislators ranks among the lowest for all state workers. Though most legislators' jobs are part time in theory, they say the work has evolved to be full time. New Hampshire legislators are paid $100 a year plus mileage expenses, for example. About 10 states pay legislators under $15,000 a year and about 10 pay them more than $30,000, Mr. Rosenthal said, with the others falling in between. The average is about $25,000.
Many legislators said they faced a financial problem because they could not live on their state salaries. Yet, they said, lawmakers' responsibilities left little time to tend to private business, and when they did make money on the side, it made people suspicious.
"It's impossible to avoid the appearance of a conflict," said Harry Meshel, a Democratic State Senator from Youngstown, Ohio. "If you do some business with a utility, do you separate yourself from utility issues in the Senate?"
Mr. Meshel, who receives a state salary of $44,000 plus expenses, said that he planned to continue in his position but that the ethical questions, as well as time constraints, had forced him to give up most of his real-estate business.
Irving J. Stolberg, 55, a geography professor and a Democrat who has represented New Haven in the Connecticut House for 22 years, including two terms as Speaker, blames news coverage, especially television, for much of the public's cynicism toward politicians. "The drudgery and challenges that occupy 98 percent of a legislator's day are not considered news, but scandal is instantly news," said the veteran legislator, who has announced that he will retire.
Mr. Stolberg, who was a driving force behind the enactment of Connecticut's income tax last year, said he was not seeking re-election largely because his work on the income tax completed his agenda as a legislator. But he said many of the other 53 members of Connecticut's 187-member General Assembly were not seeking re-election because they were "really tired" after two extremely contentious years.
"Most of us had death threats when we passed the income tax in 1991," he said.
New Jersey had a relatively large turnover of about 25 percent in its election last year, with the Democrats losing control of both houses to the Republicans after Gov. Jim Florio and the Legislature had raised taxes by $2.8 billion in 1990. In New York this year, turnover is expected to be about average, with 24, or 11 percent, of the Legislature's 211 members declining to seek re-election.
 
'It Isn't Fun Anymore'
 Mr. Hunt, the North Carolina House member, may have echoed the sentiments of others who have decided to retire: "It isn't fun anymore. It isn't rewarding anymore, and the time it takes is just unbelievable."
Some legislators at the conference said they shared some of the electorate's views about government.
"The people are very angry and frustrated with the system, and so am I," said Carol G. Hanson, a Republican State Representative from Boca Raton, Fla., and who has represented Palm Beach County for 10 years. "A day doesn't go by that you don't read about a legislator taking himself a nice job out of the budget, or about the horrors of the new computer system at the state welfare agency."
Her frustration, Ms. Hanson said, prompted her to join colleagues in vain attempts to abolish entire bureaucracies, including the departments of education and transportation. Ms. Hanson is continuing as a legislator, but she said that the frustration of such failures was one reason that about 50 of the 120 members of Florida House were not seeking re-election this year.
But acknowledging that voters had reason to be angry, she said they shared the blame. "If we could get the public as involved and as informed about politics as they are about Monday Night Football, we wouldn't have as many problems," Ms. Hanson said. "People have to get off their duffs and participate."

HEADLINE: Thanks for Coming! Now, Please Leave!

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
In his carefully orchestrated trip to Staten Island last week, Mayor David N. Dinkins was facing a problem that also bedeviled his predecessors: to address somehow the deep-seated and abiding sense in every borough, including parts of Manhattan, that the central government in lower Manhattan holds them in low esteem and serves them less well than it does other areas.
Staten Island, where the Mayor is also spending this weekend, is the fourth stop in his intermittent yearlong effort to spend a week outside of City Hall in each of New York's far-flung boroughs. He has already visited the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. He plans to spend a week soon in northern Manhattan. 
 But the difficulties he faces were particularly apparent on Staten Island, the most physically and psychologically remote of the five boroughs, a place so fundamentally alienated from the rest of New York that most of the island's political leaders favor secession from the city.
Residents of Staten Island have long felt that they are the city's stepchildren, underserved and unappreciated. The Mayor's efforts last week did not appear to alter that perception significantly. Though his advisers said they were pleased with the generally positive coverage of the visit in the local daily newspaper, The Staten Island Advance, random interviews on Friday with local residents showed broad dissatisfaction with city government.
 
'It's Just Politics'
 "His visit more or less is just a show to appease some of these people," said John Bonica, a 41-year-old electrician who has lived his entire life on Staten Island. "I think people are so disgusted with the way things have been going that there is almost nothing he can do to change their minds."
Cynthia Brockdorff, a 32-year-old homemaker, dismissed the Mayor's visit. "It's just politics," she said, "and everybody who lives in Staten Island knows it. It's a little too little, a little too late."
Staten Island's electorate tends to be much more conservative and Republican than the rest of the city. There is a widespread perception that Staten Island is a place where New York puts its most unpopular things, in particular the Fresh Kills landfill. Staten Islanders also resent proposals to build homeless shelters and prisons in their borough, although they tend to ignore the fact that similar city projects are spread throughout the other four boroughs.
In personal terms, as well, Mr. Dinkins was forging into hostile territory. He did worse in Staten Island than in any other borough in the 1989 mayoral campaign, winning the support of only 16 percent of the borough's voters. The Mayor acknowledged all this when he arrived Monday morning, and he stated clearly that his goals for the week were modest.
 
Wants to Show He Cares
 "If nothing else, I hope that I can convey to the people of Staten Island that I deeply care about them," he said at a welcoming reception on a plaza in front of Borough Hall in St. George, the island's downtown, which with its hills and fading buildings feels more like a small but charming town in western Pennsylvania than part of one of the world's foremost urban centers.
"I don't care whether you agree with me on all issues or not," he said. "If you are reasonable people, you have to say to yourselves, 'Well, by God, he does care.' "
Mr. Dinkins's predecessor, Edward I. Koch, tried to convey that he cared about potentially alienated neighborhoods by holding what he called "town meetings." These were essentially 90-minute free-for-alls in which Mr. Koch, about once a month, would take questions from residents in schools around the city, alternately informing, cajoling, debating and berating his fellow New Yorkers.
Mr. Dinkins's strategy is as different from Mr. Koch's as their personal styles. Mr. Dinkins, a mathematician by undergraduate training, prefers carefully planned events to the spontaneous uproar that Mr. Koch usually inspired.
 
Many Meetings, Mixed Results
 So all week Mr. Dinkins shuttled from his makeshift office on the third floor of Borough Hall to ceremonial events around the island. He argued the economic case against secession at a Rotary Club luncheon. He went to dinner with the Chamber of Commerce. He met privately with an array of local groups, from a Democratic club to the Staten Island Council of Jewish Organizations.
Mr. Dinkins occasionally passed out small mayoral goodies, like a new policy of free transfers between local and express buses, and he announced some upbeat news, like a decline in overall crime. He toured the Teleport, a communications center on the western edge of Staten Island that is a major employer, the new Homeport naval base and Fresh Kills, the notorious dump.
Wherever he went, the Mayor was greeted politely, and occasionally enthusiastically. He also met sometimes with ordinary Staten Islanders, with mixed results. He spent time one afternoon strolling with a police officer on his beat down New Dorp Lane, a suburban-like shopping street in the predominantly white, middle-class section of New Dorp.
Mr. Dinkins, New York's first black Mayor, was greeted warmly by shopkeepers and strollers, and he chatted amiably with children checking out books in the local branch library and homemakers pushing toddlers in strollers.
 
Challenge and Support
 One woman did challenge the Mayor, contending that his handling of the disturbances in Washington Heights last month was biased toward the victim of a police shooting, Jose Garcia, and against the police. Mr. Dinkins angrily disagreed. So did another woman, who was listening to the conversation on the sidewalk. She told several reporters, "My son is a detective and he thinks the Mayor is terrific," and she volunteered her name, Rosalyn Sonsky, before the reporters could ask.
Mr. Dinkins's reception was distinctly cool, though, when he appeared a half-hour earlier at the 122d precinct on Hylan Boulevard, a few blocks away. The Mayor walked behind the front desk, and the first officer he encountered, a young black woman, greeted him with a bright smile. But the two white officers in charge behind the desk barely acknowledged Mr. Dinkins's presence. One shook his hand without smiling or making eye contact. The other officer did not look at the Mayor and appeared so cold that Mr. Dinkins did not extend his hand.
Many of the Staten Islanders interviewed at random on Friday appeared hostile both toward the Mayor and virtually all other politicians. "I don't think his heart is in it," Mr. Bonica, the electrician, said of Mr. Dinkins's visit. "I don't think he wants to be here."
Another resident, Benito Alvarez, a 54-year-old high school Spanish teacher, said he was unaware of the Mayor's visit. And Gabriella Sutton, a 31-year-old clerk in the city's Probation Department, dismissed the Mayor's presence in the borough.
"Politics," Ms. Sutton said. "It's all lies. They promise you anything until they get elected."

HEADLINE: Issue in Campaign Is Biaggi's Record, but Which One?

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Mario Biaggi wants to base his Congressional comeback bid on his record, a reputation for championing the working people through unflagging constituent service and legislation over 10 terms in Congress.
Eliot Engel, the incumbent Congressman, also wants to base his campaign on Mr. Biaggi's record -- on the convictions in two trials for bribe-taking, extortion and other charges that landed Mr. Biaggi in a Federal prison for two years and two months. 
 The candidates are vying for the Democratic nomination for the 17th Congressional District, which cuts a swath through the northern Bronx and jogs into parts of southern Westchester County.
Mr. Engel, touching on what is certain to be a recurrent issue, insisted last week that not only did Mr. Biaggi betray the public by the acts that led to his conviction on charges stemming from the Wedtech bribery scandal, but he got his eight-year prison term cut short with a cynical, self-centered maneuver. Mr. Biaggi, who is 74 years old, was released last year for treatment of life-threatening heart and neurological problems.
"He's too sick to serve in prison, but well enough to run for Congress," said Mr. Engel. "It goes to the heart of the man's integrity."
 
Bigger Issues, Says Biaggi
 Mr. Biaggi countered that he was not sent home to die but to recover and that he saw his candidacy as a challenge to a "do-nothing" incumbent and a chance to reclaim an image he said was sullied by an unfair conviction. Steadfastly maintaining his innocence, he called the September primary "an expression of the people's court," where his name and his public service would carry the day.
"We're talking about a nation in dire economic straits, and individuals are worried about getting a job and surviving," said Mr. Biaggi. "Those are the issues. How often can you say Mario Biaggi was convicted? What does that do to alleviate the personal, national and local pain?"
Mr. Engel said that he has focused on constituent service, with a majority of his staff spread out among three district offices as compared with the two Mr. Biaggi had. "The past four years I worked very hard in the district and in Washington," Mr. Engel said. "I consider myself a spokesman for the forgotten middle class," he said.
He said that he has been involved in issues involving health care and the elderly and was an active member of the House foreign affairs subcommittee on trade issues. In a year of heated abortion debate, Mr. Engel said he is "pro-choice all the way." Mr. Biaggi has not made his position public and declined to discuss even his personal views on abortion.
Mr. Biaggi will be running in a district that was redrawn this year and is now nearly two-thirds black and Hispanic, having lost some white ethnic strongholds from the eastern Bronx.
 
District Is Varied
 The Bronx portions of the new district include the towers of Co-Op City, with its savvy senior citizen vote; the Irish working-class enclaves of Woodlawn and Norwood; part of Riverdale; Hispanic communities in the northwest Bronx; black homeowners in Williamsbridge and Wakefield, and heavily Italian Belmont.
In Westchester, the district takes in southwest Yonkers and its working-class black residents, south Mount Vernon with its core of middle-class black homeowners and part of south New Rochelle. Mr. Engel said the increased minority population and the removal of some of the white ethnic areas favored his candidacy, because, he said, he thinks he has more appeal to that constituency than Mr. Biaggi.
While the neighborhoods vary, voters have many of the same concerns -- affordable health care and housing, more jobs, lower taxes and above all, safer streets. And for many, Mr. Biaggi himself is an issue.
Mr. Biaggi is fondly remembered by some voters along the busy streets of the Belmont section.
"People like him a lot," said Luigi Izzo, the owner of the Caffe Napoli on East 187th Street. "They know he's Italian, you know what I mean? A lot remember him helping the community a lot."
Across the street, Patricia Walls sat outside her building with her miniature Doberman pinscher, Babe, resting on her lap. Ms. Walls said she has lived in Belmont for 13 years, and said she was worried that in parts of the neighborhood people feared walking down streets that once were safe.
"Eliot Engel has done nothing for -- how do you say it -- his constituents," she said. "Biaggi was around. If there were drugs in a building, he got it torn down. Whatever we needed, Biaggi was right there."
Tom Newsome said he would break from his past preference for Mr. Biaggi. "Biaggi was already convicted and he got out of jail on a lark," said Mr. Newsome. "If his health wasn't so bad, why did he get out?"
 
Retire, Some Advise
 A similar cynicism prevailed in Woodlawn, where Mr. Biaggi was respected for his stance on Northern Ireland. "He's over the hill," said Bill Brown as he sat outside a self-service laundry. "Where the hell is he going? He should be preparing for eternity."
Mr. Brown, who is elderly himself but declined to give his age, was resolute in his opposition. "He should give some other fellow a break," he said.
Elsie White, a home health aide from south Mount Vernon, said she thought Mr. Biaggi should take advantage of his freedom and retire quietly.
Ask Anne Rocco her greatest concern for her Co-Op City neighborhood and her eyes grow wide with a one-word response.
"Crime," she said. "We need more security."
At 67, William Flippen said he was more preoccupied with the young than with the old. He said drugs have eaten away at his south Yonkers neighborhood, leaving in its wake a trail of violence. A few nights ago, he said, a youth was wounded in a drive-by shooting.
A few blocks away, Jose Montes, 20, stood in the dimly lighted hallway of his apartment building. "The politicians should pay attention to housing projects," he said. "There are so many apartment buildings they should fix them up for the homeless."
Although he said he was a registered voter, he could not recall his party and said he never voted.
"All the politicians worry about is their pockets," he said. "Put money in my pocket and I'll show you a happy citizen. I'll vote all day long, then."

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has been kinder and gentler toward the poor and the disabled, just as George Bush promised four years ago.
Still, the President rarely boasts of his record in this area, partly because he knows he could never satisfy his liberal critics, partly because he does not want to offend conservatives who still revere former President Ronald Reagan. 
 And there may be another reason for his reticence. President Bush's social policy is kinder and gentler than Mr. Reagan's largely because Mr. Bush has given relatively little attention to these issues. And that is a sharp departure from the Reagan Administration, which worked with zeal to reduce or eliminate scores of health, education and welfare programs.
 
Pleasing No One
 The Bush Administration is "less ideologically driven," said Gail R. Wilensky, the deputy assistant to the President for policy development.
In the end, conservatives complain that Mr. Bush's passivity has a darker side because, left alone, the programs have grown, and the eventual costs to the Government will be higher than they might otherwise have been. At the same time, liberals assert that the Administration's neglect has allowed millions of Americans to fall into poverty.
Mr. Bush's record on social policy has become a central issue in this year's campaign. Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential nominee, repeatedly asserts that Mr. Bush has neglected social problems, has ignored growing inequality in the distribution of income and has done nothing to heal racial divisions.
Administration officials say Mr. Clinton's accusations overlook Mr. Bush's efforts in 1990 to secure passage of a law that prohibits discrimination against people with physical or mental disabilities.
For better or for worse, domestic social programs have grown much more rapidly under Mr. Bush than under Mr. Reagan. In a few cases, as with Head Start, the Federal program for preschool children, Mr. Bush has proposed big increases in spending. In other cases, social programs have grown simply because the sluggish economy has left millions more Americans in need of Government aid.
Since January 1989, the number of people receiving food stamps has increased 37 percent, to 25.8 million, the most ever. The number enrolled in the largest welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, has risen 25 percent, to 13.6 million -- also the largest number ever.
Mr. Bush is not directly responsible for those increases. In a recession, the programs grow automatically. Still, the President has not proposed cutbacks, as Mr. Reagan did.
Federal spending on food stamps has increased an average of 15 percent a year in the Bush Administration. In Mr. Reagan's first term, which also included a recession, it grew only 1 percent a year.
At the same time, the Bush Administration's benign approach has led to reversals of Reagan Administration policies in some programs. For example, the Government is no longer purging tens of thousands of disabled people from the Social Security rolls. In other cases, as conservatives point out, Mr. Bush has simply not put up much of a fight against Congressional efforts to expand social welfare programs, like Medicaid, that were tightly constrained in the Reagan years.
 
Objectives Not Defined
 If Mr. Bush seems hesitant in dealing with the nation's social problems, it may be because, by his own account, he feels more comfortable dealing with foreign affairs. As a result, he has displayed less interest in social-welfare programs than did Mr. Reagan, who single-mindedly pursued a clear objective: to cut such programs or slow their growth.
For these and other reasons, social programs have been growing at rates not seen since the Carter years. Data from the Federal Office of Management and Budget show these trends:
*Spending on elementary and secondary education rose 11 percent a year under President Jimmy Carter, 3 percent a year under President Reagan, and 11 percent a year under President Bush.
*For Medicaid spending, the annual rates of increase were 14 percent under Mr. Carter, 9.5 percent under Mr. Reagan and 25 percent under Mr. Bush.
*For the Head Start program, the increases averaged 15 percent a year under Mr. Carter, 5 percent under Mr. Reagan and 22 percent under Mr. Bush.
Martin Anderson, a senior adviser to President Reagan, said with regret that there had had been "explosive growth in domestic spending" under Mr. Bush. But Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute, a Libertarian research center here, said Mr. Bush received little political credit for the "domestic budget buildup."
"To people on the right, Bush has been a traitor because of his willingness to dump money into social programs," Mr. Moore said. "Constituencies on the left are not satisfied because they want to spend even more."
Experts estimate that 15 percent to 20 percent of the increase in domestic spending was a result of the automatic recession-related growth in benefit programs like food stamps, welfare and unemployment insurance. An additional portion of the increase would have occurred anyway because of the aging of the population, inflation in health care and other similar factors. The remainder, perhaps 40 percent, results from program changes proposed by President Bush or initiated by Congress and accepted by Mr. Bush.
 
Record Debt and Deficit
 Military spending has declined in each of the last two years. But the Federal budget deficit and the Federal debt, which reflects the accumulated total of all Federal borrowing, are at record levels, in large part because of record spending in the Reagan-Bush years.
The debt represents a relentless burden on the nation; there is no way to reduce it unless the Government runs a surplus. And interest on the debt now eats up nearly 15 percent of all Federal spending. Those facts place clear constraints on any President's ability to promote new domestic spending initiatives.
To be sure, in his budget request to Congress in January, Mr. Bush proposed ending 222 domestic programs. But the estimated saving, $1 billion in 1993, would be relatively small in the context of a $1.5 trillion budget.
At the same time, Mr. Bush boasts of making "substantial increases" in Federal spending for Head Start, the immunization of children, prenatal care and child nutrition programs. But liberals in Congress and at advocacy groups like the Children's Defense Fund say he has not gone far enough to meet the nation's needs, in Head Start or other programs.
Even when Administration officials are deeply involved in negotiating a compromise with Congress on a major domestic issue, like Federal aid to cities or Federal subsidies for child care, Mr. Bush and his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, rarely try to take credit. Aides to Mr. Bush find his reticence frustrating and puzzling.
Dr. Wilensky, the deputy assistant to the President, observed that "the White House did not aggressively take credit for achieving an urban-aid package" in June, even though it closely followed White House specifications. The $1.1 billion measure provides loans and grants to Los Angeles and Chicago and includes summer job money for scores of cities.
Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research and advocacy group, said the President "missed an opportunity to make striking improvements in urban policy after the riots in Los Angeles." Mr. Bush voiced compassion when he visited Los Angeles after the riots this spring, saying: "We are embarrassed by interracial violence and prejudice. We are ashamed." But then he opposed Congressional efforts to provide more than the $1.1 billion agreed to in the compromise.
Mr. Greenstein asked: "Has George Bush pursued kinder, gentler policies than President Reagan? The answer is yes. But that doesn't say much. You are damning with faint praise. Reagan's policies exacerbated serious social problems. Bush has made some modest improvements, but his course is mainly one of drift."
 
Policy and Personnel
Politics Divorced From Social Issues
 In every Administration, domestic social policy is set at the top. Lyndon B. Johnson and Ronald Reagan spoke with such deep conviction that their appointees and Congress knew what they wanted. Mr. Bush's message has often been uncertain or contradictory. But in some important areas, his policies have clearly been more moderate than those of Mr. Reagan.
Mr. Bush's Social Security Commissioner, Gwendolyn S. King, continually talks of the need for fairness and compassion in ruling on claims for Social Security. Her tone is totally different from that of John A. Svahn, the Reagan Administration's first Social Security Commissioner, who led a campaign to curb the cost of Social Security retirement and disability benefits.
And John R. Dunne, the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights in the Bush Administration, has sided with minority groups in civil rights litigation much more often than his predecessor, William Bradford Reynolds, who frequently sided with whites accused of discrimination.
Likewise, as Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for the last three years, Catherine A. Bertini went out of her way to help people who depend on food stamps, the school-lunch program and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC.
"Catherine Bertini's door was always open to us," said Edward M. Cooney, deputy director of the Food Research and Action Center, an advocacy group for low-income families. "She supported modest increases in the WIC program, and she was always sympathetic to our concerns."
 
'Not Always in Sync'
 But, he said, "the Administration has opposed legislative initiatives to deal with childhood hunger" in a larger, systematic way. "It refused to provide the additional $3.5 billion that is necessary to address the problem over the next five years," he added.
One reason for this discrepancy is that the Bush Administration has had trouble blending politics with social policy. In this election year, for example, the Administration's experts on social programs have generally been excluded from discussions of political strategy. And the President's political strategists rarely attend the detailed discussions of social programs.
"Politics and policy are not always in sync," said a White House aide who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The things come out of the end of two different tubes."
Bush appointees have not cooperated to concoct an ambitious, coherent social policy. When John H. Sununu served as White House chief of staff, he and Richard G. Darman, the budget director, rebuffed social-policy initiatives proposed by other Administration officials, on the ground that they would be too costly.
Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has voiced far more concern for the plight of poor people than his predecessor, Samuel R. Pierce Jr. But until the riots in Los Angeles, Mr. Kemp was often a voice in the wilderness, crying for the White House to pay more attention to the problems of poor people in the nation's cities.
 
Civil Rights
Uneven Record Pleases No One
 On civil rights, as on environmental issues, Mr. Bush's record is filled with contradictions that suggest that he has conflicting impulses.
In 1990, Mr. Bush worked closely with Congress to secure approval of a landmark law that prohibits discrimination against people with physical or mental disabilities. And the civil rights division of the Justice Department, under Mr. Dunne, has vigorously enforced the Voting Rights Act, blocking many state and local redistricting plans on the ground that they discriminate against people who are black or Hispanic.
The Bush Administration also successfully challenged gerrymandering that excluded Hispanic people from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, one of the most powerful local governing bodies in the country.
The Justice Department's support for voting rights may prove to be good politics for the Administration. Republicans have often found themselves in an alliance of convenience with black and Hispanic groups, trying to pack minority populations into urban electoral districts. Republicans assumed they would then have a greater chance of victory in nearby suburban districts because whites would account for a larger proportion of the voters in those districts.
 
A Fractured Record
 Civil rights advocates say there has also been more vigorous enforcement of housing laws in the last three years. "There has been a significant improvement in enforcement of the Federal Fair Housing Act," said John P. Relman of the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. "The Justice Department is bringing more cases than ever before. It's more aggressive in seeking large judgments against people who discriminate in the rental or sale of housing."
But Mr. Bush will probably not be remembered for those cases so much as for his veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1990, which sought to protect workers against job discrimination by effectively overruling six Supreme Court decisions. Mr. Bush complained that the bill would force employers to adopt quotas for hiring and promoting members of minority groups.
After a bitter fight with civil rights groups and Democratic members of Congress, Mr. Bush signed a revised version of the bill in November 1991, amid indications that Congress might have had the votes to override a veto. But even as he signed it, he was embroiled in a new furor. The White House counsel, C. Boyden Gray, tried to interpret the law so as to end affirmative action programs that the Federal Government had conducted for decades. At the last minute, Mr. Bush cast aside a statement drafted for him by Mr. Gray and declared his support for affirmative action.
The signing ceremony, normally a time for reconciliation, further strained relations between Mr. Bush and civil rights groups. So now, when asked for an appraisal, Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, says, "President Bush's overall record on issues of race and sex discrimination has been terrible."
 
Health Care
A Stalled Plan And No Money
 The search for a national health-care policy illustrates Mr. Bush's difficulty in grappling with a complex social problem. He recognized the problem, and he ordered a study. But he has had trouble putting together a policy. In his speeches, he emphasized the risks of doing too much rather than the need to do anything at all.
More than 35 million Americans have no health insurance, the largest number in at least 15 years. At the same time, health-care costs are rising twice as fast as the Consumer Price Index. In his State of the Union Message in January 1990, Mr. Bush announced that his Domestic Policy Council would study the issue and recommend steps to bring "the staggering costs of health care under control."
Mr. Bush expressed no sense of urgency until a liberal Democrat, Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania, won election to the Senate in November 1991. Mr. Wofford's demand for national health insurance was a centerpiece of his campaign. His victory quickened Congressional interest in the issue and put a spotlight on the Bush Administration's lack of action.
 
No Sense of Urgency
 Three days after that election, Mr. Bush, in Rome for a NATO meeting, said he wanted to present a comprehensive health plan to the American people before the 1992 Presidential election. But, faced with protests from Congressional Republicans, he eliminated an important feature of his plan: a new tax on health insurance benefits that affluent people get from their employers.
Mr. Bush's proposal, unveiled in February, calls for a variety of tax credits and deductions to help people buy private health insurance. He said his plan would guarantee access to insurance for all poor families. But he did not say how he would pay for it. Nor did he say how he would control the soaring costs of health care.
He was much clearer about what he opposed. He said Congress must not adopt a national health insurance program like the one in Canada, and he insisted that the Federal Government must not compel employers to buy insurance for workers.
President Bush's budget in January said there was an urgent "need for comprehensive health reform." But his proposal is languishing on Capitol Hill.
"The President has not made a sustained effort to sell his program to Congress," said John C. Rother, legislative director of the American Association of Retired Persons. "There has been little activity by the President or the Administration beyond sporadic attempts to bash health-care proposals by Congressional Democrats."

HEADLINE: Suit Asserts Right of Homeless to Sleep in Park

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: RENO, Aug. 1

 BODY:
A lawsuit has been filed in Federal District Court here asserting that city ordinances against loitering and sleeping in public places discriminate against the homeless.
The suit was filed Tuesday by Washoe Legal Services on behalf of Leopoldo Benavidez Jr., who is described as a homeless man arrested for sleeping in a city park. It charges that the police enforce the laws only against people who look as if they are homeless. 
 The suit seeks certification as a class action on behalf of other homeless people. It is similar to a suit filed on behalf of three homeless people in Miami in 1988; that case has not yet been resolved.
"The issue is one of fundamental fairness," said a lawyer with the Washoe County legal group, Terri Keyser-Cooper. "Everyone has to sleep. We are in effect banishing these people."
According to the lawsuit, many homeless people are mentally or physically disabled and are either unemployed or working at jobs that pay meager wages.
"They are sick, hungry and vulnerable to the elements," the lawsuit said. "Plaintiffs are arrested and jailed for performing the necessary bodily function of sleeping. If they have no place to sleep and they must sleep somewhere, they cannot be arrested for such conduct if no other alternative exists."
A deputy city attorney, Stephen Volek, said the Police Department had never "taken the position that it's appropriate to go in and bother people who appear to be homeless."
 
Disputing a Theory
 But he disputed Ms. Keyser-Cooper's reading of law. "Her theory," he said, "is that there is some legal or constitutional obligation to provide shelter to the homeless and that unless the city finds a way to make them available, it is obligated to make the parks available as a place to sleep. That just isn't the law."
Mr. Benavidez, the 41-year-old plaintiff, was arrested July 2 and charged with violating an ordinance against sleeping in a city park. He was booked into the Washoe County Detention Center and was released on July 10 after pleading guilty.
The lawsuit said that Mr. Benavidez had 4 cents in his pocket when arrested and that he pleaded guilty because he had been told by jailers and other inmates that he would not be assigned a public defender and might serve more jail time if he contested the charge.
Violation of the ordinance is a misdemeanor carrying maximum punishment of a six-month jail term and a $1,000 fine.

HEADLINE: One Suspect's Experience: Property Forfeiture Is Worth $174,000

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOMERVILLE, N.J.

 BODY:
Although the price of real estate in central New Jersey took a beating in the nationwide recession, little compares with the plunge in price on two vacant lots after the Somerset County Prosecutor's office confiscated them in a drug case two years ago.
The land, in the rolling hills of neighboring Hunterdon County, was bought for $174,000 in 1988 by James Giuffre, a Somerset builder and insurance agent. 
 After Mr. Giuffre was arrested two years later in his home with with a half-ounce of cocaine, he agreed to a deal the Prosecutor's detectives proposed in which he would forfeit the lots instead of his house.
Within 26 hours of Mr. Giuffre's arrest, deeds conveying the property to Somerset County were filed at Hunterdon County Courthouse in Flemington. Months later, the same lots were sold to a lone bidder at a public sale for a total of $20,000, and later wound up in the hands of acquaintances of the chief of detectives for the County Prosecutor. The sale of the lots and a lawsuit Mr. Giuffre has filed to get them back or be compensated for their loss have raised questions about the way the Prosecutor's office administers assets taken in drug cases.
The Prosecutor, Nicholas L. Bissell Jr., reasoned that the difference in the $174,000 price Mr. Giuffre paid for the two lots in 1988 and the $20,000 sale price two years later was that Mr. Giuffre had made a bad investment: he had paid too much at the top of the real-estate boom for property with poor prospects for development.
"There's no way, even if you wanted to, that a public sale with sealed bids could be fixed," he said in an interview. "We've got brains, you know. There's no way in the world anyone in this shop was going to submarine his career over a deal like this."
But Mr. Giuffre contends in his suit in Federal court in Trenton that the Prosecutor and his assistants conspired to strip him of the property and that he was pressured into signing the deeds over to the county without a lawyer being present.
The public sale of the forfeited land did not take place until December 1990. Both lots are in the hills above Flemington, where homes in the $300,000 range are not unusual.
 
Prosecutor 'Expressed Satisfaction'
 "It looks like in hindsight we gave it away, but it belonged to the Prosecutor's office and he expressed satisfaction with the price," said Michael Camerino, then the deputy county counsel, who was in charge of the sale. "If the county was selling surplus property we would have gone through a detailed process, like put our engineering staffs on it or hire an independent appraiser. The only information I could base the sale on came from the Prosecutor's office."
Mr. Camerino said he was shown an appraisal by the Prosecutor's office that indicated one lot was next to a junkyard and the other had serious drainage problems. He said he was also told that septic permits for both lots would expire shortly after the sale and that new state standards made their renewal problematic. No minimum bid was set.
The man who did the appraisal is John Graham, a Hunterdon County real-estate broker. He said he "took a look" at the property a few days after Mr. Giuffre's arrest. "It was not a formal appraisal by any means," Mr. Graham said in a telephone interview. "All I did was eyeball the two pieces and give an opinion." He said he would not pay more than $20,000 for one lot and $25,000 for the second.
He said he did not research any county or Raritan Township documents to back up his snap judgments. Had he checked, he would have learned that the property had passed soil tests and that septic tank permits on both lots were good until Dec. 31, 1994.
"If anything," said James A. Gallos, senior sanitarian for the County Health Department, "passing soil tests on developable land like this is like gold."
 
'Junkyard' Is a Farm
 Craig Proctor, a licensed appraiser in Flemington, said: "It's hard for me to believe three-acre lots in that area went for $10,000. They should have sold for 10 times that." The county tax assessment rolls, a few months after they went for $20,000, listed their combined market value at $147,700.
Mr. Graham also acknowledged last week that the "auto junkyard" he cited in his appraisal was in fact a farm with four or five unused cars one-quarter of a mile away.
When the sale was conducted in the Somerset County courthouse on Dec. 10, 1990, three people were present: Mr. Bissell, Mr. Camerino and Juanita DeWit. Ms. DeWit was awarded the two lots for $10,000 each.
At the time, Ms. DeWit was an employee of a local building firm, Merit Developers Inc., whose president was John Hromoho. In January 1992, after Ms. DeWit married Mr. Hromoho, one of the lots was sold to a Somerset County jail officer, Kirk Hamrah, and his wife, for $10,000.
On the second lot, Mrs. Hromoho obtained a $150,000 mortgage from the Somerset Trust Company on the authority of its lawyer, Thomas C. Miller. Mr. Miller also serves as Somerset County Counsel and is a longtime associate of Mr. Bissell, who before becoming the Prosecutor in 1982, represented Somerset Trust as a lawyer.
In April, Mrs. Hromoho deeded this lot for $1 to her husband's company, and the property, with a new house built on it, was sold for $221,000 in the spring.
Mr. Thornburg, the chief detective, expressed indignation when interviewed about his relationship to the two men who eventually ended up with the lots, John Hromoho and Kirk Hamrah. He said he barely knew them.
Yet Mr. Thornburg and Mr. Hamrah grew up in Dunellen, a small community just over the county line in Middlesex County, and they still live near Dunellen, as does Mr. Hromoho. Mr. Hromoho was an assistant football coach for the Dunellen High School in the years when Mr. Thornburg's younger brother Ron was the star running back, just as Mr. Thornburg himself had been a few years earlier. Kirk Hamrah and his brothers had played for the same team.
Mr. Thornburg said that he was living in Hunterdon County when Mr. Hromoho coached the team, and that he did not attend his younger brother's games. Ron Thornburg also is a detective on his brother's squad.
The Prosecutor, Mr. Bissell, said he doesn't know the Hromohos, and Mr. Hromoho declined to discuss the case.

HEADLINE: Small Orchestras Facing Unharmonious Slow Passages

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
The Hartford Symphony has not played a note in more than a year, and the fall season may be canceled this week if musicians reject a contract that would drastically reduce their earnings.
Although the dispute has been particularly bitter, the troubles in Hartford are but one expression of the financial difficulties affecting orchestras in medium-sized communities throughout the Northeast. 
 While big orchestras like the New York Philharmonic or the Boston Symphony are weathering the recession thanks to large endowments and a more solid audience base, symphonies with smaller budgets, less fund-raising prowess and more modest concert schedules have been reeling. They have suffered from the combined effects of reduced public and private financing, the difficulty of attracting new, younger audiences and the high costs of marketing and fund-raising.
Musicians playing for such orchestras have seen their pay drop by 19 percent between 1986 and 1991, while the income of performers with major orchestras has gone up 6.2 percent, according to a study released in June by the American Symphony Orchestra League.
Not only have musicians' pay and concert schedules been trimmed, but administrators have been dismissed, fewer soloists have been hired, and programs have been modified to include more popular works and exclude ones requiring large numbers of musicians.
"Corporate and government support has been way down in the last two or three years, we have an accumulated deficit of $750,000 and this is not a temporary situation," said Paul Reuter, the executive director of the Hartford Symphony. "We asked for concessions from our core musicians because that's the only way we can survive. There's a lot of trouble in our business."
The orchestra league study warned that "unless changes are made in the way orchestras do business, the future of the orchestra industry is in serious jeopardy." The report said that American orchestras' expenses ballooned from $87.5 million in 1971 to $698.9 million in 1991, and their aggregate deficit rose from $2.8 million to $23.2 million during the period.
Although orchestras throughout the country, including ones in Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio, are suffering, the Northeast has had more than its share of problems.
"Orchestras' income, by and large, comes from local sources," said Catherine French, the president of the American Symphony Orchestra League, "so when you have high unemployment, bank failures and you're losing your corporate base, which is especially true of the Northeast, it's bound to hurt." Hartford has been particularly hard hit and musicians are bitter.
 
37 Percent Cut
 "Management called for a 37 percent cut, which on average would have meant going from about $15,000 a year to $10,000," said Emery Tapley, a French horn player, referring to the year-old offer made to the Hartford Symphony's 21 principal musicians. Because of the impasse, he added, the musicians "have been scratching a living as best they can, some taking odd jobs or teaching, and some leaving Hartford altogether."
Hartford is far from alone.
This spring, the Syracuse Symphony abruptly suspended its season when it ran out of cash to pay its musicians. In New Haven, musicians swallowed a pay cut and a reduction in paid rehearsals to keep the city's 98-year-old symphony playing. The Long Island Philharmonic, which played 13 concerts last year, has pared its budget by about 30 percent in the last two years and is cutting its 1992-93 season to nine concerts. Orchestras in Trenton and Buffalo are also struggling.
"We're looking at every possible area of savings, but orchestras have always been operating on shoestrings," said Ernest Rose, the executive director of the Syracuse Symphony, which is cutting its budget from $5.2 million last year to $3.3 million. "We're trying to put together a season with fundamentally no staff and no resources."
In many ways, the Syracuse orchestra's experience is emblematic of the crisis brewing at orchestras outside major cities.
During the 1980's, like many orchestras, the Syracuse Symphony grew rapidly, bolstered by a boom in corporate giving to the arts and an expansion in government aid. By 1990, one-third of the symphony's budget came from a patchwork of public agencies that included the New York State Council on the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, Onondaga County and the City of Syracuse.
With New York State's budget troubles, however, support from the Arts Council was cut 60 percent, and another state appropriation was delayed, forcing the orchestra to miss its March payroll and shut down. The union for the 67 full-time and 14 part-time musicians, the American Federation of Musicians, filed a $1.2 million grievance for wages due since March 3, but capitulated in July, accepting a 20 percent pay cut.
"If they had pressed us," Mr. Rose said, "we would have gone bankrupt."
A shutdown was averted at the New Haven Symphony last fall when musicians accepted a cut in their number of guaranteed paid performances, from 104 to 58, and their pay per performance was reduced from $65 to $62. The cuts were prompted by a 30 percent reduction in aid from the Connecticut Commission on the Arts and the fact that several corporations and banks that had provided $80,000 a year as symphony sponsors cut their support in half, becoming "joint sponsors," said Catherine Weiskel, the symphony's general manager.
Even an established regional orchestra like the New Jersey Symphony, which plays about 120 concerts at six locations throughout the state, has seen a string of six-figure deficits, as its government aid has gone from $2.2 million in 1989 to $1.3 million this year, said Helen Paxton, the symphony's director of marketing.
While cutting pay and concerts have been the most obvious results of the financial straits, there have been others.
"Practically anything Impressionistic, like Debussy and Ravel, that needs a really big orchestra is not within our budget at the moment," said John Peter Holly, the executive director of the Greater Trenton Symphony Orchestra.
"We're careful now in how we program works," added Barry Shapiro, acting chairman of the Long Island Philharmonic, whose budget has been cut from $1.7 million in 1990 to $1.2 million this fall.
The recession has also hurt attendance for many orchestras, but what is especially worrisome is the dearth of concertgoers under age 40.
"Since there's been little music education in the schools, we're finding a generation that has not developed an appreciation for classical music," said Mr. Rose of the Syracuse Symphony.
 
Ticket Prices Up Slightly
 For most of these orchestras, ticket prices have continued to inch up, with relatively little effect on attendance, orchestra managers say.
To increase attendance, the Greater Trenton Symphony is concentrating on "warhorse programs" with broad appeal, like Beethoven's Fifth Symphony or the "William Tell Overture," Mr. Holly said. "Tickets sell on the basis of name recognition. We can't engage name conductors and soloists, who would be too expensive, so we have name works."
"Some musicians have criticized us for going to mainstream popular programming, but we used to play to nearly empty halls and now we're nearly full," he added. "Right now, we don't have the luxury to afford more artistically adventuresome programming."

The orchestra has not played in more than a year. (Steve Miller for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: The Scourging of Africa

 BODY:
Take pity on the untimely sorrows of Africa. At a moment of undreamed-of political gains -- apartheid crumbling, wars ending and tyrannies tottering -- much of Africa is now beset by the worst drought in this century.
The rains never came in January. Crop yields fell by 70 percent in normally bountiful South Africa and Zimbabwe. And as sure as August heat, hunger or death threaten a third of the 100 million people living in affected countries of southern and eastern Africa. 
 The world has just begun to respond. United Nations agencies, having forecast the drought, did better than expected by obtaining $850 million in promised aid from 30 governments. With improvised shuffling, U.S. aid agencies have come up with $220 million in emergency food for the stricken. With energy and a modicum of luck, millions of lives can be salvaged and real catastrophe averted.
But who will mend the barren fields of Africa? Emergency relief, however essential, risks encouraging dependency and corruption; it is no substitute for sustained development programs.
Drought has become chronic in Africa, and there is little that Africans can do to change the weather patterns. But the depredations of nature are made worse by human failures. Africans lack drought-resistant seeds, deep wells and catchment dams. Price controls beggar farmers. Foreign lenders pressure impoverished nations to export surplus food stocks to earn hard currency.
The poignant truth is that the world responds to images of shrunken flesh, but that eyes glaze over when long-term amelioration is proposed. Americans give understandable priority to economic distress at home, and other foreign crises compete with the drought for attention. Such is Africa's untimely luck.
Even so, resignation in the face of such suffering is morally unthinkable. The Administration and Congress need to assure timely arrival and effective distribution of emergency supplies. There is surely a case for urging the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to ease programs that give priority to cash exports. And with an eye to next year, it makes sense to increase rather than trim disaster aid funding in 1993, as the Administration now proposes.
So argue voluntary agencies now marshaling support for Africa. They are well ahead of an indifferent public, but the tide is beginning to turn. Somalia, whose people are victimized by both drought and a mindless clan war, is finally getting attention. And the Security Council has approved Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's move to use U.N. forces to airlift food to the interior.
The world is not helpless, nor are Americans wholly indifferent. All that is missing is leadership.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Redefining National Security

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
We all know that the world has undergone a revolution. Equally evident, U.S. foreign policy has hardly adapted. But no one has added up the new facts, or clearly demonstrated the gap between the new realities and American responses or pointed to eminently doable ways of bridging that gap and restoring American strength and leadership -- until now.
The job was done by a bipartisan commission of government veterans headed by Winston Lord, former U.S. Ambassador to China and State Department planning chief. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (of which I am a trustee) sponsored the enterprise. 
 The commission report is an anthology of hard facts and good sense. It lays out where the U.S. and others must spend more money to avoid disasters. It also shows how to pay the new bills.
Based on the new realities, the commission recommends these spending priorities:
Population. The crowded earth already peopled by about 5.5 billion will groan under about 8.5 billion by 2025. This growth will overwhelm governments, resources and the environment. The cures are economic growth and education. But the Reagan and Bush Administrations have not helped. They stopped contributions to family planning efforts abroad because of false fears about promoting abortion.
Refugees. The international homeless total reached 18 million in 1991, and grows faster each year. The main causes are war and poverty. Costs are staggering: $7 billion yearly just for those seeking political asylum.
Peacekeeping and Peacemaking. The flood of refugees will grow and so will threats to peace unless collective security is strengthened, and quickly. U.N. forces now stand guard in a dozen places at an annual cost approaching $3 billion. That figure will have to be at least doubled and a standing U.N. force established to prevent what could become rampant anarchy.
Economic Development. Aid to and trade with poor nations are matters of self-interest to rich ones. U.S. trade with developing nations has been increasing faster than with any other group of nations and already is 35 percent of all U.S. exports. Trade as a percentage of U.S. gross national product has doubled to 25 percent since 1970. Making the poor richer is the best way to prevent refugees and create new exports and wealth for Americans.
The Environment. The tab for making good environmental practices affordable for poor countries (and for wealthy ones as well) will be in the billions yearly. But the costs of doing little to control greenhouse warming gases and deforestation would be unimaginably higher. And dealing with environmental problems will create jobs and growth.
Also with attention to hard facts, here is how the commission proposes to raise the necessary money -- and plenty more to cover domestic priorities and budget-deficit reduction:
Promoting Economic Growth Through Freer Trade. This is the surest and cheapest means to pump up economies. For the U.S., every additional $1 billion in exports produces 20,000 jobs. The leaders of the industrial world have become so mesmerized by economic gimmicks and so mired in domestic politics that they have failed for years to press ahead on the freer-trade front.
Cutting Military Expenditures. Worldwide spending for arms and armed forces reached $1.2 trillion in 1988, and if promises are kept, will decline to about $800 billion by 1996. The commission wants to bring this down by an additional $200 billion, which seems reasonable given the decline of transnational threats. For the U.S. alone, this could generate savings of $90 billion annually after five years.
Raising Energy Taxes. U.S. energy efficiency is about half that of Western Europe and Japan. Inefficiency here adds to the trade deficit and undermines competitiveness and security. Higher prices are central to efficiency, and U.S. gas taxes are one-eighth Western Europe's and one-fourth Japan's. The commission calls for increases of up to $1 per gallon, over time and with help for the needy.
This package of proposals profoundly redefines U.S. national security -- away from military concerns and toward a new agenda. And yet it is manageable and affordable. It does not call for a political or governmental revolution, only for leadership.

HEADLINE: What Other Countries Think of the U.S. Elections: Latin America;
With Perot Out of the Race, Fascination Slips Away

BYLINE: By Tim Golden

 BODY:
For decades, as surely as immigrants and drugs flowed northward from Latin America to the United States, concerns about the possibility of political upheaval moved in the other direction. But that has changed this year.
As Ross Perot shot up in the polls, Latin American technocrats shuddered, and a million satellite dishes swiveled to CNN. But beleaguered Latin populists wondered if they hadn't found a soulmate, and compared him to Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, South America's out-of-nowhere man. When Mr. Perot criticized the idea of free trade with Mexico, the Mexican stock exchange fell almost instantly; when he dropped out, the market leapt a joyous 5 percent. 
 In Argentina, where President Carlos Saul Menem has jettisoned formal non-alignment and third world leadership to get as close as he can to President Bush, Government officials fret that they could lose the November election, too. Chileans, Costa Ricans and Colombians -- their own hopes of closer trade and economic ties perhaps in the balance -- have watched the American campaign like a strange, distant play full of vague clues to their economic fate.
But monopolar as the world may have grown, some Latin leaders haven't had much time to watch. When heads of state gathered in Madrid 10 days ago to discuss Iberian-American issues, Cesar Gaviria of Colombia stayed home to deal with an escaped drug lord. The Venezuelan Senate denied its embattled President, Carlos Andres Perez, permission to travel, and Mr. Fujimori was busy with a wave of guerrilla attacks.

HEADLINE: 'Free Trade' Means No Jobs and High Prices

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Breakthrough on Mexican Trade" (editorial, July 17) wrongly congratulates President Bush on the impending "free trade pact" with Mexico, and criticizes "the protectionist demagogy of organized labor and Congressional opponents." You pooh-pooh their "frightening stories" about the export of jobs to Mexico. The facts make truly frightening stories. My sources are official documents from the Mexican Investment Board and such United States publications as Business Week for last March 16 -- hardly the voice of labor! 
 The Mexican board reported that United States companies have opened more than 2,000 assembly and manufacturing facilities that provide nearly half a million jobs. In 1990 these plants, called "macquiladoras," generated $3.6 billion in value-added foreign exchange earnings. They pay $1 an hour to Mexican workers in government-controlled unions (Business Week). You say, "Their economy is too small to pose a serious threat." How about China, where even cheaper prison labor is used? The Mexican report adds: "Large multinational companies are also helping their original suppliers to relocate near their macquiladora plants."
Business Week reported that "Last year, Mexico topped one million vehicles" and adds that "the auto makers are loath to discuss their Mexican strategies." It quotes a Big Three executive as saying "We'd put up a lot more plants in Mexico, if it weren't for the U.A.W." And you speak of "labor demagogy"? It quotes the head of Ford Motor de Mexico as saying that if the North American free trade agreement that you praise is adopted, "we could be making three million units a year here, or more."
I hope you are right that "the jury is still out" on Gov. Bill Clinton, and that he takes these and other readily available facts into account when he acts to bring back American jobs. If he wants to prove himself an agent of change, he will distance himself from Mr. Bush and Detroit on this issue, and come out forcefully against the so-called "free trade" pact, which is helping destroy our industrial base by exporting jobs in every industry.
The "free trade" slogan is a fraud: intended to help balance imports and exports, it is the primary cause of the United States trade deficit and of 10 million unemployed, since its main beneficiaries are the profit-hungry multinational corporations, recklessly cutting costs -- but not prices. The public loses both ways: no jobs and high prices.

HEADLINE: 'Free Trade' Means No Jobs and High Prices;
Let's Be Serious

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The imminent completion of a free trade agreement with Mexico should provide the stimulus for a serious discussion of the direction for economic growth in our country. To term questions about that agreement "protectionist demagogy" in your July 17 editorial demeans all of us who are involved, including Congress. 
 The assumption that free trade and its presumed economic efficiencies will lead to better societies in two countries that are at vastly different stages of development and with fundamental differences in their institutions is naive at best.
A July 21 front-page article, the first in your series "A New North America," looks at the impact of such trade agreements on the glass industry. You note that the only way a West Virginia company could remain competitive with Mexican companies was to lower its wages 25 percent and eliminate worker's health insurance and vacation pay! This is the start of a deflationary economic cycle, of lower prices, yes, but also an impoverished work force unable to buy, even at lower prices.
Our Government is creating an enormous incentive to substitute investment in low-level wages and lax environmental demands south of the border for investments in productivity and greater efficiency in the United States. Our competitiveness in the world will be greatly diminished.
Without specific job protections, labor rights and environmental, health and safety guarantees as an integral part of this agreement the result will be a race to the lowest common denominator of wages and social conditions, not the highest.
The labor movement is not opposed to trade with Mexico. What we seek is a framework for managing this economic integration in a humane, responsible way.

Major New Market

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Breakthrough on Mexican Trade" (editorial, July 17) is a very timely reminder of the powerful impact a successful North American free trade agreement could have on the United States economy. Reducing trade barriers with Mexico, as the United States has done with Canada, offers exceptional opportunities to increase United States exports to Mexico, the fastest-growing economy on the continent. I must take strong exception, however, to your characterization of the United States auto industry as one that will lose jobs if the United States enters into a free trade agreement with Mexico. 
 Because of restrictions imposed by Mexico, exports of United States-built cars and trucks to that country have been strictly limited.
If these restrictions are lifted in a free trade agreement with Mexico, producers in this country will for the first time be able to sell a full range of automobiles and trucks produced in the United States to complement the more limited number of models the companies produce there for the local market. This means new orders for United States plants, increased and more secure jobs for our workers and the opening of a major new market for United States automotive products.

HEADLINE: Yes, America Needs an Oil Industry

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Shrinking of the American Oil Industry" (July 19) describes how American oil companies are shifting more of their investments in operations overseas and asks the question: "Does the United States really need much of a domestic oil industry anyway?" The question is not answered directly, but the impression is given that the United States does not because oil can be found more cheaply abroad. Thus the movement of oil industry investment, technology and jobs from the United States to overseas is presented merely as a matter of free trade. 
 This argument is fundamentally wrong. The test is not whether oil can be found or produced more cheaply abroad, but whether we can develop new oil reserves in the United States at less cost than the price at which foreign nations are willing to sell their oil to us. Where that test is met, investment occurs domestically, and Americans are made better off.
Then why are American oil companies spending more and more of their exploration and production funds abroad? Because they have no choice but to seek opportunities in foreign lands. The best prospects at home for finding billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas have been put off limits for shortsighted political reasons. Congress has virtually closed the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and the eastern Gulf of Mexico to new offshore development, and even has refused to debate opening the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. The most attractive geologic targets at home are being blocked off because of domestic political decisions to lock up American resources.
American companies in testimony before Congress repeatedly have asserted their eagerness to bid for Federal oil and natural gas leases in parts of the United States now off limits. They believe they could produce those resources at competitive prices. A policy shift in the United States toward utilizing our own economic petroleum resources could slow American job losses, production declines and government revenue losses.

Living on the Edge

BYLINE: By Mary B. W. Tabor

 BODY:
RELIABLE statistics on the extent of the school dropout problem are as scarce as they are suspect. Until this year, the 50 states have reported their dropout rates to Washington in almost as many different ways. Few school systems keep track of students who drop out after eighth grade, just before high school, when educators suspect many students are lost. And evaluations of dropout prevention programs -- a backdoor method for gauging the extent of the problem -- have been practically nonexistent.
But even without numbers, an ever-mounting pile of reports, estimates and anecdotes tell us this much: The problem is bad. 
 More children entered American schools in the past decade than ever before. But the number who never make it to their high school graduation -- almost 1 in 3 according to some estimates -- is alarmingly high. And the category of who is "at risk" of dropping out comprises an increasingly diverse population, including a large number of minority students, especially blacks and Hispanics; students from low-income households; pregnant teen-agers; students who abuse alcohol or drugs, and alienated middle-class youngsters who "drop out" intellectually under pressure to succeed.
The situation, educators and policy makers say, has grown to crisis proportions, becoming an issue of national economic concern. "If we are going to continue being competitive in global markets, we have to address these education issues," said Alicia Coro, director of school improvement programs for the Federal Department of Education. "There are certainly issues of national security as well. The people who graduate now will be our work force for the next 30 or 40 years."
So pressing is the problem that President Bush has set a graduation rate he wants American schools to achieve and a target date to achieve it. By the year 2000, he announced earlier this year, American schools should have a 90 percent graduation rate -- a goal the nation's governors have also endorsed.
Partly in response to such prodding, educators have stepped up their efforts to figure out which dropout prevention programs work, which don't, with which groups of students, and why. They say that the most successful programs do the following:
* Provide early intervention, such as intensive language training, for young students.
* Adapt to fit individual students' needs.
* Involve adults, from families or from local, community-based organizations.
* Make students feel like part of a community.
* Are comprehensive, incorporating home visits as well as classroom work.
* Link school lessons to the working world.
* Set out clear educational goals that are appealing and reasonable, holding students accountable for their performance and also using a short-term penalty and reward system.
* Conduct regular evaluations and send the results to a central office and to the schools.
"Improving the dropout rate does not involve a great and mysterious strategy, but two fundamental principles -- early intervention and providing a climate in which young people feel they genuinely belong," said Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, in Princeton, N.J.
Fully understanding the dropout problem, however, begins with defining who a dropout is; one who enters ninth grade and leaves before graduation? What about the student who drops out for a few months, even a year, and then returns to a different school?
In the United States, with its 83,000 public schools spread across 16,000 school districts, there has been no consensus on the subject -- until now. Last fall, the Federal Government and the 50 states agreed on a definition of a dropout and agreed to use it in future counts. Officially, dropouts are those students who were in grades 7 to 12 the previous year who are not enrolled in school now and who did not graduate. Exceptions are made for students out of school because of illness or temporary suspension.
 
How States Will Count Their Dropouts
 States will also be asked to measure the proportion of their populations that are not high school graduates and are not enrolled in school at a specified time, as well as what happens to a single group of students over a given period. Federal education officials, meanwhile, are demanding that evaluation plans be built into grant applications for federally financed dropout prevention programs, the better to determine which students are in the programs and how they fare.
As of November 1993, when the new national statistics will be available, the numbers may still be inexact but they will be uniform.
Currently, what few numbers there are, combined with anecdotal evidence, suggest that students who drop out are not always the ones one would expect. The usually dismal dropout rates for black students, for example, have improved over the last two decades. But the problem with Hispanic students, who often come from low-income households with poor English-language skills, is proving less tractable: they leave school at twice the rate of their non-Hispanic classmates.
Characteristics known to push children off the edge and out of school, such as pregnancy, drug or alcohol use, low family income or failing grades, do not account for all dropouts. Other pathologies, such as low self-esteem and a sense of alienation, or the school environment, are recognized as manifestations of basic problems that, in combination, threaten all youngsters. For example, a student with a history of poor grades -- the result of trouble at home, perhaps -- develops low self-esteem. He or she joins a gang, tangles with the law, leaves school and never makes it back.
Makisha Bailey's web of difficulties centered on family problems. Ms. Bailey, 17 years old, lives in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood. An average student who says she loves school, she has dropped out twice because she was pregnant. Her mother, a recovering alcoholic, now watches her children during the day. But Makisha, who lives with friends, is not back in school.
Chris Miller's problems sprang more from his high school environment. A member of a prototypical, solid-middle-class family of four in Greenville, S.C., Chris, now 20, said disruptions were so frequent in class that "I got to the point I didn't care." Refused permission to transfer, he dropped out while retaking courses after he failed 11th grade. He works locally as a hotel waiter.
So many targets require a veritable armory of weapons. "I'm not saying we know how to solve the problem," said Russell W. Rumberger, an associate professor of education at the University of California at Santa Barbara. "But we now have a better idea of how complex that problem is and the need to have more varied strategies to address it."
Those strategies are either long-term, such as early intervention, or short-term, such as remedial classes; one-shot efforts targeting a group with a specific program, like pregnancy programs, or full-scale attacks that usually involve overhauling a school system.
Encouraged by the success of initiatives like Head Start for preschoolers, most education experts agree that early childhood education is the best long-term preventive strategy. An estimated 35 percent of all children start school ill prepared for education, especially in the area of language development. Many elementary schools are creating multi-year programs that will help toddlers acquire and develop language skills.
 
Focusing on Short-Term Remedies
 For children already in school and lacking learning skills, teachers are focusing on short-term remedies: trying to keep classes small, for example, to give needy students more attention; providing students with mentors, flexible class schedules and prenatal child care, as well as job placement programs.
Desperate for answers, some schools have gone for gimmicks, like pizza parties and health classes to keep students in school. Others have joined with their states, such as West Virginia, in driver's license revocation programs -- no high school diploma, no driver's license -- to keep students in school. And for certain youngsters in certain settings, these programs seem to work.
But in large urban or desolate rural areas, where dropout rates are higher, they often don't. As a result, educators have begun to look toward more holistic programs, ones that focus on changing the structure inside the school and developing social connections outside it.
The most popular of these are schools-within-schools, settings in which students belong to communities, sometimes organized as "houses" or "concentrations." In a "science and technology house," for example, students would have regular contact with a defined group of classmates who share an interest in science. In these programs their teachers know who they are, what classes they are in and when they have missed school.
Another restructuring plan involves school "clusters" -- high schools with specific feeder elementary and middle schools -- that give students academic and social continuity throughout their school careers.
These and other models for reform are being pushed by the Federal Government, which is allocating more money for dropout prevention projects. Under the nation's School Dropout Demonstration Assistance Program, authorized by Congress in 1988, 65 four-year grants were awarded last year, financed with about $34 million. For fiscal year 1992, the pot is $40 million and the department anticipates adding about 20 new projects.
In New York City, a dropout prevention plan called Project Achieve was recently instituted in 32 public high schools. Participants, such as Prospect Heights High School in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, turn to local, community-based organizations for help with tutoring, mentoring and home visits to students having academic or social problems. In Philadelphia, the Partnership Academies program relies on businesses for volunteer mentors and job training. That program is being replicated throughout California.
 
U.S. Seeking Programs for Hispanics
 The Federal Department of Education is also asking for programs geared to the needs of Hispanic students, the group evidencing the highest dropout rates nationwide. One such program, the Valued Youth Partnership, began in Texas in 1984 and has since expanded to five school systems in predominantly Hispanic areas of Texas, California, Florida and New York. The program targets at-risk middle school students, whom it trains to tutor elementary school students and who in turn improve their own reading, writing and language skills. The object is to boost the potential dropouts' sense of achievement and involvement in school.
Educators have also begun trying to pool resources through national dropout networks. Clemson University's National Dropout Prevention Center, for example, tries to keep track of prevention programs and help school districts find ones that suit their needs.
Few programs, however, deal with students who have already dropped out. Traditional schools, organized along age and grade levels, do not readily accommodate a student who has been out of school for a year or so. And even the best programs, according to teachers and dropout counselors, are believed to bring only about 30 to 40 percent of dropouts back to school. How many of the ones who re-enter actually graduate, no one knows for sure.
But hundreds, possibly many thousands of dropouts, educators say, want to try. A young mother, for example, recently pushed her baby stroller onto a subway train in Brooklyn, sat down and sighed. She had become pregnant at 15, she said, and had enrolled in a special program for pregnant and unwed mothers in Manhattan. Once her baby was born, however, she began having problems at home and was forced to give up her place in the program. Now, she said, she is on welfare and looking for a job to pay for an apartment.
"I want to go back to school," she said. "But I don't know when. It all happens so fast."

It Didn't Only Seem Worse

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Call it the incredible shrinking economy. For months, Government statisticians said that the recession that began in the second half of 1990 had lasted two quarters and that output had fallen 1.6 percent during that period.
 But, presto, on Thursday a Government report announced that the recession had actually lasted three quarters, not two. 
Not only that, the report said, but output had declined 2.2 percent during the period.
 The report, which revised statistics based on more complete data, said the recession had begun in the third quarter of 1990 and run through the first quarter of 1991. And the report said the economy did not grow by two-tenths of 1 percent in the third quarter, as originally estimated, but instead shrank by 1.6 percent on an annualized basis during that quarter.
 Also on Thursday, the government announced more unhappy tidings: Growth in this year's second quarter was a puny 1.4 percent, half the rate in the first quarter.
 All this was not good news for the White House in a campaign year. Gov. Bill Clinton jumped on the unencouraging statistics, saying growth under President Bush was "even more anemic" than at first thought.
 The Bush Administration has long argued that the recession was not really so deep and that one reason growth was so slow in 1991 is that economies do not bounce out of mild recessions the way they do from deep ones. The Administration will no longer be able to use that argument. Trying to put a favorable spin on the news, Administration officials noted that the economy has grown, although weakly, for five consecutive quarters. They predicted that low interest rates and an export boom would push growth to a respectable 3 percent in the second half.

HEADLINE: Bridging the Cultural Gap in Chappaqua

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

DATELINE: CHAPPAQUA

 BODY:
"IT'S not like I miss the bullets," said Tarolyn Molina, a 15-year-old from the Bronx who is a first-year student in the Chappaqua Summer Scholarship Program. "But I mean, I got used to it. At home, my mother would say, 'Didn't you hear the shots last night?' and I'd say, 'No, I slept through it.' But now, where I'm staying, it's like there are 800 little birds chirping outside my window. And I'm like -- Hey, what's that noise?" she said.
Tarolyn is one of 16 visiting students experiencing the relative peace as well as the entirely new culture of the suburbs while she takes courses at Horace Greeley High School. 
 The Chappaqua Summer Scholarship Program is primarily an academic program that brings students who have already shown scholastic promise at their own high schools in the south Bronx to summer school in Chappaqua.
The program began in 1968 as the brainchild of a group of community leaders here who were then meeting regularly at the Quaker Meetinghouse, trying to come up with different ideas to bridge the gap between the turbulent and less affluent parts of New York City and its quieter, more well-to-do suburbs.
A quarter of a century later, many of the programs the group developed have long since been abandoned, but the scholarship program -- which began as a modest proposal -- has survived and flourished.
Students are recommended for the program by their guidance counselors and then interviewed and chosen by the program's directors. The students, who begin the scholarship program after the eighth grade, attend it for three consecutive summers while living with a series of volunteer host families. The students are in school from 8 A.M. to 1 P.M. on weekdays, taking two academic courses and one elective. The program also offers college counseling to seniors.
 
Exposure to Cultural Life
 But while the scholarship program maintains its academic focus, it also seeks to expose its students to the cultural and social aspects of life in the suburbs. Students are required to sign a contract guaranteeing their participation in activities like swimming and tennis as well as their attendance on field trips to places like I.B.M.'s T. J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights and the Katonah Museum.
The Chappaqua Summer Scholarship Program is financed entirely by private donations. It pays for summer school tuition, books, train fare, minibus fare and doctors' bills for the students during their stay in Chappaqua. While the program is financially solvent, it has had trouble attracting host families. This year had more families volunteered as hosts, the program could have handled more than the 16 students selected, said Linda Peterson, co-chairwoman of the program.
"People have the concept that these kids from the city are very cosmopolitan, but they are wrong," said Larry Breen, vice principal of Horace Greeley and one of the founders of the program. "Many of these children have never even been to Manhattan or seen the Statue of Liberty. When we conceived the program, we wanted to take Chappaqua's most unique resource -- our school district -- and share it. But my attitude is also that if communities like Chappaqua exist then these children have a right to know it and a right to know that these people live like they do," he said.
One of the primary new exposures each student gets is living with three different Chappaqua families for two weeks each during the summer. And while many of the students reported that they had little difficulty adjusting to the academic demands of the scholarship program, they all reported culture shock at life in the country.
 
Adjusting to a Slow Pace
 At a recent lunch break in Horace Greeley's cafeteria, students traded notes on their reactions to life in Chappaqua. One of the first things they had to get used to was the slow pace -- students here meander down uncrowded halls with a full 10 minutes between classes. Another adjustment was to unfamiliar sounds -- both the sense of quiet and the sudden, unexpected clamor of suburban wildlife.
Tarolyn's experience of sleeping through gunfire reflects the violent crime in her Bronx neighborhood, which is a constant reality for virtually all the students in the program. Tarolyn noted with some surprise that the day before she had gone out Rollerblading and nothing had happened -- no one came after her and no one had stolen her skates. Some of the students have given Chappaqua the nickname Peaceland. Ebony Jenkins, 16, expressed amazement that people in Chappaqua did not lock their cars or houses.
"These people leave their front door open," she said. "If you do that in the Bronx you see a hole where your house used to be. If you do that with your car, your car is gone," she said.
Several years ago, participants in the program were surprised at the outpouring of community grief when a Horace Greeley student was killed in a car accident overseas.
"They were amazed at how the whole community mourned over this one boy because every week these kids have people they know killed," Mrs. Peterson said. "There's not a kid in this program who hadn't been a victim of violence of some sort -- gunshots coming through their apartment window, or friends being killed or being mugged or stabbed."
 
Two Different Personalities
 Students in the program return to their own homes in the Bronx for the weekend during the school session and the transition is not an easy one on several levels.
One girl referred to her "Bronx personality" and her "Chappaqua personality." Sometimes it is simply a matter of adjusting their slang. Steve Negron, 16, who is in his third year in the program heard Chappaqua teen-agers refer to a girl as a heifer. He had no idea what they were talking about. (They meant she looked like a cow.) Later, he tried out the expression in the Bronx and was met with blank stares.
But the real transition involves the readjustment to the dangers of life in the south Bronx.
"You have to be alert," said Kwame Gyasi, 15, who has been mugged twice. "You remember, well, now we're in the Bronx, we have to act like we're in the Bronx. Sometimes you get caught in between. Up here you can relax. Over there you have to watch out all the time," he said.
 
Strong Family Ties
 At the same time, they miss their own families. Janice Cleland, a member of the scholarship program's board, said that almost all the kids in the program have strong family ties. "The reason that these kids are making it so far is that they have somebody who is backing them and encouraging them. It may be a mom or dad, an aunt or an uncle, but these parents are very strict and these kids have someone who is protecting them," she said.
Critics argue that the program can be a cruel tease. Students are exposed to the wealth of northern Westchester and one of the state's top public schools for six weeks and then sent home to a dangerous and deprived reality. Proponents counter that those who participate are motivated students, most of whom will be going on to college, and that their early exposure to a middle-class life and good schooling can ease their transition by removing some barriers of the unknown.
"This is an urban-suburban program as well as an academic program," Mr. Breen said. "It was not meant to be a black-white program, and it's certainly not a fresh-air program. But it is based on the understanding that college is still very much a white and middle-class world," he said.
Kenny Padilla, who completed the program in 1986, said it not only gave him his first sense of independence but also helped give him the courage to apply to Brown University, from which he recently graduated with bachelor's degrees in economics and in public policy and American institutions. Mr. Padilla, who will attend Rutgers Law School this fall, said the scholarship program introduced him to a world outside his own.
"It really opened my eyes to what was beyond the Bronx," he said. "Just the fact that I was able to go away to Chappaqua was like a first step for me. If I had gone to Brown without going to C.S.S.P. the culture shock would have been a lot worse. It was a lot smoother than if I went through 18 years in the Bronx, which for me was predominantly Puerto Rican, and then went off to Brown," he said.
 
'One More Thing in Your Favor'
 And while tennis and swimming lessons may seem elitist or petty to program critics, the students argue that such exposure will serve them later.
"Before I came up here I didn't know how to swim, play tennis, bowl or keyboard on a computer," Steve Negron said. "Maybe someday I'll be in a business situation and they will want to close the deal with a tennis game. If you don't know how to play, maybe it's no big deal. But if you do, it's one more thing in your favor," he said.
According to the directors of the scholarship program, two students -- neither of whom had ever picked up a tennis racket before coming to Chappaqua -- went to college on tennis scholarships.
Those critical of the program also argue that it is a sort of noblesse oblige project, allowing Chappaqua residents to feel good while ultimately making the students resentful of their parents and their own financial situations. This year's students reacted to that theory with surprise and some amusement.
"That is so ignorant," Tarolyn said. "Why would I resent my mom? My mom works really hard. In my own family, we're all at different levels. A lot of us don't consider money the top value. I'm happy with what I have and my family," she said.
"It's all in the way you see it," Ebony said. "I don't think they bring us up here to make us feel bad. They bring us up here to show us something new. Sure, I see the great big houses in Chappaqua, and I think maybe someday I'd like to live like this. But it's not like we feel bad leaving here and going home. The Bronx is our home. Truthfully, I feel better coming home than leaving home," she said.
 
Cultural Exposure Works Both Ways
 Most of the students said that if they were not in the program they would probably spend the summer watching television or doing nothing. Tarolyn said that she would not be permitted to go downstairs (or out of her apartment building) because her mother was working all day and there was no one to watch her.
Almost all of the Chappaqua families that participate are quick to point out that the advantages of cultural exposure work both ways. Susan and Robert Wolff have been hosts for six years and feel that the program benefits their own three young children as much if not more than the teen-agers who stay at their home.
"Everything that these kids have are things we want to instill in our own children," Mrs. Wolff said. "They have an interest in education, in taking risks, in new experiences, along with a strong sense of family and commitment. These kids are good influences. They have the kind of values I want to instill in my own children."

No More Blank Checks for Regulators

BYLINE: By ROBERT W. HAHN; Robert W. Hahn is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and an adjunct research fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School.

 BODY:
EARLY this year, President Bush saw a Federal regulatory system spiraling out of control and instituted a 90-day moratorium on new Federal regulations, which was later extended for four months. The moratorium, which will expire on Aug. 27, should be renewed.
The moratorium calls for a review of existing regulations and requires that any new regulations be evaluated for benefits and costs. It encourages the use of market-based mechanisms to achieve regulatory objectives. 
 Oddly enough, the President's actions have been received skeptically by the media, which have confused regulatory reform with deregulation.
Most Americans would be surprised to know that regulatory agencies often fashion regulations without regard to their cost. In many instances, Congress actually forbids cost consideration by regulators. The result is a regulatory burden on the economy now estimated at $400 billion a year.
New regulations tend to cost more while delivering less. For example, I estimate that the costs of the 1990 Clean Air Act exceed the benefits by about $16 billion annually. Such regulation is a hidden tax that reduces our competitiveness.
Most Americans would probably not be surprised to learn that regulators are using their rule-making power to micromanage the behavior of businesses and individuals while expanding their own power base. The number of Federal bureaucrats in charge of implementing regulations has nearly doubled since 1970, from 70,000 to 125,000.
Renewing the President's moratorium will slow our accelerated rate of regulatory growth. In the area of the environment, the directives mean that we may no longer have to confront the either-or dilemma presented by inefficient command-and-control regulation, which specify exactly how problems must be solved. Instead we could discover a very attractive "win-win" solution: a cleaner environment and a competitive economic system, without undue government intrusion.
Sensible regulation should balance concern for the environment, health and safety with concern for an economy that can provide jobs, a high standard of living and the resources to attack pressing domestic problems like crime, drug abuse and inner-city blight. These issues are more important to the health and welfare of the people than squeezing the last virtually undetectable part per billion of an offending substance from the air.
Renewing the President's reform program represents an important first step in moving the regulatory train back on track. But Congress needs to become an active partner, not an adversary, if the bureaucracy is to be tamed. Congress should require that regulatory costs and benefits be tallied up alongside budgetary expenditures -- not such an unreasonable request when the current costs average more than $3,000 per household and the benefits are often minuscule.
Congress could take a giant step forward by requiring a serious benefit-cost test for major regulations, making regulations that lowered our standard of living the exception rather than the rule. A 1982 bill containing this provision unanimously passed the Senate but stalled in the House. Just last month, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, introduced a bill that requires benefit-cost analysis and limits the regulatory burden that government imposes on the public. It is a step forward and it should be passed.
The American public is demanding empowerment this election year. Constructive regulatory reform requires greater awareness of how regulation adversely affects the average American. If the public understood that Congress, business lobbyists, so-called "public" interest groups and bureaucracy were the driving forces behind needless regulation, then Congress would be more receptive to regulatory reform efforts. The President's responsibility is to sensitize the public to these issues. The people's responsibility is to direct Congress to clean up the regulatory mess.

Norwich Planning to Market Its Old Mills

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
AFTER a year-long study, Norwich will soon start to market more than 2 million square feet of space in 12 largely vacant mill complexes around the city.
The city has $10,000 from the Connecticut Historic Commission, and is itself putting up $10,000 to promote reuse of the mills. City Planning Director Kathy B. Warzecha said she expects to seek bids soon for a marketing campaign beginning next spring. 
 "Other towns have done something similar, but usually with one or two mills," said Ms. Warzecha. "This is much more comprehensive."
The project followed a reuse study by Renee Kahn, executive director of the Historic Neighborhood Preservation Program, based in Stamford. She recommended turning Norwich into a "living museum" of the Industrial Revolution, much as nearby Mystic is a museum of maritime history.
"One of the nice things about Norwich having fallen on rough times is that it's left the city like a time capsule," Mrs. Kahn said. "It has a downtown, and it has mills, that look like someone walked away from them 50 years ago."
Elena L. Kalman, a Stamford architect who worked on the study, concedes that there are hurdles to overcome in such a project. But in the end, she said, developers will have buildings more unusual than anything they could afford to build.
The ornate brick and stonework, decorative wrought iron rails and fences, hand-hewn beams, and other aspects make the buildings attractive to a variety of users, said Ms. Kalman. "Those mills, even the most unimportant of them, have some very interesting spaces," Ms. Kalman said. "They're not simple and meaningless."
The mills have already begun to sell themselves. Brian H. Burchman, owner of Central Sports, is moving his sports-vehicle dealership from a new strip mall building on West Main Street to 15,000 square feet in the 717,480-square-foot turn-of-the-century Ponemah Mills.
Mr. Burchman said that the site, with quick access to Interstate 395, rail lines behind the building on the Shetucket River, is both convenient and attractive.
"The facility is just perfect for any type of business," he said. "If Norwich has a boom, that's going to be the area that booms."
United States Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Bozrah, has proposed a Federal heritage corridor in eastern Connecticut. He said the restoration of the mills could be thes cornerstone of the project, which would preserve through purchase or preservation convenant natural resources, historic sites and other regional attractions.
Most of the mills sprang up on the banks of the Thames, Yantic and Shetucket Rivers. Neighborhoods grew up around them, eventually linking most of the city.
The buildings date mostly from the last half of the 19th century, when Norwich was changing from a shipping port to a mill city. Mrs. Kahn said Norwich must change again.
"Norwich has to re-invent itself, just as it did in the late 1800's," said Mrs. Kahn. "It has to find a new focus."
The complexes range in size from the two-building, 18,570- square-foot Yantic Falls Mills on Yantic Street, to the largest complex in Norwich, the 10-building Ponemah Mills on Route 97.
"Ponemah is the most architecturally interesting," said Mrs. Kahn. "It's like a medieval castle or a Loire chateau, in that it towers over everything around it, and represents the power of the nobility."
Her report recommends a hotel-conference center as the anchor for Ponemah, with restaurants, health club, light manufacturing, retail and offices in other spaces.
She proposed similar mixed-uses for the larger complexes, and limited use for smaller ones, such as housing for the elderly in the 43,740-square-foot Turner Stanton Mill on Clinton Avenue.
Planners say the city has a ready labor force, given that military cuts have affected so many southeastern Connecticut industries. It has easy access to deep water, rail, and Interstate 395.
BUT there are problems. Ms. Kalman said there is little parking for most of the buildings, and some physical limitations: in one building, some of the ceilings are 6 feet, 4 inches high. Many have been vacant and deteriorating for decades and coordinating the multiple ownerships could prove difficult.
Ms. Kalman said there could also be lead paint, asbestos insulation, PCB's, or other hazards in some of the old mills.
The city's report has an entire section on the financial incentives of restoration. For example, most of the buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places and qualify for Federal tax credits.
"No one incentive is going to encourage anyone," Mrs. Kahn said. "But if you put together three or four or five, the bottom line comes out better than new construction."
Some of the mills are already being put back to use, with rents in the $2 to $4 per square foot range. Dale Plummer started his Quinnehticut Woolen Company in the Ponemah complex two years ago. He has eight employees using old-fashioned equipment to turn out specialty woolen yarns.
He said he supports the mill proposals in general, adding that details will have to be worked out by city planners, and people who live around the mills.
"It's kind of up to the community to say, 'This is how we want it,' " Mr. Plummer said. "I want it to go forward. Ponemah is one of the country's premier mill buildings."
Stuart B. Greenfield, a local attorney and co-owner of 230,000 square feet in Ponemah, said he has signed a contract with one retailer for 20,000 square feet, and is negotiating with another for 50,000 square feet.
"There is a lot of interest in bringing the mills back to life, and creating a renaissance in Norwich," Mr. Greenfield said. "The key is going to be flexibility."
Mr. Greenfield said so far the city planning office has expedited his permits and referred potential tenants, and state agencies have been accommodating to his plans.
"Previously, the city and state have been more of a hindrance," Mr. Greenfield said. "It's a real pleasure to see everyone finally working together to create jobs and improve the quality of life in these neighborhoods."
Ms. Warzecha said there is broad-based support for the reuse of the mills, including from the people of the mill neighborhoods.
"The reuse of these mills could make their property values go up, and their taxes go down," she said. "We'll have viable businesses instead of vacant, deteriorated buildings."

HEADLINE: Luncheon Clubs: A Tradition Fades

BYLINE: By TINA TRASTER-POLAK

 BODY:
GONE are the days when men gathered in smoke-filled libraries to scan the newspapers a half-hour before lunch. Gone are the days when power brokers washed down three-course midday meals with too many martinis. And gone are Newark's private luncheon clubs.
In late March, the last remaining and oldest of the luncheon clubs -- the 116-year-old Essex Club at 52 Park Place -- closed its doors. The nearby 744 Club on Broad Street closed last year, and the Downtown Club folded a few years earlier. 
 "Any time there is a downturn in the economy, clubs go under," said Richard G. Schoon, president of the Metro Newark Chamber of Commerce. "After the 1987 Wall Street crash, a number of clubs closed their doors, and many are struggling to survive."
Today, clubs like the Essex Club, with its deep red carpets, oak-paneled rooms and portraits of board members dating to the late 19th century, stand empty. But the demise of traditional men's clubs (some of which later admitted women) may give birth to a new genre.
In October, a new luncheon club will open on the 22d floor at One Newark Center in the Gateway office complex. Many Essex Club members say the new club, with its marble and chrome, will lack the warmth and charm of their old haunt. But it will be Newark's only private dining room.
 
Many Reasons for Decline
 Older clubs are dying for many reasons. Executives who once languished over long meals are more apt to grab sandwiches at their desks. Also, financial belt-tightening has scrapped many corporate perks like club memberships.
In recent years, the Essex Club relied on nearly $35,000 a year in rent for hospitality suites leased to local corporations like Mutual Benefit Life Insurance, Midlantic National Bank, First Fidelity Bank and the Public Service Electric and Gas Company. Only Public Service had been planning to renew its lease for 1993.
Added to a change of business mores is a healthier approach to eating and drinking. Cholesterol and calorie counters do not in good conscience consume a big sirloin steak for lunch, and alcohol consumption has dramatically dropped. Members of the Essex Club recall a time when the club sold its own brand of alcohol.
"The infamous three-hour martini lunch has gone the way of the dodo bird," said Ted Lippencott, a Newark lawyer and the club's most recent board president.
Clubs began having difficulties in the late 1960's -- for example, the longstanding Newark Athletic Club on Fulton Street closed in 1965. The demise of the Essex Club began in the late 1970's, when many of the major banks, legal firms and accounting companies fled the city for corporate parks in the suburbs. In the 1960's, club membership exceeded 1,000; in 1992, there are just 249 members.
"I, like others, feel extremely guilty that I didn't use it," said Roger Clapp, a Newark lawyer. If more members had used the club, he said, "it would still be alive."
 
'A Touch of Civility'
 Mr. Clapp, who called the club "a touch of civility in downtown Newark," recalled how Thomas Del Virginia, the 66-year-old doorman and general caretaker, greeted him by name after Mr. Clapp had been absent from the club for 20 years.
Other members say the closing of the Essex Club has created a huge void in terms of corporate entertainment. The club, they say, was the place to dine with an important guest. Members say there was not a recent governor who did not lunch there.
"The Essex Club stood for a lot; it stood for New Jersey," said Samuel C. Miller, a former member, who was also director of the Newark Museum. "There was never a decision made in New Jersey that was not first discussed in the Essex Club."
Today, business pacts are more likely negotiated over a phone or through a fax machine. But Mr. Miller says the pendulum swings every 15 years.
"For now, in Newark, the luncheon club is dead," he said. "In 15 to 20 years, the private club will be all the rage again."
 
Situated on Top Floor
 The Bellemead Development Corporation aims to lead the revival of clubs with its $2.5 million Newark Club. Situated on the top floor of One Newark Center, it was designed to feel like the Rainbow Room in Manhattan. The building also houses the Seton Hall Law School and numerous law firms.
Jim Servidea, vice president of marketing at Bellemead, said the Newark Club, which itself will operate at a loss, had been created to attract tenants. "If the market for office space was strong, we probably wouldn't create a club that has to be subsidized," he said. "But the Newark Club adds value. It offers a bigger package."
Bellemead runs the 60-year-old Roseland Eagle Rock Club in a corporate park in Roseland. Henry Sgrosso, executive director of both clubs, said, "If we just counted on lunch, which is about 30 percent of our business, we'd be out of business." The Eagle Rock Club is used for weddings, bar mitzvahs and Christmas parties.
The Newark Club will be a world apart from the older clubs like the Essex Club, which was established in 1876 and was considered the grandfather of social clubs in Newark.
Originally, the club was situated at 44 Park Place, where the Quality Inn/ Treet Hotel now stands. Club members bought the five-story Georgian-style town house facing Military Park in 1927. Built a century earlier, the club's building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
George William McCarter, a former member and Newark lawyer, said the Essex Club was "built like a man's club." The austere rooms with large fireplaces and grand silver-plated chandeliers gave the club an air of gentility.
 
Ballroom and Squash Courts
 The two most frequently used rooms were the first-floor Grill Room, where buffets were served, and the second-floor ballroom, where formal lunches and special events were held. The building also had two squash courts and numerous bedrooms, which were once lived in year round by elder members.
The Essex Club and others of its era were known to be elitist men's clubs. Although the club's rules did not exclude anyone from membership, the club did not admit women until 1975 or blacks until 1978.
Mourning the club's demise, Mr. Miller said, "To let the club die in such a way says something about the city."
What it says is that the city's vitality and power base have shifted from Broad Street, once home to prestigious law firms and large department stores, to the Gateway complex, civic leaders say.
Over the last six years, said Joseph Freiser, project development officer at the Newark Economic Development Corporation, more than $6 billion in office construction has revitalized the Gateway complex. Buildings like Gateway One and Two, A.T.& T., the N. J. Transit headquarters and the Newark Legal and Communications Center are almost fully leased. The $200 million New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts, which will be built on the site of the old Military Hotel, is slated to open in 1995.
Former members of the Essex Club, many of whose companies have moved to the Gateway, admit that the six- or seven-block walk to their club had become something of an effort. They say they have become accustomed to walking through linked steel-and-glass towers to find a salad or a sandwich for lunch.
Mr. Lippencott, whose law concern is in the N. J. Transit building, said that since the Essex Club's demise he has been experimenting with many of the Brazilian restaurants on Ferry Street in the Ironbound section. "I was glad I paid for feijoada before I knew what was in it," he said, referring to the stew that contains pig snout, jowls, black beans and rice. But now that he has learned about these ethnic specialties, he has begun taking clients to Brasilia, a plain restaurant that serves hearty fare. "It creates opportunity for local restaurateurs," he said.
While some of those who once patronized the clubs have ventured onto Newark's streets for lunch, many more stay locked up in the self-enclosed and self-sufficient worlds that office towers create.
Elizabeth Hull, a political science professor at Rutgers University, likens the throngs of workers in the sleek new office buildings to trailers that plug into local resources temporarily and then move on.
"People come and spend whole days within these complexes," she said. "There is little spillover into the community at large. There is no contact with the city. They don't even walk on the streets."
Like Newark, many urban centers contain abandoned areas once considered the grandest and most exclusive. Small town houses or older buildings that once housed the private clubs cannot compete with mammoth office complexes that offer their own restaurants.
Those who have been in Newark since the 1960's have watched the city transform from a riot-torn town to a rejuvenated business center. But they are painfully aware that the revitalization does not include old and revered institutions like the private eating clubs.
"Cities used to measure their values by keeping old establishments alive," said Clement Price, a Rutgers University history professory. "Tradition has been broken."

 ONE hundred years ago, workers at the Carnegie Steel Works in Homestead, Pa., six miles upstream from Pittsburgh on the Monongahela River, engaged in an epic battle with their employer. More than 3,800 workers, skilled and unskilled, native- and foreign-born, resisted the company's effort to reduce their wages. As the workers prepared to strike, management surprised them. Under the leadership of the chairman of the steel works, Henry Clay Frick (Andrew Carnegie, the owner, was conveniently in Scotland), the company locked out its employees, prepared to hire replacement workers and brought in two boatloads of Pinkerton security guards to protect the plant and the new workers.
As the Pinkerton boats approached the Carnegie pier on the morning of July 6, working men and women, some of them armed, gathered; and when the Pinkertons attempted to come ashore, a daylong battle ensued that resulted in numerous deaths on both sides. Outnumbered, the Pinkertons surrendered and were marched through a gantlet formed by the infuriated crowd, where they were pummeled and beaten. It was this image -- of angry, armed steelworkers joined by their irate, embattled women -- that garnered the press's attention and defined Homestead for much of the nation. This image also justified the use of the state militia to end the violence and, not incidentally, labor's resistance as well. The strike, which lasted five months, proved devastating for labor: the wage reductions held, many strikers were blacklisted, and the industry remained largely nonunion until the coming of the C.I.O.
The Homestead strike, along with other major confrontations in the railroad and mining industries at about the same time, raised serious questions about the meaning and future of American democracy. Could a democratic tradition that reverberated with the rhetoric of Jeffersonian individualism prove viable in an economy of emerging bureaucratic national corporations, mass production and increasingly routine work patterns? Would government, at both the state and Federal level, so align itself with corporate interests as to cede to them a major role in economic and political life?
In "The River Ran Red," David P. Demarest Jr., who teaches English at Carnegie-Mellon University, wants his readers to "be there" in order to answer those and other questions for themselves. His volume is a compilation of documents, taken primarily from the nation's press and from Congressional hearings, that detail the Homestead dispute. It also contains an arresting selection of graphics illustrating the conflict. The inclusion of private material, such as letters and diary selections, might have strengthened the book; yet these more public documents, collected here for the first time, nonetheless tell an important part of the story. The accompanying remarks by the contributing commentators, while occasionally given to florid prose, provide a useful, if necessarily limited, historical context.
In "The Battle for Homestead," Paul Krause, an assistant professor of history at the University of British Columbia, interprets the larger issues. Mr. Krause explores "the politics, culture and morality of steelmaking" in the late 19th-century United States and places the specific events of 1892 within a larger context. He therefore devotes a rather small proportion of his book to the actual conflict; rather, he sees Homestead as one part of the growth of a modern steel industry, its work force and a regional political system in the post-Civil War decades. Informative discussions about industrial development, the details of iron and steel production and aspects of political life follow. But Mr. Krause intends more than a mere narrative.
Central to his analysis is the belief that "labor republicanism" motivated the majority of Homestead workers. Rooted in a "classical republican tradition" that was formed by Machiavelli, British thinkers of the 18th century and American revolutionaries, this labor republicanism, in Mr. Krause's view, staunchly opposed capitalism, stressed cooperative rather than acquisitive principles and focused on the common good. Capitalism, specifically a capitalism dedicated to technological innovation, was its opponent.
In the hands of steelmakers such as Carnegie, the author states, technology undermined the traditional skills of craft workers, extracted greater profits by reducing labor costs and enthroned a "morality of improvement" that sought "to organize work, and indeed all public and private life, toward the achievement of maximum productivity and profit." In contrast, the belief in a communitarian labor republicanism distinguished these Homestead workers from capitalists and liberal labor reformers alike.
The problems with this analysis are manifold. While the debate over labor republicanism is now three decades old (having been initiated in the 1960's with the work of Herbert Gutman and David Montgomery), Mr. Krause reflects few of this discussion's intricacies. His almost Manichaean impulses lead him into simplistic divisions that cloud the more complex history. Steelmakers were not the only Americans enamored of scientific efficiency and material progress. These beliefs permeated the culture, influencing workers, railroad engineers and iron puddlers, as well as emerging middle-class professionals. Explaining this dominant cultural force as driven only by profits is reductionist.
Nor is Mr. Krause's rendering of labor republicanism reliable. He does not recognize that many 19th-century workers defended capitalism and democracy simultaneously; he ignores the individualist themes in the very tradition he extols as solely cooperative, and he fails to develop the empirical evidence for such a tradition beyond a small group of labor editors and activists. His treatment of the increasingly important unskilled immigrant work force in Homestead offers no sustained discussion of the meaning of their ethnic perspectives -- religious, fraternal and familial -- for labor republicanism.
Mr. Krause's understanding of labor reform politics and the working class is rather innocent. He invokes emotive language when noting the political failure of labor republicanism, but avoids dealing with the fact that the overwhelming majority of workers in the region consistently supported one or the other of the two major political parties. Against this reality his claim for an autonomous republic of labor lacks credibility. And his naivete is at times debilitating, as when he argues that a working-class candidate's refusal to identify himself as a socialist in an 1882 campaign "publicly signaled a momentous narrowing of American political discourse and possibilities." The outlook for socialism in a society whose individualist republican tradition gloried in its own revolutionary birth was always far less sanguine than Mr. Krause allows.
The important questions Mr. Krause raises concerning technology, democracy, economic development and the place of working people in the 19th-century United States remain more satisfactorily analyzed in Anthony F. C. Wallace's study of a Pennsylvania coal community, "St. Clair" (1987). Ultimately "The Battle for Homestead" disappoints because the author's beliefs too often substitute for the myriad voices of the historical actors he does not fully understand.

HEADLINE: For Black Farmers, Extinction Seems to Be Near

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNION SPRINGS, Ala., July 30

 BODY:
A hundred years ago Booker T. Washington convened the first annual Farmers Conference for blacks at Tuskegee Institute some 40 miles north of here. It was barely a generation since the end of slavery, and about 60 percent of all employed blacks in the United States worked on farms.
At the centennial celebration of the Tuskegee Farmers Conference earlier this year, there were the usual gospel songs, barbecues and paeans to the rural life. But even as those at the conference recognized the family of Albert J. Perry as the 1992 Merit Farm Family of the Year, most knew that the American black farmer they were celebrating was an increasingly endangered species. 
 "I've seen a lot of black farmers go under around here," said Mr. Perry, 44 years old, whose father was Merit Farmer of the Year in 1969. "And only four of us who are farming here now are under 50 years old. There aren't any black people turning their farms over to their children because their children don't want to farm."
A Federal Census Bureau study released in June shows just how rare Mr. Perry has become. Around the turn of the century, mechanization eliminated many farm jobs and thousands of Southern blacks headed north for work, as well as to escape racism.
By 1960, 11 percent of the people running farms were black, roughly the same proportion of blacks in the general population. While the number of Americans engaged in farming dwindled steadily over the next few decades, the census study found that by 1990 the proportion of black farmers had precipitously dropped, to 1.5 percent, or about 69,000 of the nation's 4.5 million farmers.
"Farm declines seemed to have plateaued for whites in the last decade or so," said Douglas Bachtel, a demographer and professor at the University of Georgia. "But black farmers are on their way to extinction."
The figures support a report made 10 years ago by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, which found that farm displacement and land loss among blacks was two and a half times the rate among white farmers. At that rate, it said, "there will be virtually no blacks operating farms in this country" by the year 2000. "The frequent pattern is for land to remain in minority hands only so long as it is economically marginal, and then to be acquired by whites when its value begins to increase," the report added.
Little has changed since the report was made, said Ralph Paige, president of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund, which gives technical assistance to small farmers, most of whom are black. Black farmers, he said, face double jeopardy. Like every farmer, they struggle against the economic forces that are driving small farmers out of business and replacing them with large agribusiness operations. But, he said, black farmers also confront racial bias, which can make it harder to get financial or other aid, and a lack of training in farm management.
"This isn't just another black farmer going out of business," Mr. Paige said. "It is our community losing a piece of the country."
 
Lure of Southern Cities
 Paradoxically, this decline is occurring during an increase in the general black population in the South, where the overwhelming majority of black farmers have historically lived. While the North was once viewed as the place of opportunity and less overt racism, Mr. Paige said, it is now Southern cities that offer jobs and a more comfortable racial atmosphere.
Here in Bullock County, the Perrys are one of the few black families known for tenaciously holding onto the land. Albert Perry's 45-year-old cousin, James Perry, said he was "likely to die on that old tractor while bringing in a good peanut crop." But with a good crop, he said with a wink, "I probably wouldn't die at all. It's a good living when things are going good."
Albert Perry said he once "had leaving on my mind" and would have moved away if his father had not told him that if he stayed around, the family's land would become his.
"He kept his promise," Mr. Perry said as he examined piles of hay that was ready for baling. "He worked with me for some years, showing me things, and one day I just asked myself what would I do if I did leave the farm. I realized how much I liked being my own boss, and while I didn't make a good living, I made a living."
 
Close to the Edge
 In addition to his 400 acres in inherited land, which he uses for pasture and timber, Mr. Perry leases about 500 acres from other land owners for growing hay, soybeans, corn, sweet potatoes, field peas and peanuts. He also has about 48 cows that he is trying to develop into a good-sized herd. But he is expanding very slowly, mindful of a time in the mid-70's when, he said, "I bit off more than I could chew."
It was a time when low-interest Federal loans were readily available. Mr. Perry took a loan to expand his soybean crop, buy equipment and get into livestock. The next year the bottom fell out of the soybean market. A year later, hurricanes destroyed much of his crop, and then there was a drought.
"I had three bad years out of five and I almost went under," said Mr. Perry, who held onto his land but lost much of the new equipment that had been the collateral for the loans. "White farmers in the area had the same problems I had, but the system just seemed more forgiving of them."
Mr. Perry told of one black farmer in the area who had borrowed heavily to increase his peanut acreage and buy a used combine. He was harvesting a crop that would have brought in $20,000 when the combine broke down. The repair bill was $200, but local officials of the Farmers Home Loan Administration would not advance him the money for repairs, Mr. Perry said. The farmer lost his crop, defaulted on his loan and lost his land.
"The facts of life are that all small farmers are disappearing," James Perry said, "but it just seems that on the way out it's the black farmer who is really catching it."
Two hundred miles away in Dudley, Ga., Robert Coleman, 55, stood knee-deep in near-ripe pea plants and then trudged over to the sandy soil where watermelons grew on his 500-acre farm. Despite the swings of fate, farming has been rewarding for him, financially and emotionally. A new Cadillac sat in front of his small house.
"I just love farming and always having something to do," he said. "I don't fish or watch television."
Mr. Coleman said he had managed to prosper largely because he also held a salaried job as an equipment operator at a nearby kaolin mine.
"It's twice as hard for the black farmer," he said. "Some of us lose our land in a bad year or through bad management. Some of us don't have the best land in the first place and we can't afford the new techniques that produce higher yields. As for me, I'd have lost my farm if it wasn't for the job at the mine."
Mr. Bachtel, the demographer, said about half of Georgia's 43,500 farmers are actually part-time farmers with full-time, salaried jobs. Among black farmers in the state, the proportion is about one-third.
On a hot day this month Mr. Coleman was doing a rare thing: giving advice to a new black farmer, 33-year-old Marvin Wells.
Mr. Wells, who also works at a nearby paper mill, said he had no romanticism about returning to the land. He said he was trying to raise peas, corn and peanuts on leased land because he wanted to make money and be his own boss.
"I figured I ought to get out there and try," he said. "If I fall, I won't be the first to fall."
Bernard Payton, the president of Tuskegee University, said that blacks' flight from the farm earlier in the century was a complex phenomenon driven by more than economics, mechanization and the deep racism of the South. It was also a flight from conditions they associated with peonage and deeply resented. To be of the land was to be a peasant and to leave the land was progress, he said of this view.
The trend is not likely to be reversed, he said, adding that he was not sure it should be. Any return of blacks to farming should not focus just on the production side and working the soil, he said. The future of farming also includes the laboratory, the research scientist and the business planner.
"The image of someone moving back to the land is the wrong image to cultivate," Mr. Payton said. "If you are concerned about blacks getting back into farming now, you have to be concerned about blacks getting training as geneticists, veterinarians, researchers and specialists in business."

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Science, Maybe, but Politics for Sure

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
In a chamber renowned for talkers, Senator Alan K. Simpson, the Republican whip, is regarded as a champion.
But after he and other undecided Republicans were invited to the White House recently for a hard-sell lobbying session on the superconducting supercollider, the Wyoming Republican was suddenly at a loss for words. 
 "I'm no scientist," he said. "Don't ask me what it all is."
With the Senate expected to vote on the big-ticket item early this week, many lawmakers can recite -- more or less -- the boilerplate on the particle accelerator: It will help discover the fundamental forces of nature by racing subatomic particles around a track until they smash, simulating the conditions that existed just after the birth of the universe.
But if few members of Congress are scientists, all are politicians, and many are also lawyers, adversarial thinkers trained to translate complicated subjects into their own terms: budgets, jobs and, ultimately, votes.
Scientists who say the supercollider offers no practical benefits are quoted by opponents, while supporters quote scientists who say the supercollider offers the limitless promise of new frontiers -- so the technical arguments are pretty much a wash.
"The truth is, I do not think there is a single person in this body who has the scientific background to know for sure whether this is the greatest investment ever or the worst investment," said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, in a rare moment of the House floor debate on the supercollider.
So, like the debates over the space station planned by NASA, the debates over the supercollider are dominated by economic and electoral, not scientific, issues. And just as in other legislative battles, the issues in the two expensive science projects boil down to the benefits of reducing unemployment versus the benefits of reducing the deficit.
Opponents call the $8 billion supercollider and the $30 billion space station space-age pork. "The truth is we just can't afford them," said Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Budget Committee.
Supporters counter that the projects are needed to sustain the nation's competitive edge in aerospace technology and physics, and they will also create tens of thousands of high-paying jobs.
The importance of the jobs argument was demonstrated in the House vote on the supercollider on June 17. The votes of state delegations correlated closely with the amount of money the project was expected to bring. Texas stands to gain the most from the supercollider since it is being built in Waxahachie, about 20 miles south of Dallas. The state's delegation voted 26 to 1 against an amendment to cut financing. The Illinois delegation, which would obtain $48 million in project contracts this year, voted 18 to 2 against the amendment. New York members, happy their state will receive $44 million in contracts, voted 23 to 10 against the amendment.
But in the end, the supercollider went down to defeat by a vote of 232 to 181, because the dominant issue in the debate was the deficit -- at least for lawmakers whose states would not benefit from the contracts and jobs.
"Timing was everything," said Representative Sherwood Boehlert of upstate New York, a Republican leader of the forces opposing the project. He noted that the vote came less than a week after the House narrowly missed reaching a two-thirds' majority to pass the balanced-budget amendment so deficit considerations were still fresh.
But now lawmakers say the heat of the balanced-budget debate has cooled, and in the last month the focus of Capitol Hill has shifted back to jobs. So the House decided to go ahead with the space station by a resounding vote of 238 to 181, even though fiscal conservatives from states not likely to gain from the project argued last week the country faced a black hole of $130 billion in costs over the next quarter century.
As for the supercollider, the Senate is expected to approve financing for it by a handy margin. That means the matter will go to a House-Senate conference committee later this summer, where few believe that the House will put up much resistance to providing money for the project. "As a practical matter," Mr. Boehlert said, "most members of Congress have signed on not as a science project but as a public works job program."

The Economy
Millions of Americans appear to have changed their spending patterns, and consumers interviewed in Oklahoma City were no exception. Both consumer confidence and consumer spending have fallen, suggesting weakness in the economy at least through the November election. Local bankers say Oklahomans' willingness to spend was shaken by lost jobs in two-income households, depleted savings and crimped pension prospects. [Page D1.]
A vast redevelopment of Times Square has been put off, perhaps indefinitely, state and city officials acknowledge. They are close to postponing indefinitely the four giant office towers that were supposed to lead 42d Street to a new day but ended up victims of a devastated market. [A1.] 
 The business of advising or investing in bankrupt companies is falling on hard times. Bankruptcy specialists who gathered at the sixth annual "Creditors' Ball" noted that less debt is falling into default and courts are pressuring advisers to hold down fees. [D1.]
A fierce battle is under way in Washington over whether ethanol, an alternative fuel made from farm products like corn, is a cure for pollution or a cause of it. [D3.]
 
International
Foreign investors' lust for Mexican equities has given way to doubts, even disaffection. The Mexican stock market's latest problems have also exposed a culture clash in the relationship between big Mexican companies and their new foreign shareholders. [D1.]
Top trade officials of Canada, Mexico and the U.S. began their seventh and possibly final round of negotiations toward producing a North American free-trade agreement. [D2.]
The U.S. has concluded that Japan's efforts to open its semiconductor market to American exports are inadequate but will not impose immediate sanctions, American officials say. [D2.]
 
The Media Business
Television has long sought younger viewers because these are the consumers desired by most advertisers. Now, three of the four broadcast networks are aggressively aiming virtually all their new shows at viewers 18 to 49 years old, even though the population is aging. Bill Carter: Television. [D8.]
Ms. magazine's 20-year anniversary is being marked with the publication of a glowing retrospective issue. The two-year anniversary of its revamping, when it converted to a bimonthly without advertising, is being observed with the once-failing magazine claiming that it is now profitable and thriving. [D8.]
Southern California advertisers are slowly coming to grips with the psychic damage to consumers inflicted by the recent riots. Many ad agency executives are trying to soft-pedal the city's uneasiness. A few are trying to exploit it. [D8.]
Friedman Benjamin is fervently hoping that one person can make a difference. Elizabeth Mason, who joined the agency as president earlier this year, is charged with setting the direction and strategy of the agency. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D6.]
The Tulsa Tribune has become the latest afternoon newspaper to announce that it will close. The Tribune said it planned to dissolve its joint operating agreement with The Tulsa World and publish its final issue on Sept. 30. [D8.]

HEADLINE: The Long Bankruptcy Party Winds Down

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: WESTHAMPTON, L.I., Aug. 1

 BODY:
The BMW's and Range Rovers began pulling up about noon, and arriving guests were treated to stuffed mushrooms and clams as they milled around the pool, cocktails in hand. But to some of them, the lack of shrimp said it all.
"Must be a down year," said H. Sean Mathis, making do with a spicy Buffalo chicken wing instead. 
 Mr. Mathis, like many who attended the sixth annual "Creditors' Ball" here today, has thrived in recent years from a lucrative boom in bankruptcies and is well aware that the long party is finally winding down. The business of advising or investing in companies that have fallen on hard times is itself falling on hard times.
 
A Shared Sentiment
 "It doesn't have the same oomph anymore," said Mr. Mathis, who has spent the last few years investing in distressed companies that he and his partners hope to turn around. Among those turnarounds is the Ameriscribe Corporation, which provides photo-copying and mail-room services for law firms. Mr. Mathis is now the company's president.
Mr. Mathis's sentiment was shared by many of the roughly 175 visitors to the weekend home of Robert M. Miller, a prominent bankruptcy lawyer with Berlack, Israels & Liberman who plays host to the annual summer gala.
In some ways, the party was bigger and splashier than ever. More than 50 bankruptcies were represented, judging from the sign-up sheet, and two bankruptcy lawyers flew in from Texas just to attend. Mr. Miller handed out $1,000 bonds of defunct railroads as party favors, and even the children of the guests feasted on lobster and hand-dipped chocolate strawberries.
But many of those invited found plenty to grumble about nonetheless.
For one thing, the big surge in corporate debt defaults is fading. Many companies that pursued ill-conceived leveraged buyouts in the 1980's have already either failed or reduced their huge debt loads.
And fees for bankruptcy specialists have come under enormous pressure from the judges who must approve them. Inspired by the stand taken last summer by the Federal Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, many bankruptcy courts are now demanding that lawyers, accountants and investment bankers back up their bills with hourly records and think nothing about slashing fees or dismissing advisers whom they consider redundant.
 
More Scrutiny of Fees
 Even the Labor Department has gotten into the act lately. Convinced that "exorbitant fees" are eroding the pension funds for workers at bankrupt companies, Lynn Martin, the Secretary of Labor, instructed her department in June to scrutinize fee applications in any bankruptcies in which the Government may be left holding the bag.
"Legal fees need to be looked at, no question," said Robin Phelan, one of the two Dallas lawyers who had flown in. But the Labor Department move, he said, "is a knee-jerk bureaucratic reaction."
He added, somewhat predictably, "The more they do that, the more they are going to get second-class representation."
As a result, investment firms like Goldman, Sachs and Merrill Lynch are doing what was once unthinkable: they are turning down advisory work when it appears that a restructuring will likely end up in court.
 
Advantage of Lower Costs
 Out-of-town lawyers like Mr. Phelan, who had never shown much interest in New York, are using their advantage of lower costs to lure clients away from Manhattan rivals. Texas lawyers, Mr. Phelan noted, have more experience than New York lawyers, since their state's economy was one of the first to go into a tailspin.
"We've been through the drill and we're cheaper than New York firms, even counting the plane ticket," boasted Mr. Phelan, a partner with Haynes & Boone who made a name for himself with the unusually generous settlement he won for clients who were creditors in the bankruptcy of the LTV Corporation.
Some of the era's biggest swashbucklers are also prowling around for new careers, or at least specialties that will keep them and their troops busy. Henry S. Miller, an investment banker who only a year ago was helping to craft an 11th-hour deal to save Pan American World Airways from extinction, is no longer doing bankruptcy work. Within months after the deal fell apart, he left Prudential Securities, where he was head of the restructuring group, to head Salomon Brothers' transportation group, where he plans to concentrate on garden-variety corporate financings.
 
Promise of Real Estate
 Judging from the buzz at the party, many of those looking to stick out the slowdown in the bankruptcy arena have struck upon real estate restructurings as their ticket. Because many multi-tenant office buildings will feel the pinch of recession only when leases come up for renewal, these advisers hope they can transform themselves into real-estate experts in time to take advantage of the collapse.
"Real estate is going to be big," William Jacobs, a director in the high-yield group at the First Boston Corporation, said with the awe that the cognoscenti once reserved for plastics in the 1960's. "There's $260 billion of commercial real estate debt maturing between March 1992 and June 1993, and nobody's lending money anymore."
Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the senior managing director of Rothschild Inc. who has become a leading advocate of creditors in bankruptcies, was also busy making plans for the future. "The boom in busted L.B.O.'s is clearly over," he said. "I don't think the business will go to zero, but there'll be less going forward, especially since the fees have come under pressure. Ten years from now, Macy's and Zale's will mark the watershed of the busted-L.B.O. period."
 
Focus on Real Estate
 Mr. Ross is encouraging his own firm to focus on real estate and financial institutions as the two pockets of the economy that still have challenges ahead. He also made waves a few months back when he was retained by the management -- not the creditors -- of the Service America Corporation, a troubled food-service company. Mr. Ross insists that he had always been willing to represent managements, if they were "realistic that the bondholders own the company."
But tongues wagged anyway over his move, which will pit him for the first time against his host and longtime ally, Robert Miller. The feeling on Wall Street was that times must truly be tough if not even Mr. Ross can afford to turn away business he might previously have scorned.
 
Resolving the Shrimp Mystery
 For his part, Mr. Miller and his wife, Deborah, worked hard to keep the mood festive, insisting that no expense had been spared. The shrimp was not a casualty of belt-tightening, they maintained, merely a concession to the caterers who had stayed up all night the year before, cleaning nearly 100 pounds of shrimp.
And Mr. Miller, whose firm represents the bondholders in the R. H. Macy bankruptcy case, insisted that bankruptcies would continue to be a good business with easy pickings for some time. Still, he and his partners did not miss an opportunity to identify a potential client -- even if their overtures were a bit premature.
During the annual awards ceremony, Mr. Miller noted that a jury had recently ordered Price Waterhouse to pay $338 million over a mishandled audit. He then presented a straw hat to Michael Gagnon, a partner with the big accounting firm, just in case the accountant wanted to pass it among the guests.

NEW YORK CITY
NEW TACTICS IN DRUG WAR
Frustrated with soaring arrests and no discernible improvement in New York City's drug problem, Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown has quietly shifted emphasis away from the once-vaunted Tactical Narcotics Teams that swept into neighborhoods to arrest street-level dealers. Instead the Commissioner is focusing on stopping higher-level drug traffickers, while at the same time putting more uniformed officers on foot patrol to try to assure residents that the streets are not being abandoned to street-level dealers. A1.
 
UNCERTAINTY ON TIMES SQUARE PLAN
Conceding that the moment has come and gone for the vast redevelopment of Times Square, state and city officials are close to postponing indefinitely the four giant office towers that were supposed to lead 42d Street to a new day but ended up victims of a devastated market. Rather than hold the Times Square Center project to the current timetable, which would probably force construction of the first skyscraper to begin next year, officials are asking the developers to revitalize, for retail and entertainment use, the four sites where the towers were to rise. A1.
 
SEEKING CLUES TO JET ACCIDENT
Federal investigators have turned their attention to maintenance records from the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar that burned at Kennedy International Airport after an aborted takeoff last week, seeking more clues about a broken wing and a possible false warning to the crew that the jet was about to stall. Under the stress of the landing, a large metal spar that formed one wall of the right wing's fuel tank cracked. B3.
 
KILLINGS STUN NEIGHBORHOOD IN QUEENS
The slayings of a couple in Bayswater, Queens, have stunned residents of the quiet neighborhood, where one of the victims, a real-estate broker, was an esteemed civic leader who knew everyone's name and had often helped new neighbors find their homes and move in. The news that the police arrested two people, including one the broker had helped, left residents even more distraught. B3.
 
MAGNET SCHOOL FOR STARRETT CITY
A school for 1,000 young Soviet emigres will open in Canarsie, Brooklyn, next month with two goals: to assimilate the students into American and Jewish culture and to persuade their parents to apply for apartments in the adjoining Starrett City housing development, which leased the school land for its new building. The school is the latest lure to white applicants as Starrett City tries to mitigate the United States Supreme Court's ruling that racial quotas to maintain integration at the development violated Federal law. Metro Matters, B3.
 
3-YEAR-OLD FALLS 10 STORIES
A 3-year-old girl was in critical condition yesterday after she leaned against a poorly secured window guard and fell 10 stories to the lawn outside a Brooklyn housing project, the police said. The girl's father had removed the guard, which normally covered the lower half of the window, and then put it back without securing it, the police said. B3.
 
REGION
 
A PATIO MIRACLE LURES BELIEVERS
Ever since Joseph Januszkiewicz told people that the Virgin Mary appeared on his patio in Marlboro, N.J., in May and promised that she would return the first Sunday every month, word has spread and the usually quiet town in Monmouth County has bustled with thousands of the faithful -- all asking for directions to Mr. Januszkiewicz's place.

In an old stone church Parkill, N.Y., a small congregation is setting out to show the world that the walls separating blacks in suburbia from those in the city can come tumbling down. The parishioners of the St. Charles African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church used to anguish over youths caught up in street violence. But it took the riots in Los Angeles and later the disturbances in Washington Heights, they say, to shake up their congregation, composed mainly of middle-class professionals, educators and retirees. The 130 church members stopped talking about what they thought needed to be done and moved into action. B5.

HEADLINE: Joseph Shuster, Cartoonist, Dies; Co-Creator of 'Superman' Was 78

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Joseph Shuster, a co-creator of Superman who sold the rights to the character for $130, never dreaming it would become a legendary figure in popular culture reaping billions of dollars, died on Thursday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 78 years old.
He died of congestive heart failure, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said. 
 One night in 1934, Jerry Siegel conceived a superhuman hero, and the next day, he asked his buddy, Mr. Shuster, to draw it. Syndicators repeatedly rejected their comic strip until 1938, when Detective Comics bought the 13-page story for $10 a sheet.
"We were young kids," Mr. Shuster said later. "What did we know?"
Published as a booklet under the name Action Comics, Superman was an instant hit. His popularity helped establish comic books as a format and spawned a genre of bizarrely costumed superheros, from Spiderman to Wonder Woman.
 
Superman: The Industry
 Superman reigned as king of the realm and an industry unto himself. Almost faster than a speeding bullet, the Man of Steel appeared in newspaper comics, a radio show, animated cartoons, movie-theater serials, a television series, a Broadway musical, a novel, feature films and a stream of franchised goods, from lunch boxes and toys to bubble gum. In the 1970's alone, Superman sales exceeded $1 billion.
Superman was the baby alien from outer space, reared as a normal American boy and growing up to become Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter. But when danger loomed, he transformed into the crusader for Truth, Justice and the American Way, ducking into the nearest phone booth, doffing his glasses and stripping to a blue bodysuit. Red cape flowing, he flew off, using X-ray vision and other powers to thwart the latest evil menace or global disaster. He leaped over tall buildings, gallantly kept the admiring and curious Lois Lane at arm's length and feared only kryptonite.
For several years, the Shuster-Siegel team earned a modest living as Superman's cartoonist and writer. But when they pressed for a share of the profits, they were dumped. They tried other story lines, including a character called Funnyman, which flopped.
 
Poverty, Then a Pension
 Protracted litigation seeking money from Superman's owners also failed. By the 1970's, both men were nearly destitute and even sold their old comic books as collectors' items worth thousands of dollars apiece. Mr. Shuster, partly blind and unemployed, lived in a threadbare Queens apartment.
Finally he and Mr. Siegel appealed to the court of public opinion. In 1975 Warner Communications, which then owned Superman, volunteered to give each a pension of $20,000 a year. In 1981 the figure was raised to $30,000, plus a $15,000 bonus after the first film in the "Superman" series grossed $275 million.
Mr. Shuster was born in Toronto. As a youngster, he moved with his family to Cleveland, where he met Mr. Siegel.
No information on survivors was available.

HEADLINE: Shoppers' Vote: No Confidence

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY, July 31

 BODY:
Rhonda Grimes heads for a Ross Dress for Less store or a Sam's Wholesale Club these days when she needs new clothes or something for her family's rented condominium.
Mrs. Grimes started a day-care business a year ago and her family's income is higher now than it was last year. And it is higher, she says, than she and her husband, Clifford, a vice president at the local United Way, expected. 
 But she has not resumed old habits of shopping, no longer visiting the J. C. Penney or Dillard's department stores here in the gleaming, three-tiered Quail Springs Mall.
"I'm doing more wholesale shopping at the outlets and discount stores," she said. "I've totally changed my spending patterns."
So, apparently, have millions of other Americans. In July, the index of consumer confidence measured by the Conference Board, a business group, plunged 16 percent, erasing half its gains since February. And the Commerce Department reported that consumers, whose spending represents two-thirds of the nation's $6 trillion economy, pared expenditures by three-tenths of 1 percent in April, May and June, after a rise of 5.1 percent in the first quarter.
 
Weakness Through November
 Together, these measures suggest weakness in the nation's economy at least through the November election, analysts said.
At first glance, Oklahoma shoppers would seem to be more eager to spend. After collapsing in the mid-1980's from a tidal wave of oil-and-gas and real-estate failures and a banking implosion that squeezed available credit, the state has slowly nursed its economy off the critical list.
The jobless rate fell to 5.7 percent in May, the most recent figure available, down from 7.1 percent a year earlier and far better than the nation over all, which had a rate of 7.8 percent in June.
Unemployment is even lower here in the state capital, at 4.7 percent in May. The city got a lift early in the year when the General Motors Corporation decided not to close a big assembly plant, and a nearby Air Force base, Tinker Field, may add 1,500 jobs soon.
 
Little Improvement in Wages
 Yet Oklahoma City job holders have seen scant improvements in their paychecks. Wages in the first quarter rose only 1.2 percent above the level in the first three months of 1991.
Local bankers say Oklahomans' willingness to spend was shaken by the lost jobs in two-income households, depleted savings and crimped pensions that jolted many families during the lean years that followed the 1986 collapse.
"Policy makers in Washington are trying to jump-start the economy with lower interest rates, but there is a high level of anxiety among consumers," said Dusty Martin, a local marketing director at Boatmen's Bank, a unit of Boatmen's Bancshares Inc., the St. Louis banking company that acquired Oklahoma's third-largest bank, First Interstate of Oklahoma, a year ago. "We've basically been in a flat economy for several years."
Interviews with shoppers and other visitors at two modern, sprawling malls here found middle-class households, once blithely inattentive to monthly budgeting, now wrestling with reduced incomes and living standards, frustrated savings goals, lowered aspirations and festering worries about inadequate reserves for children's college expenses and retirement.
Many people, like Mrs. Grimes, say they enter stores more grudgingly, with an eye mainly for bargains and necessities. After she lost her job as a bond trader in Merrill Lynch's Dallas office when the stock market collapsed in 1987, she and her husband paid off their credit cards and cut them up. They pay now with cash or personal checks.
"I'm competitive shopping today for back to school," Mrs. Grimes said as she scanned locations for shoe stores on a directory and map listing four big department stores and 120 specialty shops at the Quail Springs Mall in the northern suburbs of Oklahoma City. She expected to pay at least $60 for a pair of athletic shoes for her son, who has hard-to-fit, narrow feet.
"When I worked at Merrill Lynch, I'd call a department store and order over the phone," she recalled. "It was, 'O.K., I'll take it,' and have them deliver it to my home. Now, about the only times I shop in the mall will be during off-season sales."
 
Rent and Car Payments
 The biggest monthly payment for the Grimeses after rent is $250 on a car loan for a Dodge Spirit that Mrs. Grimes bought last year. The loan on her husband's 1987 BMW was repaid before she bought the Spirit.
The Grimeses retained a Merrill Lynch benefits plan offered with her 1987 severance, and save regularly in an individual retirement account, as well as $100 a month in a college-education fund that they started six years ago for their nine-year-old son. None of the savings have gone into the stock market.
"It may be up 100 points, but that's today," Mrs. Grimes said. "Depending on what happens in some part of the world, the market may go down 150 tomorrow. I was lucky enough to get out of the market two days before the crash in 1987, but I saw many people lose their life savings.
"People say mutual funds are pretty safe, but after what I saw, we're putting a lot of money in U.S. savings bonds," she said. "When you have small children, I think that's the best way."
 
Struggling to Survive After Losing a Job
 Jim Wylie, a variety store manager, saw his household income drop to $55,000 this year, from $85,000 two years ago before he quit a higher-paying job as a regional merchandise manager to avoid a transfer when the McCrory Company acquired his previous employer. It took 15 months, and more than $10,000 from the Wylies' family nest egg, before he found a lower-paying store manager's job in April with Everything's A Dollar.
Mr. Wylie rejected a transfer because he and his wife, Lynn, would have lost money on a comfortable house they bought in 1980, and because Mrs. Wylie would have had to quit her office manager job at Wiltel, a long-distance telephone subsidiary of the Williams Companies, a gas pipeline company based in Tulsa. Her job carried family health and retirement benefits, which Mr. Wylie gave up when he quit his old job.
 
No Time for Vacation
 Mr. Wylie, 43 years old, said he pays $320 each month on a loan for the 1989 Chevrolet pickup truck he bought in 1990; he says he cannot afford to buy a new car to replace his wife's 1987 Pontiac Fiero. They took no vacation trip this year, even though Mrs. Wylie gets six weeks of paid vacation, because he has not been in his job long enough to qualify for any time off.
After paying the monthly mortgage, saving for insurance payments and other expenses, including $2,000 for yearly tuition and books at the University of Central Oklahoma for their 23-year-old daughter, the Wylies have few dollars left for savings, Mr. Wylie said.
They use credit cards only for big purchases that cannot be covered from the checking account, like the new sets of tires Mr. Wylie bought for both vehicles. His aim is to shed the debt and limit interest charges by paying the bill quickly, writing checks of about $200 each month.
"When I was working a better job, I didn't think about" sticking to a budget, he said, adding: "If I wanted something, I went out and bought it. We're still buying things we want, but we've had to scale back."
 
A Second Income And Tasks at Home
 Sharon Weber works evenings and weekends in retail sales at the Quail Springs Mall for Nordic Track Inc., the maker of skiing machines and other exercise equipment, so she can increase family income and still be at home with her three children, ages 7 through 11.
The Webers moved to Oklahoma City in 1990 after Mrs. Weber's husband, Richard, was squeezed out of his marketing post in Minneapolis for Chicago Cutlery when the General Housewares Corporation acquired the company. Mrs. Weber said she has been angered by the big salaries paid by top executives who engineered the corporate mergers and by the cutbacks that disrupted families like hers.
 
Paycheck to Paycheck
 "People lower in the company get their pay cut and their benefits cut, and then they can't make ends meet," she said. "We live pretty much paycheck to paycheck. An extra $100 a month wouldn't help us very much."
The Webers, with combined income of $50,000 to $70,000, save little. They rarely take vacation trips. Mr. Weber will keep his 1987 Nissan because buying a new car would add too much to monthly expenses, she said. Their extra dollars now go to piano and dance lessons for their two daughters, and fees, coaching and equipment for their son's baseball and basketball teams.
"Sports, dance and piano give them discipline and self-confidence and build their self-esteem," Mrs. Weber said. "In that way, we're investing in their future. The way the economy is going, with the job situation, it's going to take two incomes pretty much to make it. So, you know they are going to be out there working some day."
 
Comfortably Retired On a Fixed Income
 Not everyone is cutting back. Doris Maxey, a secretary who retired six years ago from the Control Data Corporation, is thinking of taking a job for 20 hours a week, partly for extra spending money, maybe to buy a Cadillac to replace her 1983 Oldsmobile Cutlass. Her husband, who retired in 1985 after 18 years in warehouse operations for the Carrier Corporation, owns a custom van and a pickup truck.
"We have never lived extravagantly," Mrs. Maxey said. "But we eat out every Saturday night, and we take trips now and then. We feel comfortable, unless the pension plan goes belly-up and Social Security dies on the vine."
 
Letter Carrier's Tale
 Donald White, 28, a letter carrier for the Postal Service since 1985, said he took out loans this year to buy a new Honda Accord for his wife, Angela, and a 1992 Chevrolet Blazer for himself. They also paid $600 in cash for a 27-inch color television.
"I've had a good year, I'm starting to make a lot of money," said Mr. White, who was strolling with family members through the spacious Penn Square Mall in northwest Oklahoma City. Mr. White said the family earned less than $30,000 a year, including his wife's income as a data-processing clerk.
His widowed mother takes care of their toddler daughter on work days. The Whites rent an apartment, put about $50 a week into a bank savings account, but are not thinking about buying a home, Mr. White said. "Everything breaks down and I'd have to fix it," he said, with a grin. "I should think about it. But I'm just freeloading, having a good time."
 
A Land of Bargains Unknown in Japan
 To Akihiro Sakabe and Yuka Ochi, students in the United States who are supported by their parents in Japan, American malls are brimming with bargains at every turn. Compared with high prices in Japan, prices on Polo, Armani and other stylish brands stocked in Penn Square Mall stores looked "cheap," Ms. Ochi said.
Mr. Sakabe, 25, had just bought a pair of $4 earrings for Ms. Ochi, who is 20, at a Pier 1store. Both students said they wanted to work in the United States after they graduated because they expected higher living standards here than in high-priced and crowded Japan.
"I feel cool here," Ms. Ochi said, beaming.
Many Americans, however, say they are far less optimistic about the domestic economy.
Recalling her family's odyssey of job upheaval and reduced income, Mrs. Grimes said, "It's going to take a lot more than the recent cuts in interest rates for people to get back up to where they were four or five years ago."

HEADLINE: Japan Thinks Again About Its Plan to Build a Plutonium Stockpile

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 31

 BODY:
Facing growing criticism from abroad, Japanese Government officials say they have begun rethinking the nation's ambitious nuclear energy plans, and may delay or derail the building of self-sustaining breeder reactors that would add to the worldwide oversupply of deadly plutonium.
The quiet change seems to reflect the Government's reluctant conclusion that efforts to develop new technology for energy independence, begun in the energy crises of the 1970's, are becoming prohibitively expensive and politically untenable. 
 Japan's giant utility companies have told the Government they will no longer foot the bill to build a pilot breeder reactor, which would both consume and produce plutonium. Moreover, since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dismantling of large numbers of nuclear weapons, experts have warned that a glut of plutonium could pose major environmental problems and security threats.
 
Thinking It Through Again
 Government officials insisted during the last week of July that they were not abandoning their hopes of eventually creating a self-sustaining nuclear fuel cycle that would reduce their dependence on suppliers of uranium, which fuels ordinary reactors.
But on Wednesday, the Science and Technology Agency created an advisory panel to reassess the country's mid-term plans, which in Japan covers the next several decades.
Officials said a number of the conclusions seemed to be pre-ordained. Among them is expected to be a major change of course toward reactors that consume plutonium rather than create it, and a proposed venture with Russia to convert plutonium from dismantled weapons into fuel for nuclear power.
The committee chairman, Akira Oyama, a professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo, said in an interview that while Japan still hopes to use breeder reactors, the moment may not come until "the mid-21st century."
 
At Sea in Vulnerable Ships
 Though officials deny it, this change appears to be largely in response to mounting international protests, especially over Japan's plans to transport tons of plutonium -- fabricated from Japan's own nuclear wastes -- from Europe by sea, starting late this year. Environmental groups say the ships would pose an unnecessary environmental hazard and would be slow-moving targets ripe for terrorists.
Though the Bush Administration has informally approved the plan and will track the cargo by satellite, in late June the House of Representatives passed an amendment to the National Energy Policy Act that would effectively prevent Japan from moving the plutonium through United States waters. South Africa has also declared its waters off limits.
While Japanese officials say they plan to go ahead with at least one or two shipments in order to establish the precedent, they add that further deliveries could be delayed while Tokyo figures out how to use the plutonium.
"Something is finally happening inside the Government, and they are reviewing their plutonium policy," said Jinzaburo Takagi, a nuclear engineer and one of the leading critics of Japan's nuclear plans. "I don't think they will give everything up. But surely, there is some shift in present policy."
 
Bureaucratic Inertia
 Government officials say the powerful bureaucracy in Tokyo has been reluctant to abandon its dream, even though the United States has already abandoned large-scale reprocessing of wastes into plutonium for fear of nuclear proliferation.
"Our whole plutonium program began to take on a life of its own, and no one has wanted to pull the plug," a senior Government official who opposes the program said recently. "I think people are beginning to realize that this is placing us in a diplomatically very difficult position."
The problem is compounded by the fact that Japan has never satisfactorily explained how it would burn off all of the plutonium that its plans call for producing. Tokyo forswore the production of nuclear weapons after World War II, and almost no one believes the country has any desire to stockpile plutonium for conversion into a bomb.
 
Nervous Neighbors
 But diplomats from other Asian nations worry aloud about the wisdom of placing so much plutonium at Japan's disposal, even if it is regularly inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is widely assumed that Japan has the technology to produce a bomb should its policy ever change.
Mr. Oyama dismisses those concerns, saying there are "wide differences in the purity level of the plutonium we use for nuclear power and plutonium for military use."
Japan's goal of nuclear energy independence dates to the 1950's. The hope of relying on plutonium-fueled fast-breeder reactors was based on the assumption that uranium would be scarce and expensive.
Plutonium is a by-product when uranium is used to power a nuclear reactor, and it can be recovered and used to fuel another kind of reactor. Two small experimental fast-breeder reactors have already been built, and a major demonstration reactor is under construction.
A giant reprocessing center at Rokkasho in northeastern Japan is already a decade late, partly because of local protests. The plan to ship 80 or 90 tons of plutonium from Britain and France, which already have reprocessing complexes, arose from those delays.
But the economic predictions on which the plan was based have changed radically. Uranium is now plentiful and cheap, and the biggest problem now is how to store the highly toxic plutonium safely.
The United States has considerable control over Japan's plans because much of the nuclear waste being converted into plutonium was originally supplied by American companies. While the United States has officially supported Japan's plans, in private Bush Administration officials have been saying for months that they want Tokyo to find a way to extricate itself.

HEADLINE: After the Cold War: Views from Israel;
Israelis Worry That U.S. Will Need Them Less in New Global Realignment

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Now that they have a new Prime Minister in Yitzhak Rabin, many Israelis want to believe that they have turned a corner in the search for Middle East peace and in relations with the United States that have been muddled for quite a while.
But a development that, unlike the election, is beyond Israelis' control -- the end of the cold war -- has left them with nagging worries that somehow they are going to wind up on the short end of the ballyhooed new order, and no amount of hopefulness over a new national leader can ease those concerns. 
 Some doubts are perhaps inevitable in a vulnerable, endlessly fretting country. Still, Israeli officials and opinion molders say that as they spin the post-cold war globe, they find good reason for uneasiness, even though they are hardly blind to advantages they have already reaped.
For instance, the end to superpower rivalry made it possible to get peace talks going with neighboring Arab countries, something that Israel had said for decades was its greatest wish.
For instance, thanks both to the peace process and to Iraq's defeat in the Persian Gulf war, military planners agree that external threats to their nation's survival have never been lower.
For instance, Israel, once a pariah in many corners of the planet, has newly established or restored diplomatic relations with three dozen countries over the last two years, including China, India, a wide swath of Africa and eastern Europe and most of what used to be the Soviet Union.
Even before the final Soviet collapse, the crumbling of Communism made it possible for some 370,000 emigres from Russia and other republics to come here since mid-1989. They provide a new pool of talent, offer hopes for a future cultural flourishing and -- no small consideration -- shore up the country's Jewish majority against an Arab minority that has long been growing at a faster rate.
But none of the pluses are undiluted, and Israeli leaders are keenly aware of it. And it does not begin to touch the overriding question that has plagued Israel from the moment the United States emerged as the only superpower: Have relations with Washington changed for good, which is taken axiomatically here as meaning not for better?
Mr. Rabin's election in late June has removed much of the poison that had filled the Israeli-American diplomatic atmosphere during the final days of the former Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir. Still, "there are long-term questions about the relationship, no matter who's there as Prime Minister," said Dore Gold, a military expert at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies of Tel Aviv University.
 
Ambivalence Toward the U.S.
There has always been a certain ambivalence here toward the American Government and, for that matter, American Jews. Proud and defiant Israelis talk of how they have often had to stand alone and have always fought their own battles. But they know that this is not entirely true.
Israel is tied to the United States by $3 billion in annual military and economic aid, coupled with roughly half a billion dollars a year in contributions from American Jews. There has been a steady stream of high-tech weapons, an exchange of gathered intelligence and, usually, a happy confluence of perceived interests.
On purely strategic grounds, friendship with Israel may not have always made sense from an American viewpoint, considering the Arab countries' great share of the world's known oil reserves and their readiness in the past to use that weapon against pro-Israel America. Nonetheless, starting in the 1950's, the Middle East became one more area where the United States and the Soviet Union fought the cold war through surrogates, and despite inherent risks, the situation generally worked to Israel's advantage. Because the Soviet Union in the old days was a knee-jerk supporter of Arab causes, the United States had to stand alongside Israel almost by definition.
But with the cold war melted, Arab states have lost their Soviet benefactor, and countries like Syria are almost doing handstands to stay on Washington's good side. Many Israelis worry that the United States is moving inexorably, perhaps even obligatorily, from their corner to a more neutral spot in the Middle East ring.
This is dangerous for them and for regional stability, they warn, for they are so outnumbered by the Arabs that the Americans, if they wish to avoid yet another Middle East war, must be squarely behind Israel to help it maintain its military edge.
It has hardly reassured Israeli strategic planners that the Bush Administration talks about a new era of collective-security arrangements similar to the alliance stitched together against Iraq last year. Invariably, they say, such coalitions look for the broadest possible consensus. And inevitably, they argue, the United States will concern itself more with the wants of wealthy and influential Arab countries like Saudi Arabia than with Israel's needs.
"Israel will tend to be excluded," Mr. Gold said. "The United States-Israel relationship thrives when the United States is chiefly operating through its bilateral relationships."
 
A Long Catalogue Of Skirmishes
The steady tattoo of disputes between Washington and Jerusalem over the last year went far to reinforce Israelis' worst fears, which have not been erased by the smiles being flashed now at Mr. Rabin, who will visit President Bush in Kennebunkport, Me., next week.
By now, the catalogue of skirmishes is as familiar as it is long: the withholding of $10 billion in American loan guarantees for Israel; the anti-Semitism charges hurled against President Bush by some right-wing Israeli politicians; the comments by Mr. Bush interpreted by some of his critics as showing insensitivity to Jews; the allegations that Israel handed Patriot missile technology to China; the American rebuke to Israel for sending spy planes over Iraq last fall to hunt for Scud missile launchers; and, more recently, State Department remarks reaffirming support of a 1948 United Nations resolution on the right of refugees displaced by the Israeli-Arab war that year to return to their homes.
There are few issues more sensitive for Israelis than this one on refugees, and many of them asked nervously at the time whether the Administration was supporting the right of an estimated 2.6 million Palestinians to return to Israel. Although the State Department says no and has sought to play down the episode, many Israelis wonder all the same.
And as they do, they also wonder if a sea change has taken place that undermines the vaunted influence of the pro-Israel lobby in Washington. Israel's allies learned through the fight over loan guarantees that no matter how overwhelming the Congressional majority they can muster on a given issue, it does not count for much against an unsympathetic and determined President.
Other countries presumably have figured that out, too, and that does not help Israel.
It is taken for granted here that some countries that recently established relations with Israel had calculated that a shortcut to Washington's heart and pocketbook is through the Israelis and their American kin. By this cold reasoning, if American Jews turn out to be not that important, after all, then perhaps neither is Israel.
 
'Strategic Asset' Is Still Emphasized
As a result, there has been a good deal of scrambling on both sides in recent months to emphasize that Israel is as important a "strategic asset" to the Americans as ever, that it may not have oil but it has shared democratic values with the United States, that despite the raucousness of its politics it is a bastion of stability in a region top-heavy with radical and unpredictable regimes.
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres cites the spread of Islamic fundamentalism and of nonconventional weapons in the region as justifying continued United States-Israeli cooperation, although how Israel can stop an Islamic regime from rising in, say, Algeria is not clear.
"The confrontation now is not nations against nations but rather nations against new situations," Mr. Peres said last week. "The subjects may have changed but not the cooperation."
William C. Harrop, the American Ambassador to Israel, said recently, "Reports of the death of the U.S.-Israeli special relationship are greatly exaggerated," adding that "there is no question" about the American commitment to maintain military aid and Israel's qualitative edge against its neighbors.
Former Defense Minister Moshe Arens echoed that point just before leaving office, saying that difficulties are to be expected but that "the foundations are very strong, and I can't see anything that would put cracks in the relationship."
Nonetheless, skeptics abound, and many of them are worried less about the United States' turning outright hostile than about its turning so far inward that it will have little time or patience for dabbling in messy places like the Middle East.
 
A Seminal Incident But Did It Happen?
A seminal incident for many Israelis may not have even occurred, but that does not diminish its impact here. This was a remark attributed to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who in a burst of irritation with American Jewish groups supposedly said something to the effect of "the heck with them -- they don't vote for us anyway."
Mr. Baker's spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, has dismissed the story as "garbage." But Israelis are convinced not only that it happened but also that it reveals a gut American weariness with the whole business -- Jews, Arabs and endless Middle East crises.
And the worst thing you can say to them, Israelis agree, is that they and their cousins in America do not count. If that were so, then Israel would be just another country of five million people.
"Israelis want to make sure that their case is at the top of the American agenda, and they feel that if they are ignored then it means they are being rejected," said Meron Benvenisti, a writer and expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "We rely so much on America and we rely on a level of tension, positive or negative. Indifference is the worst. People would prefer a confrontation to indifference."
The recent drip of mutual acrimony has prodded some Israelis, both in and out of Government, to start thinking about how to wean their country away from its longstanding reliance on $1.8 billion a year in American military assistance and $1.2 billion in economic aid. It has reached the point, they complain, that Israelis look upon this money as almost their birthright, and they call the dependence unhealthy.
This view is conspicuous among politicians and writers on the political right who sense that the Americans are bound to step up their pressure on Israel to give up the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and to freeze Jewish settlements there. As long as Israel keeps going to Washington with hat in hand, they argue, it will always be vulnerable.
"Economic independence means political independence," said Yisrael Harel, head of a West Bank settlers' group called the Council of Jewish Communities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza. Mr. Harel cites the success of East Asian countries like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, all of which he says were in the United States orbit but now have the financial muscle "to stand up to American dictates."
 
Overdependence Worries Some
Some on the left are also uncomfortable with their standing as a United States client. A liberal economist in Jerusalem, reacting recently to the State Department's "right of return" comments, muttered irritatedly to an American friend, "That's what happens when you depend on someone else the way we do."
Increasingly, politicians and academicians say Israel should turn more toward Europe. But few believe that the reliance on Washington is likely to change soon.
Meanwhile, other post-cold-war phenomena are making themselves felt, with even the benefits tempered by disadvantages.
Yes, the Middle East peace process is a good thing, say the Israelis, who today accepted the United States' invitation to resume the talks in Washington on Aug. 24. But their enthusiasm is controlled, for no one knows where it will end with the United States apparently intent on putting its land-for-peace principle into action.
If Palestinians become frustrated by a continued lack of clear progress in the negotiations, they might step up their anti-Israel uprising, some warn. And even Israeli doves who would give up the territories tomorrow worry about unavoidable national traumas if the country shrank back to the narrow strip of land it occupied before the 1967 Middle East war.
Yes, the Jews from Russia and elsewhere are welcome, and there is hopeful talk about how another million or more may eventually make their way here. This country exists, after all, for the in-gathering of all Jews.
 
Economic Ills Produce Friction
But that does not mean there are no frictions. Too many of the new arrivals have not found work in their professions, and that has scared off many of their brethren back home who are waiting for conditions to improve. In the meantime, unemployment here has hit 11.6 percent, an all-time high. So Israel finds itself with dissatisfied Russians, because they have no jobs, and dissatisfied longer-term residents, because the newcomers in their view get all the breaks, such as free housing and monthly stipends.
And yes, the immediate threat from neighboring Arab countries has diminished, but that is a far cry from its having disappeared, Israeli military planners say.
Mr. Arens warns that "the perceived threat" is still high. He argues that Iraq broke a psychological barrier when it fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel during the gulf war. It makes it easier for someone to try again the next time, he says.
Perhaps just as important, many Israelis now question the wisdom of their restraint in not retaliating against Iraq last year. It sent out the wrong message, they say -- that Israel is ready to absorb Arab punches and do nothing about it.
That perception alone could threaten future security, they say, and some quickly add that they sat on their hands at the request of the United States, all in the name of preserving a coalition that was the first major diplomatic achievement of the post-cold-war age.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Republicans' 'Electoral Lock' Is Looking Much Less Secure

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 2

 BODY:
There are many ways to measure President Bush's problems these days, but a glance at the political map may be the most telling: He is at risk of losing the Republicans' renowned "electoral lock."
For a generation, Republicans began most Presidential campaigns with the comforting knowledge that the South and much of the West were conservative bastions. This dominance of the Sun Belt, where more and more of the votes and the people are, gave the party an enormous edge in winning the White House -- what many analysts described as a lock on the Electoral College. 
 Now comes the 1992 election, and that Republican base looks decidedly shaky. In the South, a Democratic ticket headed by natives of Arkansas and Tennessee means that Mr. Bush will have to fight for part of that region, which was largely unnecessary when the Democratic nominees were Northern liberals.
At the same time, Mr. Bush faces a far greater danger in the West: California, which accounts for a fifth of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the Presidency, is slipping further and further out of Republican reach, in the view of some analysts. Moreover, in states like Texas that are crucial to Republican Presidential candidates, Mr. Bush continues to suffer repercussions from Ross Perot's canceled candidacy.
"I don't think it's going to be a laydown in Texas," said Fred Meyer, the Texas Republican chairman. "I think it's a fight in Texas. I think it's a fight everyplace."
In fact, while 1992 has repeatedly shown how quickly and fundamentally the polls can change, Mr. Bush now faces a dauntingly competitive map. When an incumbent Republican feels compelled to campaign frenetically, as Mr. Bush did last week in California's Orange County, the true-believing heart of Reagan country, the world has clearly changed.
Democrats, who have grown accustomed to predictions of their predetermined defeat, are quietly euphoric.
"Once you remove California from one side of the equation, the electoral lock collapses," said Stan Greenberg, the poll taker for Mr. Clinton. "If you look now at where Democrats have a base and Republicans have a base, it's almost comparable."
But Horace Busby, a former aide to Lyndon B. Johnson who has long analyzed the electoral lock, says reports of its demise may be premature. "You have to wait really until September to see what is happening," he said.
Indeed, any discussion of the electoral map in early August should begin with some caveats: Almost no one believes that Mr. Clinton will sustain for very long the double-digit lead that he has in many public-opinion polls, both nationally and in numerous states. In 1976, for example, Jimmy Carter left the Democratic convention with a 33-point lead over President Gerald Ford, but the actual election margin was far closer.
"You don't get any polls that mean anything in this race until a week after Labor Day," said Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign. Given that polls now show Mr. Bush running behind Mr. Clinton even in a state like Arizona, which has not voted for a Democrat since 1948, Mr. Black's skepticism is understandable.
Still, the dangers to Mr. Bush are apparent. Even before the Democratic convention and Mr. Clinton's surge, Mr. Bush was vulnerable in California. Four years ago, Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee whose campaign was hardly masterful, nevertheless came within 3.5 percentage points of carrying that state.
Today, the California economy is ailing, the political mood is angry, and Democratic strategists believe they finally see an anchor for a new Presidential majority. Add Washington and Oregon, which Mr. Dukakis carried in 1988, and Democrats could take 72 electoral votes on the West Coast.
The Field Poll that was made public last week showed Mr. Clinton leading Mr. Bush in California by an astonishing 62 percent to 28 percent and the Democratic nominee attracting the bulk of the people who had supported Mr. Perot. Again, such leads are widely regarded as ephemeral, but the President is clearly in trouble there.
"We know it's going to be a tough state," Mr. Black said, "but traditionally in California if you have a high-profile race between a conservative and a liberal, the conservative usually wins."
 
Republicans See Strongholds
 The Bush forces seem less frantic about other regions. Much of the Mountain West was a hotbed of Perotism, but is expected to return to the Republican fold.
Looking South, Mr. Bush's strategists say they are confident about holding that region, including the Florida and Texas (a total of 57 electoral votes), despite the Democrats' all-Southern ticket.
Republican anxiety about the South was higher during the heyday of Mr. Perot, who was widely expected to splinter the white vote, thus opening the way for a Democratic victory in several Southern states with a strong black vote. Warren Tompkins, a senior Bush consultant in the South, said, "I'd be less than candid if I said the Perot withdrawal didn't help us in the South."
Despite Mr. Clinton's efforts to campaign as a Southern moderate, Mr. Tompkins said he considered the Democratic nominee to be vulnerable on a range of social issues in the region, from his failure to serve in the military to his support for abortion rights. Such issues "galvanize the evangelical movement if we do our homework and plan our campaign appropriately," Mr. Tompkins said.
Still, Democrats say Mr. Bush will not walk away with the South without a fight, as Republicans have in the past. Besides the nominees' home states of Tennessee and Arkansas, Democrats say they have high hopes for Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina and Louisiana and are keeping careful watch elsewhere in the Deep South as well.
Even with a Southern ticket, the Democrats have a Northern base. While Mr. Clinton showed real weakness in New York and New England in the primary season, Democratic strategists say he has firmed up that base in recent weeks. For example, John Marino, chairman of the Democratic Party of New York, says, "We're in solid shape right now in this state." In New York, and elsewhere in the Northeast, the economy is the crucial issue.
 
Midwest Battleground
 All of these calculations set the stage for a fierce struggle in the industrial Midwest, particularly Illinois, Michigan and Ohio. "That's the most questionable area and the real battleground," said Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution.
Some of the outlines of the Bush strategy for this region are emerging. Republican efforts to cast Senator Al Gore as "an environmental extremist" are clearly aimed at the industrial Midwest.
The Republicans are also making a strong appeal for Catholic voters, an important bloc in both the Midwest and the Northeast. For example, Mr. Bush is highlighting a school choice proposal that would give students vouchers they could use to pay for parochial schools. And some Bush strategists argue that Mr. Clinton's strong support for abortion rights will also hurt him among Catholics.
But Mr. Greenberg, the Clinton poll taker, said Catholics were "the quintessential middle-class squeeze voters," implying that they might react well to Democratic promises to get the economy moving.
Campaigns make their decisions on targets -- where to direct money, resources and the candidate himself -- in stages. But the early calculations are clear. Mr. Clinton will be back in his bus this week, rolling through Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota. And Mr. Bush, who was just back from a campaign swing in California, was in Illinois today.
"In the dog days of summer, it's very easy to be attracted to the new candidate," Mr. Bush told a group of Republicans at a luncheon in Chicago.
Later in the day, at the 12th Annual Northwest Republican Family Picnic, he promised a tough fight against Mr. Clinton. "He's been on my case for six months," Mr. Bush said. "We are going to define him, and we are going to win the election."
As the map stands now, Mr. Bush will need every bit of his competitive edge.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
White Tilt To Balance A Project In Canarsie

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
A SCHOOL for 1,000 young Soviet emigres will open in Canarsie, Brooklyn, next month with two goals: to assimilate the students into American and Jewish culture and to persuade their parents to apply for apartments in the adjoining Starrett City housing development, which leased the school land for its new building.
"We're trying to attract a broader base, because otherwise you attract the one group that already lives in the surrounding area," said Robert C. Rosenberg, chairman of Starrett's management company. "The law does not say we cannot encourage diverse people by income and race to apply." 
 The school is the latest lure to white applicants as Starrett City tries to mitigate the United States Supreme Court's ruling that racial quotas to maintain integration at the development violated Federal law. The 1988 ruling was in response to the Reagan Administration's suit to overturn an agreement between civil rights advocates and Starrett that would have reserved a number of apartments there for some black and Hispanic applicants and found apartments for others elsewhere in New York City.
As that initial settlement demonstrated, many people are ambivalent about the cost of integration and the potential price of segregation. For years, the city's own Housing Authority steered black and Hispanic applicants from projects in predominantly white neighborhoods -- a practice it agreed to end this year in response to a legal challenge.
And the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development's management handbook cautions:
"Experience has demonstrated that the concentration of low-income families with similar serious problems tends to create an unstable social environment that in turn may breed crime and violence and drive out the more stable families."
Race, rather than class, is often the defining factor in that mix for many whites who tolerate integration so long as the racial balance does not tip against them. "White fears over tipping seem to be the most ominous factor and biggest deterrent to integration," Dr. Kenneth Clark, the sociologist, wrote in defense of Starrett's quota system.
Since the Supreme Court ruling, the number of whites among the 20,000 or so residents declined, from 62 percent to 50 percent. Blacks increased, from 25 percent to 35 percent. The proportion of Hispanic people edged up, from 9 percent to 11 percent.
"If it would continue in this trend it would invariably end up a totally minority community in five to eight years," Mr. Rosenberg said.
So what? What's wrong with a middle-income development that happens to have fewer and fewer white residents, particularly when maintaining a balance acceptable to whites means keeping some eligible blacks out?
"If the cities become totally minority," Mr. Rosenberg said, "they will have no support in Congress and will continue to decline.
"It's not in the nature of things in this country that services are provided equally," he said. "If you end up in a situation where the project becomes totally minority, historically what happens then is that the upwardly mobile black and Hispanic people also move out. In fact, they move out before the whites because they have already escaped from the ghetto once. Then the only ones moving in are the ones with the most severe economic and social problems. Then, once you start dealing with vandalism, you can't sustain the level of service."
Starrett City, which opened in 1974 and whose motto is "Where harmony is a way of life" -- has 46 buildings with nearly 6,000 apartments. Built with government help on the eastern edge of Canarsie, it provides more services than most developments do, inspired by altruism and by self-interest (maintaining the property's value for potential sales and conversion into cooperatives).
Management also hopes to invest in a major expansion -- competing for an adjoining site with the nonprofit Nehemiah project, which has successfully built tracts of affordable housing elsewhere and which may be offered space to construct at least several hundred homes there.
"It's a political decision," Mr. Rosenberg, a former city housing official, said. "If the Mayor and Borough President want us to accommodate them, we will."
Management hopes to accommodate its own goal of maintaining a successfully integrated community by luring more whites to the list of applicants and by expanding its base with thousands of new middle-income town houses, condominiums and cooperative apartments -- much like a central city might annex a suburb.
"We can't monkey with the list," Mr. Rosenberg said, "but there are ways to change demographics."

HEADLINE: LONG DELAY LIKELY IN REBUILDING PLAN FOR TIMES SQUARE

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Conceding that the moment has come and gone for the vast redevelopment of Times Square, state and city officials are close to postponing indefinitely the four giant office towers that were supposed to lead 42d Street to a new day but ended up victims of a devastated market.
Rather than hold the Times Square Center project to the current timetable, which would probably force construction of the first skyscraper to begin next year, officials are asking the developers to revitalize for retail and entertainment use the four sites where the towers were to rise. 
 The Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty acquired the development rights to the parcels from the state in exchange for guarantees that included agreement that construction would follow a precise schedule.
 
Governor Outlines Elements
 "It's obvious now that real estate is overdeveloped for the time being," Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said in a telephone interview yesterday, "and, therefore, it doesn't make sense to go forward immediately with the building of the office towers. There's no market for them. To hold these people to the contract is to ask them to commit an act of economic self-mutilation."
He said economic-development officials had, in effect, told the developers: "We'll allow you to wait for the market to get better. In return, we'd like you to accelerate the cleanup."
Most tenants have already been removed from the sites, along Broadway and Seventh Avenue between 41st and 43d Streets. Many of the existing buildings could be pressed into service again, although others might have to be razed.
Under the proposed overhaul of the plan, the developers would be able to proceed with the office towers when the market has improved. But that could be 3 to 10 years distant, if not more.
What they would get out of the deal, if they agreed to it, would be protection of the $180 million investment they have already made in condemnation awards to property owners whose land has been taken by the state, in addition to tens of millions of dollars in development costs. They would keep their claim on the sites and avoid a potential default.
"We want the buildings, but we don't want them empty," said Vincent Tese, chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corporation. "A default doesn't do us any good."
Times Square Center, as conceived, was the engine that was supposed to drive the rejuvenation of 42d Street. It was to have more than four million square feet of offices, equal to the floor area of four Chrysler Buildings. The problem is that since the deal was approved by the city's Board of Estimate in 1984, vacancy rates have soared in Manhattan, fueled by a construction boom followed by a recession.
State and city officials have been negotiating with the developers for several months and are apparently near agreement, although not all of the issues are resolved, including how much the developers would be required to invest in the revitalization project. However, Mr. Cuomo said that in general "there is no intention to relieve the developers of any obligation."
City officials, citing the confidentiality of negotiations in progress, declined to discuss the matter.
As part of the overhaul, the developers would not have to pay in advance for rebuilding the Times Square subway station, an amount that had been set at $91 million. At the outset, that would be left to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, with reimbursement to come eventually from the rental income of the office towers.
The developers, who are leasing the sites from the state, would continue to pay condemnation awards, which could cost them at least $60 million more than what they have already invested.
The developers would also contribute $18 million for the renovation of two historic playhouses: the Liberty Theater, 234 West 42d Street, and another house, probably the Victory Theater, 207 West 42d Street.
Efforts to "clean up" 42d Street, which is both a thriving commercial strip and a potent symbol of blight and crime, go back many years. The current plan includes Times Square Center, the renovation of nearby theaters and the construction of a wholesale trade mart and hotel on Eighth Avenue.
In 1982, Park Tower, headed by George Klein, and Prudential were designated as developers of the office towers. Their architects were Philip Johnson and John Burgee.
The largest building, on the site between 42d and 43d Streets where the Toffenetti's and Nathan's Famous restaurants operated for many years, was to have 56 stories and 1.5 million square feet of space.
Park Tower and Prudential were required to begin building one tower within a year of receiving the first sites from New York State in "vacant possession," that is, without tenants. This deadline would probably have been reached in September 1993. They would have had to complete the structure no later than September 1995, by which time they would also have had to start a second building.
 
Delay Was Sought
 About six months ago, Mr. Tese said, the developers approached officials in the hope of renegotiating.
"We told them we were amenable," he said, "except there were certain things that we wanted that were important to us and that ought to be important to them. We think we got spectacular results from a bad situation."
Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, a subsidiary of the state development agency, said, "The quid pro quo for not having to build is that you have to bring 42d Street back to life."
That is to be done according to a plan that would be devised over the next six months by architectural and retail consultants.
Under this new plan, for example, the Nathan's Famous building might be leased again, as might storefronts in the Longacre Building next door and in the Rialto Theater. Facades would be refurbished and new signs would be be added above them.
Tenants might include restaurants, jazz and supper clubs, snack bars, tourist-information offices, souvenir shops, music and book stores, newsstands and theaters where multimedia "spectaculars," geared to tourists might be presented.


GRAPHIC: FEBRUARY 1981 -- State and city officials announce the 42d Street redevelopment project, to include four office towers on Broadway and Seventh Avenue, the renovation of historic theaters and construction of a wholesale trade mart and a hotel on Eighth Avenue.
Chronology: "Chronology: Redeveloping Times Square"
APRIL 1982 -- Park Tower Realty and the Prudential Insurance Company of America are designated as developers of the office towers, known as Times Square Center. The architects, Philip Johnson and John Burgee, later present a design in which each tower is similar, except in size.
NOVEMBER 1984 -- The plan is approved by the city Board of Estimate.
AUGUST 1986 -- The law firm of Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood, which was to have been a large tenant at Times Square Center, withdraws from the project.
JUNE 1988 -- Leases and development agreements are signed between the city and state and the development team.
JULY 1988 -- The state begins the condemnation process, which is slowed considerably by some 50 lawsuits.
APRIL 1989 -- Chemical Bank, which was expected to be a prime tenant at Times Square Center, withdraws from the project.
AUGUST 1989 -- The design by Mr. Johnson and Mr. Burgee is revised to make each of the towers different.
NOVEMBER 1991 -- Reports surface that the developers are seeking a delay, but state officials insist the project will not have to be slowed.
JULY 1992 -- The state reports that 230 of the 267 tenants have been relocated from the project area. (pg. B2)

HEADLINE: On the Mexican Market, Doubt Replaces Demand

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 2

 BODY:
When values in the Mexico City stock market plunged in June on false rumors that telephone workers would sell their stake in the monopoly Telefonos de Mexico, company officials tried to tell investors that it had all been a big misunderstanding. But the stock continued to drop.
When the Mexican exchange tumbled again in early July as the cement giant Cementos Mexicanos S.A. took over a Spanish company without warning or much explanation, business executives here acknowledged that there was a lesson in the failure to communicate. But two weeks later, the Mexican company bought another Spanish cement maker, investors complained again, and the stock fell once more. 
 After three years in which foreign investors helped fuel spectacular growth in Mexico City's stock market, the Bolsa de Valores, their lust for Mexican equities has begun giving way to doubt and even some disaffection. Since June, the market has dropped nearly 20 percent.
Analysts attribute the sudden shift to disparate forces: a glut of new Mexican equities that has finally outstripped the demand; a retrenchment of big international investors as other foreign markets turned down; sluggishness in the Mexican economy; and the failure of Canadian, American and Mexican officials to conclude their negotiations for a North American free-trade agreement after more than a year.
Yet the Bolsa's latest problems have also exposed a clash of culture in the lucrative relationship between big Mexican companies and their new foreign shareholders.
For American retail investors whose Mexican stocks may be their first investments abroad, the country's politics are never quite as clear as its economic policies. Even to more experienced buyers, Mexican accounting procedures can look like quantum physics. And although reporting on Mexican companies has increased geometrically, openness is hardly a Mexican corporate trademark.
In the world of secretive, family-owned enterprise from which many of the Bolsa favorites have come, the term "investor relations" has often meant that the investors are also relations.
"In general, Mexican companies have not been accustomed to having their actions questioned by investors or seeing such strong reactions in the price," said Pablo Riveroll, research director at the Mexico City office of Baring Securities. "Most of these companies have been very closely held."
 
Correcting a Correction
 Blips in market values after the reporting of better-than-expected second-quarter earnings for companies including the telephone company, known as Telmex, and some optimism about the trade agreement were as close as the market has come to a rebound since its June drop. But some analysts described this as a correction of the earlier correction: with values down to around 11 times projected 1992 earnings, many buyers are long-term investors taking advantage of prices they do not expect to last.
A conclusion to the trade negotiation, expected within weeks, would be a boon, although such news might have to be balanced against Democratic Party challenges to the agreement and slower Mexican economic growth. Barring any big developments, many brokers and analysts predict the Bolsa will continue to move sideways for months.
It will also apparently have some time to digest. When the market ran into trouble, companies were lining up behind the country's biggest financial house, Banacci S.A., to place billions of dollars in stock. Now, brokers and Government officials say, the market is expected to make them wait at least until the fall.
In all, Mexican companies sold $4.8 billion of new stock last year. By the middle of this June, when the market tumbled, they had placed another $4.3 billion -- the equivalent of about 10 percent of the Bolsa's actively traded shares, or float. With roughly $12 billion in new bank equities sold over the same period, the issues amounted to 6.7 percent of Mexico's gross domestic product.
 
A Flood of Foreign Funds
 The flood of new money explains much of the market's new volatility. Three years ago, the Bolsa was familiar to few non-Mexican investors and was played almost solely by those with a refined taste for risk. But from $4.25 billion at the beginning of 1991, foreign money in the Bolsa leaped to $27.2 billion in May, and now accounts for about one-fifth of the market's capitalization and more than half its float.
Today, while the total capitalization is still only about $130 billion and almost one-third of that is in Telmex, the Bolsa is the eighth-largest exchange in the world. Suddenly, its investors range from huge European pension funds to skittish Midwestern retirees.
"In the past four months, a lot of very unsophisticated investors -- people who invest on the basis of headlines -- have put money into Mexico," said Jorge O. Mariscal, manager of Latin American equity research at Goldman, Sachs.
As more foreigners have rushed into the market, Mexican companies have allayed their concerns about insider trading and loose regulation. Company analysis has increased, and many firms that have been questioned in the past have done better at showing their finances and strategies to be sound.
But communication problems persist.
 
'The Culture Here Is Very Closed'
 While "el roadshow" has become part of Mexican business lexicon, for instance, skeptical foreign investors have sometimes turned such presentations into "bloodbaths," said Jacques Levy, executive vice president of Mexico's most successful brokerage, Banamex/Accival.
"It is a cultural problem," he added. "The culture here is very closed. People don't take your telephone calls. They don't speak well in public, even in Spanish."
The rumor that Telmex workers were moving en masse to sell their 4.4 percent stake in the company illustrated the confusion. A few hours after the stock began to plunge in New York, Telmex sent the head of the Bolsa, Manuel Robleda, onto the floor to read a letter from the president of the telephone workers' union, denying plans to sell. When that did not work, company executives tried a hastily arranged video teleconference with some investors in New York. But the stock fell again the next day, leading several analysts to conclude that the problem ran deeper.
For all the talk of learning experiences, though, the Telmex dust had barely settled when Cementos Mexicanos, known as Cemex, found itself in similar trouble. When Cemex began buying up big chunks of Compania Valenciana de Cementos Portland S.A., Cemex officials were unavailable to answer questions. Even after one newspaper report overstated the cost of the deal by $500 million, the company gave only a spotty explanation of its plans.
The market shuddered at the thought of a favorite Mexican company reaching too far afield, and Cemex's stock dropped 10 percent in a day. Only then did the company turn to public relations consultants and begin issuing statements to try to clarify the deal.
Pulled by Cemex, the market fell 3.9 percent that week.
 
'Meltdown Scenario'
 In the wake of the market's recent troubles, some analysts have found a prophet in President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's discreet chief of staff, Jose Cordoba Montoya. In a speech to the annual Bolsa convention weeks earlier, Mr. Cordoba had warned against weak-handed investors and excessive new issues.
But the Salinas Administration's hand has generally not been so cautionary. A sell-off by the Telmex union would have represented a placement of some $800 million in new stock just weeks after the Government had sold 500 million of its own shares on Mexican and foreign markets. And when Banacci presented its first global share offering with hopes of raising as much as $1.4 billion, the Finance Minister, Pedro Aspe Armella, was on hand at the New York roadshow in an unusual show of official support. (As the market fell, the banking and brokerage firm at first halved its offering from 220 million shares and then canceled it altogether.)
Many brokers and economists believe the Salinas Administration has also made the market jittery by overselling the benefits of a free-trade pact.
"They have created a lot of expectations in the investment community that if it goes through it's a great thing and if it does not it's a horrible thing," Mr. Mariscal said. "On the basis of fundamentals, it may matter very little."
In the longer term, the flow of capital out of Mexico has refocused attention on what one broker in Mexico called "the meltdown scenario."
With the current account deficit at $11.9 billion last year, imports rising more quickly than the Government had hoped, and two-thirds of the $13 billion of foreign capital inflows last year going into portfolio investments, many economists have worried that money could move out of the economy much faster than imports could be stemmed. One Government economist called the estimated $1 billion to $2 billion that fled Mexico "the first real warning that we cannot rely only on speculative inflows."
Some economists were reassured by the momentary dearth of buyers for Telmex and other stocks, concluding there were limits to how fast money can flow out of the country. Emilio Icaza, director of research at the brokerage G.B.M., noted that the danger of money flowing out of Mexico through the stock market has also receded because so much trading in Mexican stocks is now done abroad and in dollars.
But in the coming years, Mexico's economic stability will depend on the more complicated transition from speculative money to greater savings and direct investment.
In that shift, a regional free-trade agreement is expected to be critical. After a trade accord is signed, Government officials say they will promulgate rules to encourage foreign investment, complementing changes that are already being made in mining, fishing and agriculture. The Government also established a new pension-fund system to encourage domestic savings.
"What Salinas is doing is correct," said Jonathan E. Heath, chief economist at Macro Asesoria Economica, a Mexico City consulting firm. "The question is: Will it be enough?"

HEADLINE: Japan Buys Too Few Chips, U.S. Finds

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
The United States has concluded that Japan's efforts to open its semiconductor chip market to American exports are inadequate so far, but will not impose immediate sanctions, American officials said over the weekend.
In an agreement reached a year ago, the Japanese Government supported the American industry's goal of having foreign companies account for 20 percent of all chip sales in Japan by the end of 1992. The agreement, however, specified no penalties if the target was not met. 
 The foreign share, almost all of it American, has hovered between 14 and 15 percent for the last year. The lack of increase prompted the Office of the United States Trade Representative to announce on May 27 that it would review progress in the agreement by Aug. 1.
The review is now virtually complete and is scheduled for release this week, probably on Monday. The final report is critical of Japan but does not call for the United States to retaliate against Japanese exports, American officials said.
Japan blames weak economic growth for the stagnation in the foreign share of the chip market, saying the weakness has made electronics companies reluctant to do business with new suppliers. But that is a new argument, complained Daryl G. Hatano, the director of international trade and government affairs at the Semiconductor Industry Association, an American group.
Mr. Hatano said in an interview today that until recently the Japanese electronics industry had been blaming a quickly growing market for the low market share of foreign chip makers. Japanese officials used to contend that with the market in their country growing 10 percent a year American companies would have to increase their sales in Japan by 20 or 30 percent to increase market share, Mr. Hatano said.
According to the industry association, which is based in San Jose, Calif., Japan bought 47 percent of the $54.6 billion worth of semiconductors produced worldwide last year. Japanese companies accounted for 86 percent of the sales there, while American semiconductor companies had 12 percent of the Japanese market and companies from other countries had 2 percent.
In the United States market, meanwhile, American companies had a 70 percent share, Japanese semiconductor companies had 20 percent and other companies had 10 percent, according to the industry association.
Japanese officials have also sought in recent months to change the calculations to include all semiconductor shipments to Japan by the International Business Machines Corporation. Until recently, I.B.M. shipped chips to Japan only for inclusion in computers that it builds there. The agreement excludes wholly owned subsidiaries that do assembly work with imported chips, but does include subsidiaries that function as trading companies.
I.B.M.'s subsidiary has now begun selling chips to other manufacturers in Asia, including Hyundai in Korea, but in small quantities. American officials say these chips can be included in the foreign-market-share calculation, but are too small to matter and do not mean that I.B.M.'s operation in Japan now qualifies as a trading company.
By contrast, if all of I.B.M.'s shipments were included, the foreign market share would rise by up to two percentage points.

Japan Opposes U.S. Bill
 TOKYO, Aug. 2 (Reuters) -- Tokyo will appeal to the Gevena secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if "protectionist" American legislation raising tariffs on mini-vans and sport utility vehicles becomes law, Japanese newspapers reported today.
The House of Representatives passed a bill on Friday that would reclassify some mini-vans and utility vehicles as trucks, subjecting them to a tenfold increase in import duties. The bill now goes to the Senate.
"This is clearly in violation of GATT," Asahi Shimbun quoted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry as saying, referring to the world body that governs free trade. The report noted that because European cars were effectively excluded, the legislation was clearly aimed at Japan.
The bill includes two exemptions that could exclude European mini-vans, like those made by Volkswagen, that have been imported since 1963 and vehicles with sales of less than 10,000 a year, like Britain's Range Rover.
The Bush Administration opposes the mini-van reclassification on the grounds that it would raise costs to consumers, could be seen as a violation of GATT and could result in retaliation against American exports. On Thursday, President Bush threatened to veto the bill.

After Riots, A Paradise Lost for Advertisers

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Three months after riots rocked Los Angeles, Southern California advertisers are slowly coming to grips with the psychic damage to consumers. Many ad agency executives are trying to soft-pedal the city's uneasiness. A few are trying to exploit it. And some, by coincidence, are soothing frayed nerves with campaigns planned well in advance of the riots.
Images of Los Angeles seen throughout the United States and the world are also due for revision. For example, the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau will roll out a $25 million to $30 million marketing campaign next year to help the city's recession-wracked tourist industry, which has been depressed even more by recent earthquakes as well as the deadly racial disorders and their aftermath. 
 But for now, the immediate target of post-riot advertising is local consumers.
 
'Tomorrow Will Be Better'
 Some campaigns conceived months before the riots erupted, like Pacific Bell's "Perfection" television spots by Foote, Cone & Belding, attracted considerable attention in their wake. A series of images of Californians improving themselves, "Perfection" is interlaced with eerily comforting lines like: "To the outside world, we appear lucky just to survive" and "It's just another day in California. Tomorrow will be better."
The campaign was scheduled to start production around April 29, the day the riots began, when Pacific Bell's advertising director, Allen Olivio, conferred with Foote, Cone.
"Given increased sensitivity," he said, "we wanted to make sure we weren't going to be insulting with the idea of continuous improvement and the notion of achievable perfection." After a few days, Mr. Olivio decided that Los Angeles was beginning to regain its balance and production went ahead unchanged.
Many Los Angeles advertising executives consider product advertising to be an inappropriate venue for responding to social unrest -- nothwithstanding the sportswear maker Benetton's billboard of a burning car, which was taken down in Los Angeles after the riots.
Some advertising executives said ads like the Benetton billboard could easily be misunderstood. "The possibility of messages being misperceived as insulting or offensive is great," said Jo Muse, chairman of Muse Cordero Chen in Los Angeles, which specializes in advertising to black, Asian and Hispanic consumers. "Even advertising that tries to accomplish social good, that is altruistic, will sometimes be misunderstood in the area of advertising."
On the other hand, Mendelsohn/ Zien Advertising chose to create a campaign for Wok Fast, a food-delivery company, that dealt directly, and flippantly, with the tensions in Los Angeles. In late June, a billboard was put up in West Los Angeles with a picture of Daryl F. Gates, the Los Angeles Police Chief who had to be pressured into retiring after the riots. The caption on the billboard read: "When you can't leave the office. Or won't. Great Chinese food delivered."
Initially, the agency's president, Richard Zien, figured that the publicity for the chain would outweigh the risk of legal action by the former chief. But by mid-July, Mr. Gates had threatened to sue. So, Mr. Zien said, "we agreed to take it down because our mission was accomplished."
In contrast, a few Los Angeles ad agencies are proposing campaigns to connect consumers with Rebuild L.A., a local business organization that was formed after the riots. Farada Fotouhi, president of Fotouhi Alonso, said she was urging clients to tell consumers that a percentage of their purchases would go toward product donations to Rebuild L.A.
"If a company positions itself as socially active, that encourages consumers, particularly those who want to help, to buy from that company," she said, adding that several clients are considering her proposal.
Beyond the West Coast, consumers are likely to see an alteration of the classic fun-in-the-sun image of Los Angeles, which now no longer seems to fit the city.
"In the past, not just Los Angeles but California had this mystique to it that a lot of advertisers drew upon," said Bob Wolf, chief executive of North America for Chiat/Day/Mojo in Los Angeles. "We've done one that tried to capture it -- a California Cooler campaign with the 60's thing, making coolers on the beach. But I think advertisers will be wary of using that currency again."
 
'Finding a Comfortable Area'
 Advertising executives are gradually trying to create new positive images for Los Angeles. "They're finding a comfortable area where they can mirror those interests in the American lexicon without making people mad," Mr. Muse said. "For instance, a lot has been said about the new street-wear designers -- I could see an ad with two young black guys having a clothing company."
Still, while local advertising executives are sensitive to the recent shocks dealt consumers, some believe that the recession remains a much more important factor in advertising. "Price and value will continue to dominate," predicted Phil Joanou, chairman and chief executive of Dailey & Associates.
As for rebuilding confidence in Los Angeles, he said, "What is required more than advertising is some political leadership."
For Howie Cohen, chairman and creative director of Cohen/Johnson in Los Angeles, price-and-value ads are themselves socially redeeming. "They work," he said. "They move stuff. Those able to lift their heads above the debris will be those who are able to help the suffering. I'm not unique in saying I care and I feel, but I also know I need to keep business going for those who depend on me."

HEADLINE: Job-Ad Index Eased in June

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
An index of help-wanted advertising edged lower in June, the Conference Board said yesterday, indicating that wary employers had held back on hiring.
The seasonally adjusted index fell to 92 in June, one point below May's revised level of 93, the business research group said in its monthly report. The June 1991 figure was 96. 
 "We're at a standstill: while labor-market indicators are not declining, they are showing very few signs of improvement," said a Conference Board economist, Ken Goldstein.
 The unemployment rate reached an eight-year high of 7.8 percent in June. July's jobless rate is to be reported on Friday, and economists expect only slight improvement.
The rise in the May and June unemployment rates hurt consumer confidence, but the real labor market problem is "the lack of any substantial and sustained improvement," Mr. Goldstein said.
Advertising volume rose in four regions and declined in five, the report said. The New England region's 8.4 percent gain was the largest. Steepest declines were registered by the West North Central region, down 10 percent, and the West South Central area, off 8.6 percent.
 The board monitors help-wanted advertising volume in 51 leading newspapers across the country.

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief's Dispute With Council Boils Over

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 30

 BODY:
The peacemakers who run the United Nations are fighting again.
Not since the days of Dag Hammarskjold, the Secretary General from Sweden, who locked horns three decades ago with the Soviet delegation over policy on the Congo, have the Security Council's permanent members been confronted with a Secretary General so determined to shape the international organization. 
 The French press has called the dispute "la petite guerre" because the diplomats here have been, at moments, so undiplomatic.
 
The Limits of Diplomacy
 "You have to be a diplomat at certain times and at certain times you have not to be a diplomat," said Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former Egyptian Foreign Ministry official who took over as Secretary General from Javier Perez de Cuellar in January.
"Certain facts have to be said," he insisted.
The dispute, which had been building all year, broke into the open in mid-July. The Council and the Secretary General had pointed differences over how to stop the killing in fractured Yugoslavia and how to save millions of starving people in Somalia, where civil war has led to famine. Mr. Boutros-Ghali challenged the Security Council's decision to expand the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Yugoslavia if this was to occur at the expense of urgently needed peacekeeping and relief operations in black Africa.
Both sides compromised, but the dispute has festered and at times has erupted into a collision of cultures between the Secretary General, who feels compelled to speak for the less powerful nations of the third world, and the Western powers that dominate the Security Council.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali, the sixth man to hold the top peacemaking job and the first from an Arab country, Egypt, and from the African continent, sees the dispute as a clash between the "colonial" powers of Europe and the desperate and often neglected developing world.
 
Discord in Crucial Period
 The episode is producing an unusual degree of disharmony at a time when the United Nations is more heavily engaged around the world than at any other time in its 47-year history. It has caused bitter and personal recriminations, aborted a sensitive United Nations dialogue with Libya last week and injected a level of discord that could further disrupt and delay critical Security Council decisions, a number of United Nations officials and diplomats said.
The United Nations has major operations in Cambodia, Iraq, the Western Sahara and now in what was Yugoslavia. It is also involved in longstanding operations in Cyprus and Lebanon and is undertaking new efforts in Somalia and South Africa.
All of these have deepened the financial crisis brought on by the $2 billion in arrears from donor nations, including $800 million that the United States has not paid.
One Western diplomat has described the Secretary General's recent actions as "petulant," "inflexible" and "disingenuous." Others have faulted him for being prickly, "arrogant" and "aloof."
Mr. Boutros-Ghali was no less blunt, pointing out that the Security Council had for the most part acceded to his views on Yugoslavia and Somalia. He bristled at the criticism he has received recently in the British press and wondered aloud in an interview on Thursday if it was "maybe because I'm a wog," using the 19th-century British pejorative for colonial subjects.
His characterizations stunned United Nations officials, who avoid even the hint of ethnic epithet. Sir Brian Urquhart, the longtime United Nations Under Secretary who is now at the Ford Foundation, could only gasp on hearing Mr. Boutros-Ghali's reference to the possible "wog" factor: "My my . . . dear me. . . ."
 
A Longing for Yesteryear
 A French diplomat lamented that in the days of Mr. Perez de Cuellar the Secretary General was "more consensual" and "when the Council wanted something, the Secretary General was at their disposal." Indeed, many missions have been surprised by what some view as Mr. Boutros-Ghali's imperious and mercurial style.
The Secretary General often goes over the heads of delegates to deal directly with their Foreign Ministry bosses. Adding to an image of aloofness, he seldom shows up for informal meetings of the Security Council because, he said, of the crushing workload that has been placed on the Secretariat to streamline the organization and run proliferating peacekeeping operations.
The Secretary General, the French diplomat added, "has his own personality and we cannot expect him to act and to react as his predecessor." But, he concluded, "if this kind of relationship continues, I don't think it is favorable for anyone."
The stress of Mr. Boutros-Ghali's first seven months was apparent in the interview. The normally relaxed and witty 69-year-old Egyptian scholar, most famous for having been at the side of President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt when he flew to Jerusalem in 1977, fidgeted with a bundle of pencils in front of him as he sat at the felt-covered conference table in the cavernous Secretary General's suite on the 38th floor of what Mr. Boutros-Ghali calls "this house."
 
Some Blunt Talk
 In assailing his critics, he lapsed at times from the high language of pin stripes to seething denunciations. On several occasions he ordered a reporter to turn off a tape recorder so he could answer more bluntly. Pointing to the machine, he snapped, "Please stop it," before responding to what he said was "another lie."
Speaking in English in which Arabic and French accents blended, he acknowledged that, at times, his behavior had been less than diplomatic, but he said that was not the problem.
"The problem is, one, the ego of certain members of the Security Council are accustomed to being treated in a certain way. Secondly, because maybe I don't spend enough time with them, certainly this is the second reason. But the simple explanation is high policy -- the policy of the states."
He further explained, saying: "When a country is in difficulty with its public opinion concerning what to do in Yugoslavia, or when there are other problems, they are a monster. They will not hesitate to find the body to accuse him of all the sins."
Asked if he meant that too many countries were hoisting their problems and frustrations onto the United Nations, he said, "Certainly, to the Secretary General, to the U.N." He suggested that a combination of what he termed "Europecentrism" and the inability of third world nations to address their economic and social ills was the greatest obstacle to building an effective United Nations program for the future.
 
'So Many Problems'
 "The real problem of the next 10 years will be mainly in the countries of the third world," he said, "and the problems of the third world is not only the military confrontations, but the problem of refugees, hunger, drought. So many problems."
But he added: "If we continue to get involved in Yugoslavia, this will be at the expense of the other activity of the house. At a certain time, we must say, 'Stop.' "
With the perennial shortage of cash, Mr. Boutros-Ghali warned in May that "our plate is full," and that any new peacekeeping responsibilities would have to come at the expense of other urgently needed relief and peacekeeping efforts.
Then, on July 17, the Security Council, with Mr. Boutros-Ghali absent, accepted a cease-fire accord for Yugoslavia hammered out by Lord Carrington of Britain and a European Community team of negotiators in London. The accord, which failed to stop the fighting, would have placed a significant burden on the United Nations by sending its forces into the combat zone to locate and collect the dueling artillery batteries in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
When Mr. Boutros-Ghali learned of the Security Council's action, he objected, arguing that collecting the guns would take three months and 1,100 men. He also feared that such actions would draw United Nations forces into a what he termed "a new Vietnam" that would strain United Nations resources at a time when they were needed elsewhere, particularly in Somalia, where a quarter of the population of 4.5 million to 6 million is facing death from famine this summer.
"I believe it is my duty to put the minimum pressure on the Europeans to say, 'Try to do something,' " he said. When the French military Chief of Staff told him that French and other European military forces could complete the artillery survey in Yugoslavia in three days, Mr. Boutros-Ghali seized on this assertion to put more pressure on the European powers to take part in bringing peace to their own region.
The United Nations Charter, Mr. Boutros-Ghali has become fond of saying, states that "the regional organizations" like the European Community and the Western European Union "are at the service of the United Nations, not that the United Nations is at the service of the regional organizations."
Sir Brian said he thought the Secretary General was right to be upset over how the London accord was handled. "You cannot suddenly tell a guy who is responsible for a peacekeeping operation that you are going to add an enormous burden to a group that is hopelessly overstressed," he said.
 
'Under Great Pressure'
 At the same time, Sir Brian added that he thought it "very odd" for the Secretary General to "widen the issue" by accusing the Council of being Eurocentric.
"I think he is under great pressure," he said, adding, "The European efforts to deal with Yugoslavia have been hopeless and it may be useful for them to blame the U.N. if nothing is happening."
There was more than a hint of scorn in Mr. Boutros-Ghali's voice over Lord Carrington's refusal to go to Sarajevo to try to wring a lasting cease-fire accord out of the warring factions. He contrasted the talks held at a safe distance in London with the willingness of Cyrus R. Vance, the former American Secretary of State, to conduct negotiations where the fighting was taking place.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali said that when Lord Carrington's accord collapsed, the Europeans "just threw the ball" to the United Nations
 
'Backstabbing' Politics
 One United Nations diplomat, defending the Secretary General, sneered at the "backstabbing" politics of the Security Council and wondered why the Europeans could not take on some of the military burden.
"Of course they are worried about their boys being killed, so they would rather have Fijians do it for them," the diplomat said, referring to the Fijian contingent among United Nations peacekeeping forces.
By all accounts, in pouncing on Lord Carrington's handiwork Mr. Boutros-Ghali not only angered the former British Foreign Minister, but also embarrassed Sir David Hannay, the British representative at the United Nations, who had pushed the London accord through the Security Council in the Secretary General's absence.
Western diplomats point out that the Mr. Boutros-Ghali had two representatives in the chamber when the Council acted and must therefore share the blame for the failure of coordination and communication.
Western officials also said that despite the eloquence of Mr. Boutros-Ghali on behalf of Somali famine victims, he had been slow to recognize that the staff member he put in charge of the negotiations was not up to the task and only belatedly removed him.
Despite the problems, the Secretary General predicted that his "controversy" with the Security Council would pass.
"This is quite exaggerated," he said of the dispute, "and I will say it is healthy."
He admonished a reporter at the end of the interview not to "provoke" or strain his relationship with the Security Council further because, he said, "it is my job to be provocative."

Black Church Links Suburbs and New York City

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

DATELINE: SPARKILL, N.Y.

 BODY:
IN an old stone church here, a small congregation is setting out to show the world that the walls separating blacks in suburbia from those in the city can come tumbling down.
The parishioners of the St. Charles African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church used to anguish over youths caught up in street violence. They lamented the lack of role models. Then they would retreat into their comfortable homes in this Rockland County community, where the pond is laced with duckweed and everyone turns out for potluck dinners and the annual Shad Fest on the church grounds. 
 It took the riots in Los Angeles and later the disturbances in Washington Heights, they say, to shake up their congregation, composed mainly of middle-class professionals, educators and retirees. The 130 church members stopped talking about what they thought needed to be done and moved into action.
Every weekday morning now, a dark-blue church van rumbles across the George Washington Bridge into the heart of Harlem to pick up homeless children housed in a shelter run by the Abyssinian Baptist Church. Their destination: a day-camp program called "Reach Out Suburbia."
"It just gives them another perch from which to think about their world," said Clarence Branch Jr., the chairman of the St. Charles trustee board and a high school science teacher. On a recent afternoon, he led some young charges across a rushing creek on a nature study.
"There's an obvious need for people of different backgrounds, races, ethnic and economic groups to get to know each other better," said Mr. Branch. "We're walled off in these communities and this isolation prevents people from seeing that we can get along."
Church officials hope their program will serve as a model for other black churches and organizations in suburban communities. It is long overdue in the view of the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church. "They are doing something that very few black families in the suburban communities are willing to do," Mr. Butts said. "It's a marvelous gesture on the part of the people of Rockland County. It gives youngsters another perspective of how African Americans live."
As part of the program, the children are welcomed into the homes of church members like Albert and Jacqueline Holland, who recently had a swimming-pool party for the children at their cooperative complex.
Mr. Holland, a lawyer who grew up as a teen-ager in Harlem, said he had always wanted to give back something to the community where he once lived. "This shows what the other side is doing and gives them something to aim for," he said.
Corey Walcott, a wiry boy of 12, said movies and television had taught him that only whites seem to have the nice things in life. He said his perception is changing every day with his trips to Rockland County. "When you see people like us who've got something like this, it makes you feel good," he said. "When I grow up, I want to have the same thing."
Frances Pierson, 77 years old, who is described as the church matriarch, said she hoped the experience would teach the children more about a sense of community than about material success. "Everybody belongs to everybody," she said. "That is what we want to impart. We hope what they see and hear will have a positive influence over their thoughts and maybe change some attitudes."
The program accommodates 20 children who are 12 years old or under. Parishioners said they intended to keep track of the youths into adulthood as the program continues to grow. For now, church officials say, the program is fueled on church money and faith, but in fact there is more because this is a savvy church flock.
Some of the most influential leaders in the city were sought out to insure the modest proposal takes hold. The program got the blessing of Mr. Butts, whose church is a flagship institution in Harlem and whose endorsement may later lead to corporate financing.
Mayor David N. Dinkins also wished the church well.
The program also has won acceptance from parents like Lashe Walcott, who watched from the sidewalk in Harlem as the church van picked up her two children, ages 12 and 9.
The 28-year-old mother said she could not imagine what Rockland County was like, but she was relieved that her children were heading out of a neighborhood where some people called them "bums."
"If you let them stay out here, they'll eventually think the streets are what it's all about," she said. "Maybe that's what they might want for their kids when they get older, to live in the suburbs."

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Risks and Hopes of Salzburg's New Face

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALZBURG, Austria, July 31

 BODY:
It is no accident that during his first week as artistic director of the Salzburg Festival, Gerard A. Mortier programmed two works about Roman emperors and the exercise of power: Mozart's opera "La Clemenza di Tito" and Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar." The first showed the pains of power, the second its nearly insurmountable dangers. Mr. Mortier will have reason to get to know both; there are more than enough people in town who seem to be showing that lean and hungry look.
But Mr. Mortier is too acutely aware of the importance of signs and portents in artistic governance to ignore the risks. The Salzburg Festival has always dealt in symbols of authority, from the way its founders in the 1920's used a series of musical and dramatic morality tales -- "Everyman," "Faust" and "Don Giovanni" -- to emphasize the spiritual ground of Austrian and German art, to the way the festival concert halls use the ancient rock cliff that towers over the town as foundation and backdrop. Mr. Mortier just has a different set of symbols. His first season, to run until the end of August, is a declaration of independence from the previous regime, which lasted 30 years under the firm control of Herbert von Karajan. Mr. Mortier has moved quickly and decisively. For some, that is the problem. 
 It is estimated, for example, that 20 percent of the old guard supporters have dropped out. There are hotels in town that have gone out of their way to discourage ticket purchases. It is also possible to find a vacant hotel room and, on occasion, even buy a ticket to a festival event, outlandish for Salzburg. And there is some muted caution among record companies: Mr. Mortier has said that Salzburg opera productions will no longer be coordinated with the release of recordings. He has even suggested that there might be a better way for the companies to spend the estimated $10 million they allot for publicity and posters and press conferences at the festival. There have also been unprecedented withdrawals by major stars: Riccardo Muti and Marilyn Horne over artistic disagreements, Jessye Norman because she is canceling her European tour.
The stakes are enormous. This festival is the world's largest, and Karajan ran it like a fief: the native son exercising his divine right. Because of his influence, record companies came to this town where Mozart was born, paying stores to display their posters, stroking their artists. An extraordinary network with Karajan at its center spread through the music world from Salzburg; it included major managers in New York (Ronald Wilford) and Paris (Michael Glotz), close relations with video and electronics companies (Telemondial and Sony) and recording companies (Deutsche Grammophon and EMI), contractual arrangements with two of the most distinguished orchestras in the world (the Berlin and Vienna Philharmonics), the ability to draw stars and a wealthy audience and have them each bask in the glow of the other.
In 1990, the Austrian Government estimated that the festival brought 2.2 billion schillings, or $220 million, into the national economy; $70 million was spent directly by visitors to Salzburg. The private jets and high-priced tickets, the lines of stargazers in front of the Festspielhaus, the opera productions that had their premieres in conjunction with new recordings by the same casts: all that was due to Karajan's influence. When Wilhelm Furtwangler died in 1954, the choice of his successor as conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic was so obvious that Karajan was sent a telegram by a supporter: "The King is dead. Long live the King." When Karajan died in 1989, Mr. Wilford, the president of Columbia Artists Management, himself no minor player in what Karajan once called "the game of the powerful," said that now the proper proclamation would be "God save the Republic."
As with Shakespeare's Caesar, the ruler had no heir. At a news conference on Thursday, a spokesman for the Vienna Philharmonic, Werner Resel, noted the end of an era of Kultifiguren -- cult figures -- who dominated music; who of Karajan's stature, with his business sense and artistic appeal, could run the festival? Something had to change. There had even been increasing unhappiness with Karajan's reign, complaints about cliquishness and stolidity. In fact, the search for a successor began a year before Karajan's death.
Enter Mr. Mortier. According to Hans Landesmann, appointed by the Government to head a search committee for a new artistic director, Mr. Mortier, the director of the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie in Belgium, was chosen because he "represented the most obvious change," the greatest contrast with Karajan. Beginning with a career in public relations, then working with the Flanders Festival and as administrative assistant to the conductor Christoph von Dohnanyi in Frankfurt and Hamburg, Mr. Mortier's reputation rests on a decade of work in Brussels. In opera, he emphasized production, design and dramatic direction. He admired such contemporary composers as Pierre Boulez and proselytized for neglected repertory, selling out 35 performances of "Lulu" and "Wozzeck" and drawing attention to the operas of Janacek.
Mr. Mortier arrived in Salzburg to interview for the festival position just after Karajan's death and took office in September 1991 in a completely revised administrative structure; an attempt, again, to alter the character of the festival. It is now run by three directors: a local Salzburger, Heinrich Wiesmuller, as president; Mr. Landesmann as financial officer and programmer of the concert series, and Mr. Mortier with the title of intendant. All have six-year contracts and theoretically share responsibility; they are answerable to a board that includes four government officials from the city, state and national governments, and one local representative of the Salzburg tourist board.
Mr. Mortier, 48 years old, has no illusions about the difficulties of the tasks before him. Not only is he an outsider in a town loyal to insiders, he is also unraveling traditions that many local people, ranging from hotel owners to high-society types, have found effective. But he takes pains to acknowledge the achievements of Karajan, praising him, not burying him: "I was a great fan of the festival during the 60's," he said, "a great lover of Karajan. But in the 80's he didn't care as much." The festival became increasingly commercialized, the local audiences less involved.
His plans are ambitious. As he said in an interview, he wants to move the festival away from its origins: "When the Salzburg Festival began, there was only Bayreuth. Now there are hundreds of musical festivals. Salzburg must distinguish itself."
Mr. Mortier would keep Mozart -- that disenchanted Salzburger -- at the festival's heart but would move Shakespeare into Goethe's place. He wants the festival to be a celebration of European culture and, with the inclusion of the United States, of Western culture. This year France has a major presence with Messiaen and Debussy. Next year there will be an Italian accent with Verdi's "Falstaff" and "Giovanna d'Arco," with Monteverdi's "Orfeo" (conducted by Rene Jacobs) and "Poppea" (led by Nikolaus Harnoncourt), along with presentations of works by Luigi Nono. There is also a look toward Eastern Europe, with Janacek this year and Bartok and Ligeti next.
This cosmopolitan perspective is also meant to treat the 20th century as part of the mainstream European tradition. Mr. Mortier will have composers in residence, like Mr. Boulez this year. In opera, Mr. Mortier plans more Janacek, a "Rake's Progress" (possibly directed by Peter Sellars), "Lulu," "Pelleas" and "Moses und Aron." He has talked, too, about giving operas that have had recent premieres their second major productions.
This is radically different from the traditional Salzburg festival, though in drama, Mr. Mortier plans to return to the festival's early interests, when the German director Max Reinhardt had a central role in its founding and planning. Last year plays accounted for 12,000 tickets out of the 200,000 available for all festival events; this year they amount to 25,000; next year the number will more than double to 58,000. Mr. Mortier hired the German director Peter Stein as manager of theater productions.
The biggest challenge will be marketing the festival: new -- and wealthy -- audiences will have to be found. "My most difficult season," Mr. Mortier said, "will be the next one." He has begun the changes by establishing one-week subscriptions to events, with 2,400 sold this season; people under 25 can subscribe at half price thanks to donations by corporate sponsors. Contemporary music is often being marketed in separate categories at different prices. The problem is that ticket sales in 1990 provided about 46 percent of the festival's $48.2 million of income; prices range up to $360. And the audience that is able and eager to pay those sums may be looking for something quite different from what Mr. Mortier is planning.
The president of Deutsche Grammophon, Andreas Holschneider, sees a fundamental shift in the festival's emphasis: "It is now more on the message than on the star." This is bound to affect the recording business in Salzburg. Deutsche Grammophon, as the first company to open an office at the festival, 25 years ago, is not overly concerned; stars will, of course, still be required. But ultimately, Mr. Holschneider noted, "all companies will have to think over whether their presence and exposure in Salzburg is really in the line of the new festival."
The audiences are also thinking things over. Count Johannes Walderdorff, who was a close friend of Karajan (he was one of the few people at the private funeral) and oversees the Salzburg social scene as proprietor of the Goldener Hirsch Hotel, is optimistic but guarded. Some of his clientele have balked, others are intrigued. In response to demand from new donors to the festival, for example, an additional performance of "Salome" was added for the end of August.
At performances I attended this week, audience response was committed and justly enthusiastic. The baritone Dmitri Khvorostovsky gave a virile, nuanced recital of Russian song. Mr. Dohnanyi conducted the Cleveland Orchestra in a witty performance of Weill's "Sieben Todsunden" (with Anja Silja as soloist). And many performances of Mr. Stein's "Julius Caeser" ended with standing ovations.
In the meantime, there is a lot of breath-holding in town. Mr. Mortier must walk a fine line, finding a role for the festival without allowing it to become a center for another variety of esthetic fashion; courting new audiences without losing the old; altering the tradition without losing its weight. Mr. Mortier, during a conversation, pointed to the logo of the festival, a Greek mask behind a draped flag and an image of the town's famous Hohensalzburg fortress. "It is a little Fascistic, no?" he asked. "But it can be changed later. Everything a little bit at a time." Mr. Mortier, who must answer to both higher and lower powers, is not about to underestimate the power of symbols. He must find a way, in the midst of his artistic transformations, to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's.

HEADLINE: Let's Contain the Supercollider

 BODY:
The superconducting supercollider, an enormous and costly instrument for probing the structure of matter, poses a stark issue for the Senate today:
Should the nation, faced with recession and budget deficits, continue to build an $8-billion machine to explore scientific questions that are of great intellectual interest but may have little practical payoff? Or should it write off the $1 billion spent so far and terminate the project? 
 The House voted in June to cancel the project as unaffordable. But President Bush traveled to the construction site in voter-rich Texas last week to declare support for "one of the greatest scientific projects in the entire world." The Senate is expected to approve further funding today, setting the scene for a showdown with the House over whose view will prevail.
On the merits, the mammoth machine is worth building -- provided it can be financed without robbing a host of other vital scientific projects.
The supercollider will be a huge underground instrument, 54 miles in circumference. It will accelerate two beams of protons in opposite directions around a giant ring lined with magnets. When the protons smash together, they will release showers of debris from which scientists hope to divine a deeper understanding of the fundamental forces and particles that shape the universe.
Unlike the controversial space station, which is primarily an engineering feat, the supercollider is at the cutting edge of research in two important fields. It is a key to further advance in high-energy physics, which seeks to find the most elementary particles and forces from which everything else is made. And its findings will shed light on events at the very creation of the universe, the domain of cosmology.
Even critics don't quibble that the supercollider will perform good science. But its relative importance remains in dispute. Some critics note that a large accelerator now being built in Europe may answer some of the same questions. Others contend that less costly small-scale physics is even more important because it involves more scientists and students, and it studies phenomena that are relevant to the every-day world.
Proponents have greatly exaggerated their case. They suggest, plausibly, that the machine might revolutionize our understanding of force and matter. But they neglect to mention that it may prove a dud, finding little of interest. And they predict spinoff benefits for industry and medicine without acknowledging that $8 billion invested more broadly in science might yield even greater benefits.
Proponents have repeatedly low-balled their cost estimates, only to revise them upward. And they insist that foreign nations will foot part of the bill, with little to show for their optimism.
In the past, this page has opposed the collider for fear its escalating costs would divert funds from more fruitful research. But with care and determination, it now looks possible to do both. Project managers seem finally to have stabilized their costs and surmounted the most worrisome technological hurdle -- the huge superconducting magnets.
The collider should be completed because it will perform pioneering research in a field long dominated by the U.S. but where Europe is taking the lead. It would be a shame for a great nation to shrink from this intellectual adventure.
The project should be canceled only if it threatens to damage other fields of science, thus doing more harm than good.
Congress could assure the happier outcome by continuing the collider while setting firm limits to the total budget for high energy physics in future years. That way the new machine could be financed largely by shrinking or closing its obsolescent predecessors. Resources would not need to be drained from other vital research.

Yesterday's Man

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
The men were taken from the village at gunpoint and forced into freight cars. As many as 180 were jammed, standing, into boxcars measuring 39 by 6 feet. They were kept that way for three days, without water or food, as the train moved slowly across the countryside.
Nazis transporting Jews in 1942? No, Serbs transporting Muslim Bosnians in 1992: one glimpse of the worst racial and religious bestiality Europe has known since World War II. 
 When Bill Clinton called for meaningful action to stop such Serbian atrocities, the Bush campaign denounced him as "reckless." Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman, said Governor Clinton was "unaware of the political complications in Yugoslavia."
That Fitzwater phrase reminded me of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain explaining in 1938 why Britons should not care about Nazi designs on Czechoslovakia: It was, Chamberlain said, "a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing."
Neville Chamberlain, his country and the world learned the price of ignoring Hitler's aggression against a faraway country. And similarly, what the Serbs call "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia and Herzegovina -- the murder and transport of Croats and Muslims -- has the gravest implications for Europe and the world.
The Serbian onslaught is, in fact, the model of the next great challenge to international peace and order. The West, which marshaled its political and military resources to maintain the peace through the cold war, must now confront the problem of ethnic conflict overlapping national boundaries.
President Bush has been a veritable Neville Chamberlain in refusing to face the challenge in Yugoslavia. He has dithered, deferred to a Europe that was looking to him for leadership, refused to call for the international military action that everyone knows is the only way to stop the Serbian aggression.
The excuse for his inaction has been that the Serbian war on the other peoples of what was Yugoslavia has not aroused the American public. But Americans were not greatly exercised about Iraq's occupation of Kuwait either -- until George Bush skillfully used all his powers as President to bring the country into the Persian Gulf war.
But there was oil in Kuwait, the Bush people say, and there is no such American interest in Yugoslavia. No, nothing except the European stability that has been at the heart of our international policy for decades.
Again it is argued that the ethnic situation in what was Yugoslavia is complicated. True. But the essence of what has happened there is simple. Michael T. Kaufman of The New York Times, after traveling in four of the Yugoslav republics, wrote:
"What has been going on is fundamentally a Serbian war of aggression waged largely against civilians. . . . It is guns and ammunition supplied by Belgrade that are killing civilians in areas beyond the borders of Serbia. . . . Serbian forces everywhere have resorted to the same tactic of sustained artillery shelling of cities, towns and villages."
President Bush compared Saddam Hussein to Hitler. I am against such analogies, because they cheapen the Holocaust. But if that one is to be used, it better fits the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, the inventor of "ethnic cleansing."
Governor Clinton's statement on Yugoslavia took up ideas suggested by many international observers. The economic blockade of Serbia should be tightened, he said. The United States should ask the U.N. Security Council to authorize air strikes against those who attack relief convoys, as the Serbs have been doing. American forces should be lent to that operation. And Mr. Milosevic should be charged under international law "with crimes against humanity."
If President Bush had had the courage or the vision to act, the horror in Yugoslavia would have ended long ago. When Serbian gunners began lobbing shells into Dubrovnik a year ago, a few air strikes would have stopped them -- and headed off the tragedy that has followed.
In denouncing Governor Clinton last week for his call to action in Yugoslavia -- action long overdue -- the Bush campaign inadvertently advertised its own candidate's inability to respond to new realities in the world. It showed George Bush for what he is: yesterday's man.

HEADLINE: Six Theaters to Benefit From Revised Times Square Plan

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Six theaters on 42d Street will be among the biggest beneficiaries and most closely watched symbols of the revised redevelopment plan for Times Square.
Two or possibly three of the theaters -- all of which were taken over by the city and the state during condemnation proceedings in 1990 -- are to be renovated with $18.2 million committed by the developers of the original Times Square Center office project, the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty. That is the largest outlay of money for a single purpose under the new renovation plan. 
 "The theaters will now be the most visible surviving aspect of the redevelopment," said Cora Cahan, president of New 42d Street Inc., the corporation that is charged with overseeing the restoration and management of theaters on the block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. "We have even greater responsibility for the future, and we are eager to show that the street can be reclaimed."
The six theaters are the Victory, the Selwyn, the Times Square, the Apollo, the Lyric and the Liberty. The theaters most likely to be renovated are the Liberty, and the Victory. Three other theaters on the block are privately owned: the Harris, the New Amsterdam and the Empire.
 
Tempered Resignation
 News of the theater renovation helped to temper Broadway's resignation yesterday to hearing that development plans had changed once again.
"Of course it's a disappointment," said Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, the city's largest theater owner. "But it appears to be a holding action, and we're pleased by the continuing commitment of the city and the state to the project."
Harvey Sabinson, executive director of the League of American Theaters and Producers in Manhattan, said: "We've been supporting the redevelopment of 42d Street for 18 years. It's encouraging that it will keep moving forward. I just hope I'll be able to see that in my lifetime."
Broadway has always had a major stake in the project, hoping that redevelopment would generate new excitement, and new ticket sales, for the declining theater economy.
 
Change in Plans
 Under the original plan, Times Square was to be renovated and the office towers built as part of the $2.5 billion 42d Street Redevelopment Project, a state and city initiative that was to be financed largely with private money. Under the proposed overhaul of the plan, the office towers will not be built until economic conditions improve, from 3 to 10 years in the future.
Many of the existing buildings in the redevelopment sites along Broadway and Seventh Avenue between 41st Street and 43d Streets have had their tenants removed. At least one former tenant affected by the redevelopment plans was angered by the change. "I'm more than a little ticked off that they made me move," said Joe Franklin, the WWOR-TV talk-show host who was displaced by the redevelopment from the Longacre Building at 147 West 42d Street last year.
Ms. Cahan said New 42d Street Inc. will announce in the fall which of the theaters will be renovated, and she hopes that they will be able to house nonprofit theater and arts groups.
"We will aggressively pursue uses for the other theaters," said Ms. Cahan of state-and-city-owned theaters that will not be renovated.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Environmental Debate;
Gore Says Bush Is Hypocritical on Ecology Issues

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Calif., Aug. 3

 BODY:
Giving full voice to an issue that has been muted in the early stages of the Presidential campaign, Senator Al Gore today sharply criticized President Bush for his environmental record, saying he had been hypocritical on those issues.
In stops at a factory in Irvine, Calif., that makes environmentally safe intravenous bags for hospitals and at a plant here that recycles used motor oil, Mr. Gore sought to highlight his own credentials as an environmentalist. 
 Mr. Gore, the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee, used an appearance at the Evergreen Oil plant to underscore contrasts with Mr. Bush, who visited the same plant in June just after the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The Tennessee Senator said the company was struggling to survive primarily because the Bush Administration had failed to promulgate regulations that would encourage the recycling of oil.
Indeed, Evergreen is a member of the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, an industry group that is suing the Environmental Protection Agency for its failure to draft regulations that company officials say would lead to more oil recycling. Currently, 90 percent of used motor oil is either burned or dumped in landfills.
 
'The Hypocritical President'
 "The American people trusted George Bush when he said he was going to be the environmental President," Mr. Gore told a crowd of employees and their families. "When George Bush came to Evergreen, he was the hypocritical President."
Today's comments mark the first time Mr. Gore has made detailed criticism of the Administration's environmental record. His nomination was cheered by many environmentalists, who said it would mean that matters like pollution and global warming would receive more attention in the campaign. But until today, Mr. Gore had mainly articulated the broad outlines of the party's message and attacked the Administration's handling of the economy.
Mr. Gore's reluctance to speak on the environment is a marked contrast to criticism in his book, "Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit," of politicians -- including himself -- for not boldly addressing ecological issues.
In the book's introduction he wrote that he had "become very impatient with my own tendency to put a finger to the political winds" when it came to environmental issues.
 
Hitting Back
 Yet, as Mr. Gore steps up his comments on the environment, the Republicans have already begun to hit back, at times using Mr. Gore's book to try to portray him as an environmental extremist.
Last week, after Mr. Gore spoke at a Washington clinic on women's health issues, Republican campaign workers circulated several pages from Mr. Gore's book that dealt with the harvesting of Pacific yew trees, whose bark yields the chemical taxol, which has shown promise as a treatment for ovarian, lung and breast cancers.
Mr. Gore took no position on whether the trees should be harvested, but the message the Republicans intended to convey was that he cared more about trees than cancer victims.
 
Jobs vs. the Environment
 Democrats acknowledge that Mr. Gore must proceed carefully, in the face of Republican charges that environmental proposals will cost jobs. The task for Democrats, these officials say, is to sell environmental protection as a job-creating program.
"We've got to do a clear job of saying that the choice George Bush lays out there of the environment or jobs is an absolutely false one," said Senator Tim Wirth, a Colorado Democrat who is coordinating the campaign's environmental policy.
Mr. Gore's visits to both Evergreen Oil and McGaw Inc. in Irvine were intended to highlight the Democrats' message of creating jobs while saving the environment. McGaw manufactures an intravenous bag for hospitals that contains no polyvinyl chlorides and can therefore be recycled.
Larry Watts, a company vice president, said McGaw had revenues last year of about $300 million, with $200 million of that coming from recyclable intravenous bags.
In his speech to the company's employees, Mr. Gore said: "This demand in the marketplace for new, more environmentally efficient products is a worldwide demand. And if we are going to enjoy the kind of economic advantage in the 90's and in the next century that we want for our kids, we really should be leading this environmental revolution in all industries, the way you're leading it in your industry."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
T.W.A. Holding Sale Talks With Unions and Creditors

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Trans World Airlines said yesterday that it was negotiating an agreement with many of its unionized employees and its creditors to buy out the troubled airline's chairman, Carl C. Icahn, who would step down.
The deal would provide short-term relief for T.W.A., which entered bankruptcy court protection in January, industry analysts said, but it would leave a once-proud carrier ill positioned to compete. T.W.A. has sold some of its most attractive assets and it has an aging fleet, shortcomings that threaten its long-term health. 
 Mr. Icahn personally stands to lose up to $100 million as a result of his adventure in the skies, said a person involved in the negotiations who declined to be identified. Mr. Icahn recovered his initial $400 million investment when he took the airline private in a leveraged buyout in 1988, but he holds T.W.A. bonds that would become worthless in the deal.
Under the agreement, Mr. Icahn would give up his 90 percent stake in the carrier. The unions representing most of T.W.A.'s 28,000 employees, who now have the other 10 percent, would trade a 15 percent concession in wages, benefits and work rules for an expanded 45 percent equity stake.
T.W.A.'s creditors would forgive two-thirds, or roughly $1 billion, of the company's debt in exchange for debt securities, preferred stock and 55 percent of T.W.A.'s common equity. Together, the lower employee costs and reduced interest expense would save about $400 million a year.
Mr. Icahn's successor is unclear. One person involved in the talks said Alfred D. Kingsley, T.W.A.'s vice chairman, was being discussed as the likely candidate. But another source said he was not interested in the job.
An agreement has been under discussion for two years, according to people involved in the talks. However, a broad change in pricing strategies by the major carriers in April, followed by a bruising fare war, gave new impetus to discussions of wholesale changes at T.W.A., which is losing almost $1 million a day, according to people familiar with its finances.
To be sure, a deal is far from final, and it still requires the approval of certain organizations and agencies, which will probably take months to win. The Air Line Pilots Association said several key issues were unresolved, adding that it wanted assurances that its 2,800 T.W.A. pilots would have jobs should the airline ever be sold.
And the Federal agency that insures T.W.A.'s pension fund, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, said it would oppose any proposal that would break T.W.A. from Mr. Icahn's affiliated companies unless protection was in place to cover the more than $1 billion in unfinanced pension liabilities.
The International Association of Machinists, the largest T.W.A. union, with 15,000 members, said no substantive issues threatened the agreement. "This provides a cushion to deal with the current downturn in the industry and the economy and assures T.W.A.'s viability," said Brian M. Freeman, an investment banker in Roseland, N.J., who represents the union.
He added that other unions had shown willingness to follow the machinists' lead. But the standing of 6,300 management and clerical employees who are not unionized is not clear.
 
An Uphill Climb
 If and when these hurdles are cleared, a reinvigorated T.W.A. with a healthier balance sheet and lower costs could emerge. "But I don't think it puts them in the hunt," said Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst with Morgan Stanley. No airline has ever entered bankruptcy and rejoined the ranks of the financially strongest carriers. "The track record is not good," Mr. Murphy said.
In a fiercely competitive industry, T.W.A.'s fleet is nearly twice the age of American's and Delta's, both at nine years. And T.W.A. is consistently among the performance laggards on score cards that track on-time arrivals, customer complaints, mishandled baggage and passengers "bumped" from flights.
And in its strategy of paring back, T.W.A., is going against a powerful industry trend toward consolidation. Once a dominant carrier with global routes, T.W.A. has sold some of its strongest assets, including landing rights, airport gates and slots in London. To succeed, the airline may require more capital than is readily available, analysts said.
Although it is no longer one of the nation's leading carriers, T.W.A. is still an important presence in many cities, particularly St. Louis. Earlier this year, it also increased the number of flights to Kennedy International Airport.
Some industry analysts speculate that the restructuring may make T.W.A. more appealing to other carriers. USAir, which recently announced a plan to merge with British Airways, had previously expressed interest in acquiring some of T.W.A.'s assets.
Mr. Icahn began his association with T.W.A. in 1986. He took control of the airline, which was once owned by Howard Hughes, after most of its unions sided with him and granted wage concessions to fight off Frank Lorenzo, the Texas Air chairman. But the employees were soon feuding with Mr. Icahn, who sought further wage concessions.
If the buyout deal is approved by the bankruptcy court, Mr. Icahn would become a passive investor.
Since taking the airline private, Mr. Icahn has fancied himself a maverick who bucked industry wisdom. In recent months, he has tangled with Robert L. Crandall, American's chairman, and became the unofficial spokesman for troubled carriers.
He has contended that American's fare-simplification strategy put into effect in early April was an attempt to drive weaker airlines out of business. Although the debate elevated Mr. Icahn to a more prominent industry role, he is said to have grown weary of the business.
The proposed agreement calls for Mr. Icahn to invest $150 million to $200 million to help the airline operate until the plan is approved by the bankruptcy court. That money would be safe, because it would be secured by the airline's assets, although Mr. Icahn's other businesses may ultimately be held responsible for the pension fund obligations.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves More Financing For Supercollider Project in Texas

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Rejecting arguments that the superconducting supercollider is a luxury the country cannot afford, the Senate today overwhelmingly approved spending $550 million next year for the Texas-based proton smasher.
The $8.2 billion supercollider was put in peril six weeks ago when the House voted to stop its financing. But with concerns over the budget deficit now overshadowed by worry over unemployment and slow economic growth, a House-Senate conference committee is likely to follow the Senate's lead and resuscitate financing for the project. 
 The Senate vote followed weeks of intense Administration lobbying in favor of the project, including a visit by President Bush last week to the project site in Waxahachie, Tex., about 20 miles south of Dallas. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Mr. Bush's Democratic opponent, also supports the project.
Most Senators agreed that it would be worthwhile and exciting to investigate the essence of nature, as the supercollider is intended to do by smashing subatomic particles within a 54-mile tunnel to simulate conditions that existed just after the creation of the universe. But the debate over financing the project centered on priorities, with opponents contending that it would expand the budget deficit and crowd out other research spending.
 
Seeing 'Marginal Payback'
 Senator Dale L. Bumpers, an Arkansas Democrat who is the principal opponent of the project, said that "in a perfect world" he would like to see the supercollider built. But in difficult times, he added, "it adds to the deficit with very marginal payback."
Those favoring the supercollidercontended that behind the project was the same impulse that drove the nation to go to the moon and explore the stars and that such ambitions ultimately created jobs and technologies to export. In addition, more than 7,000 jobs are tied to the project in Texas, and it promises to provide several hundred million dollars in Federal money to states.
The Senate rejected the amendment to the Energy-Water Development Appropriations bill proposing to shelve the supercollider by a vote of 62 to 32. Today's result was widely expected, and support for pressing ahead, though with $100 million less than Mr. Bush proposed, came from both parties, with 31 Democrats joining 31 Republicans in endorsing the project. The Senate later approved the entire bill.
Ultimately, several wavering Senators were persuaded by the argument that the supercollider would provide several potential spinoff benefits for medical diagnosis, computers and super-fast trains. The Senate action underlined a developing consensus in Congress that the way to control spending is not to cut science projects but to curb the escalating costs of entitlement programs like Medicaid.
"There is no question that our economic future is being harmed by a declining international competitiveness due in part to insufficient investment in basic scientific research," said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, whose state has pledged to contribute $1 billion to the project.
 
Support From Project States
 Mr. Bentsen was joined by his Republican counterpart from Texas, Senator Phil Gramm, as well as by Senator J. Bennett Johnston, the Louisiana Democratic who is chairman of the Energy Committee, in leading the forces for the supercollider. Many of the giant magnets that propel the protons towards their high-speed collisions are assembled in Hammond, La.
The Government has spread out contracts and research grants connected with the project to universities and private companies in 45 states, in large part to shore up political support; New York, for instance, would receive $44 million in contracts. The base for Congressional backing has come from the dozen or so states that have received the most lucrative contracts.
Senator Jim Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat who heads the Budget Committee, said today before the vote that he opposed the project because of cost overruns, predicting that the estimated $8.2 billion price tag would eventually reach $12 billion.
"Allowing the supercollider to continue to suck up billions of research dollars that might otherwise have gone to countless smaller-scale projects may be the greatest threat of all to our leadership role in basic scientific research," Mr. Sasser contended. Since 1987, Congress has approved $1 billion for the proton smasher, which is supposed to be completed in 1999.
But Senator Johnston asked: "Are we going to just let this country sink slowly like the sun in the west and say we can't compete anymore, we have no scientific curiosity, we have no scientific competitiveness? We're going to let this budget deficit fueled by entitlements just overwhelm us?"

HEADLINE: New Outlays For Buildings Fell in June

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Construction activity in June posted its worst decline in 13 months, the Commerce Department said today, in large part because of a sharp drop in spending for government projects.
The value of new construction put in place fell 1.5 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $416.9 billion. 
 It was the first decrease since December and the largest since May 1991, when construction activity fell 1.8 percent. The decline followed a slight gain in May. That gain, originally reported as two-tenths of 1 percent, was revised downward to one-tenth of 1 percent.
In June, a 1.1 percent increase in residential construction was not enough to offset a big 5.7 percent drop in government construction and a nine-tenths of 1 percent decline in private, nonresidential projects.
Analysts cautioned against reading too much into the drop in government construction. Activity there swings widely from month to month but, over all, it has been one of the strongest construction sectors during the two-year economic slump.
"Is the latest drop simply month-to-month volatility or are governments starting to be constrained by budget problems?" asked David Berson, an economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association. "There may be some budget constraint, but at this point I think it's mostly month-to-month volatility."
 
Government Spending Falls
 Government spending fell to an annual rate of $113.4 billion. The other public buildings category, which includes administrative offices, jails and courthouses, declined 12.2 percent. Highway spending dropped 6.5 percent and spending for school buildings fell 5.8 percent.
Lower interest rates have helped stimulate residential construction, but have not helped the commercial market, particularly for office buildings.
The third consecutive decline occurred in June in nonresidential construction activity. It fell to an annual rate of $84.9 billion. Industrial spending was off 4.3 percent and offices fell 2.4 percent. Other commercial projects, including shopping centers, rose 2.2 percent.
"The nonresidential sector has been in long-term decline and it continues to weaken," said Mark Zandi, an economist for Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. "I would expect declines at least through the end of this year and probably well into 1993. We still have vacancy rates near record highs for office, industrial and retail space."
Spending for residential projects totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $180.7 billion. Single-family home building was up 1.3 percent, while apartment spending rose seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Analysts were surprised by the June decline. Still, spending for the month was 5.7 percent higher than a year earlier. Spending during the first half of 1992 was 4.7 percent higher than spending during the first six months of 1991.

HEADLINE: Stocks Edge Up Again in a Quiet Session

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market closed slightly higher yesterday in a quiet session as many investors took a breather to digest last week's sharp gains.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 1.62 points, to 3,395.40. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume eased to 164.5 million shares from 180.6 million in the previous session. 
 There was little news to move the markets. Prices traded in a narrow range and volume was light, but the Dow still rose for the fifth consecutive session.
 
'Nothing to Cause Volatility'
 Stocks showed little reaction to mixed reports on the economy. The Commerce Department said construction spending fell 1.5 percent in June. But a poll of the nation's purchasing executives showed the manufacturing sector continued to grow in July, posting its sixth consecutive advance.
"The reports weren't too strong and they weren't too weak," said Jon Groveman, president of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. "There was nothing to cause volatility."
Some investors were staying away ahead of important economic readings scheduled for this week, including June's index of leading economic indicators today and July's employment figures on Friday.
Yesterday's gains were broad. The Nasdaq composite index gained 1.53, to 582.36. The Big Board's composite index rose 0.51, to 233.66, while the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.02, to 390.87.
Chase Manhattan led the Big Board's most actives, easing 1/8, to 24 7/8. Among other actively traded issues, Philip Morris rose 5/8, to 80 1/2, and Wellcome was unchanged at 15 1/4.
Merck rose 1, to 52 7/8, after several analysts said the company's prostate drug, Proscar, will become a billion-dollar product by the end of the decade.
McDonald's fell 1 1/8, to 42 3/4, after an analyst cut the intermediate-term rating to "above average" from "buy."
Monsanto fell 1 1/2, to 53 1/2, after an analyst lowered its rating to "sell," citing the Food and Drug Administration's approval of Ivax's generic version of a Monsanto drug. Ivax, traded on the Amex, rose 4 5/8 to 28 7/8.
Marvel Entertainment fell 2 7/8, to 31 1/2, after Barron's reported that an analyst was urging investors to sell the stock.

HEADLINE: Times Square's Future May Be Found Back at Its Roots

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
For more than a decade, city and state officials sought to reinvent Times Square as a major office district, in the hope of bringing new vitality to the crossroads.
This week, they acknowledged publicly that there was little chance of luring a major commercial tenant to the neighborhood until the next century. Even Prudential Securities, a subsidiary of one of the partners in the Times Square development team, would not move to 42d Street. 
 Today, officials believe, Times Square would profit most from its reincarnation as a jumbled, energetic patchwork of small buildings topped by big signs and filled with stores, restaurants, theaters, amusements and nightspots -- in other words, fitting a description that might have been written 50 years ago.
"What we're doing is playing to the natural potential of the area," said Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, a subsidiary of the New York State Urban Development Corporation.
"What our market study has found is that there is a tremendous unexploited potential for tourism here," she said, "a market which has always been underserved in this area."
 
A Deal With Developers
 The revitalization project would be financed in large measure by the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty, the development team that was supposed to build the four enormous office towers known as Times Square Center, along Broadway and Seventh Avenue between 41st and 43d streets.
On Sunday, officials said they were prepared to release the developers from a construction timetable and allow those towers to be built as the market dictated.
Further details of the tentative deal came to light yesterday. The chairman of Park Tower, George Klein, said the developers were "very hopeful that we'll soon have an agreement." Brian J. Strum, a Prudential executive, said the city had devised a "workable strategy."
Carl Weisbrod, the president of the city Economic Development Corporation, said the developers would make a "substantial investment in retail uses" along 42d Street, paying for the renovation of existing buildings and, perhaps, new construction.
All told, the developers would contribute more than $30 million to the renovation of the project site, Ms. Robertson said.
This would include their earlier commitment to an $18.2 million renovation of two theaters on 42d Street and a $2.6 million renovation of the "streetscape," including lighting and sidewalks, plus a loan to the state, which would undertake its own renovation of several parcels on the south side of 42d Street.
Mr. Weisbrod said the rent paid by the developers for the sites, which they lease from the state, would be "significantly increased."
For their part, the developers would keep their claim to four sites that might one day support a project with more than four million square feet of office space. They would also protect an investment they have already made: $180 million in condemnation awards that they have paid to owners whose property was taken by the state, at least $60 million they have yet to pay and tens of millions of dollars in development costs.
One of the last efforts to resuscitate Times Square Center came last winter, when officials tried to persuade Prudential that its search for a tenant need go no further than its own corporate family, because Prudential Securities, a wholly owned subsidiary with some 5,000 employees in Manhattan, was looking for new space.
"Unfortunately, it does not appear as if Times Square works for Prudential Securities," Mr. Weisbrod said. "However, we are engaged in constructive discussions with Prudential Securities to keep them in the city."
Mr. Weisbrod insisted that rejuvenating existing buildings and bringing tenants back to spaces that were only recently emptied was not a return to square one.
"Square one was where there were six to eight crimes a day reported on the block," he said. "Square one was where the street cost 10 times more to clean than any other single block in Manhattan. Square one was where we hadn't seen anything positive on the block in a half-century.
"Whatever happens, we're not going to see a return to that," he said.
In broad concept, the proposed interim arrangement -- in which tourist and entertainment uses would be stressed -- echoes proposals made in recent years by two staunch critics of Times Square Center.
In 1989, Douglas Durst, whose family briefly controlled the leases to eight theaters on 42d Street, proposed an increase in stores on the street and an upgrading of the existing movie theaters. In 1991, State Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Manhattan Democrat, called for the abandonment of the office towers "in favor of a tourist-oriented entertainment center."
Asked about the parallels, Ms. Robertson said yesterday: "You know what? Every good idea has its time. The fact of the matter is that this is a good idea, even if we're not necessarily the authors of it."
The new plan is to be developed in consultation with Garrick-Aug Associates, a retail leasing concern.
The Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, said the "decision to refurbish and upgrade existing buildings in the area as a means of revitalizing Times Square is a good one." But she added that officials "should use this postponement as an opportunity to reconsider the entire premise of the Times Square redevelopment plan."
Mr. Leichter went further, calling outright for an end to the Times Square Center project. "Forty-second Street today is much worse than it has ever been," he said, "with its closed-up shops only increasing its dangerous character."

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
An effort to create jobs by extending construction permits and zoning approvals that expired during the recession was approved for a third time by the New Jersey Assembly today and sent to Gov. Jim Florio. Opponents of the measure said builders were using the recession as an excuse to get around tough environmental laws enacted in recent years, and Mr. Florio has twice vetoed permit-extension bills. But he said he would approve the measure if lawmakers guaranteed protection for the most sensitive wetlands, and the new version has been amended to address that concern.

States Weighing Cost-Control Ideas

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
DISMAYED by climbing Medicaid budgets and the growing numbers of Americans without health insurance, several states are considering bold new efforts to hold down health-care costs. Many states have concluded that they cannnot afford to expand access to health care unless costs can be brought under control at the same time.
Vermont and Minnesota have already decided to set targets for overall medical spending. Colorado and Vermont have authorized studies of systems that would funnel all health-care payments through a single agency to a limited number of competing insurers. California is looking at a similar approach. Iowa is studying a combination of both spending targets and regulated competition. 
 Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado said in a telephone interview that his state wanted to establish minimum health coverage that would emphasize "preventive care to reduce costs rather than spending it all on heroic medicine," which labors to keep desperately ill people alive.
Minnesota wants to limit the spread of costly new medical technologies.
Health-policy experts hope the states can serve as laboratories for an eventual national program to deal with the problems of cost and access. "Not that any state by itself is likely to fix the problems," said W. David Helms, president of the Alpha Center, a nonprofit health policy group in Washington, "but we can learn from these state experiments." Mr. Helms is also a national program director for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which plans to spend $25.5 million to promote state health-financing experiments.
The foundation announced yesterday that it was giving one-third of the money to health-policy planners in a dozen states: Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. Experts from the Rand Corporation, the Urban Institute and the National Governors' Association will help the 12 states study the legal and economic implications of the experiments.
Chris Petersen, a senior counsel with the Health Insurance Association of America, an insurers' trade group, said the association supports experimentation at the state level. But he said the group opposed the single-payer concept, which would eliminate a traditional insurance company business. Other state programs that use a number of competing insurers should be tested in the marketplace, without state subsidies, he said, because the subsidies could not last forever.
Nancy Barrand, a Robert Wood Johnson project officer, said the states might eventually need permission from Congress and Federal Medicare and Medicaid officials to proceed with experiments. Some may require special exemptions from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which restricts state jurisdiction over health insurance.
Gov. David Walters of Oklahoma said he hoped to get waivers from Medicaid and a Federal tax exemption for a state plan to establish deferred individual and family health accounts resembling I.R.A. savings accounts. The state would use interest on the accounts to pay for broadened access to health care, he added.
The Bush Administration has held up a request by Oregon for a Medicaid waiver that would permit the state to set priorities in paying for medical care. Ms. Barrand said the new state programs would seek support in Washington by showing that they could "actually achieve broader access and better control over costs." The foundation will finance research so states that propose to require all insurers to charge standardized rates, for example, could predict which employers would pay more and which would pay less.
New York plans to use its Johnson grant to work on a statewide clearinghouse to process all health claims. It will also look at new rate-setting strategy for paying physicians and at ways to improve access to health care. Ronald Rouse, acting planning director with the state's health department, said that a uniform system for paying doctors could curb the "micromanagement of physician decision making," which many doctors hate. All of the New York projects need legislative approval.
Stephen H. Long, an economist in Washington with Rand, the policy center based in Santa Monica, Calif., said 35 states with widely varying characteristics had applied for the Robert Wood Johnson grants. They ranged from Minnesota, where only about 7 percent are uninsured, to New Mexico, where more than 25 percent do not have coverage. The national average is about 15 percent.
He added that some experts worry that generous health-care programs will attract people from neighboring states where benefits are sparse. He added that insurers might decide to pull out of states that sharply restrict their business. Mr. Long said the chances for success would be best in states like Minnesota where the economy is strong and the number of uninsured is relatively small.

HEADLINE: Trade Talks Bog Down Over Dispute on Apparel

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Negotiators made slow progress today on the final details of a planned North American free-trade agreement, largely because of an obscure dispute involving Canada's apparel industry, people close to the talks said today.
The trade ministers of the three countries plan to continue the talks on Tuesday, and possibly through the week. But a foreign official said that Trade Minister Michael H. Wilson of Canada and Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche of Mexico might go home if a deal was not reached on Tuesday, and return on Friday for more negotiations. 
 Deputies would continue talking in the meantime, and several people close to the talks said that they expected a comprehensive agreement to be struck this week.
The disagreement over apparel is not considered a deal breaker, and is tiny compared with the multibillion-dollar issues already decided. But it has tied up a lot of the top negotiators' time for several days. This has meant that other touchy issues, like trade in automobiles, have not been settled as quickly as expected.
 
Politically Important Trade
 The apparel dispute is important because it involves a politically important industry in all three countries and because it has become a target for critics who charge that the agreement discriminates against companies outside North America.
The Canadian apparel industry accuses the United States of pursuing a back-door strategy to restrict Canadian exports while encouraging American exports to Canada. The industry employs 120,000 Canadians, three-fifths of them in Quebec, which is the home province of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the key to his hopes of winning re-election next year.
"It puts the Canadian Government in a a very difficult position; it puts the Canadian industry that might very well be supporting an agreement in a very difficult position," said Jack Kivenko, the president of the Ottawa-based Canadian Apparel Manufacturers Institute.
But American officials contend that the agreement would represent the most far-reaching dismantling of trade barriers ever tried by the United States in this highly protected industry. They point out that the accord would gradually eliminate restrictions on imports from Mexico, a low-wage country, without imposing any new restrictions on countries outside North America and imposing a very small restriction on Canada.
The lingering differences between the United States and Canada are abstruse even by international trade standards.
The dispute begins with the 1988 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. That accord called for eliminating, over 10 years, each country's apparel tariffs, many of which are close to 25 percent. To prevent China and other countries from benefiting by shipping products intended for Canada through the United States, or vice versa, the tariff reductions applied only to clothing made in the United States or Canada from fabric also made in either country.
Because Quebec clothing producers rely heavily on imported fabric, they were given an exemption from this requirement for up to 40 million square meters worth of clothing each year.
The North American Free Trade Agreement will add a third requirement, concerning yarn, for garments to qualify for lower tariffs. Garments will have to be made in North America from fabric made in North America, and the fabric will also have to be made from yarn produced in North America.
The practical effect of the extra requirement may be limited because the economics of fabric production force most North American fabric factories to spin their own yarn. But a handful of factories do import yarn, and a few Quebec companies buy fabric from them.
The United States has offered to increase the limit set in 1988 to account for these extra garments with imported yarn. But Canada wants a much larger increase because Quebec producers contend that the original limit was too small.

After the Fade to Black, The End Isn't Hollywood

BYLINE: By George Judson

DATELINE: SEYMOUR, Conn.

 BODY:
THE people who make movies can always count on happy endings: they just write one into the script. In "Other People's Money," starring Danny DeVito, a financier persuades stockholders to liquidate an aging wire and cable company; at the last minute, employees step forward to buy the company and run it themselves.
Happy endings are harder to come by in the Naugatuck Valley, which bled tens of thousands of factory jobs in the 1970's and 80's as one brass mill after another shut down. But in 1985, employees of Bridgeport Brass in Seymour did save their jobs by buying their mill. 
 When the crew for "Other People's Money" came here in 1990 to film scenes at the 104-year-old factory, now called the Seymour Specialty Wire Company, Warner Brothers's payment for using the plant helped it pay off one of the last notes from the buyout.
Cut to last Friday, when the gates of the idled plant opened so its remaining employees could come in and clean out their lockers. Then to the next day, when, officials say, someone set fire to the laboratory building. Then to the sign on the guard shack that says the property is being prepared for liquidation.
Seymour Specialty closed on June 29 for its annual maintenance shutdown and has not reopened. Out of money, it is in the hands of a creditor, the Foothill Group Inc., that is owed $1.7 million.
The management is looking for a buyer, but one way or another, a lot of people are going to lose money. The state is owed more than $1 million in loans, the town of Seymour is owed $400,000 in property taxes and utilities haven't been paid.
The employees -- Seymour Specialty's owners -- have sacrificed all along. As their contribution to the buyout, they took a 10 percent pay cut and gave up 40 of 250 jobs. But more concessions were needed, and more layoffs were ordered. At the end, as few as 70 people were working in a mill where 800 had worked in Bridgeport Brass's heyday.
"One of the things always said was, 'We're doing this to save ourselves, we'd rather have a job that makes a little bit less than be on the street collecting unemployment,' " said Michael Kearney, the president of Local 1827, United Auto Workers, in 1985, and still a company director. "I think some people regret that, because look where they are now."
Across the United States, 11 million people work for companies owned under Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOP's. Seymour Specialty's buyout was held up as a model of white-collar and blue-collar cooperation; 100 percent of its employees took part in its ESOP.
ESOP's can be an effective way to recapitalize a company. In Seymour, at least at first, employee ownership also appeared to bolster production, said the Rev. Kevin Bean, who assisted the company as staff director of the Naugatuck Valley Project, a coalition of religious, business, labor and community organizations.
But, Mr. Bean said, "An ESOP doesn't protect you from the harsh realities of larger economic forces, especially recessionary forces. It's not a magical force field to protect a company."
In "Other People's Money," Danny DeVito, as the financier Larry the Liquidator, explained why old wireworks don't survive: "Fiber optics. New technologies. Obsolescence."
The Valley's brassworks are almost gone, in part, because brass is no longer a universal material. Another movie, "The Graduate," predicted their fate 25 years ago in one famous word: "Plastics."
Mr. Bean and others acknowledge the shrinking brass market, while pointing out that Seymour had a firm hold of a niche, producing alloys for the automobile industry and other users. It has customers waiting for its furnaces to fire up again.
But employee ownership, workers learned, doesn't transform a decades-old factory into a state-of-the-art factory. It doesn't install new equipment. It doesn't provide skilled workers to replace the experienced hands who know the old machinery but retire.
"A lot of old-time bosses retired," said Tom Klimovich, another former union president. "They didn't have their knowledge written on paper, they had it between their ears. When they left, it went with them."
Nor does an ESOP eliminate the need for management, or make it smarter, as employees learned when they elected a majority of hourly workers to the board of directors.
"I learned a lot through the buyout," said Mr. Klimovich, who is a director, "but I'm not going to tell you I was a genius at business. You hire people to do that. And you hope they're doing the job right."
An ESOP doesn't prevent losing orders in a recession, or a furnace melting down, or mistakes in the front office or on the shop floor. This one, very likely, will have no Hollywood ending. Its success, Mr. Bean said, is that it kept the furnaces burning in Seymour seven years longer than they would have otherwise.
"We got seven years out of it," Mr. Klimovich agreed. "That's the way I look at it. We got seven years."

Taubman Centers, a Mall Empire, to Go Public;
Big Developer To Shed Debt In Stock Sale

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
A. Alfred Taubman's shopping mall empire plans to sell shares to the public, hoping to raise between $335 million and $389 million from investors who would get a 22 percent stake in a group of 19 large shopping malls from California to Connecticut, the company announced yesterday. The move would effectively free Mr. Taubman of hundreds of millions of dollars of personal debt.
The company said the offering and the accompanying restructuring would enable it to slash debt and expand. It said it planned to enlarge some large regional shopping centers and might buy or build others. 
 Mr. Taubman, the 67-year-old real estate developer who controls Sotheby's Holdings as well as the Woodward & Lothrop department store chain based in Washington, would end up owning less of his shopping center empire than the public will own. The plan is to ask the public to pay more than 50 times last year's earnings for a stake in the company.
 
Other Offerings Halted
 The success of the deal will hinge on the willingness of investors to pay such a high multiple. In recent weeks, a number of large equity offerings have been withdrawn, and others have been cut back, because of investor resistance. But the fact that the filing comes after those setbacks indicates that the underwriters, led by Morgan Stanley & Company, are optimistic that buyers can be found.
Mr. Taubman and his family are not taking money out of the deal directly, but a loan of about $450 million to the Taubmans from his empire will, in effect, be forgiven. And Mr. Taubman will be in a position that could enable him to take out large additional sums within a few years.
The offering of shares in Taubman Centers Inc. would provide a windfall for pension funds at General Motors and American Telephone and Telegraph. Those funds would get all the cash, after expenses, from the offering and still own 52 percent of the shopping center empire. That ownership stems from a $610 million loan made in 1985, which the pension funds are now converting into a controlling stake in the empire, a right they were given when they made the loan.
If the offering of 26.8 million shares goes as planned, with shares selling at $13.50 each, the midpoint of the $12.50 to $14.50 range cited in the prospectus, the pension funds would end up with $327 million in cash and equity interests worth $874 million.
 
 
Old Loan Would Be Forgiven
 Mr. Taubman would own a stake worth about $326 million, although he has pledged that holding to banks in return for $80 million in loans.
In 1985, when the pension fund loan was made, Mr. Taubman and his associates effectively pocketed the cash by borrowing $600 million from the shopping center empire, with three- quarters of that going to the Taubman family. As part of the restructuring that accompanies the offering, they will essentially end up owing that money to themselves, effectively canceling the loans.
The Taubman properties range in size from the 1.9-million-square-foot Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, Ill., near Chicago, to the 714,000-square-foot Meadowood Mall in Reno. In all, the malls have 21.3 million square feet of space.
Taubman Centers said that it would initially pay dividends at a rate of 22 cents a quarter, although it cautioned that there was no guarantee that the rate would remain level. At that rate, the shares would yield 6.1 to 7 percent, depending on where they sell within the expected range. On a pro-forma basis, Taubman Centers reported profits of 24 cents a share last year, indicating that the shares are to be offered at a range of 52 to 60 times trailing earnings.
 
A Glimpse of Mall Economics
 The offering prospectus, filed yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, provided the first look at the economics of such a large shopping center developer. And it showed that while the stores that sell in shopping centers have run into problems in recent years, the problems have so far not severely damaged the Taubman centers, notwithstanding the bankruptcies of several anchor stores.
Under the normal operating procedures of those centers, the tenants pay not only rent but almost all of the operating expenses as well. And rents have steadily climbed, in large part because leases signed years ago contained escalation clauses.
But there were signs that the recession began to pinch the centers' operations. New leases signed in 1991 called for lower rents than similar new leases signed in 1990, although still well above the levels of expiring leases they replaced. In an interview, Bernard Winograd, the company's chief financial officer, said he expected that "in a cyclical recovery" the figures in new leases would rise again.
In the meantime, however, it is clear that tenants of the shopping centers have been squeezed even as the centers' profits have risen in recent years. At 15 Taubman shopping centers that were in operation before 1987, sales by the tenants peaked in 1989 and declined slightly in 1990 and 1991. But because of escalation clauses and new leases, the centers saw their revenues rise.
In 1989, the 15 centers had revenues of $317.4 million, or 16 percent of the $1.99 billion in sales by tenants of the shopping centers. By 1991, the centers' revenues of $350.9 million amounted to 18 percent of the underlying sales of $1.95 billion.
On a long-term basis, it may be difficult for stores to continue paying ever-larger percentages of their sales for rents, and that could put a damper on revenue increases as leases come up for renewal.
Over all, Taubman reported that 87.2 percent of its space was leased on March 31, down from 90.5 percent at the end of the year. It said that this was a normal seasonal dip and noted that the figure was higher than a year earlier.
If the deal is completed, Taubman Centers Inc. will become a real estate investment trust, required under tax laws to pay out 95 percent of its income to holders. Its sole asset would be a 32.5 percent stake in a related company, Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership, which will actually own the Taubman stakes in the shopping centers, which range from 100 percent to as little as 25 percent. Those ownership percentages are likely to rise, however, as minority partners cash out by trading their stakes for shares in Taubman Realty and eventually for shares in Taubman Centers.
Under complicated arrangements, the pension funds at General Motors and A.T.&T., as well as other holders including Mr. Taubman, can effectively ask the company to sell new shares to redeem their interests. For that reason, it is possible that in the next several years, beginning as early as mid-1993, there will be many more shares of Taubman Centers available for trading, perhaps depressing the price.
Of the 19 centers included in the deal, 8 have seen one or more anchor tenants file for bankruptcy in recent years, for a total of 15 stores. But only one mall, the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey, actually lost anchors. Both B. Altman and Bonwit Teller closed, but the mall has announced plans to expand and add three new anchors: Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends the Day Mixed While Gold Drops Sharply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday against most currencies as traders waited for more definitive economic and political news to take shape later in the week.
Gold prices dropped sharply. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold was quoted at $352.60, off $4.80 from late Friday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at $353, off $4.50. 
 Currency traders said the dollar's behavior reflected a reluctance to make any aggressive moves amid a lack of information to trade on.
"People would like to have more news to make up their mind," said Peter Wild, first vice president and treasurer of the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer & Company.
Traders are not sure what the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, will do when it meets on Thursday, Mr. Wild said, and many refrained from any speculative activity. Last month, the German central bank raised interest rates to a 61-year high, jolting the financial markets.
The July unemployment figures in the United States are scheduled to be reported Friday, and many traders are awaiting that news. A higher number could signal a further drop in interest rates in the United States, which would hurt the dollar.
Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.25 yen, down 0.05 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 127.25 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 127.20 yen, from 127.15 on Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9245, from $1.9205 late Friday. Later in New York the pound fell to $1.9240, from $1.9270 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.4750 German marks, up from 1.4745; 1.3165 Swiss francs, up from 1.3155; 4.9800 French francs, unchanged; 1,114.00 Italian lire, down from 1,114.75, and 1.18395 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18425.

HEADLINE: GlenFed Loss at $26 Million

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: GLENDALE, Calif., Aug. 3

 BODY:
GlenFed Inc. said today that it lost $26 million in its fourth quarter and $120.9 million for the fiscal year as real estate problems continued, though the losses were narrower than in the periods a year earlier.
GlenFed, the parent of Glendale Federal Bank, reported the losses late Friday and restated its third-quarter loss to $146.6 million from $106.7 million. 
 GlenFed said that as a result of continued weakness in the economy and deterioration in California real estate markets, it had significantly increased its provisions for loan losses and real estate write-downs.
It recorded a $78.7 million provision for loan losses in the quarter. It also set aside $12.4 million for losses related to foreclosed real estate holdings.
Nonperforming assets and restructured loans totaled $827.1 million on June 30, 1992, compared with $712.1 million on June 30, 1991, and $930.4 million on March 31, 1992.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: ON BASEBALL;
When Game Isn't Fun, Astros Owner Knows It's Time to Get Out

BYLINE: By Murray Chass

 BODY:
Despite all the talk about George Steinbrenner since he ousted himself from baseball two years ago today, nothing memorable has been said about him, certainly nothing that compares with the comments made about the Yankees' owner more than a dozen years ago.
"The two of them deserve each other," Billy Martin uttered July 23, 1978, referring to his boss and his star player, Reggie Jackson. "One's a born liar, the other's convicted." 
 Then there was this view, expressed May 14, 1979: "There's nothing more limited than a limited partner in the Yankees."
John McMullen made that remark, and he knew whereof he spoke. He had been a limited partner of Steinbrenner for several years. When he offered his observation, he was on his way in as majority owner of the Houston Astros. Thirteen years later, with Steinbrenner on his way back to active duty with the Yankees, McMullen is on his way out as the Astros' owner.
"I'm not selling it for the money," said McMullen shortly after the sale was announced on July 24.
He has sold the team, effective after the season, because after 13 years, he no longer was having fun in Houston; too many people there wouldn't let him.
It was not enough that the New Jersey resident rescued the Astros from the Ford Motor Credit Company, keeping the team in Houston instead of having someone else move it elsewhere.
Members of that city's news media never forgave him for firing the team's president and general manager, Tal Smith, in 1980. Everything McMullen has done since that 1980 act, including the Astros' declining fortunes since they won a division title in 1986, has been viewed through eyes that focused with intense dislike and resentment on the man who sacked their good buddy.
Perhaps McMullen's tenure in Houston would have run more smoothly had he publicly explained Smith's dismissal at the time, but despite the urging of associates he thought it was an internal matter and no one else's business.
Under Ford Motor Credit ownership, Smith ran the Astros operation unimpeded. When McMullen came in, Smith lost the control he had. He reacted, in McMullen's view, by being insubordinate and disloyal, behaving rudely toward Jacqueline McMullen, the owner's wife, among other things, and not talking to Robert Harter, whom McMullen named president of the Houston Sports Association.
The clincher came when a top-level official of a Houston newspaper told McMullen that Smith was leaking derogatory stories about him to the newspaper. After confirming the information, McMullen acted.
As recently as this summer, Houston newspaper columnists were still citing the Smith firing as one of McMullen's dastardly acts. Ironically, the dirty deed with Smith always is coupled, as punishable offenses, with the owner's failure to re-sign Nolan Ryan when he was a free agent after the 1988 season. McMullen indeed blundered in not keeping Ryan, but if he had listened to Smith in 1979, he never would have signed the ageless marvel initially.
Smith opposed McMullen's decision to make Ryan baseball's first $1 million-a-year player. Smith did not believe in paying such salaries, and he was a firm believer in developing players in the minor league system rather than signing expensive free agents.
In recent years, McMullen has followed that pattern, but now he is criticized for creating a losing team by maintaining a low payroll. The critics ignore the fact that the Astros are ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers, whose payroll is more than three times that of Houston's.
Ignored is the corps of good young players the Astros have and the excitement the team creates when it sweeps a three-game series from the first-place Cincinnati, takes two of three games from first-place Pittsburgh and opens a monstrous road trip by beating first-place Atlanta twice.
They ignore the $8 million the Astros are spending on their player development system, one of the biggest expenditures among major league clubs. They ignore McMullen's laudable record of hiring members of minorities, like Bob Watson, his assistant general manager, forgetting that the owner tried to hire Joe Morgan, the Hall of Famer, as his manager or general manager well before anyone talked about the need for such appointments.
The critics also have had a field day with the team's four-week road trip, necessitated by McMullen's decision to allow the Republicans to hold their convention at the Astrodome (rent-free, no less).
But not everyone is a critic.
"I'm glad what they did," Tom Pagnozzi, the St. Louis Cardinals catcher, remarked recently. "A lot of economies are suffering, and that owner was willing to say, 'I'll take my club out on the road and help this economy.' Look at the multimillions the convention is going to pump into that economy."
McMullen has had his faults as an owner -- name one who hasn't? -- but unlike some owners, he is not two-faced, saying one thing publicly and acting the opposite way privately. And he certainly is not what some people in Houston paint him to be, but they nevertheless have succeeded in painting him out of the picture.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Ad Campaign;
Bush: Change and Principle . . .

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

 BODY:
Television Script (President Bush speaking): "Everyone wants change. America must change. But change must be guided by principle, and there are three basic principles that must lead our quest for change.
"First, we must control wasteful Government spending. That's absolutely essential for the kind of change the American people want. 
 "And second, we must strengthen the American family. The decline of the American family is hurting the soul of America, and we've got to change that.
"Third, we're a nation of laws. We must increase respect for the law. We must pass strong legislation to help the fight against crime and to back up our police officers and law enforcement officers out on the street.
"These are the kind of changes that America needs, and I'm convinced I can bring about that change."
Producer: November Company, New York.
On the screen: Opens with these words in black letters on a white screen: "Change must be guideed by principle." The Presidential seal is in a corner of the screen. The words dissolve into an earnest looking President Bush, in extreme close up, gazing into the camera. At the end are the words, "President Bush."
Scorecard: The advertisement sounds as if it was produced for a longshot challenger, not an incumbent President. But for this ad, Bush media consultants thought it more effective to seize on the anti-Washington mood than to emphasize the President's accomplishments. While the ad does not attack Gov. Bill Clinton, it seeks to neutralize the Democrat's portrayal of himself as the outsider. The ad also emphasizes themes that are always popular with core Republican voters -- controlling wasteful spending and being tougher on crime -- and makes a pass at one that the Bush campaign has begun emphasizing -- family values.
 
. . . And the Deficit
 Television Script (President Bush speaking): "To get our economy moving faster we have to reduce the huge Federal deficit by cutting spending. The only way to do that with certainty is to pass the Balanced Budget Amendment. And earlier this summer we came nine votes short of getting the two-thirds majority needed to pass it. I'm going to fight to get those nine votes from a new Congress next year and pass the Balanced Budget Amendment."
Producer: November Company, New York.
On the screen: Begins with black letters filling a white screen: "We must reduce the huge Federal deficit." The letters dissolve into an extreme close up of President Bush, speaking directly to the camera. It ends with words on a plain background, "President Bush."
Accuracy: The facts about the budget vote in Congress are correct, but the 30-second commercial does not give the full story. Mr. Bush has never offered a balanced budget to Congress in his years in office, and both proponents and opponents of the amendment agree that the legislation by itself would not balance the budget.
Scorecard: Mr. Bush's Democratic challenger, Bill Clinton repeatedly says that he balanced every budget as Governor of Arkansas (which he is required to do by state law), and this advertisement seeks to neutralize the Federal budget deficit as an issue. Mr. Clinton also likes to remind voters that the national debt has soared in the 12 years Republicans have been in the White House. In this ad, Mr. Bush seeks to blame Congress for that.

HEADLINE: This China Bill Is on Target

 BODY:
This year there doesn't have to be a Washington stalemate on whether to renew China's trading privileges despite its human rights abuses. Congressional human rights champions have come up with a much improved bill. It threatens targeted trade sanctions should Beijing fail to improve its record of repression, trade abuses and reckless weapons exports.
The House has given overwhelming bipartisan approval to the bill, sponsored by Representative Nancy Pelosi of California. Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, is now trying to assemble a veto-proof Senate majority as well. 
 The Pelosi bill would extend Beijing's trading privileges until July, as President Bush asks. But requests for further extensions would have to be accompanied by a report showing "significant progress" in getting Beijing to respect human rights in China and Tibet; release political prisoners; stop the export of goods produced by slave labor, and abide by treaties governing the export of missile technology and nuclear materials. Should China not meet these conditions, tariffs would be increased on exports from its state-controlled industries. Private sector exports would continue to enjoy their present privileges.
This page opposed earlier bills which would have removed low tariff privileges from all Chinese exports. Such a sweeping approach would have hurt the entrepreneurial sectors Americans most want to help. But to impose higher duties on government industries if Beijing continues to violate its international commitments would be entirely appropriate.
The Bush Administration, though endorsing the goals of this legislation, promises a veto. Yet Republicans as well as Democrats have good reason to vote for targeted trade sanctions, aimed at the most obnoxious practices of the world's largest Communist dictatorship.
Through his failure to express American outrage over the Tiananmen tragedy, Mr. Bush has eroded a bipartisan consensus on China. The Senate now has a chance to make America a force for democratic change in China once again.

HEADLINE: Notch Babies Threaten Real Babies

 BODY:
This is a sordid tale of two babies. The first is abused and neglected, living in poverty. The second is a "notch" baby, a retiree born between 1917 and 1921 who claims that Congress has cheated on Social Security benefits. Today, notch babies turn viciously on real babies in an unconscionable attempt to get what's unrightfully theirs.
The battleground is the House floor. At stake is a laudable children's initiative that would provide funds for troubled families, foster care and adoption. Standing in the way are supporters of the notch babies, who plan to propose that the children's bill be amended to increase Social Security benefits. But if the notch babies win, real babies lose: The expensive amendments would make eventual passage virtually impossible. 
 Notch babies have no justified gripe. When Congress revised the formula for Social Security benefits in 1972, it botched the arithmetic and overcompensated for inflation. It corrected the error five years later by phasing out the windfall for new retirees. Under the corrected formula, retirees born before 1917 were allowed to keep their excessive benefits. Retirees born between 1917 and 1921, the notch, would receive a declining portion of the benefits; and everyone born after 1921 would receive only normal benefits.
The notch babies cry foul. So they propose a "fix" that will cost an astonishing $300 billion over 30 years. That's an unforgivable giveaway to an undeserving claimant. The notch babies are receiving every dime they deserve and every bit as much as any succeeding generation.
Last month notch baby supporters tried to hold up the urban aid bill until benefits were hiked. Now they threaten to hold poor kids hostage.

HEADLINE: Milosevic Isn't Hitler, But . . .

 BODY:
"Greater Serbia." "Ethnic cleansing." Civilians transported in sealed buses and railway cars. And now, concentration camps. The chilling reports from Bosnia evoke this century's greatest nightmare, Hitler's genocide against Jews, Gypsies and Slavs.
The parallel, mercifully, is not complete. Serbia's leader, Slobodan Milosevic, does not directly threaten the entire European continent. He does not have one of the world's largest economies at his disposal. His aggressive designs are limited to the Balkans. 
 But by standing aside while he implements his version of the Final Solution, the world sets a frightening precedent for a dozen other areas of ethnic tension. It's not too late to send a firmer message -- through diplomatic ultimatums, backed by the threat of armed intervention. Mr. Milosevic recognizes only one language, military force; the rest of the world may soon have to speak it.
Serbian atrocities are one parallel with Nazi Germany. Another is Europe's peace at any price response. At Munich in 1938, Britain and France agreed to a "peace plan" that forced Czechoslovakia to surrender part of its territory, the Sudetenland, to Hitler. Today, the European Community wants Bosnia to agree to a "political solution" that would surrender part of its territory to Bosnian Serb forces loyal to Mr. Milosevic.
Europe brushes aside Bosnia's request for international enforcement of a cease-fire as a precondition to political talks. Instead, Europe treats Serbian commandos as if they had the same legitimacy as Bosnia's elected Government. Like their predecessors at Munich, Europe's negotiators proceed as if Serbia were negotiating in good faith, despite a string of broken promises and violated cease-fires.
Even now, Mr. Milosevic might be convinced to stay his terror squads by a credible threat of force. Although Yugoslavia's rump army is Europe's third largest, and is fighting on favorable terrain, it is no match for the larger, high-tech forces of NATO or the West European Union.
Yet Britain's Prime Minister, John Major, again rules out military action. His Foreign Minister goes further, asserting that no state would even consider using force against Serbian aggression.
Do Europe's leaders think that if Mr. Milosevic gets what he wants in Bosnia, that will be the end of it? There can be little doubt that he will pursue his "ethnic cleansing" campaign in other parts of the former Yugoslavia, like Kosovo or Macedonia. Or that a successful pogrom in Bosnia will inspire demagogues elsewhere in Europe to adopt the same tactics. Bosnia's Croats and Muslims, the Red Cross reports, already respond to Serbian atrocities with their own gross abuse of human rights.
Diplomacy has one last chance. Later this month, an international conference on Bosnia convenes in London. Not just the European Community, but also the U.S., Russia and the U.N. will be represented. They need to demonstrate that they have learned something from the tragic errors that led to the Second World War. Mr. Milosevic is only a minor-league Hitler. The London Conference must not become a minor-league Munich.

HEADLINE: Clinton Is an Economic Realist

BYLINE: By Paul R. Krugman; Paul R. Krugman, author of "The Age of Diminished Expectations," is professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Republican contentions that Gov. Bill Clinton's economic program is based on reckless taxing and spending are predictable. More important are the concerns of moderates that the blueprint is less substantive than it first seemed -- that, unlike Ross Perot's program, it would do little to reduce the Federal deficit.
It is certainly possible to argue that the Clinton program would do little to hasten a reduction in the budget deficit. Still, the program is pretty good and represents a much-needed change of direction in economic policy. 
 Leave aside Mr. Clinton's hope that he can cut $26 billion a year in non-defense spending as well as his claim that he can reduce the deficit by accelerating growth. There is still a sensible core to his program.
He proposes to invest moderate sums -- less than 1 percent of the gross domestic product -- in child care, education, training and infrastructure. To pay for these investments, he proposes tax increases for the affluent, reforms in taxing foreign corporations and spending cuts, primarily on defense.
The taxes and cuts would amount to $53 billion a year, and the new investment spending to $47 billion a year, so there might be some direct deficit reduction. But Mr. Clinton's main emphasis is on financing new investment, not on cutting the deficit.
The defense cuts are well within the range that reasonable experts believe is feasible. The added revenue from taxes on the rich means rolling back less than 25 percent of the tax break given in the 1980's to the 2 percent of families with the highest incomes. Only the extra revenue from foreign corporations looks shaky, but it is surely true that some additional revenue can be captured.
Investment in the nation's infrastructure, neglected for 12 years, is badly needed. So patching the holes in our fraying transportation, communications and sanitation systems means high payoffs. The evidence suggests that, with one-fifth of the nation's children below the poverty line, Head Start and other programs for children are also investments with high economic (not to mention human) payoffs.
But shouldn't everything else be put on hold until the deficit monster has been slain? The budget deficit, estimated at $372 billion for fiscal 1992, is serious, but it is not our only -- even our main -- economic problem.
Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently estimated that the deficits of the 1980's reduced the growth rate of the economy's productive capacity in that decade by about 0.3 percent. This figure, which most economists would agree is in the ball park , is not insignificant. But it represents only a small part of the woes of an economy in which median family income rose 2.8 percent a year from 1947 to 1973 but has been virtually stagnant ever since.
There is no reason to think that eliminating the deficit would end our malaise. If we balanced the budget by 1996, instead of running the deficit the Congressional Budget Office projects, a reasonable estimate is that our long-term growth rate would rise by only about 0.25 percent.
A President with unlimited political power could balance the budget and simultaneously find the resources to spend on urgent investment needs. In the real world, choices must be made. If a President can save $1 billion through feasible cuts in spending or raise $1 billion by taxing high-income families, should that money be used to reduce the deficit or help repair bridges and finance Head Start? Mr. Clinton's answer is that investments should have first priority. He's right.
Ross Perot, with a single-minded focus on the deficit, proposed inflicting far more pain than Mr. Clinton is willing to consider. But that doesn't make the Perot program better. The Clinton investment plan would probably do more for growth than Mr. Perot's frontal assault on the deficit.
By contrast, President Bush has no economic plan at all. His only significant initiative is a proposal to cut capital gains taxes -- which would worsen the deficit, do little to stimulate private investment and do nothing at all to meet our increasingly desperate needs for investment in the infrastructure and in children.

HEADLINE: BROWN'S RESIGNATION;
Brown Abruptly Resigns His Police Post

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Lee P. Brown resigned suddenly as New York City's Police Commissioner yesterday, jolting the nation's largest police force and raising questions about whether his grand scheme of remaking the department by putting more police officers back on the street will be fully achieved.
The resignation was announced at a hastily arranged news conference at City Hall where Mayor David N. Dinkins also said that David W. Scott, the department's highest ranking uniformed officer, would step down. 
 Mr. Brown, who took control of the department two years ago, said he was leaving to spend more time with his ailing wife, Yvonne. Top police officials, who insisted on anonymity, said Mrs. Brown had cancer. Mr. Brown refused to discuss her condition.
 
Said Little of Wife's Illness
 Mr. Dinkins said that he had known of Mrs. Brown's health problems for several months. But several close aides to Mr. Brown, who described the Commissioner as an intensely private man, said that he had never discussed his wife's illness before Sunday night, when he told them of his plans to leave.
In some recent public appearances, Mr. Brown had expressed a determination to stay in New York and put the police back on the streets where they can win the trust of communities under siege from lawless elements.
While he had long been a national advocate of this approach, he said it was crucial at a time when tension between residents and the police had fueled the recent riots in Los Angeles and posed danger in other cities.
Mayor Dinkins said that Commissioner Brown informed him last Tuesday that he planned to step down because of his wife's condition, but the Mayor said that he kept the news to himself until he had time to act on it.
 
Effective Sept. 1
 Mr. Brown submitted his resignation, effective Sept. 1, to Mr. Dinkins on Sunday night at a private dinner at Gracie Mansion, the Mayor's official residence. The Mayor appointed Mr. Brown's chief deputy, Raymond Kelly, a 29-year veteran of the force, to be acting commissioner.
Mr. Brown's resignation comes at a difficult time for the Dinkins administration: In recent months it has been at odds with the Police Department following charges of police corruption and excessive force in the racial unrest in Washington Heights. Last month, Mayor Dinkins announced his support for an all-civilian complaint review board, while Mr. Brown has adamantly supported keeping the board mixed with police and civilians.
Such public disagreements led to speculation around City Hall that Mr. Brown had been pressured to leave or that he was angry with the administration's handling of the review-board issue and had decided to leave.
At the news conference, Mr. Brown rejected such notions, saying: "My priorities are quite clear. My family comes first." The Commissioner said that he planned to return to Houston, where he served as police commissioner before coming to New York in 1990 and where he will teach criminal justice at Texas Southern University.
Mr. Brown said he would move to Houston because he had two daughters attending college there and the family would be closer while his wife receives medical treatment. When pressed for details about his wife's health at a meeting with reporters at Police Headquarters he said: "I have already said all I intend to say about my wife. She is a private person."
Because his wife's condition had worsened in recent months, Mr. Brown said, he had been speaking with several universities about a teaching position.
Mayor Dinkins said that he understood and supported the Commissioner's decision to leave the force to devote more time to his family and that he would be sorely missed. "It's a very sad moment," Mr. Dinkins said. "I did not try to talk him out of it. It was not negotiable. It would challenge our relationship if I tried to talk him out of it."
Mr. Brown was the architect of the administration's plan to increase public safety by remaking the police force. That vision included increasing the number of officers on foot patrol and encouraging them to form community ties and enlist the help of residents in solving crimes, a concept known as community policing.
The Mayor praised Mr. Brown's short tenure as Police Commissioner, saying that he had laid the foundation for achieving that vision with more officers patrolling the streets and a significant decline in crime, despite a national trend upward.
 
Efforts Praised
 Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, a private police watchdog group, called Mr. Brown a "champion of public safety" and said that community policing would probably have never come to New York City without the Commissioner's drive and talents. "I'm really sorry to see him go because he really has made a difference in a very short time," he said.
Phil Caruso, head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said that he was saddened by Mr. Brown's departure because the Commissioner had shown himself to be an expert manager who really understood the conditions that police officers face and who had worked to improve them. "He's been a man of his word, and we liked him," Mr. Caruso said.
Mr. Brown's plan for putting police officers back on the streets is far from complete. So far, every precinct has divided its area into geographic beats and the number of "community patrol officers" who are assigned to watch over those areas has been increased to 40, from 10. But only one precinct -- the 72d in Sunset Park, Brooklyn -- has switched its entire force to that model. And the entire department is still being trained in new techniques aimed at seeking innovative solutions to crime rather than responding to emergencies.
"Community policing has yet to go into high gear," Mr. Reppetto said.
 
Search Panel to Be Appointed
 Mr. Dinkins said that he would soon appoint a search committee to begin evaluating candidates to succeed Mr. Brown, and is likely to face tremendous pressure from his core constituents to choose a Hispanic or black commissioner. The corruption inquiry will also put pressure on the Mayor to choose an outsider.
But yesterday the Mayor said that the search would not be limited to black candidates, and that he was looking for "the most qualified person for Police Commissioner."
Mr. Dinkins said that Acting Commissioner Kelly, who is white and a veteran of the force, would not be excluded from consideration.
Chief Scott, who has been on the force for 30 years, said he would retire because of poor health. He refused to elaborate but several police officials said that they were aware that he had been having health problems for some time.
 The Housing Commissioner's correct name is Felice L. Michetti, and she remains in the post.
The correct name of Ms. Hernandez-Pinero's predecessor is Laura D. Blackburne; she is thus former chairwoman of the Housing Authority, not former Housing Commissioner.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS
Taubman Centers, a Mall Empire, to Go Public;
Still Dealing And Living In 80's Style

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Contrary to the talk from the Hamptons' links to London's auction rooms, A. Alfred Taubman is not going bust, at least if his extravagant life style is any indicator. At a time when developers are struggling to survive, the 67-year-old shopping center and real estate magnate is acting as if the 80's never ended.
He is still collecting art, still playing host to parties at his homes in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; Manhattan; Southampton; London and Palm Beach, still playing golf and attending game-hunting parties and still globetrotting in his private jet. He has money in the bank, $130 million to be exact -- the proceeds from the sale of part of his stake in Sotheby's, the auction house he bought nine years ago. He remains chairman and still owns $170 million worth of Sotheby's stock. 
 Now, Mr. Taubman is even looking to expand his billion-dollar empire by building more shopping centers or buying existing ones, despite the distressed retail climate. He is also going public with his company, he said, to make it easier to finance expansion.
 
Planning for Expansion
 "Years ago there were plenty of funds available from banks, but banks are overextended these days," Mr. Taubman said in an interview earlier this summer. "By issuing a public offering we are giving people an opportunity to become investors in a profitable and successful business."
And in a revamping connected to the public offering, Mr. Taubman and his family are effectively being forgiven $450 million in personal loans.
Whether he is discussing Monets or malls, Mr. Taubman is a gifted salesman. With a Midwestern twang and the gusto of a used-car salesman, he seems to think anything is believable -- even that the recession has not affected his business.
Real estate executives, fearful of Mr. Taubman's power, would talk about him only on condition of anonymity. What they are saying is that his decision to take the shopping centers public has been in the works for years but that now he is being forced to raise money to cover some losses. The setbacks, they say, have come both from real estate investments like 712 Fifth Avenue, the landmark office building between 55th and 56th Streets that also houses Henri Bendel, and his retailing investment in Woodward & Lothrop, the Washington-based department store chain.
The office building is 50 percent vacant. Woodward, which he bought for $162 million in 1984 and for which he has guaranteed more than $300 million in loans, reported a $43.6 million loss last year, company officials say.
Nevertheless, the 6-foot-3-inch developer still thinks big and talks big. "I'm not liquidating assets; I'm repositioning them," he said, sitting in his office at 712 Fifth Avenue behind an oversized conference table custom-designed by Michael Graves, the Princeton, N.J., architect. (The space next door he rented to his old friend John Gutfreund, who resigned as chairman of Salomon Brothers after that firm's Treasury market scandal last summer).
"I'm looking at my business long term," Mr. Taubman said.
Since he started his business 42 years ago, Mr. Taubman has been given credit for the evolution of plain suburban shopping centers, once referred to as "strip centers," into architecturally designed, multi-storied structures that his colleagues say are an art form in their own right. His are the most extravagant and elite -- and some of the priciest for tenants. They are filled with such high-end retailers as Bottega Veneta and Ralph Lauren, Saks Fifth Avenue and Yves Saint Laurent.
But it has not been so easy to fill his two real estate holdings in Manhattan -- 712 Fifth Avenue and the 34-story, 515-foot-tall granite and glass building at 1325 Avenue of the Americas, developed in collaboration with Edward J. Minskoff Equities.
"I paid $12 million a year and a half ago and am a limited partner," Mr. Taubman said of 1325 Avenue of the Americas, at 54th Street. "That's my total responsibility."
The other building, 712 Fifth Avenue, is a rockier tale. Housed in the old Rizzoli building, it was originally a team effort between the Taubman Company and Salomon Equities. But when Salomon Equities went bankrupt two years ago, the Taubman Company became the project's managing partner. Of the office space, Mr. Taubman says that so far it is about 50 percent leased, which he acknowledges is a blow. "But it's certainly not making a change in my life style," he said.
 
A Shift in Retailing
 Little, it seems, does make a dent in his life. Many retailers say the developer is throwing away money on what appears to be a losing proposition in Woodward & Lothrop. Nordstrom, Macy and other national retailers have moved in on and conquered its traditional turf in Washington and Philadelphia. Some investors are asking how Woodward can make it when Garfinckel's, Washington's high-end local department store, was forced out of business by this crowd.
Mr. Taubman is moving the company in a new direction, to fill a gap in what he perceives the public needs and wants -- high-end home stores. His new free-standing stores are not meant to compete with Ikea or Conran's, but to appeal to a more affluent shopper. So far he has opened two Woodward & Lothrop Home Stores in shopping centers in the Washington area, and he reports they are performing well. But the company can provide no figures to back up the claim.
 
People 'Thought I Was Crazy'
 "We realize we have to lose money for a while, but we've made the important initial investment," Mr. Taubman said. "People may think it's a crazy investment, but people thought I was crazy when I bought Sotheby's."
 Indeed, in Sotheby's he managed to make a profit from the time he bought the company in 1983, marrying his lifelong passion for art with his skill as a retailer and developer. Mr. Taubman's flair for retailing helped transform Sotheby's from a sleepy auctioneer frequented mostly by dealers to a one-stop shopping center that offers a broader mix of customers everything from financing to appraisals, repairs and sales.
In the 80's, the formula worked; speculators loved being seen bidding in public. Now, however, Sotheby's, along with the rest of the auction business, is suffering from a sluggish economy. When the company released its end-of-season figures last week, it reported sales of $1.14 billion, a decline of 15.5 percent from last season.
Sotheby's is also watching a gradual erosion of its market share and stock price. Seven years ago, the auction house had 60 percent of the market, while archrival Christie's had 40 percent. Now, Sotheby's reports it has 52 percent.
Still, Mr. Taubman insists his decision to sell a bulk of the company's shares had little to do with the economy or his own personal finances. "The company has a great name and a great future," he said. "I still have control of it, and I still feel I can be important to Sotheby's."
"But I'm 67 years old," he added. "It's time to start planning for the future." For this week at least, Mr. Taubman is in Europe, joining his wife, Judy, who was in Paris attending the fall couture shows.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about the real estate developer A. Alfred Taubman misstated the name of a former co-owner of a building at 712 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in some editions. It is Solomon Equities. The article also described the company's financial condition incorrectly. It has never declared bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
A Quiet Bond Market Awaits Data

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market's focus turned yesterday toward Friday's unemployment report for July and the auction of around $36 billion of Treasury notes and bonds next week.
The uncertainty before both events, combined with some mixed economic data, made for a quiet day in the market as a lot of investors stayed on the sidelines. But yesterday was notable as Salomon Brothers returned as a full-time player in the bond market for the first time since its Treasury auction scandal was disclosed a year ago this Sunday. 
 The firm's suspensions were lifted effective yesterday by the Federal Reserve and by the Treasury. Salomon, which was suspended by the Treasury last Aug. 18, can now bid for its customers in Treasury auctions again. For almost the last year, it could bid only for its own account.
On June 1, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York suspended Salomon from trading government securities with the Fed. These are transactions that the central bank does with its primary dealers to control the growth rate of the nation's money supply.
 
A Mood for a Market
 The unemployment report on Friday may establish a mood for a market that has been through several emotional swings lately and is now waiting to see if the direction will change again. The report could determine if the recent rally in the long bond will continue and push interest rates through their January lows toward levels not seen since 1986.
The tone set Friday will also be important for the three quarterly Treasury auctions next week. A stall in the rally may lessen the appetite for the notes and bonds to be sold, depriving the Government of some small savings on its interest bill. The details of the auctions will be announced Wednesday.
It was the surprisingly gloomy June report, which pushed the unemployment report up to 7.8 percent, that set off the rally in the market, which surged for most of July until it ran out of steam at the end of last week.
As of now, the consensus seems to be that there will be no big surprises, with the level of nonfarm jobs expected to rise about as much as the 117,000 decline in June.
To some, like John Costas, managing director of government trading and sales at the First Boston Corporation, an unemployment report of this kind would "reverse the weakness of last month but not show any real strength." And this, he said, would mean that yield on the 30-year bond, which was at 7.44 percent in late trading yesterday, compared with 7.45 percent on Friday, would continue to decline after the quarterly Treasury auctions next week. And he said the yield would break through the January low of 7.38 percent.
But Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J., thinks that the employment data will be stronger, in fact, about twice the consensus, with nonfarm payroll jobs rising about 200,000. One of his reasons for this forecast is technical, not economic. The jobs survey was taken much later in the month in July than in June, which means that there is more time for the usual stream of summer hirees to be counted.
For him, this stronger number would mean that the rally of July would be over, at least for the rest of the summer.
"If these kinds of numbers came out, I think you would see the market stalling out here," he said. "But I don't think you would see any significant rise in interest rates."
 
Home-Mortgage Refinancings
 The fact that interest rates would not rise significantly is the important factor. If this is the case -- even with stronger employment data than the consensus forecast -- then the window of opportunity for refinancing home mortgages will stay open much longer than it did in January, when long-term yields hit their recent low.
In January, that window was open for only about two weeks because the bond market reacted negatively to signals, which later proved faulty, that a healthy economic recovery was getting under way.
The market for mortgage-backed securities has been hit hard in the last two to three weeks because the refinancings mean that people holding the securities may be paid much sooner than expected. This leaves them with cash that will probably have to be invested at lower interest rates and faces others with losses because many of the mortgage securities were selling at premiums to their face or par value. But the prepayment is at the par value.
In the bond market yesterday, Treasury securities were buffeted early in the day by the report of the National Association of Purchasing Management, which said that its index of economic activity rose to 54.2 percent in July from 52.8 percent in June.
The increase was difficult to interpret. It was up but a little less than some forecasters had expected. Its employment component seemed to signal continued slow growth. Its inflation index was up a little. Bonds and notes fell, then rose, and ended little changed for the day. By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 106 18/32, up 1/8 point to yield 7.44 percent, compared with 7.45 percent on Friday.
The five- and seven-year Treasury notes, which had fallen sharply at the end of last week, were basically unchanged for the day.
In the weekly auction of Treasury bills, the three-month bill was sold at an average discount rate of 3.20 percent, up from 3.18 percent last week. The average discount rate on the six-month bill was 3.30 percent, up from 3.27 percent a week ago. This is the second consecutive week that the discount rates have risen. The rates had fallen 43 basis points, from 3.59 to 3.16, for the three-month bill, and 42 basis points, from 3.66 to 3.24, for the six-month bill, after the Federal Reserve cut its discount rate July 2.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three-month and six-month Treasury bill:

HEADLINE: How Escobar, a Rare Jailbird, Lined His Nest

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ENVIGADO, Colombia, July 31

 BODY:
The image of Pablo Escobar lounging on his prison water bed while coordinating shipments of tons of cocaine to the United States on his cellular telephone is not quite accurate, say lawyers who visited the trafficker in his hillside jail here.
First of all, Colombia's wealthiest citizen had to make do with a foam mattress until his water bed was installed last year. Second, until he received his cellular phone he had only the rustic services of the 50 carrier pigeons in his personal prison aviary. 
 Finally, the lawyers say, the 42-year-old Mr. Escobar was not one to work in bed, and presided over his business meetings at the head of a proper boardroom table. He also enjoyed the use of an office equipped with a computer linked by modem to a national computer network.
What about charges that Mr. Escobar continued trafficking until he escaped from the jail on July 22?
"It was important to have him physically detained, but no one really thought he would stop trafficking," said Juan Guillermo Sepulveda, a lawyer from nearby Medellin who, as local state prosecutor, helped negotiate Mr. Escobar's surrender June 19, 1991.
In the wake of Mr. Escobar's escape, formerly tight-lipped officials are coming forward with a flood of new information confirming long-held suspicions that the fenced-off complex overlooking this suburb was not the trafficker's jail but his fortress, a cage that he was able to gild to his liking and from which it appears he could have escaped whenever he wanted.
But there was little reason for Mr. Escobar to want to leave, not until the Government began a crackdown last month to reassert control over the prison. With the state paying his security bill, Mr. Escobar quickly developed the comforts of home in his prison compound.
For exercise, there was a soccer field and a personal gymnasium. He spruced up his personal living quarters with rugs, walk-in closets, a video cassette player, a stereo system, a bar, a refrigerator, a 60-inch color television and a whirlpool bath. The living quarters included a reception area with a wood-burning fireplace. The police also discovered large quantities of pornographic magazines and videos.
"Pablo Escobar's rooms looked like a wealthy bachelor's pad," an official in the state prosecutor's office told the newspaper El Tiempo on Friday. "It seems to have been designed by an interior decorator. The colors of the rugs, curtains and bedspreads match perfectly."
[Two weeks after Mr. Escobar and nine of his cohorts escaped, police officials are increasingly pessimistic that the nationwide manhunt will have any success. On Aug. 4, the authorities announced that overflights of Medellin by United States military spy planes had ended. "It's very difficult to predict the outcome," Fernando Brito, director of Colombia's intelligence police, said in an interview in Bogota. "Escobar is a very wily man and he has very great economic power. We are confronting the world's most powerful criminal."]
Short of domestic servants in luxurious prison, Mr. Escobar impressed several of his guards to serve as bartenders and waiters during his parties, photographs confiscated at the prisons indicate.
The police also found a large selection of women's underwear, leading them to conclude that the prisoners received frequent visits from prostitutes. But one photograph taken at a prison party shows a male trafficker dressed up in women's clothing.
"The whole spectacle is disgusting," Colombia's Attorney General, Gustavo de Greiff, said after inspecting the prison and reviewing a series of party photographs. "It is absolutely incredible that no one rang the alarm bell, that no one said anything."
The authorities suspect that a food truck with a false bottom may have smuggled in the contraband items seized from lockers after Mr. Escobar's escape: computers, pistols, tear-gas masks, radiotelephones, a cellular phone and bundles of United States currency.
But not all of Mr. Escobar's comforts were obtained illicitly. Correspondence between officials and lawyers for Mr. Escobar in the period leading up to his surrender to the authorities shows the lawyers won guarantees of Mr. Escobar's freedom to choose his guards and to design his jail, nicknamed The Cathedral.
Inside the jail, 17 members of the 28-man guard service were picked by Mr. Escobar's allies in the municipal government of Envigado, his power base for two decades. Dressed in civilian clothes, these 17 guards patrolled the jail's innermost security ring, a report issued on Thursday by Colombia's National Association of Prison Guards said.
Their shift from prison guard to bodyguard became apparent during the army's recent early-morning assault to reassert control over Mr. Escobar and his 14 fellow inmates. While guards from the federal service offered no resistance, seven of the Envigado guards fought back, and one was wounded.
"Look at the prison guards like a presidential guard," Jose Salomon Lozano, one of Mr. Escobar's lawyers, suggested in an interview in Medellin. "They have to respond for the life of the President. They cannot allow an attack from the outside. Enemies can appear disguised as soldiers."
The army assault was prompted in part by Mr. Escobar's refusal to allow security changes at The Cathedral. According to a Government report made public last week, an engineering company inspected the jail last October and pronounced it "very vulnerable" to escape.
In January, Fernando Carrillo Florez, then Colombia's Justice Minister, maintained that the prison "does not fulfill the minimum requirements for a high-security jail." He recommended a $4 million construction plan, including fencing off prisoners' free access to the eight-acre prison grounds and fortifying perimeters with concertina wire, land mines and electronic sensors.
But work progressed slowly. On June 8, it stopped entirely after "two prisoners demanded that the contractors suspend work," the Government report said. Unhappy with the changes, Mr. Escobar summoned a crew of Envigado city workers, who started to tear down an offending stretch of electrified fence. Army officers ordered that the fence be put back up.
"As soon as work resumed, 10 prisoners intimidated and beat the construction foremen and, with death threats, demanded suspension of work," the log reported for June 12. "Work was suspended."
To back up their threats, several prisoners photographed the construction workers and said they would be killed if they were ever seen again in Envigado.
Suspicious that Mr. Escobar might have ordered the construction of an escape tunnel, Colombia's Defense Minister, Rafael Pardo, ordered the air force to take infrared photographs of the prison grounds, a technique that allows detection of tunnels.
On June 27, an air force plane made a successful photo run, eluding fire from a prison antiaircraft battery. The photographs did not reveal tunneling activity.
 
Bombing of Prison Feared
 The antiaircraft battery had been installed in response to Mr. Escobar's fear that his numerous enemies -- drug rivals, relatives of murder victims, or the United States Government -- would try to bomb the prison.
Indeed, on March 9 the police in El Salvador announced the arrest of nine people who allegedly had shipped three 500-pound bombs to Cali, Colombia. Arrested members of the Salvadoran Air Force said Cali's cocaine cartel intended to use the bombs to obliterate their Medellin rivals in prison here.
On Mr. Escobar's orders, construction workers dug a rudimentary bomb shelter. Civil aviation authorities closed the airspace over the prison and guards had standing orders to douse the lights if a plane entered the area at night. The traffickers also controlled the prison's electrical system, an advantage they may have put to use when they escaped in the early hours of July 22 during a mysterious three-minute blackout.
Many people here believe that the Mr. Escobar had slipped out of jail on several previous occasions.
"Since September, my in-laws have been saying that Escobar has been seen around town," an American woman living in Envigado said. "I guess he was tired of being locked up and went out for joy rides."
 
His Daughter's Message
 Mr. Sepulveda, the lawyer, recalled that during a jail visit last year the trafficker told him, "Here I have what I like -- books, soccer and my family."
During his 13-month jail stay, Mr. Escobar refused to permit the police to take identity photographs. The only known photographs of Mr. Escobar taken inside the jail, published this week in Semana magazine, show a heavy-set family man with a mustache surrounded by his wife, Victoria Eugenia Henao, his 15-year-old son, Juan Pablo, and his 4-year-old daughter, Manuela, who held a pet white rabbit.
"Daddy, I love you, and I send you Colombia's biggest kiss," Manuela chirped in a radio message the day her father fled the jail.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Weakness in a G.O.P. Citadel Threatens Bush in California

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Aug. 4

 BODY:
The sunny, deeply conservative political terrain of Orange County has served as the staging ground of Nixonism and the Reagan Revolution. Now it may prove the Waterloo of the Republican heir of those two Presidents, George Bush.
A deep disaffection over President Bush, from both his right and left, is spreading through this traditional bastion of Republican strength. The Republican leadership has been shaken by recent polls showing the President trailing the Democratic nominee, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas -- and this in a county where Mr. Bush whipped Gov. Michael S. Dukakis four years ago by a 69-to-31-percent margin.
 
A Change of Heart
 The disaffected include Patricia Cox, a longtime resident active in social and charitable affairs who says she has voted Republican since she went for Thomas E. Dewey in his losing race against Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. But as she peered out over Upper Newport Bay from the shady lawn of her large home she declared herself a Clinton backer. 
 "I can't believe Bush's stand on choice and fetal-tissue research," Mrs. Cox, 70 years old, said with dismay.
The change of heart may have come more from events in her life than from anything politicians have done. George Bush, after all, had the same stance against abortion and tissue experiments four years ago. But since then, Mrs. Cox's battle against cancer and the illnesses of several relatives have altered her perspective on issues that are both medical and personal.
A few miles from Mrs. Cox's home, in the sleek business parks of Irvine, Roger W. Johnson, a former Bush contributor who is chairman of the board of the Western Digital Corporation, a maker of computer parts, is preparing to forsake Republican roots that go back to the Eisenhower and Goldwater days, but for a different reason: the slumping economy. "He's made an art form out of doing nothing," Mr. Johnson said of the President. "They don't know what's going on in the country. We cannot compete internationally; the schools are in shambles; people cannot get health care."
The President's backers insist his stock will rise after the Republican National Convention, which begins in two weeks in Houston, and when wavering Republicans here confront the awful prospect of actually voting Democratic. But they nevertheless fear that Mr. Bush will not carry Orange County by a large enough margin to offset the normally heavy Democratic pluralities in the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas. At stake are California's 54 electoral votes.
"The President's in very serious difficulty," said Allan E. Hoffenblum, a Republican political consultant in Los Angeles. "If he's in trouble in Orange County, he's in trouble, period. Bush will carry Orange County, but the question is, will he get just 52 percent? Any time a Republican gets less than 60 percent in Orange County, he loses the state."
No Republican since 1880 has won the Presidency without carrying California.
 
Sensing the Urgency
 Evidently sensing the urgency, the President has visited California five times this year, most recently Thursday. He came to Orange County, spoke at the Anaheim plant of a robotics maker and tried to appeal to concern for military preparedness.
For now, the news is mostly bad for the President:
*A poll by The Orange County Register on July 16-17, just after the Democratic National Convention, found Governor Clinton leading the President in the county, 42 to 35 percent, with former backers of Ross Perot going for Mr. Clinton by nearly two to one. The poll of 403 registered voters had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.
A Field Poll taken July 22-27 gave Mr. Clinton what the poll called a "phenomenal" 62-to-28 percent lead over Mr. Bush statewide, the largest lead ever for a Presidential candidate in the 45-year history of the poll. The poll of 1,192 adults had a margin of error of three percentage points.
*An editorial in the libertarian Orange County Register Sunday called on President Bush to quit the race, saying he has "shown too much of a willingness to work in tandem with Congressional Democrats."
*A poll July 25-27 by Fairbank, Maullin & Associates, a Democratic survey firm in Santa Monica, put the Clinton lead at 52 to 26 percent in California. The poll of 800 voters had a margin of error of four percentage points.
All of this comes against a backdrop of a county of 2.4 million people which, while still 79 percent white and 55 percent Republican by registration, has long outgrown its caricature image of wealthy right-wing zealots battling Communism, taxation and big government. Moreover, its economy, heavily dependent on Government aerospace and military contracts, has suffered in the recession.
"This translates into more people who were living a blissful, middle-class life who are now unemployed or threatened by unemployment," said Richard Maullin of the survey firm. "And as it continues to urbanize, the county becomes more complex. It has a growing minority population, and substantial numbers of Democrats. It just doesn't fit the conservative stereotype as much as it used to."
In all this, President Bush has appeared to many residents to be remote and detached from California's problems. And the Republican ranks are increasingly influenced by business-oriented young people who are put off by the Bush-Quayle attempts to appeal to the religious right, abortion foes and "family" values.
"You have a lot of young, under 35, swing Republicans," said Mr. Hoffenblum, the Republican consultant. "They're conservative on economic issues, but not on social and environmental ones. They were originally part of the Democratic base that the Republicans picked up during the 80's. They're uncomfortable with the religious right." Mr. Hoffenblum might have added that these are the very people Mr. Clinton is wooing.
David L. Scott is one of these people. He moved to Orange County from Texas almost three years ago and quickly became involved in Republican politics, giving $500 a year to the local party and serving on the board of directors of the Silver Circle, a fund-raising group. But Mr. Scott, 30-year-old director of government relations for a computer software company, is now leaning toward Mr. Clinton.
"I look at Bush and see a nice guy who is going in circles," said Mr. Scott. He said he recently wrote the Republican Party complaining that it should avoid getting involved in "endorsing social viewpoints," like the abortion issue.
 
The Abortion Issue
 Indeed, the abortion issue appears to have been a major factor for Republican women in the county, where the polls show there is strong backing for a woman's right to choose, as there is in California generally. Last Thursday, Anita M. Mangels of Laguna Beach, who says she has never voted Democratic, led a demonstration against President Bush at his Anaheim visit.
"First and foremost, I am pro-choice," said Ms. Mangels, laid off from her job with a real estate developer. She said she felt betrayed by President Bush when he agreed to raise taxes.
Greg Haskin, executive director of the Orange County Republican Party, said he was confident that Mr. Bush's support would solidify once memories of the Democratic convention faded and the President began his campaign in earnest. He disputed suggestions that the abortion issue was crucial.
"We've had eight years of pro-life Ronald Reagan and four years of pro-life George Bush," he said. "The economy is the important factor."
For some time, California Republican leaders have been warning the White House. "Clinton is receiving a massive Republican crossover, which is very unusual in a county where Republican loyalty is so high," said Tony Quinn, a Republican strategist in Sacramento. "What you're seeing is the Bush Administration's general neglect of California's economic interests.
But Mark Baldassare, a poll-taker and longtime student of Orange County politics who teaches urban planning at the University of California at Irvine, warns against writing off Mr. Bush. "There is so much pent-up frustration right now, so many people looking for a way out of the economic malaise," he said. "But if Bush can come up with a plan to make people regain confidence, he'll get the voters back."
Still, Larry Thomas, a longtime Orange County public relations adviser to the national Republican Party, said many in the local party had been urging the White House to reassure Californians, to demonstrate that "what they are seeing is not the absolute demise of one of the great states in the nation but a painful restructuring, that there is some hope."

HEADLINE: 3 Countries Move Closer to Free-Trade Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Canada, Mexico and the United States made steady progress today toward agreement on a North American free-trade accord, pushing to fashion a single broad compromise on a short list of small but politically touchy differences.
The final step is likely to come this week, possibly as soon as Wednesday morning but more likely on Thursday or Friday, people involved in the negotiations said. Differences on all of the remaining sticking points in the negotiations, including the contentious issues of trade in automobiles, energy and textiles, were narrowing. 
 A few smaller issues also remained, including how quickly tariffs would be reduced on products like beer and glass.
President Bush is eager to announce the agreement personally, and will not be in Washington until Thursday night, people involved in the negotiations said. So the final touches may not be put on the pact until then, with a series of news conferences taking place on Friday.
As an agreement grew near, the Administration and its allies among Congressional Republicans began gearing up their effort to sell the anticipated pact to lawmakers.
Seeking to garner Democratic votes, two senior Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee endorsed late Monday a resolution calling for the free-trade pact not to hurt American health, safety or environmental standards.
Kathleen A. Lydon, the chief spokeswoman for Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said that the resolution, sponsored by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, did not contradict the agreement. The House is scheduled to consider the nonbinding resolution on Thursday.
"They're going to try to hug us to death," said a Democratic Congressional aide.
The talks were expected to continue until Wednesday morning.
During 13 months of talks covering everything from truck routes to avocado diseases, trade officials from the three countries have frequently said each sector of the economy would be handled separately.
But now the principle of matching concessions within industries is fraying as the negotiators assemble their final list of differences and try to resolve them in one final deal.
Gradual progress was made on some issues, like textiles and oil shipments, this morning. Mexico gave a partial guarantee to the United States that it would continue supplying oil during international crises. Negotiators also neared agreement on a requirement that cars have slightly more than 60 percent of their value produced in North America to qualify for duty-free treatment.
But most of the remaining disagreements, notably involving trade in automobiles and rules for resolving commercial disputes, are down to a few sticking points where compromises involving several industries may be made.
In the auto dispute, American negotiators are close to paying for a recent concession benefiting American workers with a concession to Mexico that would hurt the same workers, rather than with, say, a concession that would hurt American farmers or aircraft industry workers.
Mexico agreed 10 days ago in Mexico City to abolish over 10 years its complicated system for restricting car imports, a move that should help American auto makers and their employees. People with detailed information on the negotiations said today that in exchange, the United States might quickly exempt Mexico from the current 25 percent tariff on imported pickup trucks. Mexico currently produces few trucks, but reducing the tariff would make truck production much more attractive.
A report of the tentative American concession first appeared in The Journal of Commerce today.
Car and truck imports are a sensitive political issue, particularly in an election year. Last week, the House passed a broad bill on tariffs that would reclassify mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles as light trucks instead of as cars, subjecting them to the 25 percent duty.
Representative Sander M. Levin, the Michigan Democrat who sponsored the vehicle section of the House bill, was leery of the American concession. He said in an interview that detailed studies should be done before the lawmakers considered the agreement.
"Nobody has analyzed it, and before it's submitted it needs to be analyzed," Mr. Levin said.
Steven M. Beckman, the international economist for the United Automobile Workers, said the union opposed any exceptions from the stiff tariff on light trucks. The Bush Administration has insisted that the accord being negotiated must eventually eliminate all tariffs on trade within the continent.
But people involved in the negotiations defended a reduction in truck tariffs, saying its effect would be limited. New Japanese and European assembly plants in Mexico would not qualify for the exemption, and American companies would find it too expensive to close their existing factories in the United States and replace them with factories in Mexico, they said.

HEADLINE: IRAQ FOOD IMPORTS ARE SAID TO DROP

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Iraq's imports of basic foods like rice, sugar, cooking oil and tea have fallen sharply in recent weeks, say Government officials here and private traders in the Jordanian capital who traditionally handle most of that country's import needs.
Iraqi merchants have virtually ceased placing new orders here for some weeks now, their Jordanian counterparts say, apparently because of the disruption caused by a more than 50 percent fall in the value of the Iraqi dinar last month and after Baghdad executed some 40 merchants it had accused of profiteering. 
 This sudden devaluation of the dinar, which pushed the Iraqi currency down from about 14 dinars to the dollar to 22 or 24, and the disruption it caused may represent a first success for a reported plan by the Central Intelligence Agency in Saudi Arabia to destabilize President Saddam Hussein's Government by flooding Iraq with forged dinar notes in order to create hyperinflation.
 
A Sharp Drop in Imports
 The total flow of Iraqi imports through the Jordanian Red Sea port of Aqaba -- most of which consists of staple foods -- has dropped sharply from a 1992 peak of 550,000 tons in May to 160,000 tons in June and only 80,000 tons in July, the Jordanian Finance Minister, Basel Jardaneh, said in an interview.
With private Iraqi merchants no longer ordering, most of this food is now being imported by the Baghdad Government, which provides Iraqis with a basic monthly food ration at very low prices.
Mr. Jardaneh said he could not explain the fall, but he speculated it might either mean Iraq has sufficient stocks to last for a while or that it is running low on dollars to pay for new supplies.
While Iraq traditionally imports flour and processed foods from neighboring Turkey, Syria and Iran, the port of Aqaba is the cheapest entry point for rice, sugar, cooking oil and tea, which come by ship from the Far East.
Jordan's Finance Minister insisted the Government is strictly enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq by allowing it to import only food and medicine and certain other supplies approved on humanitarian grounds by the Security Council.
He said Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d had appeared satisfied with Jordan's enforcement procedures after being briefed on the situation when he visited Amman on July 21.
In June, after an American intelligence estimate that 30 percent of the goods crossing from Jordan into Iraq violated sanctions, the United States Director of Central Intelligence, Robert Gates, visited Amman in an unsuccessful effort to persuade King Hussein to install United Nations monitors on the border to check what was being exported to Iraq.
But the visit led to a sharp tightening of Jordanian controls, diplomats here say, which appear to have eliminated many sanctions violations.
 
Truck Traffic Drops
 Foreign journalists who visited the main Jordan-Iraq border crossing at El Ruweished on Monday were told by the customs director, Aziz Bsoul, that the number of trucks going into Jordan has fallen from about 400 a day in June to 200 a day in July and was only 42 on Sunday and 30 the day before.
The United States, Britain and France, which have stationed warships outside Aqaba to enforce the sanctions, have also stepped up searches of cargo vessels using the port to look for banned Iraqi imports or exports.
Diplomats here say the number of trucks crossing into Iraq from Turkey has also fallen drastically in recent weeks. But the situation on Iraq's borders with Syria and Iran is unclear.
Jordanian traders here report that Iraqi merchants who traditionally order staple foods as well as detergents, razor blades and other items through them have disappeared from the market over the last few weeks.
The immediate cause was the sudden fall in the Iraqi dinar's value on the free currency market here last month.
Many Iraqi importers suffered big losses as a result of this devaluation, which made it hard for them to re-sell merchandise at prices that covered their dollar costs.
But the final straw came when the Iraqi authorities, facing mounting public anger at rising food prices brought about by the devaluation, arrested some 500 merchants on charges of speculation and profiteering and then executed 42 of them in an effort to force prices lower.
The effect, Jordanian merchants say, was to bring private imports of basic foods to a virtual standstill, with Iraqi traders frightened they would face imprisonment or death unless they sold their goods at a loss.

HEADLINE: Israel Threads the Maze Toward U.S. Loan Pact

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Here is Israel's economic Catch-22 as its pursuit of billions of dollars in United States loan guarantees moves into high gear this week:
To get the aid, as well as to assert its spending priorities, the new Government has canceled plans for 12,000 publicly financed apartments, nearly half of them for Jewish settlers in the occupied territories. 
 But by putting the brakes on future construction, the Israelis have undercut a booming sector of their economy, one that accounts for more than half of the 6 percent growth projected for the gross national product this year.
In other words, in part to obtain American help intended ultimately to make the economy run faster, Israel has taken measures that will probably cause it to limp a bit for a while.
"The next two years will be difficult," Finance Minister Avraham Shohat acknowledged, telling a parliamentary committee a few days ago that deep slices in the country's 11.6 percent unemployment rate are not likely until 1994. But the situation will then improve considerably, he promised.
 
A Political Conundrum
 For Americans and other interested foreigners, the loan guarantees tend to be seen as a political question: How badly do the Israelis want this help in absorbing some 400,000 immigrants who have arrived over the last three years, most of them from the former Soviet Union? Do they want it badly enough to stop building settlements in the occupied territories, as the Bush Administration would like?
The answer from the previous Likud-led Government was no. In turn, the Administration told the Israelis to forget about the guarantees, which do not involve actual loans but rather a United States pledge to back up Israel when it enters international markets to borrow $10 billion over the next five years.
Now the new Labor-led Government of Prime Minister of Yitzhak Rabin says it will greatly scale back future settlement-building. The Americans smile at this and suggest that some form of loan guarantees will be approved, although important details are still unsettled and may not be resolved before Mr. Rabin journeys to Kennebunkport, Me., next week for two days of meetings and appreciative pats on the back from President Bush.
These political considerations aside, the loan guarantees have become something of a grail for Israeli economic planners. For starters, $2 billion in loans were included in the 1992 budget that has been huffing along without them since last January. Looking ahead, Israel's economic establishment views the guarantees as the seal of approval it needs for favorable terms on the loans.
"The guarantees have become a symbol of the prospects for the Israeli economy," said Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel. "Whether legitimately or not, they have become part of the economic reality. They are the key to creating the environment for turning around the recent slowdown in immigration and the entire mood of investment."
Mr. Frenkel left for Washington today with a new plan for economic change that the Israelis hope will satisfy Washington's concern about the Israeli budget, which is almost as important as its interest in curtailing settlement. While Israeli officials insist that they are not about to accept economic dictates from the United States, they acknowledge that they can hardly ignore American wishes.
Last week Mr. Frenkel warned the Rabin Cabinet that "a disaster" lay ahead if it used the borrowed money to cover budget deficits, instead of financing investments to create jobs for Russian Jews and thus make it easier to repay the loans.
On this score, leaders of the new Government insist there is no need to worry. Their goal, Mr. Shohat, the Finance Minister, said in an interview, is to reduce the inefficient, centralized economic planning that runs deep here, to sell off state-owned companies, to encourage exports and to liberalize financial markets.
Moreover, the minister said, anyone who worries that Labor will inevitably fall back on its familiar ways, born of an Eastern European socialism that even Eastern Europe has abandoned, has it "totally upside down."
"We want to attract investors and create jobs," he said. "We are going to put a lot of money in infrastructure, in communications, in research and development. The 1993 budget will reflect this shift in priorities."
Nonetheless, there are those who worry, especially free-trade advocates like Alvin Rabushka, an American economist who has closely studied (and criticized) Israeli economic ways. Mr. Rabushka is not convinced that this Government, any more than its predecessor, will use the money it hopes to borrow to strengthen the economy. This is a country hooked on subsidies, he asserts, including the $3 billion in economic and military aid it receives from the United States each year.
"It's the only country left in the world that's saying that if we increase the debt of every citizen, we will somehow revitalize the economy," he said.
Other critics question whether Israel now really needs to borrow $10 billion, for that figure was premised on having a million immigrants arrive from former Soviet territory over five years.
With unemployment among these newcomers running to nearly 40 percent and the sense of danger they felt in the old Soviet Union now abated, Russians more and more are choosing to stay in Russia. Immigration has been greatly reduced, to about 32,000 people in the first half of the year -- a high figure by historical standards but one-third of the number forecast.
Despite this reduction, Mr. Frenkel, the bank governor, argues that $10 billion is still needed. As for skeptics, he says the question is whether one can have faith that the Government will "use the money correctly."
"My judgment is that conditions exist for that," he said.

HEADLINE: Agreeing to Raise Taxes, Officials Get Out of Jail

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: JACKSON, Ky., Aug. 4

 BODY:
Three Breathitt County officials agreed to raise taxes to balance the budget for the county in Kentucky's Appalachian region, but only after spending four days in jail.
The officials, who are magistrates on the county's governing Fiscal Court, were jailed on Friday for failing to comply with a court order to meet a requirement of the State Constitution to adopt a balanced budget by July 1. In seven successive budget proposals, they refused to adopt a 1 percent payroll tax that state officials said was essential to avoid a $400,000 deficit. 
 Judge James King of the Circuit Court held the three officials in contempt on July 24 and began fining each $200 a day until they adopted a budget acceptable to the state.
On Monday, they grudgingly agreed to support the 1 percent tax that they had said residents of the depressed area about 80 miles southeast of Lexington could not afford. They were freed from jail today to vote on the budget.
The Magistrates, Hubert Hollon, Hershel Manns and Arch Turner received a standing ovation from about 150 spectators as they entered the county courtroom today shortly before noon for the Fiscal Court meeting to vote on the tax.
In a strange reversal, Cecil Clair, who as Judge Executive of the Fiscal Court is the county's highest elected official, and Magistrate Helen Combs, who have consistently voted for the tax, voted against the budget proposed today. They said they disagreed with several items in it.
But the other three county officials prevailed, passing the budget and insuring their freedeom.
A separate ordinance enacting the payroll tax was unanimously approved but must be approved twice more by the Fiscal Court before it becomes official. The county's lawyer, Mike Stidham, said he hoped the tax would take effect by Sept. 1.
The just-freed officials were not happy about trading their votes for freedom. "I think the state has forced us into a position to vote against our consciences," Mr. Hollon had said.
 
Most Services Closed
 When the board missed a July 1 for adopting a balanced budget, the courts closed and garbage collection and most other services in the eastern Kentucky county of 18,000 people were shut down.
Because the county's jail was also closed, the three had to be held in a neighboring county's jail.
After about 60 supporters showed up at the jail on Monday, the three decided that staying in jail was not the solution.
"They realize our only avenue is to vote against our wishes to get out of jail," Mr. Turner said of the supporters.
Breathitt County, in the state's Appalachian coal region, has been hard hit by a mining slump and a sharp drop in its share of the state's coal severance tax. Unemployment was 11.4 percent in May, the most recent figure available.
Despite hard times, some residents said they were willing to pay the tax to keep the magistrates out of jail.
Yvonne Maggard, whose husband is a state legislator, organized the group that visited them in jail. She said that she did not want a tax increase but that being jailed was too high a price for the magistrates to pay.

Teaching Ex-Communists Capitalism

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif., July 31

 BODY:
Until this summer, Mihaly Kopanyi had only one textbook about capitalism for his business school students in Budapest, a recent Hungarian translation of Paul Heyne's "The Economic Way of Thinking."
Now Mr. Kopanyi has a treasure trove of materials -- case studies, professorial bon mots and jottings from dormitory bull sessions -- to take home to the Budapest University of Economic Sciences when he resumes teaching after seven weeks at the Stanford Business School. 
 Mr. Kopanyi is one of eight Eastern and Central European professors who this year, for the first time, are part of the Stanford Executive Program, joining more than 160 senior-level international executives on this sun-baked campus for a summer of instruction in marketing, finance and organizational behavior.
As academics, the eight are better versed in the ins and outs of capitalism than their pupils at home -- undergraduates and graduate students, but most importantly executives who must be re-educated after a lifetime operating not-for-profit businesses.
"We have to change the mentality of our managers," said Marcel Duhaneanu of the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest, Romania. "We have to teach them to take risks and to see this activity of making money as important and honorable."
Serguei Vasilievich Sarkissov, who runs the executive training program at the International Business School in Moscow, clucked at how formidable the task is. "Our managers are so ignorant," he said. "They come and ask, 'What means marketing?' "
Before the fall of Communism, these were the Young Turks on their campuses, teaching about stock markets that neither they nor their students had ever seen and trying to explain competitive pricing in a world where central planners decided how much everything cost.
"I was expected to teach Marxist theory, but I considered it quite obsolete," said Lena Minkova Roussenova of the Univeristy of National and World Economy in Sofia, Bulgaria.
In addition to the subject matter at Stanford, the visiting teachers are also studying the pedagogic techniques of American professors, who are more inclined to jocular give-and-take than the stern lecture-and-listen style that predominates in Europe.
The Stanford program is part of a rare cooperative venture of five premier business schools. Along with Harvard, M.I.T., Northwestern and the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford has waived the $25,200 tuition, room and board and paid the travel expenses of the young faculty members because "training the trainers" is the most efficient way to widely disseminate American expertise to the emerging free market economies.
The 100 or so Central and Eastern European professors here, divided among the five campuses, are enrolled this year in general management programs. At Stanford, the professors live in a dormitory alongside excutives from Merrill Lynch, Bank Suez and Liz Claiborne, to name a few of the companies represented.
They attend morning lectures by such professors as Ezra Solomon. They gather in study groups in the afternoon to dissect case studies, like how the Otis elevator company set about modernization. And they take field trips to local businesses like Nordstrom's department store.
After the general management program, the professors will return to their own campuses, pledged to conduct field research and write case studies about companies that are in the process of privatization.
The last stage of the program is scheduled for next summer, when the professors return to pursue a specialized area of study, say, organization behavior at Harvard or managerial accounting at Stanford.
At Stanford, joint ventures with Central and Eastern European nations have been all the rage since the beginning of perestroika. The Hoover Institute, for example, has conducted seminars for young diplomats from these countries for two years.
The professors in this summer's program have been quick studies in capitalism. Take Mr. Duhaneanu, who spent his four-day semester break in Hawaii, fulfilling a lifetime dream by taking a trip that he felt compelled to defend as a wise economic decision.
"In Rumania we have the Black Sea," he said. "So this was a very interesting case study for me in industrial tourism."

HEADLINE: Governors Find School Improvements Hard to Sell

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., Aug. 4

 BODY:
Education improvements and the extra money they often require have never been an easy sell to the public. But the task has become much tougher.
Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, who is campaigning for a $300 million tax increase for education in the face of stiff opposition, knows that. So does Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri, where a proposition calling for changes in schools and $385 million in new taxes to initiate them was defeated by voters last November. So do governors in Oklahoma and Nebraska, where citizen-led initiatives on the ballot the last two years tried to rescind education legislation. 
 "There is skepticism and cynicism among the public," said David Hornbeck, an education consultant who spoke on these issues at the National Governors' Association annual meeting, which ended today. "People aren't sure whether the reforms will work, and many believe they have 'already given at the office.' "
As an indication of the grim mood among voters, the National Governors' Association for the first time at its annual conference offered a seminar to governors' staff representatives on how to market education reform to the public. Many governors said states hadn't been explicit enough in defining for voters what the potential changes mean.
 
A Hurdle Underestimated
 Voter skepticism is a bigger hurdle than many educators and politicians had believed, several governors and education policy experts said. Among others are the sluggish economy and budget deficits in many states, and demands to see results.
Also undermining state education efforts, they added, is the fact that only 25 percent of American families have children in school. Many people believe they don't have much stake in education.
Part of the problem, too, is that legislation to effect change has become more sophisticated. Most states have moved away from first passing required academic improvements and then tackling financing legislation, either to increase spending for education or to equalize spending between between rich schools and poor ones. Now education legislation tends to combine both.
"Over all, states are doing a very poor job of selling," Mr. Romer said during an interview at the conference. "Change and higher taxes are always difficult."
Missouri offers a case study in how difficult it is to sell change. Last fall, state officials believed they had assembled a solid ballot initiative, with improvements like smaller classes and school-based management; they had backed those improvements with about $385 million in new taxes.
The measure was rejected by voters, despite vigorous and vocal support from Governor Ashcroft, a fiscal conservative. "There are many lessons to be learned," said Richard McClure, the Governor's chief of staff.
Mr. McClure said state officials should combine the proposed improvements with measures that hold schools accountable. Voters are more likely to support the legislation if they know there are consequences for schools that do not perform well.
Some states have started to adapt to the tougher climate by being more aggressive in publicity.
In Colorado, for instance, Governor Romer faces a groundswell of opposition to a ballot initiative that he has proposed. The initiative, on the ballot this November, proposes to increase the state sales tax to 4 cents from 3 cents on every dollar; the Governor asserts that if the initiative fails, public education spending will have to be cut by 12 percent in the 1993-1994 school year. Mr. Romer is campaigning on the breakfast circuit, flying the width and breadth of the state and eating breakfast three times a day to line up support for his tax increase.
"It's not fun saying, 'I'm your Governor and I'm going to raise your taxes,' " Mr. Romer said. "I get a lot of hostile audiences."
Among the hostile gatherings are a good number involving senior citizens, who, the Governor said, ask why they should support education improvements. He says he responds by telling the retirees that schoolchildren are future workers who will pay the retirees' Social Security benefits.
Although some statewide polls show the inititive has more support than opposition, Governor Romer expects a fight. "I'm telling my staff to take no prisoners. You're either with us or against us."

HEADLINE: In Chicago, a Model Farm School

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Jason Zeigler's summer school assignments include breeding fish, learning to groom a dog and raising vegetables in a small garden set in one of the fields surrounding his high school.
Jason, who is 15 years old and lives on Chicago's South Side, had not spent much time around animals, much less in a vegetable garden, until he started high school two years ago. 
 "In my neighborhood, some people have flowers or they have plants inside their house, but if you talk about growing vegetables, they think you're going to work on a farm," he said.
Jason is working on a farm, of sorts. He is a student at the Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences, a public school set on the last farm in the city of Chicago.
Although a farmer is paid to plow and harvest the fields, the 55-acre farm in the city's southwest corner is an outdoor classroom, where students assist the farmer and care for their own gardens. Inside the brick school building are regular classrooms, as well as a 300-gallon fish tank, a half dozen rabbit pens, a floral design shop and two greenhouses.
 
Study of Food and Fiber
 "It's not just sticking plants in the ground," said Jason, who hopes to become an environmental engineer for a national park.
The school's curriculum is designed to prepare public school students for such disparate jobs as marine biologist, nutritionist, food quality inspector, customs agent, commodities trader or "anything to do with food and fiber," said the principal, Barbara Valerious.
When it started in 1985, the high school was only the second of its kind in the country, the first being Philadelphia's Biddle Saul School for Agriculture. Last year, Kansas City, Mo., started a similar program, and San Jose, Calif., plans to open a high school devoted to agricultural and environmental sciences this fall.
With the United States Department of Agriculture estimating that 50,000 agriculture-related jobs will open up each year in the 1990's, most of them off the farms, Chicago's agricultural high school is attracting a lot of attention. Officials from school districts in Phoenix and Atlanta have visited the school in the last year, seeking to model programs on Chicago's curriculum.
"It is quite an amazing school," said Diana Pihos, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department. "There is such a huge need out there for people to work in these areas that there are going to have to be more schools like it."
Students at the agricultural high school take college preparatory courses like English, mathematics and foreign languages, as well as classes in animal sciences, horticulture and agriculture technology. Their school day is slightly longer than the average public school's, and they graduate with 31 credits, as against the 21 required for graduation in Illinois.
About 70 percent of the school's graduates have gone on to four-year colleges. The school's graduation rate is 89 percent, as against about 50 percent for all Chicago public schools.
Almost half the students in the 90-member graduating class this spring was awarded a total of $1.4 million in college scholarships from about 15 universities, including Princeton and the United States Military Academy at West Point.
For Jeremy Bartel, who is 15 and intends to be a geologist, it was not the scholarships, or even the job opportunities, that lured him to the schoo; it was the chance to be around plants and animals.
 
Calming Nature of Plants
 "Plants are very calming," he said. "When I have a big test, sometimes I just go into the greenhouse and stand there and watch the plants grow."
Teen-agers from throughout Chicago can apply to the school; students in the neighborhood get in automatically, and those from outside the neighborhood are chosen by lottery. Hispanic youths make up 14 percent of the 450-member student body, whites 18 percent and blacks 68 percent, Ms. Valerious said.
This summer, the most popular summer school class is one that operates a fresh produce stand. The class buys vegetables from the farmer growing the crops and sells them to the public. Students manage the business transactions and can earn wages if the stand makes a profit.
Last year, a team of Chicago students came in 20th in the nation in the horticulture competition sponsored by the FFA, formerly the Future Farmers of America, in which students rated several samples of a plant. "Just like other high schools have a football team," said Marcia Watman, who teaches agriculture techniques. "It's the same thing with us, only we have a horticulture team."

HEADLINE: Teachers Ask Mediator To Aid in Contract Talks

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Trying to accelerate contract talks that have been stalled for almost a year, Sandra Feldman, the president of the New York City teachers' union, formally declared yesterday that the negotiations were at an impasse and asked a state mediator to step in.
The unexpected action, announced at a crowded news conference at the United Federation of Teachers headquarters in Manhattan, will produce an effort by the State Public Employment Relations Board to settle the dispute. If that fails, then a fact-finder will determine whether any money exists to pay for a raise for the teachers. 
 Ms. Feldman's move comes after more than 10 months in which the city's 66,000 teachers have been working without a contract. It is aimed at putting pressure on Mayor David N. Dinkins and the Board of Education to offer more substantial wage proposals, something Ms. Feldman contends her antagonists at the negotiating table have not done.
 
Report Can Be Rejected
 Unlike a binding arbitration ruling, a fact finder's report can be rejected by any party to a negotiation, but those findings would carry considerable weight in the public debate and might force some concessions.
Ms. Feldman, caught between a restless membership and a Mayor whose candidacy she helped launch, tiptoed around reporters' questions about whether she would call a strike when schools reopen on Sept. 9. But she made several veiled warnings.
"We want to do everything possible to avoid a serious confrontation with the city, but I can't rule anything out," she said. "For teachers to go into a second school year without a contract is unprecedented."
The union last struck the schools in 1975, in a five-day walkout that disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of children and their parents. Under the state's Taylor Law, it is illegal for public school teachers to strike.
James S. Vlasto, a spokesman for Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, said the board had "bargained in good faith" but any calls for pay raises should be put at the door of City Hall, which controls the budget.
Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said, "Fundamentally we've had enormous difficulty finding ways to fund a settlement that would be even remotely acceptable to her."
Ms. Feldman said she welcomed proposals put forward by Mr. Fernandez on Friday that would create incentives for experienced teachers to work in the city's most troubled schools. But she said she wanted to dispel any impressions that Mr. Fernandez might have created that the contract talks were anywhere near completion.
In fact, she said, there has been absolutely no movement in negotiations since the contract expired on Oct. 1. The city has insisted that any money for a modest raise would have to be squeezed out through concessions in other parts of the teacher contract, from areas like sabbaticals.
Ms. Feldman would not say how large a pay raise she wants, although she indicated that she is seeking parity with surrounding suburbs, where the top pay ranges from $3,000 to $16,000 more than that of senior New York City teachers. Salaries for New York City teachers range from $26,375 for beginners to $52,750 for those with 20 years of service, a master's degree and 30 additional graduate credits.
One official familiar with the negotiations said the teachers have asked for a raise of at least 10 percent -- about $5,000 a year at the top salary scale -- that would give them parity with some suburbs. Such a raise would cost roughly $400 million.
The city, the official said, is considering only inflation-linked raises of roughly 3 percent that would have to be financed through concessions in work rules.

HEADLINE: After Long Battle, Cuomo's Jobs Plan Faces Hurdles

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Although the state Legislature has passed Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's $800 million bond plan to create jobs and improve the state's infrastructure, debate over the proposal is far from over. Two of the biggest hurdles remain: deciding how the money should be spent and persuading voters to approve the plan in the November election.
The passage of the bond act was a big victory for Mr. Cuomo, who had made it the centerpiece of his economic development program this legislative session and who had feared just a month ago that the measure was dead. Its passage last week prompted the Governor to call the session, which has ended for the summer, "extraordinary." Mr. Cuomo signed the bill on Monday, so the proposal will be put on the ballot in November. 
 As the state continues to reel under the weight of the recession, Governor Cuomo hopes the bond act will prime the economy and create jobs by putting people to work to upgrade roads, water mains and other improvements, and then by attracting businesses to the newly improved areas. State officials say the plan will bring in about 25,000 new construction jobs right away and hundreds of thousands of other jobs in the ensuing years.
But while most politicians would normally be delighted at the prospect of having economic development projects to take home to their constituents, some conservatives fear political repercussions from supporting anything that could lead to more state debt in the current political climate.
 
Conservative Opposition
 "In these tough fiscal times, some politicians are unwilling to go along with spending of any kind," Brian D. Backstrom, vice president for research at Change-NY, a conservative group that opposes the bond act, said recently.
The chairman of the state's Conservative Party, Michael R. Long, has called the proposal to pay for infrastructure improvements with money borrowed through bond sales a "disastrous economic plan" that would cause state taxes to rise.
"Once again, away from public scrutiny, the backroom politicians have reached agreement on an economic package that will increase the economic misery of New Yorkers," he said. "If this bond act is approved it will fuel higher taxes in the near future, taxes that will lead to more private-sector jobs fleeing New York."
Some supporters of the bond act have expressed concern over whether voters will approve it. The last large bond proposal, a $2 billion initiative intended to set aside money for the environment, was rejected by voters in 1990.
This time, officials say, they hope to raise voters' consciousness about the bond act through speeches and public appearances, although they are barred by law from advertising or specifically asking voters to support it.
"What's better than putting people to work?" Governor Cuomo asked at a recent news conference. He added that the bond act would do more than employ people just for the sake of employing them.
"This is not just basket weaving," he said. "This is hundreds of thousands of jobs. You find another way to put people to work right now, when we need it worse than we have at any time since the Great Depression."
Even before the voters decide the fate of the proposal, politicians in Albany will be scrambling over how to divide the money.
Under Mr. Cuomo's plan, $600 million would go to the state's 62 counties and the five boroughs of New York City, based on population, with a $2 million minimum per county or borough; $100 million would be divided regionally, and $100 million would be used for statewide infrastructure.
The money will go to decidedly unglamorous projects, like sewer hookups and water lines, that would help persuade companies to move in, said Mary Ann Crotty, the Governor's director of policy management. Localities would submit proposals to a legislative task force, which would allocate the money based on criteria outlined in the legislation. The bulk of the money should be spoken for by October. If the bond act passes on Nov. 3, she said, the projects could begin next spring.
 
Renovation and Development
 The money could be used to renovate aging industrial parks or develop idle state land or to reopen closed factories. It could not be used as a loan or grant to an individual company, unless it can be proved that the public would benefit from the company's moving into the area.
New York City's share of the money would come to about $239 million, money it needs because of reductions in its own capital budget in the last couple of years. Projects that might be financed with the money include improvement of the Harlem River railyard for a flower wholesale market; infrastructure for an industrial park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and refurbishment of Pier 11 on the East River in Manhattan for commercial and tourist use, said a spokesman for the state Department of Economic Development.
"This is a good deal for the city," said John Bozzella, the city's lobbyist in Albany. "No matter how big your capital budget is, you don't thumb your nose at $239 million."

HEADLINE: July Vehicle Sales Off a Bit After Slump Late in Month

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks fell 3.9 percent in late July, but sales for the entire month stayed close to the gradual rate of recovery that began in the spring, according to statistics released today.
In late July, 397,546 domestically built vehicles were sold, based on the daily selling rate. Cars were down 5.1 percent, to 248,053; light trucks were off 2 percent, to 149,493. There were 10 selling days in the latest period, compared with 9 last year; percentage changes are based on the daily selling rate. 
 For the month, auto makers sold 1,107,064 vehicles, which included all cars and light trucks, domestic and imports, a 1.5 percent drop from July 1991. Sales of cars dropped 4.2 percent, to 705,087; sales of light trucks, which include mini-vans and sport utility vehicles, rose 3.5 percent, to 401,977.
 
Tracking the Pace of Sales
 Sales of domestically built cars were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.7 million for the period from July 21 to 31, up from a rate of 6 million in the middle of the month but the same rate as in late July of last year. For the entire month, the rate was 6.5 million.
Dealers, auto executives and financial analysts were split in their assessments. Some said that sales were sluggish; others contended that they were not bad in light of weak economic indicators like unemployment, consumer confidence and personal income.
The weakness in late-July car sales suggested that a "pay back" effect was at work. Rental car companies ordered more aggressively than usual in June, fearing they might not have enough cars to cope with heavy summer travel, fed by the surge in airline bookings that resulted from deeply discounted air fares. Those earlier car sales reduced the orders placed in late July.
"We're in a holding pattern," said Jack Kirnan, an auto analyst for Salomon Brothers in New York. "Consumers are waiting to see whether we're slipping into recession or just having a painfully weak recovery." But Mr. Kirnan counted himself among those who thought sales were "pretty good."
 
View From the Dealerships
 Rick Ellis, who owns a Ford dealership in Malone, N.Y., said, "We had a good May and June, but July was hell."
John Koerner, general sales manager of Healy Chevrolet-Geo-Oldsmobile in Beacon, N.Y., said July sales were up from a year ago but were softer than in any other month this year.
The General Motors Corporation, the top auto maker, had a 6.1 percent decline in sales of all vehicles for the month, to 407,384, reflecting an 11.6 percent drop in car sales. Light-truck sales rose 5.7 percent. Saturn and GMC Truck were the only sales divisions to register positive comparisons with last July. Consequently, G.M. has slightly trimmed its third-quarter production plans.
The Ford Motor Company, ranked No. 2, posted a 5.4 percent increase in vehicle sales for the month, to 284,506, thanks to a 3.8 percent increase in car sales and a 7.8 increase in light trucks.
The Chrysler Corporation posted a 7.2 percent increase in vehicle sales, to 131,810, with a 6.8 percent rise in light trucks and a 7.8 percent increase in cars.
The Honda Motor Company's car sales rose less than 1 percent, to 67,084. Honda's Accord model was the top-selling car for the month, leading the No. 2 Ford Taurus.
 
Mixed Performances
 The Toyota Motor Corporation's vehicle sales were off 6.4 percent, to 97,119, for the month; car sales were off 8.2 percent, sport utility vehicles were off 15.1 percent and mini-vans were off 30.6 percent, but sales of pickups rose 11.8 percent
The Nissan Motor Company had a 30.3 percent sales drop in cars and light trucks for the month, to 45,287. The Mazda Motor Corporation's sales fell 1.9 percent, to 29,758, but the Mitsubishi Motor Corporation increased sales 12 percent, to 18,559. Mitsubishi said a lease program on its Diamante sedans spurred sales to nearly 5,000 for the month.
Detroit's Big Three gained market share against foreign auto makers, continuing a trend that began early in the year. The Big Three's share of the car market increased to 64.7 percent for the month from 64.1 percent in July of last year; the Japanese auto makers also increased their car share slightly, to 27.6 percent, from 26.9 percent last year. All other importers, mostly European, dropped to 7.7 percent of the market, from 8.9 percent last year. Volkswagen, Mercedes, Porsche, Hyundai and Saab posted declines; Audi, BMW and Volvo had gains.

HEADLINE: Thruway Authority Is Given New Powers

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEWBURGH, N.Y., Aug. 4

 BODY:
The New York State Thruway Authority will start economic development projects along the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway and take over the state Barge Canal system, under legislation signed today by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
As a start, the measure authorizes the Thruway Authority to help finance development projects along waterfronts in Buffalo and Syracuse, as well as a new interchange near Stewart International Airport in Orange County. 
 "This legislation allows the Thruway Authority to become a catalyst for economic development along the Thruway corridor and our canal system," Governor Cuomo said.
State officials said the measure would not require higher tolls on the Thruway, the nation's longest toll road.
However, the legislation makes it even less likely that the Thruway's tolls will disappear when the road's construction bonds are paid off in 1996. A special state task force, citing the fact that one-third of Thruway tolls are paid by non-New Yorkers, has recommended preserving the tolls.

Salaries Increase In Public Relations

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
The median salary for public relations practitioners has risen 6.5 percent, to $46,556, from $43,718 last year, according to the seventh annual salary survey by The Public Relations Journal, which is published by the Public Relations Society of America in New York. 
 The publication said the results of the survey indicated that the industry was emerging from a recession after two years of layoffs and few pay increases; the median salary rose only 1.2 percent in 1991 from the previous year. The survey also showed that a "salary gender gap," a disparity between men's and women's pay, had widened: the men's median salary of $57,766 was 47 percent higher than the women's median of $39,207.

HEADLINE: Yields Fall at Slower Pace For Bank Funds and C.D.'s

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Nearly a month after the last cut in the Federal discount rate and cuts in the prime lending rates by most leading banks, yields of bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit have continued to slip, but the decline in the week that ended today was less pronounced than in previous weeks.
Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, a bank-interest-rate publication, says that bank rates have tumbled 40 basis points since the cut and that he thinks a new bottom may be in sight. But, he says, the Federal Reserve may yet take another hard look at the economy and see if another easing is in order. "The odds are even money on another rate cut," Mr. Heady said. "It could happen this month or in September.". 
 Rates at the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills rose on Monday, marking the third time they have risen in as many weeks. Many interest rate watchers consider the auction a fairly good indicator of what many banks may pay out to depositors in the weeks ahead.
 
 
3-Month Bill Up 2 Points
 The average rate on a three-month bill at auction was 3.20 percent, up 2 basis points from the previous auction, while the six-month bill rose 3 basis points, to 3.30 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
"A close look at commercial banks in New York show that two-thirds are pricing their three- and six-month certificates to yield under 3 percent," Mr. Heady said. "Banks do not appear to be squeamish about chopping yields as depositors flee to higher-paying investments elsewhere."
In the latest week, New York area banks -- both commercial and savings institutions -- reduced the average money market account and six-month certificate of deposit by 2 basis points, to 3.06 percent and 3.31 percent, respectively. The average three-month certificate was cut 4 basis points, to 3.09 percent.
Commercial banks left money market accounts and three-month certificates unchanged this week at 2.86 percent and 2.91 percent, respectively and reduced six-month certificates by a basis point, to 3.07 percent.
 
 
Biggest Adjustments
 Savings banks cut both money market accounts and six-month C.D. yields by 4 basis points, to 3.25 percent and 3.54 percent, respectively. The three-month certificate was cut by 7 basis points, to 3.29 percent.
The largest yield adjustments in the New York area were at the Dime Savings Bank, which lowered its money market account 15 basis points, to 3.25 percent, and at First Nationwide, which dropped its three-month C.D. 50 basis points, to 2.85 percent, and its six-month C.D. 13 basis points, to 3.15 percent.
By comparison, the yields at 20 large banks outside the New York market were down slightly, with an average bank money market account off a basis point, to 2.96 percent, and a six-month certificate down 2 basis points, to 3.20 percent.
 


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, Aug. 5, 1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Manages Slight Gain In Listless Domestic Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose slightly yesterday against other leading currencies in slow domestic dealings that reflected a dearth of economic news to trade on.
Gold prices barely budged in New York after falling overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, bullion rose 10 cents an ounce, to $352.70. A late bid at the Republic National Bank at $353.00 an ounce was unchanged from Monday. 
 "It was a real yawner," Jay Wertheimer, senior foreign currency trader for the New York branch of Banco di Sicilia, said about dollar trading. "The markets were very thin, very dead."
Traders are waiting for the unemployment figures due to be released Friday. The data will be the Government's first significant report on how the economy fared in July. "Up until then, we don't expect much to go on," Mr. Wertheimer said.
A Commerce Department report that showed the Government's economic forecasting gauge fell in June for the first time in six months had no effect on foreign exchange dealings, traders said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.20 yen, down 0.05 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 127.25 yen. By the time trading concluded in New York the dollar fetched 127.25 yen, up from 127.20 on Monday.
The British pound fell in London to $1.9230, from $1.9245 late Monday. In New York, the pound cost $1.9195, cheaper than its $1.9240 exchange value Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.4770 German marks, up from 1.4750; 1.3245 Swiss francs, up from 1.3170; 4.9900 French francs, up from 4.9800; 1,116.00 Italian lire, up from 1,114.00, and 1.18485 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18395.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday, were: 1.4745 German marks, down from 1.4770; 1.3205 Swiss francs, up from 1.3185; 4.9815 French francs, down from 4.9850; 1.6625 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6655; 1,114.50 Italian lire, down from 1,115.00; 1.1851 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1840.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Post First Drop in 6 Months

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The Government's chief economic forecasting gauge fell in June for the first time in six months, the Commerce Department said today.
Analysts had expected the slight decrease in the index of leading indicators and said it was not a sign of renewed recession, but a symptom of the weak and erratic growth that has bedeviled the economy since the middle of last year. 
 The drop of two-tenths of 1 percent in the leading indicators, which are intended to predict economic activity six to nine months in advance, was the first decline since the index fell one-tenth of 1 percent in December. The June drop was the steepest decline since January 1991.
The drop followed gains of six-tenths of 1 percent in May and three-tenths of 1 percent in both April and March.
The report suggests that the economy is in "for more of the same -- a lackluster, limpid, lethargic performance that goes on month after month," said Robert Dederick, an economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
That is bad news for President Bush and other incumbents who would prefer that voters on Election Day feel good about the economy, or at least optimistic that difficult times will soon be over.
The July figure in the most politically potent set of election year statistics -- the unemployment rate -- is scheduled for release on Friday. Despite five consecutive quarters of weak economic growth that economists say constitute a recovery, the unemployment rate has continued to rise.
 
Making Predictions
 Many analysts say that unemployment, after hitting an eight-year high of 7.8 percent in June, will register a slight decline for July, but few believe the rate will dip below 7 percent by the end of the year.
"I think we'll see some improvement," said Paul Boltz, an economist at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. "But I think the improvement will be perceived as late in the day."
In June's leading indicators, 6 of the index's 11 components contributed to its decline. One was unchanged and four were positive.
The negative indicators, in order of magnitude, were a drop in the inflation-adjusted supply of money in the economy; a decrease in the average factory employee's workweek from 41.3 hours to 41.1 hours; an increase in new claims for unemployment insurance from an average of 415,000 a week in May to 429,000 in June; a decline in stock prices as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index; a decrease in building permits and a drop in consumer confidence as measured by the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center.
 
A Ragged Recovery
 The positive indicators were a gain in new orders and contracts for business equipment and buildings; a rise in new orders to factories for consumer goods; a slowdown in business delivery times, which indicates increased demand, and an increase in the price of various raw materials.
The backlog of unfilled orders at factories was virtually unchanged and did not push the overall index in either direction.
The various changes left the index in June at 149.6 percent of its 1982 base of 100, down from 149.9 in May.
Economists say the June decline probably will be followed by a rise in July. But they say the sawtooth pattern reflects structural problems constraining the kind of robust growth that has typically followed postwar recessions. The problems include the decline in military spending that has followed the end of the cold war, the plunge in commercial real estate values, the weak condition of many banks and, most important, an overhang of consumer, business and government debt.
The drop in the leading index prompted the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Donald W. Riegle Jr., a Democrat from Michigan, to call for "a significant increase in the money supply by the Federal Reserve."

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
ALL is not well in the wine world. The wine market in the United States declined last year for the seventh year in a row. Domestic wine shipments were down 1.5 percent, to 147.4 million cases while imports fell 8.7 percent to 25.8 million cases.
The persistent economic recession, a widespread and growing concern about alcohol abuse, heightened public indignation over drunken driving and the consequent stiffer penalties, plus steeper Federal excise taxes all combined in 1991 to deliver yet another blow to the already troubled industry. 
 Total shipments were 173.2 million cases, down from the 1984 peak, 220.2 million cases. The figures are from Impact, a trade publication that has tracked the wine industry's performance for many years.
Impact tracks cases shipped rather than cases produced because producers may hold wine anywhere from weeks to several years for aging. What's more, the wine production calendar rarely coincides with the producer's fiscal calendar.
The one bright spot in an otherwise somber picture was California varietal wines, which were up 7.4 percent, to 47.7 million cases. Varietal wines are better-quality wines that bear the name of the principal grape variety from which they are made. A bottle of wine made mostly from the cabernet sauvignon grape is a varietal. A bottle of California burgundy, usually made from a number of cheaper grapes, is known as a generic, or jug, wine. The jug wines, which were the keystone of the California wine market for generations, are slowly dying out. Shipments of California generics fell 8.7 percent last year, to 58.7 million cases, Impact reported.
The encouraging performance by the higher-priced varietals lends substance to a slogan the industry uses to cheer itself up: people, the wine makers say, are drinking less but better.
Indeed, dozens of smaller wineries, particularly in California, continue to see great demand for their products, allocating their often quite expensive wines to favored customers. There are still a few wineries where fans wait for a place on the waiting list.
Which is little solace for larger, less elitist producers whose customer bases have been shrinking like grapes after a late spring frost.
California, where everything seems to be going wrong at the moment, has been hit especially hard. Ordinarily, Californians drink more wine than anyone else in the country. They are still ahead of the rest of the United States; they drank 42 million cases last year. Even so, their overall consumption fell 5.2 percent.
Table wine, the reds and whites we drink with dinner, accounted for 76.8 percent of the United States market last year, up a tenth of a percentage point over 1990. Sparkling wine made up 8.6 percent, also up a tenth of a point. Actual shipments of sparkling wine dropped 1.7 percent, to 15 million cases, but the drop was mostly in imported wines; American sparkling wines actually did better in 1991 than in 1990: shipments were up 3.5 percent, to 11.2 million cases.
Lest you mistakenly attribute this small bright spot to some post-80's let-'em-eat-cake attitude, be aware that most of the performers were low-enders like Tott's and Eden Roc brands, both owned by Gallo, and Canandaigua's Cook's, which, Impact says, shipped 26.5 percent more cases in 1991 than in 1990.
Domaine Chandon, best known of the top-of-the-line domestic sparkling wines, was off 9 percent, to about 350,000 cases, but the real losers were the imports. All French Champagne shipments were off 12.5 percent, with Moet & Chandon, the Domaine's European cousin, down almost 10 percent.
The rest of the market, about 15 percent of it, is made up of dessert wines, which include port, sherry and inexpensive flavored wines like Canandaigua's Wild Irish Rose; special natural wines like bottled sangria and the so-called apple wines; vermouth, and imported speciality wines. Only the special natural category showed any improvement, possibly, Impact speculates, because some big producers are making them -- they are inexpensive to concoct -- in lieu of more expensive table wines.
In the imported category, popular-priced Italian table wines were the biggest losers. Over all, shipments from Italy, the United States' largest foreign supplier, were down 12.1 percent. But individual brands suffered much more. Banfi Vintner's Reunite Classics were down 21.2 percent, and Austin-Nichols' Canei line was off 33.6 percent. Even the redoubtable Georges Duboeuf, the prominent Beaujolais shipper, posted an 11 percent drop, from 545,000 cases to 485,000, according to Impact.
Shipments from France, the second most important wine exporter after Italy, were off just under 5 percent. The Italians sent 8.1 million cases of table wines, down from 9.3 million in 1990; the French sent 5.8 million cases, down from 6.1 million. A case, by the way, contains 12 750-milliliter bottles.
As they cast about for something good to say about 1991, most wine makers and marketers clutch at the Nov. 17 broadcast of the CBS program "60 Minutes," in which French and American medical researchers suggested that France's lower incidence of heart disease might be explained by the fact that the French drink more wine than Americans do. The program suggested that the moderate consumption of wine, preferably red, could cut the risk of heart disease. The program's contentions have been criticized by some nutrition experts.
According to Impact, data from Infoscan Resources, a company that monitors supermarket sales, showed that supermarket sales of red wine rose 44 percent from late December 1991 through early January 1992. One industry leader, Art Ciocca, president of the Wine Group, told Impact that the broadcast was "an absolute watershed event for the wine industry."
 
TASTINGS
Ruffino Aziano Rosso, 1989; about $8.
 Ruffino is one of the best-known names in Italian wines. With the proliferation of newer types of wines and smaller, trendier producers, the old house of Ruffino, which has been owned by the Folonari family since 1913, is mentioned less frequently. This is a mistake. Ruffino wines, beginning with their top-of-the-line Riserva Ducale, are invariably excellent. Aziano is a Chianti Classico made from the grapes of a single vineyard called the Villa Zano, a wine property with records dating back to the 10th century. The grape mix is usually about 80 percent sangioveto grosso, with 10 percent canaiolo and other red grapes, 4 percent white grapes, and a varying amount of governo, the concentrated must of dried grapes. In other words a Chianti made mostly but not entirely in the old style. The 1989 is a rich, full-flavored wine that will hold nicely for another five years but is ready to drink now.

HEADLINE: How European Films Have Treated Blacks Through the Years

BYLINE: By SHEILA RULE

 BODY:
"Eurobeat: Blacks in European Cinema," a series at Lincoln Center at the Walter Reade Theater that explores the presence of black characters in European films from the 1920's to the present, opens today with the only surviving fragment of Josephine Baker's first feature and a movie starring Paul Robeson in one of the few nonstereotyped roles of his acting career.
The series, which runs through Aug. 20, is presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center. It includes the New York premiere on Friday of "No Fear, No Die," by the French director Claire Denis, whose first feature was the acclaimed "Chocolat" in 1988. 
 The series includes titles -- some familiar, others obscure -- from France, Switzerland, Spain, Britain, Italy and the Soviet Union. On the opening bill, Baker appears in a 25-minute chunk of "Siren of the Tropics," a semiautobiographical silent film made in France in 1927. Directed by Henri Etievant and Mario Nalpas, "Siren" is about a woman from a Caribbean plantation who, as a dancer, becomes the toast of France. In the other opening feature, Robeson appears with his wife, Eslanda, in "Borderline," a silent film made in Switzerland in 1928 by the director Kenneth MacPherson. The film looks at racial tensions that develop in a Swiss mountain resort when a black couple arrives.
Also on today's program is Montxo Armendariz's "Letters from Alou," made in Spain in 1990, which examines the harsh life and hopeful outlook of a poor Senegalese immigrant as he travels through Spain looking for work.
 
Dignity and Complexity
 As was true in Hollywood, black actors in early European films were often no more than background characters. Yet taken together, the 18 films in the series show that European film makers often portrayed blacks and race relations with more dignity and complexity than their American counterparts did. Roberto Rossellini's 1946 "Paisa," for example, is a passionate drama about the wartime relationship between an Italian boy and one of his liberators, a black American soldier. And the Yiddish-language Soviet film "The Return of Nathan Becker," made in 1932 by Boris Shpis and Rokhl M. Milman, involves a young Jew returning to his Byelorussian village from America and taking with him a black friend, whom he assures, "You, too, are going home."
Richard Pena, the program director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, theorizes that Europeans were better able to look at blacks as individuals than as representatives of a group because Europe did not begin experiencing large-scale immigration from Africa and the West Indies until after World War II.
"In certain ways, rightly or wrongly, Europeans have been able to approach black characters without as much of the history and baggage that American film makers have had," Mr. Pena said. "That's not to say that Britain, Spain and Portugal were not involved in the slave trade, but in many ways it was distant from them; it was happening somewhere else."
Mr. Pena also cited Hollywood's fear of offending moviegoers in the South. "The United States industry was meant to be a national industry," he said. "European film production was done on a much more individual basis and there has been more of a tradition of intellectual and socially oriented cinema."
Ms. Denis's "No Fear, No Die," made in 1990, is about two alienated black immigrants in France -- one from Benin in West Africa and the other from the French West Indies -- who become involved in supplying birds for cockfights.
 
Who Is French?
 "We have in France immigrants from Africa or North Africa and they are not French," Ms. Denis, who is to attend the premiere, said in a telephone interview from Martinique. "If you consider the African situation, they might be very poor immigrants with a lot of hard times. They still have in their mind that they have their own country, that they are related to another civilization."
In contrast, she added, immigrants from Martinique and Guadeloupe are French. "They have a French passport," she said. "But some white people don't want to know that people with black faces can be French. The people from Guadeloupe and Martinique become much more isolated and much more offended by the way they are treated than a person from Africa. They feel it is even more unfair because, after all, they belong to France as much as any white person."
Eight films in the series are from Britain. Of those, "The Proud Valley," Pen Tennyson's 1940 drama about unemployed Welsh coal miners who are helped by a black stoker is said to be the film of which Robeson was proudest. In the 1959 thriller "Sapphire," by Basil Dearden, the investigation of a woman's murder reveals that she was racially mixed, pregnant and passing for white. Stephen Dwoskin's "Ballet Black," in 1986, is a documentary about Les Ballets Negres, the first black ballet company in Europe.
In the magical-realist film "Ama," made in 1990 by Kwesi Owusu and Kwate Nee-Owoo, the young daughter of African parents becomes the medium for an ancestral prophesy, discovered on a computer floppy disk in the English countryside. In an interview from London, Mr. Owusu, who was born in Ghana, said the film was an attempt to "reconcile my place within the Western world in relationship to my own background."

HEADLINE: BARCELONA: BOXING;
Help Wanted? Call Havana

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain, Aug. 4

 BODY:
One of the first things you notice about Ireland's Olympic boxing team is Nicolas Hernandez Cruz.
He doesn't look Irish, and his name certainly doesn't imply that he is. 
 But Hernandez, Ireland's 34-year-old Olympic boxing coach, will tell you that since he moved to Dublin from Havana in 1988, he has adopted Ireland, from its songs to its brogue.
"I'm not Irish, but I feel like being Irish when I am here with the boxers," Hernandez said with an unmistakable Irish lilt. "I get some odd looks, mostly because of my color. They say, 'Is that the black Paddy?'
"I feel at home, really. I have all the music. I know the songs. The only difference between Dublin and Havana is the weather. Nice people, friendly people."
Hernandez is among the growing contingent of Cuban coaches who are working with teams from other countries. Once forced to import coaches and specialists from East Germany and the Soviet Union, Cuba has become a major exporter of sports advisers. Nine countries in these Olympics, including Ireland, have Cuban boxing coaches and several other nations have hired Cuban coaches in volleyball, weight lifting, track and field and other sports.
"Sports has been like an embassy for Cuba," said Raul Villanueva, the vice president of Cuba's National Institute of Sports and Physical Education. "We have a great relationship in sports with the United States. Politics has been a barrier in other areas between us, but never in sports."
As part of the latest evolution of its highly refined sports system, pride in its coaches has served as a positive link to counter Cuba's negative economic news.
In addition to Hernandez, there are Cuban boxing coaches on the Olympic teams of China, India, Mexico, Pakistan, Spain, Tanzania, Thailand and Uganda.
And Cuba's coaching presence here goes beyond boxing. Mario Figueroa is Venezuela's wrestling coach; Gilberto Herrera Delgado is the men's volleyball coach for Spain; Carlos Cruz Delgado is Mexico's track and field coach, and Jose Cortina Martinez coaches Italy's baseball team.
Spain had never even entered a team in the volleyball competition until this year, but under the direction of Herrera, for 15 years the coach of the Cuban national team, it has reached the quarterfinals.
In addition to the political benefits, there is also a significant financial component to Cuba's export of coaches. Each Cuban coach sent abroad signs a contract for a one or two years. Half of the money received from the hiring nation goes to the coach and the other half goes back to the Cuban sports system, to help Cuba's teams to travel, train and live a privileged life style.
The amount of money received varies, depending on the country, the sport and the level of competition involved. For example, Herrera receives more because he is a national team coach for Spain, whereas many of the other Cubans abroad work in younger divisions.
Hernandez is not a typical product of Cuba's boxing system, because he didn't begin in the sport until he was 18. But by 1981, he was rated the second-best light heavyweight in Cuba. He missed the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles because of a Soviet-led boycott, and he missed a shot at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul because Cuba boycotted those Games in solidarity with North Korea.
He graduated from the University of Sports Culture in 1983, and began to work as a coach that same year, even as he continued to fight. Three years later, he returned to the university as a professor of sport and physical culture, and he still has that post.
 
Foreign Coaches Gone
 Cruz remembers that when he began boxing in the 1970's, there were 42 foreign coaches in Cuba. As Cuba participates in its first Olympics in 12 years, there is only one foreign coach in its contingent, in archery.
In Montreal in 1976, at the last Summer Olympics unaffected by boycotts because of East-West tensions, Cuban boxers won three gold medals, three silvers and two bronzes. In competition here at the 1992 Games, Cuban boxers have dominated thus far, winning 34 bouts and losing only three through today. In addition, the baseball team was undefeated after tonight's 6-1 victory over the United States.
Cuba has recently taken significant steps to upgrade in several other sports, and the results here have been promising. Among the medals the Cubans have so far won in Barcelona are ones in fencing, judo, Greco-Roman wrestling, weight lifting and track and field.
For Cuban officials, however, the most significant sign of the country's continuing advancement in sports is the fact that coaches like Hernandez have become valuable international commodities.
There are 150 Cuban coaches working throughout the world in a variety of sports and the Cuban coaches may be in even greater demand after the Olympics.
"Even here at the boxing competition, other countries have approached us and asked us to send them some of our coaches," Villanueva said. "The fact that our coaches are being requested is a source of pride and prestige for the country. It shows the high level of sports we have achieved."
Ireland won five Olympic medals in the 1950's, but the country's last Olympic boxing medal was a flyweight bronze at Moscow in 1980. The country's sports officials hope the presence of Hernandez will lead to more medals and international success, but Hernandez said that it won't be easy. Two Irish fighters have reached the semifinal round, bantamweight Wayne McCullough and welterwight Michael Carruth.
"There is a big difference between boxing in Ireland and Cuba," said Hernandez, who while growing up participated in basketball before he turned to boxing. "The main difference is that the Irish are part-time boxers, the Cubans are full-time boxers. They train every day without worrying about losing their jobs or how to find a job.
"Unemployment is a big problem in Ireland. How can you get the money to bring back to your family? Some of the amateurs trying to make a living out of boxing -- some of them work very hard, work in the day three times a week and train. But training after being tired, how can you produce?"
 
10 Months Since His Last Visit
 For Hernandez, the most difficult part about living in Ireland has been being away from his wife and their daughter. "This time it has been 10 months away from home," he said, referring to his second stint in Dublin. "I have a daughter 4 years who I haven't seen since last October."
At least the Olympics have provided Hernandez with an opportunity to see Cuban friends he hasn't seen in a long time. "All of the coaches get together each night at the Olympic Village," he said. "We play cards, tell stories, jokes."
 
Heart Is With Irish Now
 But Hernandez said his heart is now with his Irish boxers.
"I want my boxer to win," he said. "I've been sweating and training with them. How can I say that I want the other boxer to win?"
Where is his heart when Ireland is not fighting?
"When I am not with the Irish, I just enjoy boxing," Hernandez said. "My motto is, 'Let the best man win.' I put my hands together for that one that deserves to win. It doesn't matter where he comes from.
"We are all human beings. We all are working very hard to win."

HEADLINE: Dangerous Stalling on Russian Aid

 BODY:
The U.S. wants to propel Russia toward democracy, markets and disarmament. But you'd never guess that by watching the House toy with the Administration's bill to assist the former Soviet republics. Proposed in April, the House bill -- whose Senate version passed in early July -- has remained bottled up in committee.
The Russian economy is collapsing, and opposition is mounting to President Boris Yeltsin's pro-market reforms. Yet the House dallies. If it delays much longer, there might be no reform Government left to help. 
 Western aid alone can't turn the Russian economy around. But it can cushion the shock of the transition to markets, help Mr. Yeltsin overcome domestic opposition and keep reforms marching forward. Russia's immediate need is $5 or $10 billion to import food, medicine and factory raw materials at a time when centralized controls have been dismantled but market controls haven't arisen to take their place.
The Administration's bill would make a modest start. It would help to promote markets, dismantle defense installations and facilitate the exchange of technical assistance. The money would be provided only if Russia keeps democratic and economic progress alive.
The centerpiece of the bill would authorize a $12 billion increase in the U.S. contribution to the International Monetary Fund. Because the money is considered a deposit at the fund, not an expenditure, it wouldn't trigger tax hikes or spending cuts. The U.S. deposit, along with similar contributions by other fund members, would be used to support various I.M.F. aid programs -- including those it hopes to negotiate with Mr. Yeltsin.
For now, the I.M.F. is key. The West has promised the Russians a $24 billion aid package; a chunk would come from the fund. And the I.M.F. would have to approve Russia's economic plan before the aid package would be released.
Agreement has proved dismayingly elusive. Some, but not all, of the problem is unnecessary rigidity on the part of the I.M.F. The fund's task has been made fiendishly difficult by divisions within the Russian Government. By reinforcing the reform faction, Congressional action would make durable and believable commitments to monetary and fiscal austerity easier to strike.
Western aid would allow the Russians to pay their bills without printing mountains of new rubles. That way Mr. Yeltsin can clamp down on inflation without clamping down on the economy. And that might buy him some breathing space to launch his ambitious plans to privatize state-owned enterprises and open the economy to foreign trade and investment.
The danger is that, without sizable help from abroad, the pain of market reform will prove backbreaking, impelling politicians to retreat to centralized controls. There's no excuse for the House to flirt with that disastrous possibility.

HEADLINE: The Sleaze Factor

 BODY:
Mary Matalin's snarling press release attacking Gov. Bill Clinton -- it referred, among other things, to "bimbo eruptions" plaguing the Clinton campaign -- is said to have embarrassed President Bush. As well it should. Ms. Matalin's broadside defied Mr. Bush's admonition to his staff to avoid personal invective. And it deflected public attention from his effort to start talking aggressively about issues.
Despite Mr. Bush's disavowal of Ms. Matalin's comments, issued through an aide, questions linger. Was Ms. Matalin engaging in the political tactic known as "surrogate sleaze" -- carrying out an authorized attack for which Mr. Bush could later deny responsibility? After all, Ms. Matalin, as deputy campaign manager, is no small potato in the Bush re-election effort and is presumably in regular consultation with the White House. 
 Even if Ms. Matalin was flying solo, she may have done so in the confident expectation that her charges would be secretly welcomed. There's one other possibility: that Mr. Bush meant what he said the first time and that Ms. Matalin never got the message. In that case the Bush campaign is more frazzled, incompetent and confused than even its worst critics suspected.
Granted, Presidential races are not tea parties. They are usually rough and often harsh. It is the rare candidate who can promote his own vision without ridiculing his opponent's. Al Gore calls Mr. Bush a "hypocrite" on the environment. Mr. Bush says Mr. Clinton's health care program shows "all the compassion of the K.G.B." Even Ms. Matalin's charge that Mr. Clinton's campaign is "lower than a snake's belly" fits comfortably into the less-than-noble tradition of American political discourse.
The question is where to draw the line. Negative campaigns are disheartening enough; campaigns that employ personal invective are more so. Mr. Bush seemed to realize as much when, in early July, he repudiated a TV commercial (independently produced by a Republican loyalist) about Mr. Clinton's relationship with Gennifer Flowers. Mr. Bush said the ad was "the kind of sleaze that diminishes the political process."
That was not only the right thing to say. It was also politically shrewd. Voters are growing resistant to sleaze, and with the economy faltering they are far more interested in what both candidates intend to do about national problems than they are in anyone's personal life.
That point appears to have escaped Ms. Matalin. In an interview with The New York Times a few days before her press release, she said Bill Clinton's big problem was simply that he's "evasive and slick. We've never said to the press that he's a philandering, pot-smoking draft dodger."
"The way you just did?" she was asked. "The way I just did," she conceded.
Voters care about a candidate's character, about integrity and truthfulness, just as they care about the issues. In the end they tend to rely on the public record and their private instincts. Raw innuendo adds little to public enlightenment and discredits its author. Mr. Bush has now made that point twice. Beware if he has to make it again.

Smoking And Politics

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
It is both quite simple and somehow difficult to write about cigarette smoking. The simple part is this: Smoking kills. Cigarettes are, as Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, once said, "the only legal product that when used as intended cause death." It is lung cancer, not breast cancer, that is now the number one cancer killer of American women. "Smoking is associated with more death and illness than drugs, alcohol, automobile accidents and AIDS combined."
That last is from the memoirs of C. Everett Koop, who as Surgeon General did more to promote a smoke-free America than anyone. 
 This is the difficult part: Why do we allow the sale of a product that has no beneficial effects and many fatal ones? Why do we allow cigarette advertising to be a tissue of lies? Why do we tolerate an industry that attracts and addicts consumers when young, many too young to legally purchase the product?
I can't recall hearing a President inveigh publicly against smoking. While President Bush talks of the "behavior" that must be modified if AIDS is to be conquered, I don't recall hearing him decry the "behavior" that causes emphysema.
Jimmy Carter, in a speech earlier this year, spoke of his intimate interest in the problem. "My father, my mother, both sisters and my brother all died of cancer," he said. "And all smoked cigarettes." On television not long ago Al Gore had to fight to maintain his composure as he talked of watching his sister, Nancy, die of lung cancer.
Neighbors of the Gores have said that the family stopped growing tobacco on their farm after Nancy's death. But the Clinton-Gore campaign will benefit from contributions of more than $680,000 given to Democratic Party committees by various tobacco interests. Republicans have received more than $1.2 million in such contributions, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, in Washington D.C.
(In his memoirs Dr. Koop describes heavyhanded efforts by elected officials friendly to the tobacco industry to persuade him to ditch his crusade. "Everywhere there were reminders about the cozy relationship between tobacco and politics," Dr. Koop writes. "At Republican fund-raiser dinners each table offered free cigarettes, complete with the President's profile embossed in gold.")
The tobacco companies have been enormous beneficiaries of the American system. Our emphasis on personal responsibility means that even activists oppose outright prohibition. The tension between human services and the economy means that we have both a Health and Human Services smoking office, budgeted last year at around $8 million, and a Department of Agriculture tobacco program with a budget of nearly five times that for support services like crop insurance subsidies and research and development.
One in four Americans smokes. Many started as teen-agers, anxious to show how grown-up they were. Then they couldn't stop, even after they saw the dark spot on the X-ray. One way to prevent tobacco addiction is to fight it as zealously in schools and in advertising as we do drugs. There must be some lung cancer patients willing to show kids how glamorous and grown-up radiation can be.
The biggest change in recent years, people will say, is that everyone knows now that cigarettes cause cancer. But only 10 years ago the chairman of R. J. Reynolds was still saying that "no causal link between smoking and disease has been established." Today the official line from the Tobacco Institute is: "We recognize the risks associated with smoking; at the same time there is virtual universal awareness by the public of those risks."
But there isn't universal awareness of how tenacious cigarette addiction can be. And there is little awareness among kids of how mortality can come knocking at your door. Will we ever have a President who speaks fiercely to this issue? Or a First Lady who looks at how many brands are targeted to women, and at how many women die, and takes up the fight as her personal cause?
That would be politically difficult, given the enormous power of the tobacco lobby. But to balance the difficult, there is the simple truth: Cigarettes contribute to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people every year. One of them may be someone you love. And if you hold a person's hand and watch her die, it seems to me that your only choice afterward is to go after the killer.

HEADLINE: What America Owes the Ex-Soviet Union

BYLINE: By James A. Baker 3d; James A. Baker 3d is Secretary of State.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Twice before in this century, America was summoned to international leadership. After World War I, we ignored the summons, and we and the world paid dearly. After World War II, wiser from experience with depression and dictatorship, we heeded the call to leadership and created the democratic coalition that won the cold war. Today, America is summoned again, this time to secure a democratic peace with Russia, Ukraine and the other new independent states of the former Soviet Union.
As President Bush said, "Democrats in the Kremlin can assure our security in a way nuclear missiles never could." The House of Representatives, by passing the Freedom Support Act, can help those democrats -- and help America, too. 
 Just seven weeks ago, in his address to a joint session of Congress, Boris Yeltsin spoke as Russia's first freely elected President, boldly committed to democracy and free enterprise. He spoke as a full partner in the search for security, eager to join President Bush in the most far-reaching nuclear arms reductions in history. And he spoke as a friend, prepared to end secrecy and throw open secret files that can help shed light on the fate of M.I.A.'s and P.O.W.'s.
The Freedom Support Act, announced April 1 by President Bush, is a crucial step in building a democratic peace. The act comprehensively addresses the military, political and economic problems of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Armenia and the other new states.
The act will support arms control, nonproliferation and nuclear safety. It will expand our democratization programs and encourage free markets. It will make it easier for U.S. companies to invest in and trade with the new independent states. That's good for American businesses and could create thousands of jobs for American workers. Indeed, helping develop vast new markets in the states of the former Soviet Union will create great possibilities for America's economy.
* The act is not a foreign aid give-away. President Yeltsin and other reformers are attempting to build modern, free-market economies on the ruins of Communism. Their task is extraordinarily difficult and complicated by political turmoil and deep economic hardship. Our help is no handout. The reformers must make the hard decisions and do the hard work. Our help cannot guarantee they will succeed -- but should Congress fail to act, their task will be all the more difficult. All who want to see this brave experiment prevail must help them succeed, for their sake and for ours.
* The act is America's share -- and a fair one -- in a coalition effort. The problems of the former Soviet Union are too huge for any one country to tackle. In a policy I call collective engagement, we have joined forces with other major industrial democracies, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
* Above all, the act is an investment in America's security, now and in the future. There are two peace dividends. The first is financial and important. The second is human -- the freedom from fear we wish for all Americans -- and it is vital. If Russian and other reformers fail, if democracy collapses and authoritarianism returns, both dividends will slip through our fingers and we will all lose. Defense budgets would rise again and the fear of confrontation we knew during 40 years of cold war would be certain to return.
* The Senate has passed the Freedom Support Act. The House of Representatives should not hesitate, because history certainly will not. Events are moving quickly in the former Soviet Union, and we must keep step to help shape them. It will take statesmanship to pass the act -- and pass it quickly. Statesmanship is the ability to distinguish between a reason and an excuse.
There could be plenty of excuses for the House to reject the act or to cripple it with "killer amendments": the Federal budget is tight, times at home are lean, this is an election year. But there is a simple, compelling reason why the act should pass: It will help insure our security for decades to come.
Statesmen of the 1940's -- from national leaders like Harry S. Truman and Senator Arthur Vandenberg to freshman Congressmen like John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon -- understood the difference between reasons and excuses. They answered their generations' summons to international leadership.
Today, it will require similar statesmanship, from Democrats and Republicans alike, to answer our call to leadership and secure a democratic peace for future generations of Americans.

HEADLINE: Reducing Casualties in the Abortion Battle

BYLINE: By Mario M. Cuomo; Mario M. Cuomo is Governor of New York.

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
The struggle over when and whether abortion should remain a legal choice for American women seems likely to rage on for years, and while people of good will struggle over their polarized views, what should be a vital common ground may continue to be neglected.
Whatever else the abortion adversaries believe, most of them would also agree that there are entirely too many abortions in this country. Of the six million pregnancies in the United States every year, more than half are unplanned; more than a quarter -- 1.5 million -- end in abortion. That's a rate higher than for any other industrialized Western nation. 
 It's here that we may find some real hope of accomplishing what most people agree is a desirable goal -- reducing the rate of abortion by helping women avoid the circumstances that press them to make such a difficult choice. It's an idea that could join people rather than tear them apart. Here are some general principles I would suggest as a starting point for such a constructive discourse.
First, we should try to teach young men and women their responsibility in creating and caring for human life. At the very least, young people should hear from us that they are not deficient because they choose to abstain from sexual relations until another and better time.
Today, speaking up for abstention may sound old-fashioned and naive, but if we don't, we run the risk of saying -- with our silence -- that we condone the alternative message of the popular culture, that sexual activity is a necessary way to validate one's maturity.
At the same time, however, we must recognize that not all young people will follow the path of restraint -- even with our best efforts -- so every young American who is sexually active but not yet prepared for the responsibilities of parenthood should have access to complete, intelligent information and counsel on the possible consequences of sexual activity and on the uses of contraception. Now more than ever, responsible sex education is an appropriate part of the public school curriculum.
Some of us believe the use of contraceptives is wrong. Those who do have a right to live by that belief. That is one of the great beauties of this democracy: No one can be required to have an abortion or to use contraception. But for the sake of those who believe that contraception is a better alternative than an unwanted pregnancy that ends in abortion, we should invest in better, simpler, safer contraceptive technology.
Beyond abstinence, education and contraception, there is another partial solution that deserves our attention: adoption. Some women would choose not to end a pregnancy if they could be relieved of some or all of the emotional, physical, financial and social commitments of rearing a child -- commitments they judge themselves incapable of undertaking for a lifetime.
We need to re-examine the adoption alternative, not as a panacea for abortion but as one of the many ways we can create real choices for people. There are literally thousands of couples eager to adopt. We should remove undue obstacles to adoption where they exist, making the process as easy as possible, consistent with prudence.
Finally, for those women who might consider an abortion because of economic extremity, we must make sure that carrying a child to term is a realistic choice. Specifically, we must make the health care needed to have and raise a healthy child as available as the care needed to receive an abortion. That's the New York policy; it should be America's.
Everyone, I hope, would agree that life beyond the womb deserves more consideration, but in this regard our work has barely begun. We are a long way from creating a society where the concern for new life doesn't end at the moment of birth; where an infant isn't helped into a world that doesn't care if a baby is fed properly, housed decently, educated adequately; where the blind or disabled child isn't condemned to exist rather than empowered to live.
Unless we change the terms of the debate, the question of abortion rights will lock our nation in combat indefinitely. To allow the current differences on this subject to postpone humane and constructive action to reduce the need for abortion and improve the lot of our children would be foolish.
As we have done for a decade in New York State, we must resolve as a nation to pursue every avenue that helps bring down the rate of unintended pregnancy and, therefore, the number of abortions. Wouldn't it be useful if both Governor Clinton and President Bush could join in such a discussion?

HEADLINE: Enticed by Tax Breaks, Prudential Will Stay in New York

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Having declined to take space in the Times Square Center office complex planned by its parent company, Prudential Securities Inc. has nonetheless decided to stay in New York City, keeping its headquarters and about 5,000 jobs in lower Manhattan.
The Prudential brokerage firm is to receive tax incentives and energy savings worth at least $106.2 million over 20 years. In return, it is to sign 20-year leases for a total of 1.5 million square feet of space at One Seaport Plaza, where it now has its headquarters, and One New York Plaza. 
 By keeping Prudential in New York, the city will realize more than $830 million in tax revenue over 20 years, Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday as he announced the deal with Howard A. (Woody) Knight, an executive vice president of Prudential Securities.
The Mayor described the deal as the "second-largest lease transaction in the history of the city," exceeded only by Merrill Lynch's commitment to 3.9 million square feet at the World Financial Center in 1984.
"Let there be no mistake -- and Woody, you can back me up on this -- P.S.I. was out the door," Mr. Dinkins said. "They had launched an intensive two-year search for more affordable space. But we are fighters. And this is a win for all of us."
Deputy Mayor Barry F. Sullivan said there was no direct link between the decision by Prudential Securities to stay in New York and a recent decision by city and state officials to relieve the Prudential Insurance Company of America of its obligation to follow a construction timetable at Times Square Center, of which it is a developer.
But Mr. Sullivan added, "I have to tell you that the good will from one negotiation washed over to the other, and vice versa." Under the tentative Times Square agreement, the developers would invest about $30 million in renovations along 42d Street.
Although it has not been completed, the Times Square deal has already been criticized by State Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Manhattan Democrat, for needlessly consuming millions of dollars in public money for acquisition of the site.
And the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, who has frequently questioned the city's incentive policies, said yesterday of the Prudential Securities deal that "any financial package this size requires an examination of its costs and benefits." But she said she was "delighted that Prudential Securities remains a part of the New York community."
 
Deemed Inappropriate
 Among "literally hundreds" of alternatives Prudential Securities was considering for its operations, Mr. Knight said, was Times Square Center, a four-tower office project on Broadway and Seventh Avenue.
But Mr. Knight said that in February, Prudential executives "concluded it would not be appropriate" for the firm to move to 42d Street.
Even if Times Square Center had been ready when Prudential's leases began expiring in 1994, Mr. Knight said, "we would have been one of the very first people in a project that had a long time from start to finish."
What that would have meant, said Rodger G. Parker, a senior vice president at Prudential Securities, was that the area "would be in a state of flux probably for five years."
 
Search Led to Other Cities
 Instead, Prudential will lease one million square feet in One New York Plaza, at Water and Broad Streets, a 50-story building owned by the Chase Manhattan Bank, and renew its lease for 500,000 square feet in One Seaport Plaza, at Water and Fulton Streets, a 34-story building owned by the Resnick family. It will vacate space in six other buildings downtown.
The search for new space took the company to Houston, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Jersey City, as well as Times Square, Mr. Parker said.
But Mr. Knight said state and city officials were able to "level the playing field" through the incentives.
The package includes these items:
*An estimated $48.4 million in energy savings through the use of power generated by the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant.
*An estimated $41.1 million in tax revenue that the city will forgo in sales taxes on construction materials and major equipment like computers and telecommunications systems, real estate taxes, commercial rent taxes and mortgage-recording taxes.
*An estimated $16.7 million in tax revenue that the state will forgo in sales and mortgage-recording taxes.
The package does not include the tax benefits that Chase Manhattan might receive, under the city's new Industrial and Commercial Incentive Program, for the renovation of the Prudential space.

HEADLINE: A Compromise on Radio Station Ownership

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
The Federal Communications Commission took the middle road today on radio ownership, bowing to opposition from Congress and the radio industry itself.
The agency raised the number of radio stations that a single company may control, to 18 AM and 18 FM stations from the current 12 each, but it retreated from the new rules that it issued earlier this year that would have allowed a company to own 30 AM stations and 30 FM stations. 
 Critics had said the higher limits could have led to a few broadcasters dominating the nation's airwaves.
The F.C.C. also ruled that radio companies could buy noncontrolling stakes in an additional 3 AM and 3 FM stations beyond the 18, if the new stations were owned by members of minority groups. After two years, the limit on controlling interests will be 20 AM and 20 FM outlets, plus the 3 additional, noncontrolling stakes.
 
Help for Three Companies
 The new rules will take effect when published in the Federal Register, probably within a month or so.
Three companies are nearing the old ownership limits and presumably could take advantage of the new rules soon: Capital Cities/ABC Inc. of New York, with interests in 11 AM and 10 FM stations nationwide; the Willis Broadcasting Corporation of Richmond, with interests in 13 AM and 13 FM stations, and Ragan Henry of Philadelphia, with interests in 9 AM and 12 FM stations. Willis and Ragan Henry are minority-owned.
The companies could not be immediately reached for comment.
Since 1940, the F.C.C. has limited the number of stations that a single owner can control. But in the 1980's, it licensed more than 2,000 new radio stations at a time when competition from MTV and other cable-television music programs reduced radio's share of advertising dollars. Today, more than half the industry's 11,000 stations are unprofitable, and scores of stations are closing. Concerns owned by members of minority groups were hit especially hard.
Earlier this year, the commission proposed to loosen the ownership limits so that financially stronger companies could rescue the weaker ones and thus promote diverse voices in radio programming.
But even the radio industry, especially smaller stations, felt the commission had gone too far, especially in adopting rules that allowed broadcasters to buy as many as 6 radio stations in the largest markets. Some radio broadcasters also feared that reaction in Congress would be so adverse that lawmakers would pass legislation freezing the ownership limit at 12 AM and 12 FM.
Alfred C. Sikes, F.C.C. chairman, favored the proposal to raise the limits, which commission staff members had drafted, but had difficulty winning support on the five-member panel. Commissioners Andrew C. Barrett, Ervin S. Duggan and James H. Quello opposed the more sweeping F.C.C. staff proposal but favored some change. Only Sherrie P. Marshall sided with Mr. Sikes.
The National Association of Broadcasters, the radio industry trade group, said in a news release yesterday, "The commission has answered the radio industry's distress signals with rules that will clearly help keep the industry afloat and on course."
Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and a leader of the opposition to the F.C.C. rules, said in a statement, "The commission has wisely decided to moderate its excessive decision of last March." He added that the new rules would improve the industry's economic well-being while avoiding "the risk of excessive concentration."
 
An Angry Letter
 In an angry letter to Mr. Sikes, dated May 27, Representative Dingell implied that the agency had acted hastily and had seemed to ignore evidence that high limits would lead to an alarmingly low number of broadcasters owning most of America's radio stations. He complained of an "apparent lack of analytical support" for the 30-30 limits.
The commission then produced an analysis, explaining an earlier worst-case scenario, under which 166 broadcast companies could end up owning all of America's radio stations, down from 5,200 nationwide.
"We heard that after Congressman Dingell asked for the analysis, people over at the F.C.C. were up all weekend preparing one," said Dennis Fitzgibbons, Mr. Dingell's press secretary. William H. Johnson, deputy chief of the bureau that prepared the economic analysis, disputed the contention that the commission lacked an analysis but acknowledged that "some of the work was done before the Congressman's letter and some of it was done after."
 
'Pioneer's Preference' Rejected
 In other actions, the commission denied a much-sought-after "pioneer's preference" to five companies seeking to establish a satellite telephone system that would allow customers to place cellular telephone calls from anywhere on Earth, even the remotest regions.
A pioneer's preference would give a company numerous regulatory advantages and the use of the critical parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that are under Government supervision and are necessary for providing the phone service.
Five companies are seeking to establish satellite phone service, including Motorola Inc., whose Iridium project is the most ambitious. Motorola and financial backers that it has not yet lined up plan to spend more than $3 billion to launch a constellation of 77 satellites.
The commission's staff concluded and the commission agreed that no company's plan was so innovative as to qualify for the preference.
The commission also agreed with a staff proposal that paved the way for shifting part of the electromagnetic spectrum now used by oil companies, electrical utilities and ambulance services to new concerns offering what are known as personal communications services.

HEADLINE: Brown Says Community Policing Will Endure

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
Imperturbable, guarded, at times wistful, and above all jovially confident, Lee P. Brown took stock yesterday of the New York City Police Department that he will be leaving at month's end and pronounced himself satisfied that the new wave of local-based policing he sponsored would outlive his abrupt departure.
He said the executive staff he put in place -- including his interim successor, First Deputy Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly -- combined with new systems set in place and the strong commitment of Mayor David N. Dinkins to community policing would preserve his legacy, which he called the only option for the department. 
 "It's no longer a program," he said. "This is how we do business."
Yet, he acknowledged, "We don't have a manual that we're following -- we're doing a lot of this as we're going along."
At City Hall, meanwhile, Mayor Dinkins and some of his aides said yesterday that Fritz W. Alexander, the deputy mayor for public safety, hoped to announce by Friday or Monday a committee of four or five police experts from outside the department to screen candidates for the commissioner's job. Mr. Dinkins said he would not give the panel a deadline although he wanted them to move "as quickly as they can."
In his first long interview after his surprise announcement on Monday that he would quit to spend time with his ill wife, Mr. Brown, a 54-year-old police professional and criminologist, said he had "a lot of regrets" at not being able to see his program through to fruition in 1996, when the number of officers will peak at about 31,000, up from about 28,000 now.
"I'll have to watch from afar," he said, calling his two and a half years at the helm of the nation's largest police department "the apex of my career" -- where else, he asked, was there to go after that?
In fact, it will be back to Houston, where he served as Police Chief from 1982 to 1990 and where, starting Sept. 1, he said, he will begin teaching at Texas Southern University while his wife, Yvonne, receives medical treatment. Citing her privacy, he declined to say anything about her illness or condition, but associates have said she has cancer. The couple have twin daughters attending Texas Southern, as well as two other grown children in the Chicago area. Mr. Brown said he had sold his house in Houston and would have to start house hunting all over again.
 
Points to Make
 Sitting at times bolt upright and at other times fidgeting in a wing chair in his top-floor office overlooking Chinatown, Mr. Brown, in a gray houndstooth suit, crisp white shirt and navy polka-dot tie, made the following points, among others:
*While speaking warmly of Mr. Kelly, he declined to say whether he favored Mr. Kelly as his permanent replacement. But he said "race shouldn't be a factor" in the appointment. Some of the suggested candidates for the job are black, as is Commissioner Brown. Mr. Kelly, as are several of the others, is white. Mr. Brown said that he stood ready to assist in the selection, but he had not been approached.
*He said that while he had been "sidetracked by crises" like a police drug-corruption scandal and disturbances in Washington Heights triggered by perceived police brutality, he saw none of the crises as symptoms of serious failures by himself or the department.
*Although he and Mayor Dinkins did not always see eye to eye, he said, "I'm not mad at the Mayor." As for rivalries with budget officials and others at City Hall, he said he had always clashed with those who would cut his funds or try to run his department.
*The abrupt resignation by Chief of Department David W. Scott, the department's highest uniformed officer, was unrelated, Mr. Brown said, to his own resignation. Mr. Brown said he was told by Chief Scott of his plans to retire for health reasons before Chief Scott could have know of Mr. Browns own plans.
The Commissioner, renowned for his equanimity and relentlessly upbeat predictions, said community policing had been too firmly rooted to be jeopardized although, he said, in every crisis, "There are those who would clamor to go back to the old ways."
He warned that if the economy seriously worsened and crime soared "quite likely there would be a demand to go back to traditional policing." But he voiced confidence that the collaboration of the police and neighborhood residents and citizens' groups, working together to identify and solve problems, would withstand challenges.
Even in the event of Los Angeles-type riots, he said, "It would still be better to have a cop firmly fixed in the community on a permanent basis than a SWAT team waiting to put out disorders."
His tone turned plaintive as he spoke of not being able to see his plans mature. "I would prefer to have been here," he said quietly.
 
Hiring Up, Crime Down
 Although foot patrol strength has grown from 750 officers in August 1990 to some 3,000 now, the full complement of 5,000 will not be reached until the hiring plan is completed in 1996, he said. The original plan to hire 1,626 more civilian employees to free police officers assigned to desk jobs has been sharply scaled back because of the fiscal crisis, a matter of some disappointment, Mr. Brown said.
But he attributed at least a share of recent dips in reported crimes to community policing. Reported crimes have been down over the corresponding month of the year before for 20 of the last 21 months. In the first four months of this year there has been a 6.7 percent drop from the four months in the same period a year ago.
He said that in the case of a Brooklyn officer, Michael Dowd, accused of running a cocaine ring with other officers, there was "blame all over the place" -- not just in the Police Department but also in the former special prosecutor's office and District Attorney's offices.
Checking the records, Mr. Brown said, he found some police scandal in each of the last 20 years.
He also defended his absence during the recent outbreak of rioting in Washington Heights after a police officer fatally shot a suspected drug dealer. He said that while visiting his mother in Fresno, Calif., he remained in close touch with his office.
He said resignation was straightforward: "I've been married 34 years," he said haltingly. "My wife has been the person who has followed me all over the place in terms of my career. And at a time when she's in need, I'm going to make sure I'm there for her. That's the bottom line."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
There They Go Again: Clinton and Gore Climb Back on Bus for a 3-Day Trip

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Iowa, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Having their act together, Bill Clinton and Al Gore are taking it on the road again.
No Presidential ticket has ever put together anything like the political stage show of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, which is so mutually supportive that it sometimes resembles an old vaudeville act -- "Absolutely, Mr. Clinton. Positively, Mr. Gore" -- as each man relentlessly complements and compliments the other. 
 And few pieces of political theater have ever had such initial success as did Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore in their tryouts, when they found cheering crowds and glowing press throughout a six-day bus trip from Manhattan to St. Louis.
In search of more of the same, Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore, their wives, the Gores' oldest daughter, 40 or so staff members and 150 journalists returned to their buses and the highways of the Middle West today in a three-day trip that will take the entourage from St. Louis (picking up where the first trip ended) north through border towns and small cities in Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
 
Rehearsed Spontaneity
 The bus tour started out with the Clintons and the Gores exhibiting somewhat self-conscious displays of high spirits as they posed for the cameras at Lambert Field, the St. Louis airport. Mrs. Clinton, who started out the day wearing a button reading "Hillary Clinton: One Smart Cookie," and Mrs. Gore whispered and giggled and hugged each other.
Mrs. Clinton sounded a bit like a cruise ship recreation director as she exhorted the crowd at the airport. "Are you ready? Are you ready? This is going to be fun," she said, adding, "We're going to start singing 'Happy Trails.' "
Their first day out, the Democrats found very much what they were looking for. After an appearance before a smaller-than-expected crowd in East St. Louis, Ill., to begin the trip, the buses left the Interstate system and proceeded north through a series of small Mississippi River towns and cities in a sort of "Blue Highways" political journey.
As the entourage of 15 vehicles moved along blacktop lanes through cornfields and river flatlands, crowds of flag- and sign-waving people began to be seen at gas stations, intersections and country stores. Four times in the space of 100 miles, the crowds were large enough to bring the procession to a halt and send the candidates, shirtsleeved and beaming, out to shake hands and say hello to the hundreds of people stretched along rope lines.
The tone of the people who came out to see the candidates was notable for its infectious enthusiasm, with people pushing and yelling in their rush to get the attention and, if possible, the touch of the candidates. In Wayland, Mo., Mayor Bill Moss was among the more than 500 people who gathered in the late afternoon. Mr. Clinton, greeting him, asked what the population of the town was.
"Whole bunch bigger now," Mr. Moss said. (Officially, it is 391.)
It was clear that Democratic officials along the way had worked hard, using radio announcements and telephone networks, to bring out the crowds. For several days before this trip, Clinton tacticians have been busily playing down the size of the crowds they expected to see.
In fact, the Democrats had taken efforts to build the most self-consciously dramatic crowd of the day, a group of more than a thousand people gathered at a gas station and parking lot off a state highway in Bowling Green, Mo. The size of the crowd forced the bus entourage to what was billed as a "spontaneous" stop.
"There was quite a lot of phone calls," said Helen Pratt of Franklin, Mo. "I got called by Brenda Wells, the sheriff's wife, who is the vice president of the Women's Democrat League around here, and I gathered up a whole bunch of people and brought them down."
 
City by the River
 The day culminated here in Burlington, a manufacturing and farming city of 27,000 on the banks of the Mississippi River, where Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, evidently exultant, took the stage before a crowd of some 10,000 people, many of whom had been waiting for hours to see them.
Mr. Clinton quickly went into a new and especially pointed attack on President Bush for his handling of the recession, drawing on a quote from the President published in a news report today. "My opponent is quoted as saying the recession is over," Mr. Clinton said. "You just don't know it. That's what they've been telling you all along. Things are great. You're just too dumb to see it."
In Hannibal, Mo., Samuel Clemens's hometown by the Mississippi, the crowds were large enough to be more than respectable, and seemed nearly as enthusiastic as those that greeted the Democrats on their first trip together.
They used the friendly settings to continue their escalating attacks on President Bush. In the deeply impoverished city of East St. Louis, where the bus caravan first stopped, both candidates offered a sharply heightened and more pointed criticism of Mr. Bush for his handling of the civil war in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, suggesting that he was, in not taking more forceful action, ignoring a genocidal situation that they implicitly compared to the Holocaust.
In the small, green city of Hannibal where Clemens grew up, and where half the shops and restaurants in town exploit the writer's pen name, the Arkansas Governor invoked the shade of Mark Twain in a sort of literary-politico jab at Mr. Bush. "Mark Twain once said petrified opinions and old ideas never did anything to break a chain or free a human soul," he said. "That's what we have in Washington: petrified ideas."
"Their whole idea is that it could be worse," Mr. Clinton said. "Our whole idea is that it could be better."

HEADLINE: In Budgetless California, a Sense of Business as Usual

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Aug. 5

 BODY:
On California's 36th day without a state budget, negotiations here are moving sluggishly, lawmakers are cranky, Gov. Pete Wilson's face is etched with strain and state workers are scrambling to cash the i.o.u.'s they are getting instead of paychecks.
Today the Bank of America, the state's largest bank, stopped offering cash to its customers in exchange for the i.o.u.'s and several other banks are expected to follow suit at week's end. 
 But despite the $10.7 billion budget gap, the ballooning interest costs on the i.o.u.'s, the precipitous drop in California's credit rating and the steadily deteriorating economy, what is most striking here in this scorching state capital is the sense of business as usual.
Legislative committees continue to debate bills about mobile-home loans and the reporting requirements for dialysis centers. Tourists, many of them Californians, continue to troop through the Capitol rotunda and relax on the leafy grounds.
Lobbyists continue to buttonhole lawmakers and aides at the water coolers. And government officials continue to lament the fact that the state, unlike the Federal Government, lacks the statutory authority to furlough workers or close monuments in order to generate a sense of urgency about the failure to agree on a budget for the fiscal year that began July 1.
 
An Old, Familiar Tune
 "All the experts were expecting that people would take to the street in righteous anger," said Dan Schnur, Governor Wilson's director of communications. "But people have built up a lot of resistance. They've been inoculated by years of budget shortfalls. They've heard this all before."
Indeed, California has often failed to finish its budget by July 1 in years past. But this year is different, because there is no reserve fund to cover the temporary lapse.
Governor Wilson and the four legislative leaders met this afternoon in what is still known here as the Ronald Reagan Cabinet Room. Similar meetings have taken place since Friday.
While the Bank of America's refusal to accept any more i.o.u.'s inconvenienced state workers who patronize it, they will not be left in straitened circumstances, as employees at the huge bank were quick to tell them. Other banks and credit unions, primarily First Interstate, the No. 3 bank in the state, and Credit One, the credit union that serves three-fourths of the state workers in the area, still accept the warrants. In fact, they are saying so in their advertising, hoping to lure new customers.
By all accounts the only people so far who are truly suffering from the stalemate are the vendors who do business with the state, providing goods and services at prisons, hospitals and other institutions. While a law requires that state employees be paid, at least with i.o.u.'s, and a court order for the time being guarantees health and welfare payments, there is no law covering vendors; they are receiving no money or scrip for now.
 
Hardships for Vendors
 Scattered news reports in recent days have told of hardships for vendors, like a meat company in the Yosemite area that cut back employees' weekly hours to 24 from 40, or a cold-storage company in Orange County that laid off 4 of its 25 workers and is considering taking out a high-interest loan to meet its payroll. These small-business owners are far from the Capitol and are unable, as the state workers would be, to clamor in the corridors or even go on strike.
It was the prospect of Bank of America's joining 20-odd smaller banks in refusing to accept the i.o.u.'s for state workers, as well as a poll late last month that showed approval ratings plummeting for both the Governor and the Legislature, that brought Mr. Wilson and the four legislative leaders back to the bargaining table on Friday for the first time in many weeks.
 
Some Tentative Agreements
 For a few days those negotiations looked promising, with tentative agreements struck among the leaders about how to reduce spending for higher education, health and welfare, and corrections.
But the heavy lifting remains. The sticky question of financing for public schools and community colleges has been put off, to be tackled only after everything else is settled. And on Tuesday the leaders confronted what is thought to be the second-highest hurdle to agreement: how to slash funds to already cash-poor counties, which by law are the providers of last resort of health and welfare benefits to the poor.
Governor Wilson, a Republican, wants to give counties authority to spend shrinking resources as they wish, even if it means eliminating required welfare payments to single, childless people. Many Democrats fear that lifting these mandates will mean that rural counties can, in effect, put the poor on buses to San Francisco or Los Angeles and leave the urban counties stuck with the bill.
Mr. Wilson talked tough about Democratic intransigence after Tuesday's bargaining session. "This is a zero sum game," Mr. Wilson said at a news conference. "I really don't think that has sunk in."
Meanwhile, rank-and-file lawmakers were grousing about a tortuous process that has already cost them their July vacations, tarnished their reputations with constituents and left them feeling like bit players in a drama that is being played out without them.
Last week there was a brief outcry for the leaders to step aside and let the foot soldiers take over the budget-writing process. A resolution was offered suggesting that the Governor be chained to the podium until a budget was passed. And the speeches that any member is permitted to make at the close of each session grew more numerous and more cranky each day.
"There is a very high level of frustration and disappointment, frankly, that the process isn't working," said Senator Marian Bergeson, a Republican from Newport Beach.
Assemblyman Robert Campbell, a Richmond Democrat, crossed party lines to agree. "There are so many other issues," he said, citing the continuing drought, the declining quality of elementary education and fee schedules at the state universities. "And we can't do anything else because we're spending all our energy on the budget."
There were also isolated examples of public unhappiness -- no groundswell, to be sure, but stirrings. A carpenter at work in the old Senator Hotel, now an office building, said he had heard on a radio talk program that the i.o.u.'s had already cost the state more than $2.6 million in interest, which he did not like one bit. A cafeteria worker in the elevator at the Capitol muttered unprintable epithets about the Governor.
And the Capitol bureau of The San Francisco Chronicle received a handful of phone calls from angry citizens, including one urging the newspaper to publish the phone numbers of lawmakers to make it easier to complain.
But, as with most crises, there were winners here as well as losers. The city-owned parking garage used by lawmakers and their staff members was bustling at a time when it is usually half empty. And business was brisk last month at Frank Fats restaurant, a Capitol institution famous for its banana cream pie and its high-powered clientele.
Prognosticators were busy, too. In the course of one day here earlier this week, David Roberti, the president pro tem of the State Senate, changed his prediction that the budget would be complete by Aug. 15, just before the Republican National Convention opens in Houston, and said that Sept. 1 was a safer bet.
And Sherry Bebitch Jeffee, a political analyst at the Claremont Graduate School, said she had been wandering the corridors of the Capitol and had "heard everything from Labor Day to Nov. 1."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Jabs at Rival's Morals, Saying Values Are Besieged

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: RENO, Aug. 5

 BODY:
President Bush today put religion and morality at the heart of his effort to undermine public trust in Gov. Bill Clinton, suggesting that the Democratic nominee lacks the moral fiber to be President.
Accompanied by John Cardinal O'Connor, Mr. Bush appeared before a wildly applauding, flag-waving crowd at a Knights of Columbus meeting in New York City to present himself as the nation's "moral compass" at a time when he said its "fundamental values" were under siege. 
 Making a two-day, cross-country campaign swing to New York, Nevada and Colorado, Mr. Bush displayed as much confidence and animation as he has shown in the weeks since his poll numbers plummeted after the Democratic National Convention.
Leaving New York, he eagerly clambered aboard a lime-green firetruck to ride back to Air Force One at John F. Kennedy Airport while his aides beamed their approval. "I think he looked a little more studly than Dukakis in the tank," said Torie Clarke, the campaign press secretary, in a reference to one of the 1988 Democratic nominee's most embarrassing campaign gaffes.
 
'Set the Record Straight'
 By the time Mr. Bush arrived in Reno to address a gathering of the Disabled American Veterans, he was talking about his Democratic rival with a directness unusual for a politician who usually refers to his opponents as "they."
"The Clinton-Gore ticket has two more weeks of leave and then after the convention we're going to go after them," Mr. Bush told supporters at the airport here, the first time he has referred to the Democrats by name in a public setting. "We're going to take it to the people. We're going to set the record straight."
Addressing the veterans, Mr. Bush suggested that Mr. Clinton was too untried in foreign affairs to be entrusted with the country's security. "The foreign playing field is so competitive that I'm not sure we should trust our team to a rookie quarterback," he said.
In New York, Mr. Bush staked out tough stands against abortion and for organized prayer in schools as he portrayed the Arkansas Governor as an opportunistic politician who would let 13-year-old girls obtain abortions without their parents' consent.
"Today I make the same appeal to you that I make to every voter," said Mr. Bush, who received two standing ovations from the Knights, a Catholic service organization, at the Marriott Marquis hotel on Times Square. "Look beneath the rhetoric. Take a look at the ideas to determine who has the courage to stand up for the changes that are morally right for America."
Using one of the homespun lines crafted for him by his new speech writer, Steven Provost, Mr. Bush offered a calculated sound bite that not only presented Mr. Clinton as less morally worthy but also echoed Republican charges that Mr. Clinton was "slick."
"If you're looking to restore America's moral fiber, why buy a synthetic when you can get real cotton?" the President said.
 
Strategy for Victory
 Mr. Bush's speech reflected the extent to which his strategists are calculating that to win in November the President must alarm voters about his Democratic opponent by painting Mr. Clinton as too liberal on issues like welfare, abortion and religion. This year, as in past campaigns, the Republicans are making a strong appeal for Catholic voters, an important bloc in the Northeast and the Midwest.
White House officials said early on that they would try to make morality and family values a centerpiece of the Presidential campaign because of Mr. Clinton's personal problems in the primary season.
On Monday, Mr. Bush was forced to repudiate an effort by his campaign to bring up the issue head-on, and the speech yesterday was clearly intended as a more sophisticated allusion to the reports about Mr. Clinton's private life. It also seemed intended to further Republican efforts to present Mr. Bush and his wife, Barbara, as more fitting and more traditional role models for the nation.
Appearing more relaxed and confident than he has in recent weeks, Mr. Bush also used the occasion to stake out a strong anti-abortion position two weeks before the Republican National Convention, at which the party's right wing will be trying to beat back efforts to moderate its platform plank on the issue.
Introduced to the crowd by Virgil Dechant, Supreme Knight of the organization, as a staunch anti-abortionist, Mr. Bush said, "Seven times I have ignored the polls and acted on what I believe is fundamental principle and vetoed, as Virgil very generously pointed out, abortion legislation."
Bringing the crowd to its feet, Mr. Bush added: "And I promise you again today, no matter the political price, and they tell me in this year it's enormous, I am going to do what is right. I am going to stand on my conscience and let my conscience be my guide when it comes to matters of life.
"In some places, a 13-year-old girl cannot get her ears pierced without parental permission, without bringing her mother and father along. But some believe that the same girl should be able to get an abortion without parental consent. And I think most Americans believe this idea is crazy, and I'm going to fight to see that it doesn't happen."
The President also continued to refine his efforts, which have proved unsuccessful thus far, to present himself as an agent of change even though he has been in public life for decades. "Sure, change is natural," he said. "But maybe a better word for the United States of America is renewal, because the change we need is based on principles that never change."
 
Stressing a Moral Tone
 But Mr. Bush's primary purpose yesterday seemed to be to chip away at public confidence in Mr. Clinton on moral grounds. "Some think it's O.K. to hand out condoms in schools, but oppose amending our Constitution to allow our kids to put their hands together in prayer," Mr. Bush said. "I disagree."
Calling the Presidency "more than managing the economy, more even than being Commander in Chief," Mr. Bush said, "I stake my claim to a simple belief: The President should try to set a moral tone for this nation. And all around us, we see evidence that America's moral compass has gone awry."

HEADLINE: Banks Cite Expense in Refusing State I.O.U.'s

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Bank of America was not the first bank in California to stop accepting the state government's i.o.u.'s, but because of its huge network of 1,435 branches, the decision by the largest bank in the state was a particularly inconvenient to state workers, creditors and local governments.
"To say that banks stopped accepting the i.o.u.'s to put pressure on the political process is an overstatement," said Greg Wilhelm, legislative director at the California State Bankers Association. He pointed out that the expense of handling the i.o.u.'s was a frequent complaint of banks and that some bankers had been stung by newspaper editorials claiming that continued acceptance of them was prolonging the problem. 
 Wells Fargo Bank, the second largest in the state, and Union Bank, the fourth largest, had previously said they would not accept i.o.u.'s dated after July 31.
Mr. Wilhelm said that "most elected officials were probably glad when the banks started to pull the plug."
"The banking industry's willingness to accept the warrants acted as a shock absorber in keeping the pressure off the Legislature to solve the budget problem," he said.
A spokeswoman for the Bank of America, Sharon Tucker, said the bank did not have any special arrangements to help customers who might fall behind in loan payments because they cannot cash the i.o.u.'s. "We tried to accommodate the vast majority of people by accepting the i.o.u.'s after the end of July, when most state workers are paid," she added.
Officials at Bank of America and Wells Fargo noted that accepting the i.o.u.'s, or registered warrants, created an additional expense that was not fully covered by the 5 percent interest rate the state is paying.
 
A Difficult Balance
 Finding the right balance between serving customers and accepting the extra cost of handling the i.o.u.'s has been difficult for many bankers in the state. William M. Ried, president of the Mechanics Bank in Richmond, said that early in the week he had decided to stop accepting the i.o.u.'s but that yesterday he changed his mind.
"I thought about our customers and decided that outweighed the extra costs or the possibility of fraud," Mr. Ried said.
As the state's paper becomes harder to convert into cash, financiers are beginning to look for alternatives to banks.
Gray Davis, the State Controller, said that "the jury is still out as to whether banks can make a little money" because of the interest payments.
To encourage banks to continue cashing the i.o.u.'s for their customers, Mr. Davis said his office is working to develop a secondary market where banks might sell the i.o.u.'s they do not want to hold. Because the 5 percent interest paid by the state is exempt from Federal and state tax and is two or three percentage points higher than other short-term securities, Mr. Davis hopes there are investors willing to accept the uncertain maturity of the notes.
The WesCap Federal Credit Union in Pomona is already providing a similar service for credit unions, by promising to buy i.o.u's that they have cashed for their customers but do not want to hold.
Los Angeles County is serving as a banker of sorts for other local governments that have received i.o.u.'s rather than cash from the state.
Maureen Oster, the development officer in the Los Angeles County Treasurer and Tax Collector's office, said the county's offer to buy state i.o.u.'s from other local governments has attracted more and more telephone calls in recent days. She warned that if other local governments do not find ways to cash the i.o.u.'s, "they might be forced to issue registered warrants themselves."

WPP Gets a Second Chance As Holders Clear Debt Plan

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
SHAREHOLDERS of WPP Group P.L.C. voted overwhelmingly yesterday at a special meeting in London to approve a plan that extensively restructures its crushing debt.
The approval, by holders of 99.7 percent of the shares voted, offers the agency holding company time to try to ride out the industry's seemingly endless recession. 
 Analysts in Britain and the United States, who have followed WPP's travails as avidly as soap-opera fans await the next installment of their favorite serial, welcomed the vote. They praised aspects of the agreement that the British financial press had characterized as a rescue plan, because it eliminated a well-publicized threat by a syndicate of 28 creditor banks to seize control of WPP and force it into receivership.
"Barring an Armageddon, we shouldn't be here again," David Forster, a media analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities, said in an interview from London. "I'm not saying they're out of the woods, but they have bought themselves a lot of breathing room. It's a major step in the right direction."
Under the restructuring, about $270 million of WPP's debt, which totaled $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion, will be forgiven, and the annual interest payments will be pared about 40 percent. In exchange, the banks, which gained voting control of WPP in November when the company failed to pay them dividends, will assume ownership of 52 percent of WPP, a stake that will be reduced after the issuance of additional shares to 47 to 48 percent.
WPP's debt had threatened to overwhelm the financially hard-pressed parent of advertising agencies like the J. Walter Thompson Company and Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide and public-relations firms like Hill & Knowlton.
"There won't be any more recourse to the bankers after this," said Lorna Tilbian, a media analyst at S. G. Warburg in London, noting that under the plan, WPP will not begin repaying its debt until 1997. "I think it's steady as she goes from now on."
Still, the analysts cautioned that like a soap-opera heroine who recovers from amnesia only to learn she has an evil twin sister, WPP remains faced with daunting challenges, not the least of which is the damage caused by the intensive coverage of its financial struggles.
"It was not helpful to us at all to have all those headlines about 'financially troubled WPP,' " Burt Manning, Thompson's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview as he prepared to return to New York from the meeting.
"As an operating entity," he added, "Thompson wasn't in question. During all this time, we've gotten new assignments, new billings and we've been profitable.
"But every time a story about the holding company appeared, it would create concern, which I guess is understandable."
Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, said he was pleased by the outcome of the vote, which seemed in doubt until Fidelity Investment Services, WPP's largest shareholder, reluctantly decided late on Friday to support the plan.
WPP's operating companies, he added, "have performed particularly well, given the circumstances they were operating under -- what has been going on in the industry and the particular uncertainty we faced.
"The removal of the uncertainty will enable our companies to be even more successful."
Analysts said the restructuring, which includes providing WPP with $150 million in working capital, seemed predicated on no early or significant upswing in the uncertain British and American ad economies.
"It was put together on a very conservative basis," said Mr. Forster of Kleinwort Benson, "with no assumption of a strong recovery."
In the next few days, concurrent with the restructuring, Gordon Stevens will replace the legendary adman David Ogilvy as WPP's chairman. Mr. Sorrell noted that as regional director of the North American operations of Unilever P.L.C., a giant WPP client, Mr. Stevens had worked with both Thompson and Ogilvy.
Mr. Ogilvy, 81 years old, will become WPP's president emeritus and a consultant. He came out of retirement to become WPP's chairman in 1989, to mollify those anxious about Mr. Sorrell's $865 million hostile takeover of Ogilvy.
It was that acquisition, two years after Thompson's, that pushed WPP to the brink.
"You've got to remember, they bought something they shouldn't have and paid too much for it," said Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst at Paine Webber in New York. As a result, he said, even after the restructuring, "there's still not a whole lot of room left for mistakes."
He added, "The situation isn't critical, but it ain't good."
One way to improve WPP's situation would be to sell assets. Analysts said that WPP was continuing to negotiate a possible sale of Scali, McCabe, Sloves in New York, which also has interests in agencies like Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis, to the Interpublic Group of Companies.
"They'd been getting silly offers" for assets, Ms. Tilbian of S. G. Warburg said. "Now that suitors see the company is on a safer footing, they might not try to take advantage of the situation."

HEADLINE: Suffolk Raises Sales Tax Half a Cent

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., Aug. 5

 BODY:
After a final round of flailing, the Suffolk County Legislature agreed today to raise the county sales tax by half a cent to 8.5 percent to close a budget deficit and avert a property-tax increase.
The new rate, which means Suffolk joins neighboring Nassau County in collecting the highest sales tax in the state and among the highest in the nation, will take effect on Sept. 1. It automatically expires on Dec. 31, 1993, unless county officials gain state permission for an extension. The higher rate will produce an estimated $12 million in revenue this year and about $50 million next year. 
 Last year, the county got state permission to increase the sales tax by half a penny. That increase also expires at the end of next year. County officials said that would mean $100 million to $120 million less in revenues for 1994.
Under an aid plan approved for the financially troubled county last month in Albany, half of the revenues from the new sales-tax increase will pay off a budget note the county plans to approve and sell by the fall to close a $36 million deficit in the county's $1.3-billion 1991 budget.
 
Avoids Rise in Property Taxes
 Without borrowing, the county would have been forced to raise property taxes in the 1993 budget to close the deficit.
"The sales tax reduces the amount of money you will need from property taxes," said the Legislature's Presiding Officer, Donald Blydenburgh of Smithtown. "That's what it comes down to."
The revenues will be divided between the county's general fund, where they can be used to close a projected deficit in the 1992 budget of $5 million to $10 million, and the police district that covers the county's five western towns, where the money will provide financing to hire 300 new police officers.
The 10-to-8 vote today gave the increased sales tax the minimum support needed to go into effect. The budget note also needs a minimum of 10 votes to pass.
In the debate preceding the vote, legislators opposed to the increase said that the county should consider deeper program cuts and laying off workers first. They clashed with colleagues who said that the county had done everything it could and that the economic problems were caused by higher expenses mandated by the state and Federal Governments. In the end, a combination of Democrats, Republicans and two Conservative legislators provided the narrow margin of victory.
The vote ended a difficult period for County Executive Robert J. Gaffney, a former State Assemblyman who found himself caught between the conflicting wishes of the State Legislature and the Governor's office on one hand and the County Legislature on the other.
 
One Plan Fails
 The plan Mr. Gaffney, a Republican, offered initially called for sellingup to $90 million in general obligation bonds, but support evaporated after Mr. Gaffney reduced his estimate of the total budget deficit last month to $42 million to $46 million.
Mr. Gaffney then settled on a plan with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and leaders of the State Legislature that would have allowed the county to sell general obligation bonds to close out the deficit for 1991 and also to cover whatever deficit occurred in 1992.
But in an unexpected turn, Republican members of the County Legislature rejected the plan and demanded a revision that substituted the budget note, which must be repaid within one year, for the six-year-general obligation bonds.
Mr. Gaffney told county officials that no changes were possible. But last month, when Governor Cuomo called a special session of the State Legislature for final votes on financial packages for Suffolk and Nassau, Mr. Gaffney raced to Albany to lobby frantically for the changes the county officials wanted.
In a final moment of embarrassment, Republican Assemblymen from Suffolk, Mr. Gaffney's colleagues when he served in the Assembly, declined to vote to authorize the sales tax increase, nearly derailing the plan's approval.
"At the time I felt they were abandoning ship," said Mr. Gaffney. "It was disappointing."
The Suffolk officials must now turn their attention to the 1993 budget, which Mr. Gaffney will announce in mid-September. Mr. Gaffney has warned of a potential $100 million "problem" that lies ahead.

HEADLINE: Negotiators Hope to Finish Free Trade Pact Today

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
American, Canadian and Mexican negotiators hope to complete a North American free trade agreement by late Thursday afternoon or Friday, people involved in the talks said today.
The negotiators finished the broad outlines of the planned agreement on Tuesday evening and labored over many of the remaining details today. 
 On Thursday at 5 P.M., President Bush is scheduled to return from a campaign swing in the West, the same people said, and could use the White House as a politically dramatic setting for the announcement of major accomplishment 10 days before the Republican convention.
But experienced trade hands cautioned that unexpected disputes could still crop up, either in the next two days or even after an accord is struck. Seemingly small details could suddenly turn into important stumbling blocks and push a final deal into next week or beyond.
Early this week, the talks were held up as much as a day by a heated dispute over whether Canada would be able to start shipping to the United States more square meters of clothing made from imported yarn or fabric. That issue is now largely resolved. But differences remain on arbitration panels for bilateral and trilateral commercial disputes and on trade in automobiles, energy, beer, glass and apparel.
American law requires that before the free-trade accord can be submitted to Congress, 40 industry groups must produce detailed evaluations of the pact. A member of one groups said today that the groups had been told that they were likely to receive a final copy of the agreement by Saturday so that they could produce their reports by Aug. 28.
The accord would then be submitted to Congress on Sept. 8, the day after Labor Day and the day that Congress returns from its August recess, the group member said and an American official confirmed.
An Administration official said that Aug. 28 was not a hard and fast deadline but that the groups had been asked to produce their reports as quickly as possible. Several groups whose industries were dealt with early in the negotiations have already prepared draft reports, the official said.
In another sign of an imminent deal, senior American trade officials will spend four hours on Thursday afternoon describing it to a group of chief executives, trade association presidents, and labor and environmental-group leaders.
As the negotiations at the Watergate Hotel dragged through their eighth consecutive day, including four days with Trade Ministers present, tempers were beginning to fray. "It's like the Energizer battery -- it keeps going and going," one tired participant complained of the talks.
Meanwhile, the International Trade Commission, an independent Federal agency that performs nonpartisan analyses of trade policies and rules on trade law cases, embarrassed the Administration today by announcing that the free trade pact would hurt American allies in the Caribbean.
By lowering Customs duties on imports of garments from Mexico, the free trade accord would shift international investment away from Caribbean nations' apparel industries and toward Mexico's, the commission said in a report issued this evening.
The report, which was commissioned by Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, gave new credence to criticisms that the accord will help Mexico at the expense of other poor countries. Economists have long criticized regional agreements that divert trade instead of creating new trade, because this distorts international markets.
The House is scheduled to vote Thursday on a resolution sponsored by Representatives Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader. The resolution calls for the free trade accord to protect jobs and the environment, and is so broadly worded that even the Administration supports it.
Public Citizen, a consumer and environmental group founded by Ralph Nader, distributed fake deeds to the Brooklyn Bridge on Capitol Hill today. "If you believe President Bush's promises on trade, jobs and the environment, he's got a bridge he'd like to sell you," an attached flier said.
All three negotiating teams are haunted by the problems that cropped up after top American and Canadian negotiators shook hands on the 1988 United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. Senior officials then left aside a variety of legal phrasing issues for their assistants to work out, only to discover that some of these technical issues had commercial implications that made them politically touchy.
The senior officials ended up holding another meeting two months later to sort out these differences.
The 1988 pact also failed to end trade disputes between the countries because of murky language concerning how to resolve disputes and what qualifies as a car made in North America. To minimize such quarrels in the future, all three countries are devising extraordinarily detailed provisions for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Even if the Trade Ministers strike a deal this week, their lawyers will continue to work on the legal language through the end of the month. The point of the extra negotiations is to uncover possible disputes over these issues now.

HEADLINE: More Buses and Trains Planned to Lure Riders

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

 BODY:
As part of a new strategy to turn around the falling ridership on New York City's public transportation system, the Transit Authority is planning to increase the number of subway trains on certain lines and start new bus service beginning in September.
The changes are the first concrete steps in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's initiative, proposed in June, to intensify customer service and improve the transit system's infrastructure. 
 The board of the transportation authority, the Transit Authority's parent agency, is expected to approve the changes at its meeting on Aug. 14. They would be phased in over a year and the hope is that the new strategy will build back ridership, which since 1989 has fallen by 9.6 percent for subways and by 6.8 percent for buses.
"We're committed to aggressively getting new ridership," said the Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman, Peter E. Stangl. "We're going to market it hard and see whether it works."
In April, the transportation authority proposed what it called its "Fare Deal" strategy. Instead of cutting service to narrow a projected budget shortfall of about $300 million by trimming expenses, the authority decided to concentrate on increasing ridership.
"It's an if-you-run-it-they-will-ride-it idea," explained Jared Lebow, a Transit Authority spokesman.
 
'A Complete Turnaround'
 The initiatives, which were announced yesterday by the Transit Authority president, Alan F. Kiepper, would cost $5 million to $6 million for the first year but could easily pay for themselves if they add 6 million fares a year to the 1.6 billion now recorded in the city's public transportation networks, Mr. Kiepper said. Most of the new riders are expected to be tourists and weekend riders and then as the economy improves, people commuting to work.
"What has happened is a complete turnaround," said Joseph Rappaport of the Straphangers Campaign. "It's like they had new brains implanted. For years they had their knife to the subway and bus service. It's incredible and it's fantastic."
Several of the initiatives will go into effect in September and although the M.T.A. board must vote on all changes in fares and new lines, Mr. Stangl stressed, he expected the proposal to pass this month without any problems.
But money to pay for the entire "Fare Deal" strategy awaits city, state and Federal approval. The Transit Authority faces a multimillion-dollar deficit in 1993, Mr. Lebow said.
 
Changes in Trains
 The Transit Authority's September changes focus on specific lines. There will be more and faster service on the N and R lines that connect Queens, Manhattan and Brooklyn, reducing travel time by 7 to 10 minutes. In addition, there will be 27 percent more weekend afternoon service on the Lexington Avenue No. 6 Line.
Beginning in October, there will be a 50 percent increase on the A and D trains on weekends as well as a new A Train Rockaway Park express service, improved platform signs, pocket schedules and better station announcements.
Two new bus lines have already been approved by the transportation authority board and will go into effect in September. The M60 will connect Harlem to La Guardia Airport and the S79 will link Staten Island to Brooklyn. In October, reduced rate bus-to-subway transfers at Jamaica Center in Queens and Stillwell Avenue in Brooklyn will take effect and on Staten Island there will be free express-to-local bus transfers and free transfers from local buses to Staten Island Rapid Transit trains. Beginning in January, there will be new limited bus-stop service on the B41, BX1, Q43 and M7 buses that will stop at one-third fewer places.

HEADLINE: Trenton Budget-Cut Layoffs to Total 2,700

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
New Jersey officials said today that they would lay off nearly 2,700 state workers beginning in October because of $1.1 billion in budget cuts voted by the Legislature.
The number of layoffs was more than twice what the Republicans, who control the Legislature, had predicted would be necessary but only half of what the administration had forecasted. 
 The work force reduction will be the biggest layoff in New Jersey history, said the State Personnel Director, Anthony J. Cimino. That cut and the elimination of 2,850 other jobs through attrition will reduce the state work force to 62,000, he said, 9,000 fewer people than the state employed in January 1990, when Gov. Jim Florio took office.
The cuts range across all 19 state departments but appeared to spare both the Governor's office and the Legislature's staff, at least for the time being.
 
'The Spirit of the Budget'
 Mr. Cimino said that the administration had attempted to abide by the Legislature's admonition to begin the layoffs with well-paid employees and so-called unclassified employees, those without a civil-service classification.
Although the State Attorney General, Robert J. Del Tufo, told department heads last month that they were not obligated to honor the Legislature's dictates about where cuts were to be made, Mr. Cimino said, "we honored the spirit of the budget language."
He said 1,051 of the layoffs affected management employees, of whom 631 have no civil-service classification. They could be laid off immediately, but Mr. Cimino said they would probably "be given at least two weeks' notice." Most of the layoffs will begin on Oct. 2, he said.
But it is by no means certain that those targeted for layoffs will lose their jobs. Any employee with a civil-service classification, including an unknown number of managers, can "bump" a less senior employee in the same or a lower classification. The second person can do the same, taking a third person's job.
The process is complicated and subject to restrictions -- an electrician, for example, could not take a nurse's job, and there is no bumping across departmental lines. The result can be chaotic.
During a round of about 900 layoffs last year, Mr. Cimino said the ratio of employees affected was 3 to 1. That is, for every person laid off three people changed jobs because of bumping.
The immediate response to today's announcement was relatively muted. Jan Pierce, vice president of the district office of the Communications Workers of America, which represents some 38,000 state employees, said the union would "dedicate all of its resources to working with the administation and other unions toward the goal of maintaining state services while minimizing layoffs."
But the Policemen's Benevolent Association, the union representing corrections officers, maintained that it was understaffed by 337 officers because of a hiring freeze and that the Corrections Department has been used as a "political pawn" in a battle between the Democratic Governor and the Republican Legislature.
 
9,000 Fewer Workers
 Local 195 of the New Jersey Public Employees Union, representing about 8,000 state workers, said it intends "to do everything possible to keep these recently announced layoffs from taking place." The union argued that despite the layoffs in middle management "the largest number slated for layoff are those in lower-salaried positions."
The state work force has been reduced by 9,000 people since 1990, despite a $2.8 billion tax increase Mr. Florio pushed through the Legislature that year. The Republicans pared that increase by $608 million two months ago by cutting the sales tax from 7 to 6 percent.
But even with the lion's share of the increase still in place, a stagnant economy and lower revenues made sharp cuts in state jobs and programs unavoidable.
"Twenty-seven hundred jobs is an enormous amount of pain for a penny," Mr. Cimino said today, continuing the administration's criticism of the tax cut in the face of an already serious budget crisis.
The Republicans, who wrested all-but-total control of the Legislature from the Democrats largely on the strength of resentment over the 1990 tax increase, insisted on cutting the sales tax though Mr. Florio and the Democrats warned that it would mean laying off 6,000 to 7,000 state workers.
The Republicans, on the other hand, insisted that the savings could be accomplished while cutting only about 1,400 people, almost all of them middle managers earning more than $50,000 a year.

HEADLINE: William Maxwell McCord, 61, Author and Sociology Professor

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Dr. William Maxwell McCord, an author on social and urban issues and a sociology professor at City College of New York, died on Monday at Yale University Health Services Center in New Haven. He was 61 years old and lived in Guilford, Conn.
His family said yesterday that he had died of injuries sustained in a car crash in Guilford on July 9. 
 Dr. McCord, a native of St. Louis, was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Stanford University and earned a doctorate in social science at Harvard in 1955. That year he began his teaching career as a Harvard instructor in social psychology. He returned to Stanford to join the sociology department in 1958 and gained tenure at the age of 28.
He spent six years teaching at Rice University in Houston and Syracuse University before moving to City College in 1971. He served as sociology department chairman for 10 years, until 1983, and lectured widely overseas at universities from Dublin to Cairo to Singapore.
Dr. McCord was a co-author of books and monographs on delinquency and crime and later ranged over economic development, international politics and urban affairs. His credits grew to 17 books and nearly 100 articles.
Among his works were "The Springtime of Freedom: Evolution of Developing Societies" (Oxford University Press, 1965), "Mississippi: The Long, Hot Summer" (W. W. Norton, 1965), and, more recently, "Paths to Progress" (Norton, 1986), written with his wife, Arline McCord. Researching the Mississippi book, Dr. McCord joined the Freedom Riders in their drive against racial segregation.
In addition to his wife, the former Arline Fujii, Dr. McCord is survived by five sons, Geoffrey, of Durham, N.C., Robert, of Narberth, Pa., Maxwell, of White Plains, and William of Guilford; a daughter, Elinor Mary McCord, also of Guilford; a stepdaughter, Dr. Karen Sakuma of Seattle; two stepsons, Theodore Sakuma of Orangeburg, N.Y., and Michael Sakuma, of Stony Brook, L.I., and six grandchildren.

Treasury Plans $36 Billion Auction

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Treasury as expected announced yesterday that it would auction $36 billion of Treasury notes and bonds next week, including $10 billion of 30-year bonds. But this decision appeared to surprise some investors in the bond market, who were apparently looking for some unexpected twist.
The consensus forecast for the auction announcement was exactly what the Treasury announced: $15 billion of 3-year notes, $11 billion of 10-year notes and the $10 billion of 30-year bonds. But traders and analysts said there was speculation in the morning as the bond market rose that the size of the entire auction might be cut and that the 30-year bond auction would be reduced or even suspended. 
 The disappointment of far-fetched expectations can have some impact. Just before the announcement in Washington at 2:30 P.M., the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were up 7/8 point on the day in the secondary market for Treasury securities, to yield 7.39 percent, just a few basis points or hundreths of a percentage above its low for the year.
But immediately after the announcement, the price of the long bond began to fall. And it ended the day all but unchanged. In late trading it was offered at 106 27/32 , up 1/32 for the day to yield 7.42 percent, unchanged from Tuesday.
"I don't know what the bond people were smoking," said Jay Goldinger, a bond trader at Capital Insight in Los Angeles. "Bond investors got a lot higher on the market than they should have."
 
The Buying of the Long Bond
 Some traders said that the buying of the long bond could have been in part just to hedge in case there was a surprise announcement. This would help to explain why the 7/8-point gain unraveled so fast in the afternoon.
The price of Treasury notes also came off after the announcement. But by the end of the day they had rebounded a little. Traders said that investors who sold the 30-year Treasury bond moved into the shorter maturities -- ranging from 2-year to 10-year notes.
At the end of the day, the 30-year bond to be auctioned next week was trading in the pre-auction, or when-issued, market at a yield of 7.37 percent, five basis points below the current issue.
Lou Crandall, chief economist for R. H. Wrightsom & Associates, said investors were willing to pay a little more for the new bond because once it was issued it would trade with more liquidity than the old issue. But he said as an investor he would stick with the current issue. "If I found out that my pension money was in this one just because it was the new one, I would fire the manager," he said.
The new three-year note appeared to be in less demand. In the when-issued market the three-year note to be auctioned next week was at a yield of 4.83 percent, 14 basis points over the current three-year note. The current note was offered in late trading at 103 1/32 , up 1/8 to yield 4.69 percent, compared with 4.74 percent on Tuesday.
And the 10-year note to be aucitoned next week was trading at a yield of 6.62 percent in the when-issued market, just two basis points over the current 10-year note yield. In late trading the current 10-year note was offered at 106 12/32 , up 5/32 , to yield 6.60 percent compared with 6.62 percent on Tuesday.
The spread on the 10-year note is so close, Mr. Crandall said, because there is such strong demand for it that a real shortage has developed.
On other issues affecting the market, the Treasury said the nation's debt ceiling, which caps the level of Treasury borrowing, should be reached in the first quarter of next year. As it has in the past, the Treasury indicated that it would like Congress to approve a higher debt ceiling before it adjourns this year so a "crisis situation" can be avoided early next year.
Congress and the White House have avoided debt ceiling crises, complete with threats to or actual shutdowns of the Government, for almost two years because the debt ceiling, which is now $4.145 trillion, was raised much more than usual in November 1990.
The Treasury also said it was encouraging both Brazil and Argentina to buy the 30-year zero-coupon bonds they need in the secondary Treasury market. But the Treasury also said it might still sell some of these bonds directly to the two Governments. The two countries need the bonds to provide the guarantees on loan repayment that are at the heart of their recently negotiated debt reduction agreements with their commercial bankers.
The prospect of these two countries buying billions of dollars of 30-year bonds would provide a little support for the bond market and could even help the Treasury get a slightly better price in next week's auciton.
There was economic news that also gave the bond market some support yesterday before the Treasury announcement. This included the Federal Reserve's so-called beige book, which reports on economic activity around the country. In addition, there were comments from the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, that also indicated that the pace of economic growth was still sluggish. For bond traders this means that inflation ought to remain low and interest rates would not be rising, all good news for the bond market.
The beige book said that "economic activity has been uneven" in recent weeks with little strength anywhere. According to the Fed report, growth was especially disappointing in manufacturing and retail sales, with only a few parts of the country reporting any strength.
The report also noted that the recent reductions in interest rates had not had a significant impact on home sales, although a new round of mortgage refinancings is clearly under way.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts a Broad Gain Aided by Pound's Weakness

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against most currencies, helped in part by weakness in the British pound.
The British pound was weak in relation to the German mark and was not supported by the British central bank or the United States Federal Reserve, said Jack Adkins, a currency analyst with the Refco Group in Chicago. "That seemed to lead all the currencies lower and that benefited the dollar," Mr. Adkins said. 
 Trading among foreign currencies, known as cross trading, can have a spillover effect on the dollar.
Also factored into the mark's activity was the release yesterday of figures showing a continued rise in unemployment in Germany, Mr. Adkins said.
"It's indicative that the German economy is showing signs of slowing down because of extremely tight monetary policy," Mr. Adkins said, noting that the German central bank raised its discount rate last month. The discount is the interest central banks charge commercial banks.
Mr. Adkins said the market remained uncertain about the unemployment figures the United States will release tomorrow. "We are kind of on hold until we see that," he said.
The dollar traded at 127.50 yen in New York, up from Tuesday's late bid of 127.25. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 127.30 Japanese yen from 127.28 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 127.35 yen.
The British pound fell in New York to $1.9075, off from $1.9195 late Tuesday. In London, the British pound fell to $1.9135, from $1.9230 late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.4815 German marks, up from 1.4770; 1.3300 Swiss francs, up from 1.3245; 5.0050 French francs, up from 4.9900; 1,120.00 Italian lire, up from 1,116.00, and 1.18375 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18485.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday, were: 1.4775 German marks, up from 1.4745; 1.3240 Swiss francs, up from 1.3205; 4.9889 French francs, up from 4.9815; 1.6655 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6625; 1,116.75 Italian lire, up from 1,114.50, and 1.1827 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1851.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Mixed Yields Are Shown For Money Market Funds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by money market funds were mixed in the latest week, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. Analysts said the yield situation appeared to be stabilizing as the funds caught up to the Federal Reserve's lowering of short-term interest rates a month ago.
Walter S. Frank, IBC/Donoghue's chief economist, does not think the Fed is likely to take further action, unless the unemployment numbers released tomorrow compel it to do so. Otherwise, he said, the monetary officials will hold the line until next month. "The Fed doesn't like to take action so close to its quarterly refunding," Mr. Frank said.
 
Varied Directions
 Yields on tax-exempt money funds posted their first gains in weeks, as investors moved toward the longer end of the market and locked into higher-yielding longer-term securities. Among taxable money market funds, yields were down, but the speed of the decline eased. 
 Both the seven-day compounded and the simple average yield for tax-exempt funds showed gains of 2 basis points, to 2.22 percent and 2.20 percent, respectively. In the last 30 days, the average compounded and simple yields are both down 3 basis points, to 2.18 percent and 2.16 percent, respectively. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
IBC/Donoghue's said assets of tax-exempt money funds showed a slow leak as $620 million was withdrawn, leaving total assets at $94.7 billion. Much of the money was taken out by investors looking for higher yields in longer-term municipal bonds, it said.
The average number of days left to maturity of the securities in tax-exempt portfolios rose by a day, to 64. This is quite long, analysts say, and indicates portfolio managers are not fearful that interest rates will suddenly go back up.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-free yield is 3.08 percent, up 11 basis points in the last two weeks, while the equivalent for those investors in the 31 percent tax bracket is 3.21 percent, up 19 basis points in two weeks.
In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, Donoghue's said the Strong Municipal Money Market fund, distributed by Strong/Corneliuson in Milwaukee, gave the best return for the sixth straight week, at 2.99 percent.
Yields on taxable money market funds fell, as assets declined by $6.3 billion, to a total of $496.9 billion. Of that, institutional assets fell $4 billion, to $177.4 billion, with retail funds accounting for the rest of the drop, with assets off $2.3 billion, to $319.5 billion.
The average seven-day compounded yield for taxable money market funds was 3.15 percent, down 4 basis points, while the simple yield fell 3 basis points, to 3.11 percent. Over a 30-day period, the compounded and simple average yields were both down 7 basis points, to 3.23 percent and 3.18 percent, respectively.
 
Extending Maturities
 Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in portfolios rose two days, to 64 days, as managers extended maturities in search of higher yields.
The Standby Reserve Fund, distributed by Cowen & Company in New York, had the best return among general purpose funds, with a yield of 3.98 percent. Over all, funds holding government debt outperformed others: United Service Government Securities Savings, distributed by United Services in El Paso, showed a return of 4.37 percent. The fund's management does, however, absorb some costs, enhancing the yield.
For bank money market accounts, which are the prime competitor of money funds, the average yield was 3.07 percent.

Gold Below $350 an Ounce, But Some Remain Bullish

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold prices dipped below the psychologically important $350-an-ounce level yesterday. Some analysts, however, said the downturn might be just a blip in a long-term rally.
Gold for August delivery fell $3.50, to $349.20 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. It was the lowest daily settlement since July 14 and a significant setback for the market, which had climbed from less than $340 in mid-May to more than $360 by late July. 
 Silver for September delivery rose 1 cent, to $3.892 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange; October platinum sank $1.40, to $376.30 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The selloff of gold futures was led by commodity funds, said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals analyst with Prudential Securities.
Gold fell $4.80 an ounce on Monday in reaction to the relatively quiet start of a two-day strike by black workers in South Africa, a leading gold producer. But yesterday's decline was prompted more by technical factors like the market's failure to hold above $360, analysts said.
Still, Ms. Raptopoulos said the fundamental factors behind gold's recent rally -- low interest rates, a weak dollar, falling stock prices and political uncertainty in the United States and elsewhere -- remained in place.
Dinza Mehta, chief bullion dealer with the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, said that prices might have risen too high, too fast, and that this week's downturn was a temporary pause. He predicted gold would again approach or exceed $360.
"Why the market should put on such a severe selloff is a tiny bit puzzling," he said.
Oil prices fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the International Energy Agency reported that five OPEC nations had raised their production last month to push the organization more than a half-million barrels a day over its self-imposed output ceiling.
Prices were also under pressure as a result of an American Petroleum Institute report on Tuesday that showed United States crude oil stocks rose by 6.3 million barrels last week, a greater increase than traders had expected.
Light sweet crude oil for September delivery fell 17 cents, to $21.18 a barrel; September heating oil dropped 0.44 cent, to 58.63 cents a gallon; September unleaded gasoline fell 0.73 cent, to 58.95 cents a gallon; September natural gas slipped 1 cent, to $1.851 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Trade-Pact Fears Seem Overstated

BYLINE: By Sylvia Nasar

 BODY:
NOW that a North American Free Trade Agreement looks imminent, some Democrats are worried that it will make America's working poor even poorer. The most dire predictions, from the liberal Economic Policy Institute, are that low-wage Mexican workers will steal $1,000 from the paychecks of most American workers each year and rob them of half a million jobs.
Though legitimate, such fears -- which the Canadians also share -- seem overstated. A comprehensive review by the middle-of-the-road Brookings Institution recently found that all but one of 15 studies of the effect of freer trade with Mexico and Canada concluded that pay would get a small increase. The single exception, and the one cited by the Economic Policy Institute, fails to take into account the pay-raising effects of greater competitiveness and bigger market size. 
 Real-world evidence should do even more to soothe anxiety. Trade with Mexico has mushroomed in the last few years but American jobs have been gained, not lost, as a result: 175,000 jobs since 1989, many in manufacturing, by the reckoning of Gary Hufbauer at the Institute for International Economics. That's more, incidentally, than the headline-grabbing job cuts at General Motors, I.B.M. and McDonnell Douglas combined.
The fact is that Mexico, growing again and hungry to modernize, is on the verge of becoming America's second-biggest foreign market. It is expected to replace Japan as the No. 2 export market. Canada will remain the biggest buyer of American products. As Mexicans buy American trucks, computers and other goods, trade with that country has swung from a $2 billion deficit for the United States in 1989 to an estimated $7 billion surplus in 1992.
Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy Institute, argues that American workers are in for a rude awakening when the agreement throws open borders to cheap imports. Then, the young, the less educated and males -- the people whose paychecks have been taking a beating in the recession and for the last decade -- will be forced to compete directly with Mexican factory hands, who earn half as much an hour ($2.17 to be exact) as the worst-paid American.
Some workers will inevitably be hurt, everyone agrees. But others will be helped. And the overall effect will probably be positive, but even the negative effects will almost certainly be modest.
First, most of the working poor are employed by service companies, from fast-food restaurants to hospitals to gas stations, and do not compete directly with foreign workers. Secondly,
United States trade barriers vis-a-vis Mexico and other poor countries are already low. Tariffs on Mexican goods average just 4 percent. Lowering them further cannot conceivably make a sharp difference.
"You're removing a small amount of protection against a small country," said Gene Grossman, an economist at Princeton University. "Americans won't even notice Nafta."
On the other hand, the agreement is likely to have a positive effect on American exports from cars to computers. Mexico does two-thirds of its overseas shopping in the United States. And Mexican tariffs, though sharply lower than a few years ago, are still hovering around 10 percent. Mexico also has strict auto quotas.
Mexico's recent appetite for American capital goods is not likely to fade anytime soon. As Mexico struggles to join the world's newly indsutrialized countries over a decade or two, that nation is likely to keep running trade deficit -- just like the United States before World War I, Japan in the 1950's and Korea in the 1970's.
The most plausible anxiety concerns investment, not trade. The worry is that the agreement will divert investment and jobs from the United States to Mexico as American manufacturers are drawn to magnet of low Mexican wages.
A look at a few basic facts shows that such fears appear to be exaggerated. People forget that Mexico's economy is one-twentieth the size of America's. Even if the United States contributed every penny of foreign direct investment Mexico could absorb, the amount would be only a minute fraction of all the money Americans invest. Mexico now receives a total of $3 billion in investment from all foreign sources, compared with $725 billion that Americans invested at home last year.
"If Mexico's total investment were to go up by 10 percentage points of the Mexican G.D.P., or $30 billion, and it all came from the U.S., our domestic investment would go down by two-tenths of a percent of United States G.D.P.," said Rudiger Dornbusch an economist at M.I.T.
"They would be an instant Korea and we would have a rounding error."
In any case, virtually everyone agrees, much of the new direct investment in Mexico will substitute for American investment now flowing to places like Taiwan, Indonesia and Ireland.
Again, take a look at what's actually happening. To increase its competitiveness, Japan has been exporting labor-intensive manufacturing operations to low-wage Malaysia and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim throughout the 1980's. Germany has been setting up shops and factories in Czechoslovakia, Portugal and southern Italy. Yet, neither of these models of enlightenment has seen the pay of its low-wage workers collapse.
Closer economic ties between the United States and Mexico will help make both economies more competitive without having much effect, one way or the other, on the living standards of America's poorest workers. Rising pay in Mexico should ease immigration pressures, as they are already. And the benefits of investing in Mexico -- as opposed to Czechoslovakia or Malaysia -- is that Mexico is more likely to buy American exports.
Thus, the notion that a more isolated nation -- as opposed to one with productivity-enhancing training, tax cuts or renewed economic growth -- will materially help those American workers who are falling behind seems wrongheaded to say the least.

HEADLINE: Fed Downgrades the Nation's Business Prospects

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve today downgraded its assessment of business prospects around the country, with the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, conceding that the economic recovery is "quite minimal."
In its latest nationwide survey of the economy, the Fed declared that "economic activity has been uneven" in recent weeks with some pockets of strength but many more areas where activity is stagnant or declining. 
 The new Fed survey of its 12 regional banks was in stark contrast to a review just seven weeks ago that had sounded the most optimistic assessment of the economy's prospects since the recession began in July 1990.
 
'Significant Pressures' Noted
 But since that report was issued, the national unemployment rate has shot up to an eight-year high of 7.8 percent and several statistics have flashed warning signals that this year's rebound could be in danger of stalling out, just as a similar recovery did in 1991.
Testifying before Congress today, Mr. Greenspan insisted that the economy was still advancing, but said that "there are definitely very significant pressures which are holding the economy back."
He added, however, that this year's weakness is not as severe as last year's, when the recovery faltered.
"I do wish to make the distinction between an economy that is going down, or an economy that is completely stagnant," Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee. "The economy is scarcely moving in a way which we consider adequate, but it is moving forward."
The Fed report, known as the "beige book" for the color of its cover, will be used as the basis of discussion when Fed policy makers meet on Aug. 18 to review interest rate strategies.
The Fed last cut rates on July 2 and many economists believe that a further reduction is in the offing if economic signals do not show signs of strengthening. A key report will be unemployment for July, which will be released on Friday. Many economists believe it will show only a slight dip in the unemployment rate, perhaps down to 7.7 percent.
 
Mortgage Refinancings Spurred
 The central bank has already cut rates 23 times in the last three years, which has driven mortgage rates to their lowest level in nearly two decades.
But the Fed survey said that so far the latest rate reductions have had little impact on home sales although they had spurred another round of mortgage refinancings.
In a separate report today, the National Association of Realtors said that housing sales and prices remained under significant downward pressure in many parts of the country with 21 cities reporting price drops in the spring and 16 states reporting falling sales.
Where the Fed's June report on the economy had found manufacturing showing strength throughout the country, the new report said that growth in factory output varied widely from region to region and from industry to industry.
The Fed's regional banks in Cleveland and Chicago said that manufacturing continued to lead the economic recovery in their regions. But Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond and St. Louis all said that manufacturing employment had failed to show any significant increases in their region.
 
Cutbacks Weaken Economy
 San Francisco complained of continued weakness because of cutbacks in defense and aerospace industries.
Minneapolis and Atlanta complained of depressed sales of big-ticket appliances while auto sales were weak in most districts, with the exception of Atlanta and Dallas.
Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, Mo., and Dallas said that lower interest rates were failing to spur home buying, with real estate agents in some parts of the country reporting that worries about job losses were holding down sales.
The Fed said that the farm economy was somewhat better. The Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City districts all said that recent rains had brought relief to drought-stressed crops.

HEADLINE: G.M. Subsidiaries Report Mixed Results for 2d Period

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 5

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation's three nonautomotive subsidiaries posted mixed second-quarter financial results today. But their cumulative performance was sharply lower than last year's because of a $749.4 million restructuring charge reported six weeks ago by G.M.'s Hughes Aircraft unit.
G.M. will report overall second-quarter results Thursday. Analysts expect Hughes's one-time write-off to leave the auto maker with a loss of several hundred million dollars in the quarter. 
 Following are the details of the subsidiaries' results:
 
Hughes
 Including the charge, G.M.'s Hughes Electronics subsidiary posted a second-quarter net loss of $615.7 million, compared with earnings of $83.4 million in the period a year earlier. Revenue edged up 2.6 percent, to $2.97 billion from $2.89 billion.
Hughes will use the charge to pay for severance and related expenses in connection with laying off about 9,000, or 15 percent, of Hughes's workers; to discontinue business lines, and to consolidate facilities. G.M. said the Hughes write-off would enable the company to reduce costs by about $700 million annually.
G.M.'s class H stock, which represents a right to receive dividends based on Hughes's earnings, closed today at $25.625, up $1.125 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
G.M.A.C.
 The General Motors Acceptance Corporation earned $286.9 million in the second quarter, 1.2 percent more than the $283.6 million of the period a year earlier. G.M.A.C.'s earning assets eased to $94.7 billion on June 30, from $98.4 billion a year earlier.
Robert T. O'Connell, G.M.A.C. chairman, said lower earnings from financing and mortgage operations reflected lower earning-asset levels and lower interest rates, partly offset by lower borrowing costs and better loss trends. G.M.A.C.'s insurance lines generated $45.5 million in profits, up $17.8 million from last year.
 
E.D.S.
 The Electronic Data Systems Corporation subsidiary posted a 12 percent increase in second-quarter net income, to $157.1 million from $139.8 million. Revenue rose 20 percent, to $2.02 billion from $1.68 billion. On a per-share basis, earnings on G.M. class E stock were 33 cents, compared with 29 cents a year ago. G.M. class E represents a right to receive dividends based on E.D.S.'s earnings. It closed today at $28.125, up 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
E.D.S. said the highlight of its second quarter was the signing of a 10-year contract to provide systems-management services to Smith's Food and Drug Centers Inc. in Salt Lake City. E.D.S. declined to disclose the contract's value.
Despite the gains of the class E and class H shares, General Motors common slid $1.125 today, to $39.125.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Fujitsu Expects Its First Deficit Ever

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 5

 BODY:
In another sign of Japan's deepening economic slump, Fujitsu Ltd., the nation's largest computer company, said today that it would lose money for the first time in its history in first half of this fiscal year.
Company officials and analysts say the loss, expected to be about $80 million, stems from severe pricing pressures in the semiconductor business and sluggishness in the computer business. In addition, analysts say, Fujitsu, which is heavily dependent on large mainframe computers, is facing some of the same pressures as its archrival, the International Business Machines Corporation, which has gone through wrenching pain as computers have become smaller and less expensive. 
 Such problems, which are also hurting other companies, are forcing Japan's once-vaunted high-technology companies to cut investments in product development and factories and in some cases to drop businesses that are no longer profitable.
 
Prospects Do Not Look Good
 "The prospects for recovery are receding," said Peter G. Wolff, vice president for Asian electronics research at Kidder, Peabody & Company in Tokyo. "Probably there are others on the way" to losses, he added.
Indeed, the NEC Corporation, one of Japan's largest semiconductor and computer companies, had a consolidated net loss of 3.4 billion yen in the second half of its last fiscal year, ending in March, because of write-offs. And the Sony Corporation had a loss in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year.
A spokesman for Fujitsu said the company expected to lose about 10 billion yen in the sixth-month period ending in September. That loss, equivalent to roughly $80 million, contrasts with a profit of 10.4 billion yen in the corresponding period a year earlier. Revenues are expected to be about 1.7 trillion yen, or about $13.4 billion, up slightly from 1.6 trillion yen a year earlier.
The loss will be on a consolidated basis, meaning it includes the results of Fujitsu's subsidiaries here and abroad. The parent company alone is still expected to eke out a tiny profit, a company spokesman said, and the company still expects a profit for the entire year on a consolidated basis.
 
Problems at Overseas Units
 Consolidated results are worse than parent company results because of problems in some foreign subsidiaries, including a British semiconductor factory that is still in the start-up phase, the spokesman said.
Fujitsu has been taking steps to try to improve its results, although Mr. Wolff of Kidder, Peabody said he thought that further measures would be needed.
This week, Fujitsu said it was closing a 260-employee semiconductor assembly plant in San Diego, shifting the work to Malaysia. Earlier this year, the company pulled out of the fax machine business in the United States.
Fujitsu has had big problems in its semiconductor business in large measure because of low prices for dynamic random access memories, the main chip it makes. To cut its costs and enter new markets, Fujitsu agreed last month to team up with Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a Silicon Valley semiconductor company, to build a plant to manufacture a new type of memory chip.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Hanoi Is Blocking Progress on Missing

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
The Pentagon said today that Hanoi had begun to put new obstacles in the way of resolving more quickly the cases of American servicemen still unaccounted for from the Vietnam War.
The two countries had just begun to make significant progress on the issue, which is blocking the normalization of relations and the lifting of an American economic embargo. Joint American-Vietnamese teams have been excavating crash sites and conducting interviews in wide areas of Vietnam. 
 "The train is fast coming to a halt," Col. John Cole, chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency's office in Bangkok, told the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs near the end of two days of testimony on the most emotional aspect of the issue, the reports of live sightings. "The Vietnamese are beginning to change the rules."
The Pentagon says it has 110 unresolved, first-hand reports from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos of sightings of Americans covering nearly 19 years since United States forces were withdrawn from Indochina and Hanoi said all prisoners had been returned. The Defense Department lists 2,266 Americans still unaccounted for in Indochina, although half of them are assumed to have died.
Colonel Cole told the committee that in a meeting a week ago, Hanoi demanded full files from the United States on reports by people who claim to have seen Americans, including information on sources. Vietnam would then decide which cases to investigate.
Senior Defense Intelligence Agency officials testifying before the committee said the United States would not jeopardize sources by complying with the request. Vietnam has also denied that it ever offered free access to prisons in the search for Americans.
In testimony, officials acknowledged that they had not asked for access to a Vietnamese Defense Ministry compound in Hanoi that has been the source of persistent rumors and refugee accounts of an underground prison housing foreigners.
Today, a brief confrontation erupted between the committee and the defense intelligence officials, led by Robert Sheetz, chief of the Pentagon's Special Office for P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, when it was determined that nine photographs of the Hanoi site, known since French colonial days as the Citadel, had been reversed in printing -- the equivalent of viewing a slide backward in a projector -- before being turned over for exhibition in the hearing room, making sites difficult to identify.
The committee's vice chairman, Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican, challenged the intelligence agency to prove that it had not been confusing informers by showing them similarly reversed pictures of the Citadel site. Mr. Sheetz apologized and said there had been no intention to deceive.
 
Might Be Non-Americans
 Reports of sightings, the majority of them later proved to be false, have played a large part in creating accusations of Government conspiracies among groups lobbying for the prisoners of war and those missing in action. Defense intelligence officials reiterated today that they believed that most of the sightings are of Russians or Europeans or Cubans working in Indochina.
But committee members said that as long as Laos and Vietnam barred American teams from areas that have generated some of the more credible reports, the sense of cover-up would grow, despite stepped up efforts by the Defense Department to narrow the list of the missing considerably.
Senator John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the committee, asked today that officials and relatives of the missing consider the plight of Vietnam, where officials cannot be expected to open their most sensitive files and sites to the American military and where the bureaucracy can stall even the most well intended plan.
On the other hand, giving the Vietnamese more time and information on sites to be studied, Senator Kerry said, only increases the chances that lobby groups will find investigations unsatisfactory because they will believe prisoners were quickly moved by Hanoi.

HEADLINE: House Democrats Agree to a Vote on Russian Aid

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
House Democratic leaders agreed today to bring President Bush's plan for aid to Russia and other former Soviet republics to a vote Thursday or Friday after the Administration agreed to consider their appeals for more domestic spending on housing and transportation.
The legislation, whose centerpiece is a $12 billion increase in the United States commitment to the International Monetary Fund, was passed in the Senate in June. Despite a range of opposition over everything from Soviet troops in the Baltic to Moscow's aid to Cuba to domestic issues, the bill is expected to pass in the House with majority support from Republicans and Democrats. 
 The Administartion has said that replenishing global lender's funds was necessary so the agency could help Russia and other former Soviet states. Today the fund approved a $1.04 billion loan to Russia.
Urging the House Rules Committee to clear the bill for floor action today, Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, the second-ranking Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said it was essential to pass it quickly. He called it "by far the most important foreign policy vote that most members will cast in their careers in the Congress."
He said passage could not guarantee the success of reforms sought by President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, but it could provide critical help. "Time really is of the essence here," he said. "Yeltsin is on the bubble. He really is on the precipice."
Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, Republican of New York, told supporters that he would like to support Mr. Bush, but that he was troubled because he felt his unemployed constituents would oppose helping a former enemy when the Federal Government lacked the money to help them.
Mr. Hamilton said, "This is an issue where leadership can persuade."
He said lawmakers should explain to the voters that without stability in Russia and the other former Soviet republics, defense expenditures would be higher, and that with stability, trade and jobs could increase.
Representative Dante B. Fascell of Florida, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the cost of the bill "is not even a blip on the screen" when compared to United States expenditures over the duration of the cold war.
While Republicans insist that a solid majority of their 166 House members will vote for the bill, Democrats have not taken a final count, and collecting all their votes could put a vote off until Friday.
One part of that effort will be to persuade members to vote for the bill without their favored amendments. The other will be to persuade Democrats that the Bush Administration is moving to meet their concerns about domestic needs.
Today Representatives Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, and David E. Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip, said they were finally prepared to back the bill because Richard A. Darman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, agreed today to give serious consideration to two domestic demands.
One would provide an expansion of federal loan guarantees for housing and another would provide money to speed up higwhay construction.
Mr. Gephardt said it was "not a conclusive meeting." "I felt we made some progress toward solving a set of employment problems," he said. "We're not asking for a great deal. We've asked for attention."
But both the Democratic leaders said that if no agreement was forthcoming, they would oppose final passage of the bill when it returned from a House-Senate conference after Labor Day.
Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican, criticized the Democrats for having a constantly changing set of domestic demands. But he said it was important to move on the bill now. He said that after the Congress-bashing expected at the Republican National Convention, which begins in 11 days, it would be hard to get bipartisan agreement on such a difficult bill in September.

TV Images of Bosnia Ignite Passions and Politics

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Once again, Washington finds itself under siege by television news.
After the Persian Gulf war, pictures of battered Kurdish refugees forced the Administration to provide them with a semblance of protection. Now the pressure is on to put an end to the grim scenes from what used to be Yugoslavia: 
 Two small corpses (one a Serbian infant, an ethnic-cleansing bullet having evidently gone astray) after an attack on a busload of children trying to escape the killing ground; mourners scattered by mortar fire at the funeral for the two children, a mother running from her 32-month-old daughter's grave, a grandmother injured; civilians dashing across dangerous streets to do their daily chores, like people seeking sanity in a madhouse; cities destroyed and families who have left everything behind coming up against closed borders.
There have been no pictures yet of what some have charged are detention centers for former Yugoslavs of non-Serbian extraction, but news programs have made up for that by illustrating the reports with the still-painful photographs of prisoners found in Hitler's concentration camps.
The major networks rely on outside news services like Visnews for their pictures from Bosnia. Whatever the source, they are strong stuff. The message strikes like a mortar shell: Less than 50 years after the destruction of Nazism, the doctrine of racial purity is again on the rampage in Central Europe.
From Congress and from editorial and op-ed columns come reminders of the failure of democracies to act in the 1930's. Already in difficulties over the economy, President Bush must now endure being likened by the sound bites of Democrats to Neville Chamberlain. Even given the scant acquaintance with history for which Americans are famed, can Mr. Bush, who is running wishfully as the model of a manly leader of the new world order, fail to respond with some muscular action to stop the slaughter?
Just what the United States can or should do about outbursts of violence around the globe, even where American interests are arguably at stake, is complicated enough. Mr. Bush's response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, after all, was initially opposed by most Senate Democrats and remains a matter of contention. The complications are compounded by the use of television. As the Pentagon was planning its assault on Iraq, the Administration was rallying public enthusiasm with accounts, eagerly picked up by news producers, of Iraqi atrocities. Now, in a less gung-ho mood, the White House finds itself afflicted by nightly evidence of worse atrocities in a country without oil.
Using television to whip up support for military adventures or merely for political one-upmanship is a highly problematic practice. Some much publicized atrocities turn out to have never occurred. And even, as in Bosnia, where the evidence of a genocidal cleansing is appallingly apparent, trying to satisfy public emotions with actions that are bound to have broad and unforeseeable consequences may not be the best way to run a government. It is not much of a way to run a Presidential campaign either, but the candidates seem to know no other way.
The tube is a single-minded, simple-minded weapon. Iraqi babies in hospitals arouse as much sympathy as Kurdish babies in camps. That is no doubt a tribute to American soft-heartedness but it is also a constraint on policy. If Washington, possibly in consort with its equally reluctant European allies, should carry the war to Serbian centers, television pictures of dead Serbian babies and grieving mothers will replace those of Muslim babies and mothers. And if American soldiers die, the cameras will focus on their families at home. The television audience is famously susceptible to all such sorrows, and cries for war may quickly turn into simple tears.
So television can be a force for compassion, whoever the victims, when it is not stirring up hate for the latest enemy. Either way, this medium, so much better at stirring up than calming down, at delivering the present than revisiting the past or envisioning the future, cannot be counted on to offer much guidance on whether or how to deter or punish an aggressor. Particularly in the frenzy of a Presidential campaign, you can't always tell whether a report is alerting the nation to an evil that must be fought or merely manipulating easily aroused feelings for parochial advantage. But with the evil rampant in Bosnia on display every night, can this country do nothing?
It is not for a television reviewer to issue an opinion on whether the United States should go to war against Serbia or any other malefactor. Yet I can testify that those pictures on the screen have had a powerful impact even on this professionally resistant viewer. Given all the necessary cautions about the uses of television in matters of life and death, can anyone help wishing that cameras had brought pictures of German concentration camps into American homes 50 years ago? Yes, the reporting from Bosnia may be misused, but it could also turn out to be a gallant episode in television journalism.

HEADLINE: For Times Square, A Reprieve and Hope Of a Livelier Day

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
Times Square Center, the cluster of blockbuster skyscrapers by Philip Johnson and John Burgee that would have been the centerpiece of the $2.5 billion Times Square redevelopment project, was the apotheosis of architecture as entertainment for the star-struck. The project's apparent collapse turns a symbolic page on an era when architecture became the all-too-willing servant of high-powered public relations. And it creates an opportunity to write a new and more buoyant chapter in the life of this troubled district. 
 The vast towers of Times Square Center, which once threatened to turn Broadway and 42d Street into an office canyon with looming walls of dreary post-modern pastiche, were the grotesque, paradoxical climax of what had once seemed a highly desirable end: not just fixing up Times Square, but also using one of the favorite preoccupations of the 1980's -- architecture -- to do it.
 
Jumbos and Whoppers
 The eminence of Mr. Burgee and Mr. Johnson was used to market the fiction that buildings of any size, in any place, could be nothing less than sheer genius when architects of stature were hired to style them. (So, too, with Kohn Pedersen Fox, the firm that designed the enormous merchandise mart that was to have filled two blockfronts at the project's west end, also now on indefinite hold.)
In fact, the architecture of Times Square Center was abysmal, a Victorian fantasy of mansard-roofed behemoths locked in a grim quadrille at the "Crossroads of the World." The architects refined it through the 1980's, then went back to the drawing board entirely in 1989, but the last version -- a stodgy imitation of the jazzy style pioneered by the Miami firm Arquitectonica -- only confirmed what an impoverished conception of architecture had been operating here all along. The "new" design by Mr. Burgee and Mr. Johnson simply applied a new veneer to the same set of jumbo parcels. Here was evidence, if more were needed, that for all its appeals to history and tradition, post-modernism was often no more than modern formalism in period dress.
But the chief fault did not lie with the architects, or with their developer, Park Tower Realty. It lay with the city and state agencies that supported them. The plan to redevelop Times Square and 42d Street had started out with a reasonable set of design guidelines. Instead of enforcing these regulations, however, state officials allowed the architects to toss them out the window, on the ground that only development of this scale could prevent Times Square from continuing its shabby decline.
This was an architectural variation on the Big Lie, a whopper whose outrageousness made it all the harder to deny. To oppose the project was to risk being branded antidevelopment, as if architecture would now be available only in two equally unappetizing varieties: new Super Jumbo Size and leftover Sleazy Fire Trap.
Actually, private development in Times Square boomed in the 1980's, with support from city zoning regulations but without any boost from the very project that was promoted as essential to the area's rebuilding. Indeed, almost the only undeveloped sites in the area today are the ones that were vacated and boarded up to make room for this project.
Architecture became famous in the 1980's, and who wanted to complain about that? Wasn't it a good thing that the public was covering its coffee tables with lavish books on Italian villas, flocking to exhibitions of architectural drawings, shuffling dutifully into lecture halls?
Surely architects saw little cause to complain. Many of them rode the wave of 80's affluence with surpassing aplomb, and their new celebrity status certainly seemed to bode well for the vitality of their art. Real estate developers were quick to get the message, and what was wrong with that? For years, the pressure had been on developers to care about something more than the bottom line. In the 80's, many of them met and even surpassed this expectation. But few had counted on the power of public relations to turn the public's interest in architecture into a license for laissez-faire.
Developers quickly learned the trick that snazzy design by star designers could help win support for dubious projects. When a well-known architect was hired to design a blockbuster development, criticizing it was nearly tantamount to attacking artistic freedom. Publicity agents mounted elaborate campaigns highlighting the "world class" design, the stylish covers of their press kits packed with fact sheets, design statements, glossy pictures, political testimonials and architects' biographies.
 
Beliefs of True Believers
 But what people opposed at Times Square was not development. It was loss of reason on the part of those who could present such projects and seriously expect to be applauded for them. Indeed, what makes this Times Square story so disturbing is that the powers behind it were not cynical. They gave every indication of sincere belief that their plan was wholly admirable. They were creating art, or something like it, so why complain that the buildings were too big? How can a city have too much art?
The paradox is that even in its current state of dilapidation Times Square has more to teach architects about art than nearly any other site in America. It remains rich in the kind of visual and cultural collisions few artists can pull off in style. A "Beverly Hills" polo player, four stories tall, prepares to strike his mallet against the top of a police station lodged in a trailer concealed behind warped plywood painted with classical columns. A Japanese whisky bottle lights up to wish Tony Bennett a happy birthday. Here is a public space defined by private enterprise, a permanent festival to celebrate Broadway's unruly rupture of Manhattan's straight arrow grid.
Looking should be the top priority for Times Square now. The place is in trouble, socially and economically, and the demise of Times Square Center is bound to provoke a new round of suggestions about how this historic place should be saved. But perhaps the most constructive approach would be simply to stop, look and listen to Times Square's own ideas about what it wants to be.
 
An Aspiring Id
 And what it mostly wants to be is a version of the Freudian id. It's the great maw of pleasure, desire and fear, opening itself wide for our entertainment like the hell's mouth in a medieval morality play. We'd feel cheated if we didn't see streams of exotic, devilish creatures come skipping out of those jaws in search of cheap thrills and tawdry glamour, and we'd be equally disappointed if we couldn't also depend on the morality brigade to come scampering right after, like the Save-a-Soul Mission in "Guys and Dolls," wielding nightsticks, Bibles and urgent referrals to social service agencies, prodding the little devils to clean up their acts.
Architecture does not fit naturally into this context, for the reality is that Times Square is truly more Damon Runyon than Philip Johnson. (Is it an accident that the biggest hit on Broadway in this year of the demise of the Times Square redevelopment project is "Guys and Dolls"?) Architects are more comfortable taking the superego role, the great Cleaner-Uppers, the traffic cops of urban space. Though zoning regulations adopted in 1986 call upon architects to emulate Times Square's dazzle, few of the new buildings manage to look lively. They leave it up to neon signs to inject the required pizazz. Take away the signs, and you're left with spectacles like 1585 Broadway, a square chaperone dressed in starchy gray, peering down sternly at the indecorous doings in the street below.
Only one of the new buildings walks a perfect line between the sober and the gaudy: Two Times Square, originally conceived as an office tower, and converted in mid-design into the Ramada Renaissance Hotel. Mayers & Schiff, the building's architects, helped devise the current Times Square zoning. Instead of pasting their signs onto the facade, they've turned the signs into the facade. They're attached directly to the building's structure, its concrete columns exposed through notches cut through the skin of dark gray brick and glass. This taut fusion of architectural rigor and Madison Avenue seduction is the most advanced piece of design to go up in Times Square since the TKTS booth was created (also by Mayers & Schiff) 19 years ago.
With the office towers of Times Square Center gone for now, if not for good, the focus has shifted to the plan for which the center was supposed to have provided financing: the restoration and programming of 42d Street's theaters. To succeed now, this plan will need the strongest possible support from the public and private sectors. It deserves that support overwhelmingly, not just because this tarnished boulevard is home to so many architectural gems, but also because the plan has its priorities in order. The play's the thing on Broadway -- and the movie, the dance troupe, the stand-up comic -- and the best thing architecture can do to stage its own revival is to remember who's the star.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
False Humanitarianism

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Let me be chillingly blunt about what Western officials told me regarding the Balkan crisis. They said that nothing they are doing or plan to do is at all likely to compel the Serbs to stop killing Bosnian Muslims.
And, as is becoming tragically clear, Western policy is merely to provide enough humanitarian relief for Bosnian Muslims to quiet Western public opinion -- and to do so without taking any military action that might suck Western forces into actually protecting the Muslims or their territory. 
 In other words, the idea is not to fight for Muslim survival, which Western officials believe to be beyond practical means. It is rather to feed them until they become refugees or get shot -- or until they realize, hopefully much sooner, that they must surrender.
Of course, Western leaders would prefer to see the Serbs wilt under U.N. economic sanctions and stop their "ethnic cleansing" of Muslims. But no Western official with whom I spoke expected this to happen for months, or years.
Thus Western leaders look to the Bosnian Muslims to recognize that their cause is hopeless, come to the bargaining table and accept defeat. To drive that point home, they are telling the Muslims to forget dreams of being rescued by Western cavalry.
Nor will President Bush, Prime Minister John Major of Britain or others allow themselves to be stampeded into sending rescue missions. That explains why the State Department backpedaled on the existence of Serbian detention centers where Bosnian Muslims reportedly face torture and execution. Mr. Bush and Mr. Major know well how atrocity stories stimulate their publics to throw caution to the wind. They also know that these enthusiasms quickly wane once troops sink into inconclusive battle.
Mr. Major seems ready to put additional diplomatic pressure on the Bosnian Muslims later this month at a peace conference in London. He, the other European Community leaders and U.N. officials will also lean on the Serbs. But the main British aim is to sell the idea of creating safe havens that would be transformed into ethnic cantons, each with considerable autonomy. The effect of such an approach would be to legitimize much of the Serbian conquests in Bosnia.
The Bush Administration seeks a much narrower focus for the London conference -- to strengthen humanitarian relief efforts. Administration officials want to expand these efforts beyond Sarajevo. This will require land convoys, which in turn will require protection. The Administration will support giving U.N. relief units some firepower for self-protection. It will also grudgingly consider providing the convoys with air cover, but neither London nor Paris is enthusiastic about that.
The effect of such an American focus on relief will be to preclude discussion of wider U.N. military action. And Washington is not alone in this stratagem. No U.N. Security Council member seems prepared to cross the line from humanitarian relief to combat. Russia even seems ready to veto proposals to do so.
Reluctance to cross the line makes sense when it comes to sending in ground troops. Serbian guerrillas would soon turn the situation into a quagmire, as they have in years past.
The caution also seems right when it comes to air strikes against Serbian gun emplacements on the Bosnian hills surrounding Sarajevo. These targets are not easy to hit, and the Serbs surely would retaliate against defenseless U.N. relief forces.
But doubts about force carry much less weight if the proposal is to bomb Serbian territory directly. The targets would be military factories, airfields, supply depots and the like. This action would threaten Serbia's one asset, its powerful armed forces. If the West puts that asset at risk, Serbian leaders might reconsider their ambitions.
The option to bomb Serbia is not a good one and holds little hope of success. But present Western policy -- feeding the Bosnian Muslims while prompting them to surrender -- is worse. It offers practically no chance of bringing Serbs to their senses, and doing so is central to restoring some equanimity to the Balkans.
Bowing silently to most of the Serbs' demands will only whet their appetite. In behalf of realism, Western policy punishes the principal victims. In the name of peace, it shames any sense of justice.

HEADLINE: Restored I.R.A.'s Make Fiscal Sense

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You say my proposal to restore and expand the individual retirement account is too expensive (editorial, July 28). I say we can't afford not to take this action.
Most Americans, including leading economists, think that a restored I.R.A. would give a healthy boost to savings in this country. When fully deductible I.R.A.'s were curtailed, contributions plummeted from $38 billion to $14 billion, and the country's savings rate dropped one-fourth, to the lowest level since the Depression. 
 My proposal would give taxpayers the option of claiming a deduction on up to $2,000 a year in I.R.A. deposits, or forgo the deduction up front and pay no taxes on withdrawals down the road -- the "backloaded" option.
Everyone with an I.R.A. or 401(k) plan could make withdrawals -- penalty free -- for a first home, college, medical bills or unemployment.
The restored, improved I.R.A. won't increase the Federal budget deficit. Other items in the Finance Committee package, like the phaseout of the personal exemption for those in the upper-income brackets, fully offset the cost. Your assertion that the "backloaded" option pushes the cost into the future ignores that those choosing the $2,000 deduction up front will pay taxes when they withdraw. Come tax time, this deduction will be what makes the I.R.A. attractive.
This proposal will help working Americans, expecially families. Sixty percent of two-income families in America are ineligible for fully deductible I.R.A.'s; next year half of all families won't be eligible.
Americans need the savings, the investment, the housing and jobs that the I.R.A. would create. It can make what few other economic actions can: a difference for the better in our lives.

Lawn Mower Is New Target In War Against Air Pollution

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
To most people, it is a lawn mower, but to the Environmental Protection Agency it is an "uncontrolled mobile source" that becomes part of the suburban swarm adding measurably to smog on a summer's day. And the time has come, the agency says, to clean it up, along with weed eaters, leaf blowers, chain saws and a lot of other off-road gas-powered machinery.
A lawn mower can easily spew as much smog-causing hydrocarbon into the air in an hour as a modern car, experts on pollution say, even though the car has 30 times as much horsepower. Chain saws are worse: the California Air Resources Board says a chain saw operated for two hours emits as many hydrocarbons as a new car driven 3,000 miles. 
 That is because modern cars have microprocessors that can precisely control an engine's mix of fuel and air; injectors to break the fuel into droplets of optimal size, and catalytic converters to catch anything that passes through the engine unburned.
Lawn mowers and other outdoor machines have none of these. In fact, they have all the pollution control equipment of a '57 Chevy -- without a muffler.
 
Electronic Yard Work
 Tomorrow, William K. Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and an organization of electric utilities plan to announce the start of a program to clean up America's lawn mowers. The effort on lawn mowers will be part of a plan that will eventually cover all kinds of engines, small and large, used off the highway. That would include construction equipment, farm tractors and even the service vehicles on airport aprons.
Nine utilities around the country will each give away 100 newly designed battery-powered mowers, taking their customers' old gasoline models in trade and asking them to test the new mowers in the field -- or, more precisely, on the lawn -- and report back on their performance. Meanwhile, the E.P.A. will haul the old mowers into its labs to study their emissions, in preparation for issuing new air-quality regulations similar to the rules now in place for cars and trucks.
In its new get-tough approach, the E.P.A. plans to make an example of the lawn mower. "We joke around and call it the last frontier for mobile sources," said Gay McGregor, an air-pollution specialist in the E.P.A.'s mobile-source laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich.
The lawn-mower-engine industry, after initial resistance, is acknowledging the mighty little machine's role in air pollution. At the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, formerly the Lawn Mower Institute, Dennis C. Dix, the executive director, conceded, "We certainly could do better." His industry, which never worried much about exhaust, is being forced by California to abide by new regulations that are to take effect in 1994 and 1999 and may be extended to other states as well.
Ann McClure, the executive vice president of the Professional Lawn Care Association of America, said: "There's an irony in this. Turf actually helps to cleanse the air, taking what emissions there are in the air, removing them, and replacing them with oxygen."
At Caterpillar Inc. in Peoria, Ill., a big maker of the type of agricultural and heavy construction equipment that is likely to be regulated soon, Rita L. Castle, said that the trend was "not unexpected." She added, "They've gone after most of the large emissions sources, and off-road vehicles certainly deserve a close look."
 
A Snow-Blower Exemption?
 At the Toro Company, Karl C. Kaukis, the director of marketing for the Lawn Boy line, said lawn mowers could be cleaned up, but consumers would find them more costly. He added that he hoped for "a common sense approach."
Specifically, he said that he hoped that the cleanup would not extend to snow blowers, of which Toro is a major producer.
"The utilization is so low, and the summer utilization is zero," he said.
Smog is a summer hazard, though carbon monoxide, which small engines also emit, is a particular problem in some cities in winter.
Nobody is certain how many lawn mowers are in use or what their emission levels are after a few years without being tuned up, but an E.P.A. study late last year suggested that in areas that are already in violation of smog rules, nearly 20 percent of volatile organic compounds and nearly 30 percent of nitrogen oxides come from "nonroad sources." Mixed with sunlight, those two chemicals make smog.
The population of "nonroad sources" varies now from place to place; in the metropolitan New York area, for example, outboard motors on pleasure boats are numerous, but in Colorado they are not.
Most manufacturers will try to lower emissions from gasoline engines by redesigning the combustion chambers, in many cases switching to overhead valves instead of side valves, a change made by the auto industry 40 years ago. They also plan to make engines that run on a leaner fuel-air mixture.
California has adopted rules to begin in 1994 for improvements that the state says can be achieved with existing technology, and stricter rules for 1999 that will require new approaches.
Meeting the 1999 standards may mean installing catalytic converters. That development would not delight the makers and users of gasoline-powered mowers, because the super-hot converters could set fire to grass clippings. It should pose "an interesting packaging problem," said Thomas Bingham, a product engineer at the American Honda Motor Company.
The dirtiest of the outdoor machines are those that burn a mixture of gasoline and lubricating oil and run on a rich fuel-air ratio, like chain saws and weed eaters. Producing such engines is easier for the manufacturer, and their lack of fuel economy is not a concern; it is the rare customer who asks if the chain saw gets six trees to the gallon or seven.
Moreover, chain saws, mowers and the like have always escaped notice because they are outnumbered by cars. But collectively these and other outdoor engines are a big source of pollutants. The California Air Resources Board estimated that in its state, the annual hydrocarbon emissions of such devices equaled the output of 3.5 million 1991-model cars, each driving 16,000 miles.
One reason for the lawn-mower problem is that cars must, by law, be maintained and periodically inspected for their emission levels, but lawn mowers, typically, need not.
"What is tuning?" said A. Joseph Vandenberg, director of technical services at the Edison Electric Institute, in a reaction that pollution-control officials fear is typical of lawn-mower owners. Mr. Vandenberg is helping to organize the swap program.
"I've got a spark plug I've left in it for 12 years," Mr. Vandenberg said. "As long as the thing cranks, you run it. If it doesn't, go out and buy a new one."
 
Cruising Range: a Quarter- Acre
 One result of the new focus on lawn mowers is that before the much-ballyhooed zero-pollution electric car makes it into the typical suburban garage, the rechargeable electric mower may arrive there first.
The new electric mowers being distributed in the test program, made by Black & Decker, will be able to mow about a quarter of an acre without recharging. A full charge takes 20 hours; an 80 percent charge 4 hours. The mower, which will sell for about $500, will use about 6 cents' worth of electricity per charge. Producing that electricity will result in some air pollution, but studies show that power plant smokestacks are cleaner than auto tailpipes, per unit of energy, and far, far cleaner than lawn mower exhaust. Disposing of dead batteries also poses a pollution problem, but, again, a lesser one.
This is not the debut of a new concept in mowing. Mr. Kaukis said Lawn Boy sold battery-powered mowers a decade ago, but found consumer interest very low. The company still sells plug-in mowers that require a heavy-duty, and very long, extension cord.
The electric mowers to be distributed to consumers for testing are being provided by Baltimore Gas and Electric, Boston Edison, Indianapolis Power and Light, the New England Electric System, New York State Electric and Gas, Oklahoma Gas and Electric, Potomac Electric Power, Southern California Edison and Tampa Electric.
The utitilies are still deciding how to choose who will receive the new mowers, though they will be seeking a representative cross section of old mowers. The consumers chosen for the test group will get to keep the electric mowers, in exchange for donating their gas-powered machines to science.
Switching to electric mowers would eliminate several other categories of pollution, advocates say. For example, the E.P.A. estimates that about 7.5 percent of the contribution to hydrocarbon emissions of lawn and garden equipment comes from spilling gasoline while refueling.
Mark P. Mills, an energy consultant, estimates that the United States has 18 million walk-behind lawn mowers, and that if all of them were converted to electricity, oil consumption would fall 2.2 million barrels a year. Consumption of coal and natural gas to run power plants would rise somewhat, but total energy use would still decline because the electric system is more efficient than a small internal-combustion engine, he said.
Converting all of this equipment is doubtful, however, since, for one thing, not all lawns are less than a quarter-acre, and not everyone will want to prolong the job of mowing the lawn by stopping to recharge the mower. Others, on the other hand, may seize the opportunity for such a respite.

GTE to Sell Lighting Operations for $1.1 Billion

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The GTE Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its worldwide lighting business, best known for its Sylvania light bulbs, to a subsidiary of Siemens A.G. and a group of investors for a total of $1.1 billion.
The price is below what analysts said the lighting business might fetch when a possible sale was announced last year. But the analysts added that the sale of other assets related to the subsidiary and income from overfunded pension assets were likely to add several hundred million dollars to the eventual proceeds. 
 "We definitely believe that this will be a break-even deal," a GTE spokesman, Harvey W. Greisman, said, referring to the subsidiary's book value of $1.4 billion.
 
Other Businesses to Sell
 For the most part, analysts said they approved of the deal, in which the two buyers would get separate parts of the lighting business. But they noted that GTE still had other businesses in its electrical products group that it wanted to sell and that the company appeared to have had difficulty finding buyers willing to offer a high price.
They said the sale of the lighting business underscored the determination of GTE to concentrate on its local-telephone and cellular-telephone businesses.
"As we said when we announced our intention to divest the electrical products business, our future growth, profitability and enhancement of shareholder value lie within the telecommunications industry," Charles R. Lee, GTE's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
Analysts said investors should be pleased by the sale, as well as yesterday's announcement that GTE would increase its quarterly dividend to 45.5 cents a share from 42.5 cents. The 7.1 percent dividend increase is likely to be the largest among the big local-telephone companies.
The announcement of the lighting business sale came two hours after the New York Stock Exchange had closed. GTE's shares closed unchanged yesterday at $34.75.
Linda B. Meltzer, a telecommunications analyst at UBS Securities Inc., said she was relieved by the announced sale of the lighting business, noting that more than 10 months had passed since GTE first said it was exploring either selling or spinning off the subsidiary.
And Marianne G. Bye, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said that since the company had expected to announce a transaction in June, the market was beginning to get nervous.
 
Buyers of the Lighting Business
 The buyers of different pieces of the lighting business are Osram G.m.b.H., the subsidiary of the huge German conglomerate Siemens, and a newly formed company owned by a consortium of international investors that GTE declined to identify.
Osram bought the largest piece of the lighting business: GTE's North American operations in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, with annual revenue of about $1.3 billion.
In a statement, Osram said that the acquisition would increase its sales by 70 percent, to about $3.1 billion, and that the addition of 13,000 GTE workers would raise its work force to 29,000. Sylvania's consumer business in light bulbs appears to complement Osram's main concentration: lighting products for industrial, theatrical and automotive markets.
The international investors, who are in the process of adopting the name of Sylvania Lighting International B.V. for their newly formed company, will acquire GTE's International Lighting business, with operations in Europe, eastern Asia, Latin America and Australia.
Osram and the investors group will be assuming a total of about $100 million in debt.
The North American and international lighting operations had annual revenues of about $2.3 billion and a book value of about $1.4 billion, Mr. Greisman said.
GTE did not say how much each of the buyers would pay for its share of the lighting business.
The sale is subject to approval by Government regulators, presumably including the United States Justice Department over antitrust concerns, and may be completed by December.
Still to be sold in GTE's electrical products group are the Valenite and Control Devices divisions, with a book value of about $200 million. Valenite is a maker of cutting tools and Control Devices makes circuit breakers and other gear for telecommunications equipment.
GTE is expected to receive close to book value for the Valenite and Control Devices businesses. It is also expected to get about $100 million from overfunded pension assets, as well as five months of income from the lighting businesses' discontinued operations, analysts said.
 
'I'm So Glad They Sold It'
 Ms. Meltzer of UBS said a spinoff of the lighting business would probably have brought in far less than book value. "I'm so glad they sold it instead of spun it off," she said.
Ms. Bye of Lehman Brothers said the price was "a little bit light, but it is only a partial sale and economic conditions around the world probably meant there weren't many buyers offering high prices."
GTE said that it had received more than 100 inquiries but that weak economic conditions in Europe and Japan depressed the bidding.

G.M. reported a second-quarter operating profit of $392 million, its most heartening in two years, reflecting strong car and truck sales.

British Petroleum said it would cut its dividend 55 percent, take a pretax restructuring charge of $1.82 billion and lay off 11,500 employees, or 10 percent of its worldwide work force.

The Economy
First-time claims for unemployment benefits soared to a 10-year high of 469,000 in late July, the Labor Department said. Analysts said the job market was actually stagnant. The jobless rise largely reflected a two-week plant shutdown by G.M. [D13.]

HEADLINE: Hoechst Net Rises by 6%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SOMERVILLE, N.J., Aug. 6

 BODY:
The Hoechst Celanese Corporation, a chemicals and fibers maker, said today that second-quarter net earnings increased by 6 percent on higher sales volumes.
Hoescht Celanese, which is a subsidiary of Hoescht A.G. of Germany, said net earnings of $50 million compared with profits of $47 million in the second quarter of last year. Second-quarter sales were $1.8 billion, up from $1.7 billion last year. 
 Prices were held flat during the three months that ended on June 30 by overall softness in several industries, said Ernest H. Drew, the president and chief executive.
"Although volumes for most of our businesses are stronger this year than last year, prices have been adversely affected, especially in the commodity chemicals business, as a result of the weak worldwide economy," Mr. Drew said.
The company said second-quarter earnings reflected an $11 million pretax charge for closing a technical filament operation in Canada.

Retail Chains Report Widely Varied Sales for July

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Retail sales in July varied widely from store chain to store chain, according to retailers' reports yesterday. While sales exceeded analysts' expectations in some cases and disappointed in others, they failed over all to give any clear indication of the long-awaited rebound in consumer spending.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. startled analysts with strong sales in a traditionally slow month, while sales at Sears, Roebuck & Company continued to slide. 
 Apparel retailers like the Gap Inc. and Ann Taylor, whose sales have faltered this year, reported slightly better sales in July, but the Limited Inc. again suffered from problems at its flagship division and its Lerner Stores.
 
Hesitant on Conclusions
 Wall Street analysts hesitated to draw conclusions about the health of the industry and the economy from the widely divergent numbers.
"I'm looking forward to the earnings releases later this month to give more of an indication of what the impact of these sales figures has been on the bottom line," said Janet J. Mangano, a retail analyst at Burnham Securities Inc. "With sales figures all over the board, it's hard to get a real sense of what's happening."
Retailers typically use July to clear spring and summer merchandise, so sales gains probably came at the expense of profit margins. According to the First Manhattan Company, an investment bank, about 6.8 percent of annual retail sales come in July, making it the third-smallest month of the year.
"Those retailers who have the right merchandise, as well as provide the value that the consumer is responding to, continue to gain share of market, regardless of what segment they're in or what customer they cater to," said Jeffrey M. Feiner, a retail analyst at Salomon Brothers.
The Salomon Brothers retail sales index, which tracks the sales of 15 leading retail chains, climbed 4.3 percent in July from a 3.8 percent increase in June. While the growth was not anything to get excited about, Mr. Feiner said, it seemed to indicate that the economy was improving, although very slowly.
 
Controlling Costs
 Analysts said retailers had kept the leash on expenses and inventory. Thus, while sales may continue to be lackluster, profits should show improvement.
The impact of promotions and clearance sales was apparent in the sales figures released yesterday. The Neiman Marcus Group, which operates Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Contempo Casuals, said sales in its stores open at least one year dropped 3.9 percent in the month that ended Aug. 1. Neiman Marcus staged its big First Call sale in June this year, but it was held in July last year, making comparisons difficult.
On the other hand, Mervyn's, a Dayton Hudson Corporation store chain, chalked up a 6 percent gain in stores open at least a year, even though the bulk of the chain's business is in economically decimated California. But Stephen E. Watson, president of Dayton Hudson, said the business was driven by promotions and clearances.
Analysts watch sales in stores open at least one year, called comparable, or same-store, sales, more closely than overall sales because new stores tend to have strong sales in their first months of operation.
Wal-Mart had a 13 percent gain in comparable store sales, but Sears's comparable sales dropped 2.2 percent in July. The Limited's comparable sales dropped 6 percent, while the Gap had a 7 percent increase and Ann Taylor's comparable sales rose 3.4 percent, and overall sales grew 13 percent, to $29.7 million.

HEADLINE: Confidence and the Car Market

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 6

 BODY:
At first glance, perhaps even second, the American auto industry seems to be emerging from two years of rough times and huge losses. Sales have been up, market share is on the rise, and second-quarter results produced black ink.
But rather than proclaim that they have turned the corner and face smooth sailing, industry executives and investors have turned exceedingly cautious, fearful of the nation's economic uncertainty and stumbling growth. 
 Indeed, even as strong earnings reports have come out -- from Chrysler and Ford last week and from General Motors today -- the stocks of the Big Three auto makers have been in the doldrums. And in the last few days, amid a broad selloff, shares of G.M. and Ford have fallen sharply. G.M. shares are down $4.375, or nearly 11 percent, since Friday's close, and Ford is down $4.75, or 11.6 percent. (Chrysler has fallen only 50 cents, or 2 percent, since Friday.)
On the positive side, the auto makers are winning high marks for streamlining their organizations and cutting costs. They are paying fewer cash rebates, selling fewer cars to rental companies at steeply discounted prices, and selling more high-profit models. In the first half of 1992, the Big Three have raised their share of the United States vehicle market to 72.5 percent, an increase 1.6 percentage points.
 
 
Volume Brings Profits
 On the down side, without sustained sales growth fueled by an army of confident buyers, little else matters. "Give them the volume," said Harvey Heinbach of Merrill Lynch, "and the profit will come."
And it is hard to escape the economic news: consumer confidence remains weak and unemployment high. Some analysts counter that auto sales are certain to keep building because of pent-up demand. They cite the rates at which cars are being scrapped and the length of time consumers typically keep their vehicles.
But after several months of optimism, it seemed significant today that General Motors, the nation's largest auto maker, suddenly turned cautious.
The note of warning was sounded in the commentary on G.M.'s second-quarter earnings offered by Robert C. Stempel, its chairman. The second half of the year, he predicted, "could be difficult in view of uncertainties related to the pace of economic recovery in North America and a slowdown in some major markets."
Mr. Stempel's words echoed those of Harold A. Poling, the chairman of the Ford Motor Company, who expressed much the same caution last week, as Ford announced its best earnings in two years. Only Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, has been more sanguine about the rest of the year.
For weeks, some investors with large G.M. stakes have been privately receiving negative signals from the company's economists. They have been discussing, for instance, something not explicitly mentioned in the earnings report: G.M.'s North American operations remain unprofitable. Analysts predict that G.M. will lose money in the current quarter, which is historically weak because plants are shut down to prepare for production of the next year's models.
 Other analysts found July's retail sales, released on Tuesday, quite worrisome. Although they were roughly in line with the seven-month trend of steady growth since January, July sales were down slightly from June, when orders were inflated by heavy sales to rental companies. Auto makers were ready for the drop last month, reasoning that some of the June sales had gone to buyers who otherwise would have bought in July.
Still, the July drop in retail sales seemed to be a turning point for some investors and analysts, who turned negative on the industry's prospects. Many, perhaps, were looking at substantial gains in share prices since early this year and may have been eager to take their profits.
Thus, August's retail numbers, which will be released early next month, will be very important in assessing the direction of the industry.
Stephen Girsky of Paine Webber was not the first automotive analyst to trim earnings estimates in recent weeks, but he did so based on sales and weakening economic indicators. Ronald Glantz, an auto analyst at Dean Witter in San Francisco, commented: "So far this year we've been seeing a lot of customers who need to buy a car. What we need to see are the people who don't need new cars but want to buy them."
He estimates that about three million people were waiting to build up enough confidence to buy.
But Wendy Needham of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company said she thought consumers were already confident. "We'd be seeing sales of Escorts if people only were buying out of need," she said. "We wouldn't have had as many sales of Sevilles and Ford Explorers as we've had."
She said she thought the sellers of auto stocks would be sorry a year from now, if the recovery is stronger and the stocks become much more expensive. "I'm in this for the long haul," she said.

HEADLINE: Operations Show Profit For G.M.

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said today that it had an operating profit of $392 million in the second quarter -- its most heartening quarterly showing in two years. The company reported a net loss of $357.1 million for the quarter because of the previously announced charge of $749.4 million by its Hughes Aircraft subsidiary.
The operating earnings reflected increased factory sales of cars and trucks to dealers, as well as cost savings from G.M.'s reorganized North American automotive operations, said Robert C. Stempel, the company chairman. 
 But despite the strong operating earnings, some analysts said they had expected much better results. Investors pushed G.M.'s stock price down $1.875, to $37.25. It was the second-most-actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange, with 5.9 million shares changing hands. As recently as Friday, the stock was trading at $41.625.
 
 
Auto Stocks Have Dipped
 In recent days, the stock prices of G.M., Ford and Chrysler have all slipped, as economic data have provided fresh evidence that the nation's economic recovery continues to sputter. Without strong economic growth, the outlook for auto sales is not good.
"The latter half of the year could be difficult in view of uncertainties related to the pace of economic recovery in North America and a slowdown in some major European markets," Mr. Stempel said in a statement. Though the next six months should show an improvement over the period a year earlier, he said, "sustaining the rate of progress we experienced in the first half appears extremely challenging."
G.M. revenue rose 14 percent in the second quarter to $35.19 billion, from $31.33 billion in the second quarter of last year. It lost $784.5 million in the 1991 quarter.
On Wednesday, G.M.'s Electronic Data Systems Corporation posted a 12 percent increase in profit, to $157 million; the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the company's financing arm, earned $287 million, up more than 1 percent, and GM Hughes Electronics had a net loss of $585 million, largely because of the restructuring charge.
The $749.4 million charge against earnings at Hughes Aircraft will pay for cutting 15 percent of the military contractor's worldwide staff, or 9,000 jobs, and other austerity moves because of less Pentagon work.
 Stephen Girsky, automotive analyst for Paine Webber in New York, noted approvingly that G.M.'s gross profit margin in auto making was 15.3 percent, compared with 14 percent in the first quarter and 11 percent a year earlier. But he has lowered his recommendation on auto stocks to "hold," from "buy," because of his concerns about the economy and July's slightly weaker retail auto sales.
G.M. sold 1.1 million cars and trucks to American dealers in the quarter, up 13.9 percent from the second quarter of 1991. Worldwide, factory sales rose 12 percent, to 2 million. Retail sales in the United States rose 5 percent, to 1.3 million vehicles.
G.M. said its profitability remained strong overseas, although below last year's level, which was helped by exceptionally strong German sales.
The company is in the midst of a historic shrinking, aimed at making it more responsive and competitive, in which 74,000 jobs will be cut and 21 factories closed by 1995. G.M.'s North American car-making operations lost $7 billion last year, an industry record, and the company's overall losses exceeded $4 billion.
With better cash flow and the sale of 57 million new common shares in the second quarter -- the largest offering ever by an American corporation -- G.M.'s liquidity was significantly stronger than it was a year ago. On June 30, G.M. reported $10.87 billion of cash and marketable securities, compared with $7.16 billion a year earlier.

HEADLINE: B.P.'s Shares Plummet After Dividend Is Slashed

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
British Petroleum said yesterday that it would cut its dividend by 55 percent, take a pretax restructuring charge of $1.82 billion for the second quarter and lay off 11,500 employees, or 10 percent of its worldwide work force. The moves came five weeks after Robert B. Horton, B.P.'s chairman, resigned under pressure from the company's outside directors.
Analysts anticipated a dividend cut by the oil company, the world's third largest, but the size of the cut was more severe than some had hoped. In response, shares of the company's American depository rights, each of which represents 12 shares of the London-based company, dropped $3.625, or 7.36 percent, to $45.375. It was the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, with 5.89 million shares traded. 
 The Royal Dutch/Shell group also reported a disappointing quarter yesterday, with earnings on a replacement cost basis -- excluding gains or losses on inventory holdings -- of $868 million, down 22 percent.
 
Quick Recovery Seems Unlikely
 Adding to the gloom at B.P., the new chief executive, David A. G. Simon, said the prospects for a quick recovery were poor. "External trading conditions are expected to remain difficult, particularly for the downstream oil and chemicals businesses, with growth prospects for the world's economies remaining uncertain," he said in a statement. Downstream oil is an industry term for refining and marketing operations, as distinct from oil production.
Downstream margins in the United States would be hurt later this year, he predicted, when clean air rules take effect and gasoline must be reformulated to reduce pollution. "In Europe, recovery will depend upon seasonal heating oil demand," Mr. Simon said.
The crude oil market, he predicted, would remain balanced unless Iraqi oil was allowed to re-enter the market. The company said it was well positioned to take advantage of any increase in oil prices, but the company's oil production in the United States is declining. B.P. is the largest producer in Alaska.
The market for petrochemicals in Europe remains weak.
B.P.'s second quarter profits, before one-time transactions, declined to $193 million from $515 million, valuing inventories on a replacement-cost basis. James J. Murchie, an analyst at Stanford C. Bernstein, estimated that after exceptional items, earnings per share fell to 30 cents in the second quarter, compared with 62 cents a year earlier.
Analysts attributed B.P.'s problems to the company's acquisitions in the last few years, and heavy capital expenditures. Summing up the company's recent history, Frank P. Kneuttel of Prudential Securities Research said, "Debt rose, interest expense rose, and profits have gone to hell."
Mr. Murchie, who worked for Standard Oil of Ohio and then B.P. after B.P. acquired Sohio, said, "What you've got is a company that thought oil prices were going to go to $25 and spent like it, in terms of capital." If B.P.'s costs of finding oil are the same as the industry average, he said, then the company has been spending enough to replace 120 percent to 130 percent of its annual production, which is not a successful strategy if prices do not rise.
In addition, he said, the company had been spending twice as much on its refining and marketing operation as it was recording in depreciation.
Another analyst at a large stock brokerage house, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, "They took all the old Sohio stations and turned them into modern B.P. stations; they took all the B.P. stations and turned them into ultramodern stations."
The analyst said that while some of the cuts were obvious, some came from housecleaning by a new chief, Mr. Simon, who replaced Mr. Horton on June 25. Mr. Horton had been on the job 27 months when his resignation was sought by the company's outside directors. When it came, the company's American depository rights plunged $6, to $48.375.
Yesterday, holders of American depository rights filed a class-action suit against the company, charging that B.P. should have reported at that time that the dividend would be cut.
But a dividend cut has been obvious since the end of the first quarter, when -- excluding gains from divestments and inventory value fluctuations -- profits fell nearly 90 percent and the company had to borrow to meet its dividend. Under British law, taxes rise if a company does not earn its dividend, so cutting the dividend now will reduce its tax burden, analysts said.
The layoffs, of which 80 percent will be in Europe and about 2,000 in the United States, are part of a program to cut the company's costs by about $1 billion annually, Mr. Simon said. "The extent to which these cost savings will result in growth of profits from current levels will be decided partly by the market and partly by the level of competition," he said.
Mr. Murchie, the analyst, said what was happening at B.P. was capital spending cuts followed by the realization that without projects to supervise, manpower needs were smaller. "It's the unfortunate reality of cyclical businesses, but poor, innocent people lose their jobs," he said. "B.P. is just a more extreme example of what's going to be happening to other oil companies."
At Royal Dutch/Shell, meanwhile, net income for the second quarter, including the change in inventory value, was $1.041 million, up 14 percent. Exploration and production earnings rose. Manufacturing, marine and marketing earnings were up, but only because of extraordinary items and changes in the value of inventory.

HEADLINE: A Year Later, Bond Traders Are a Humbler Lot

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
In the year since the Salomon Brothers Treasury scandal last August, bond traders have lost their swagger. They can still make millions of dollars a year. And the market is still rough and tumble. But in the last 12 months, traders have been on their best behavior, worried about possible Government indictments.
The image of the cowboy trader, averse to following rules, emerged in the aftermath of the Salomon scandal. But today, traders all seem to wear white gloves to the party and observe perfect etiquette. They are filling out more forms, keeping better records and talking less to their competitors before an auction to avoid being accused of collusion. 
 "In the past, people were cockier about their role in life," said a top executive in a major trading firm, who, like many others in the business, was loath to be identified by name because of the continuing Government investigation of the Treasury market.
How much this more conservative style of operation is affecting borrowing costs, however, is a matter of debate. The auction is the supply spigot for the $2.3 trillion Government securities market. It is the way the Treasury, and the still mostly tightknit group of primary dealers who buy the securities, set interest rates on the bills, notes and bonds that cover the Government's cash flow needs and budget deficit.
What is clear is that the tighter trading procedures embraced by many firms and traders are more in response to Government inquiries into wrongdoing than to sweeping new rules. The Government has asked copious questions and subpoenaed numerous records as part of the investigation of the illegal bidding by Salomon and the possibility of collusion among other trading firms.
"I think people are more conscious," said Junius Peake, a consultant on financial markets. "There are higher levels of supervision. No primary dealer wants to get caught like Solly did."
More sweeping changes in the Treasury market are waiting in the wings, but they may not fly. Legislation that would broadly revise the regulation of sales practices, crack down on fraud and create detailed reporting and compliance procedures is still being fought over in Congress.
And the major regulators of the bond market -- the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve -- oppose the legislation, arguing that more regulation will make the market less efficient and raise the Government's borrowing costs. They say that what happened at Salomon was an aberration, rather than a sign of a flawed system.
"I don't think fundamental changes in the bond market or in the way traders do business are called for or will happen," said Jerome H. Powell, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for finance.
Even the changes that have been made are not likely to prevent another Salomon-like scandal. "If someone has a devious mind and wants to do it, one can always get around the system," said Joel Kazis, a managing director at UBS Securities in New York.
The Salomon Brothers scandal, which broke on Aug. 9 last year, centered on illegal bidding in the Treasury auction. Salomon repeatedly exceeded the legal limit by bidding on more than 35 percent of the total of securities to be sold.
Salomon's top executives, who had known about the illegal bidding but took no action, were forced to resign.
The scandal sent shock waves through the bond industry. From the giant firms that dominate Wall Street to the much smaller boutique bond houses, traders today have become more religious about time-stamping their trading tickets, allowing discrepancies to be traced more easily. But that's a bore. For the same reason, they must fill out forms accurately -- before they go to lunch. That's a chore. And they say they must watch what they say on the telephone. A snore.
 
Training the T-Crossers
 What was an informal spiral notebook at many firms is now a formal ticket or log. Salomon Brothers now has training classes for traders, who then serve as part-time compliance experts on the trading floor.
A compliance director at a major firm says the office is fielding more questions nowadays because traders are more worried about "dotting their i's and crossing their t's." And the director says that many other firms must be doing likewise because of the number of headhunters calling in their search of fixed-income compliance officers.
"You have had a major Government investigation," said Mr. Powell of the Treasury. "Without question that will have chilled traders and will have made life in the Government bond market much less pleasant over the last year."
Traders say one of the biggest changes for them involves talking: they do a lot less of it.
In the past, before Treasury auctions, dealers would normally talk among themselves by phone to try to find out about another dealer's position without letting on about their own. In this way, they avoided bidding too much while still winning the securities they needed to fill expected orders.
This search for "market color" seems to be conducted much less now. Traders are afraid of suddenly having their conversations played back to them by government lawyers.
What effect all of this has had on the Treasury auction is hard to determine. Some traders said the bidding is not as fine-tuned as in the past. Others say auctions are now riskier for the bidders, who may pay more than they should or may not obtain an adequate supply of securities to fill their order.
But the very aggressive bidding for the five-year note in the auction at the end of July shows that the Treasury, at least, may have benefited by getting a record-low interest rate: 5.56 percent. While some traders attribute this to changes in style, others argue that the auction simply came at the peak of a market that was already ahead of itself.
In any case, another change has not had much discernable effect. New rules and regulations put out by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have altered the role of the primary dealers -- the core of the Treasury auction process -- by broadening participation in the auction to others. But the change has not seemed to have had a major impact yet because there is only one new primary dealer; in fact, the auction business seems to be even more concentrated than before among the top players in the market.
One significant change in policy was the Treasury Department's decision to brandish a weapon it had previously been reluctant to use: supplying additional securities when a severe shortage is driving up prices, perhaps signaling a squeeze or an illegal manipulation in the market.
In this way, "the Treasury can eliminate any shortgage," according to a report to Congress in January by the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve, outlining their major recommendations for regulating the Treasury markets.
There have been occasions this year, traders and the Treasury said, when this weapon might have been used because a shortage had occurred. But the Treasury declined, apparently because they saw no sure sign of an illegal manipulation.
Another factor reducing the chances for collusion is that customers are more careful to avoid placing all their orders for a Treasury auction through one dealer.
"Previously dealers, especially the big dealers, could fairly easily control the auction for a day or two," said a manager of a large bond fund in New York, who insisted that he be identified. "They could know where all the bonds are. But now it is much more difficult."
Dealers have also said that a lot of customers have stopped bidding through them in the Treasury auctions because of the new rules that require the customers' positions to be disclosed and confirmed to the regulators. So they are buying their bills, notes and bonds in the preauction or when-issued market, which is making some of the last-minute bidding decisions by dealers even more hectic and uncertain than before.
 
Pending Legislation
 The complete revamping of the auction system that was proposed by the Treasury is many years away, according to Mr. Powell, the Treasury Under Secretary. In the meantime, the Treasury is still considering how much it wants to tinker with the auction system.
So are others. On the legislative front, the S.E.C. and Representative Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the key Energy and Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, are squaring off against the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and much of the industry.
So far, this conflict has left the two major pieces of legislation dealing with the Salomon aftermath competing with each other in Congress. One, which has passed the Senate, is supported by those who would do less. The House version, which was approved by the Banking Committee today, would bring much more sweeping regulation to the bond market.
It is unclear whether either will become law before Congress recesses this year.

HEADLINE: Bias Found Widespread In the Courts

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
A task force set up to study the New Jersey judicial system has found widespread bias and a lack of opportunity for racial and ethnic minorities to work in the system or receive even-handed treatment from it.
The 48-member task force, whose findings were released today by Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz, said blacks were more likely to be arrested, less likely to be released on bail, less likely to see members of their own race in the courtroom and jury box and more likely to be the target of a death penalty hearing when charged with murder, especially if the victim was white. 
 People who do not speak English are still not being provided with adequate interpretive services to help them understand what is happening in court, the report said.
And if those who use the court system believe they have been discriminated against, there is no formal procedure for filing a grievance against court personnel, the task force reported.
 
A Known Bias
 "We have long known that the same bias that has affected all of society for so long exists in all of its institutions, including the judiciary," Mr. Wilentz said, adding that even though the problem is known to exist, no changes have resulted.
"What is needed and what has been accomplished by the task force is broad public exposure of the problem, in detail, so that the judiciary will know better where to attack it, and so that the public will support our efforts," he said.
Mr. Wilentz said an interim report produced by the task force in 1989 has already produced some changes. A procedure for filing complaints about discrimination in employment has been established; additional training and testing have been developed for interpreters and translators, and more than 40 court documents and forms have been translated into Spanish, he said.
The task force, whose chairman was Judge Theodore Z. Davis of the New Jersey Superior Court in Camden, broke up into four committees to study different aspects of bias in the courts.
 
A Lack of Confidence
 The Committee on Minority Access to Justice found that members of minority groups expressed a lack of confidence in the system and a reluctance to bring cases to court. A research project that focused on use of the courts found that 80 percent of white residents said they were likely to use the courts to settle disputes, compared with 15 percent of blacks and 5 percent of English-speaking Hispanic residents. (People who did not speak English were even less likely to use the courts.)
In addition, the committee said, members of minority groups often view the courts, especially at the municipal court level, as working in concert with the police. They also believe that money influences how judges treat those who appear before them, that those who can afford to hire private lawyers are treated with deference, while those who cannot afford counsel are not.
 
Paucity of Representation
 One factor contributing to these perceptions, the committee said, is the "paucity" of minority representation, from the State Supreme Court down to municipal courts, and in important policy-making and senior management positions.
The committee report gave high marks to a program initiated by Mr. Wilentz in 1986 to hire more minority members as law clerks, but said the program has not advanced beyond the levels of participation achieved in its early years.
"When a minority comes to court, the degree to which other minorities are visibly present as employees or principal participants in the court often plays a significant role in shaping that minority person's expectations of being treated fairly," the committee said.
The task force issued 62 recommendations, many of them calling for further study of the problems; increased sensitivity training for court personnel, and enhanced employment opportunities for minorities.
Mr. Wilentz endorsed only one proposal immediately, that he appoint a permanent oversight committee consisting of judges, lawyers and members of the public to follow up on the task force recommendations eventually accepted by the court, and to do more research.
The Chief Justice said the record of the task force recommendations will be kept open for 90 days for public comment before the court decides which recommendations to endorse.
"For minorities who are defendants, all the report asks is that they be treated fairly and equally; it does not ask that they be favored, but that they not be disfavored," Mr. Wilentz said. "It asks that they not be treated worse just because they happen not to speak English well, or just because they happen to be poor, or just because they happen to be unemployed, without a family, lacking in education, or just because they happen to be black or Hispanic."
"The report seeks no advantage for minorities and I do not believe they want any," he said. "They just want to be treated like everyone else and they are entitled to be."

HEADLINE: Cutting the Big High School Down to Size;
Fernandez Joins the Movement to More Emphasis on Individual Teen-Agers

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Large high schools, with their sweat-scented, echoing gymnasiums and hallways chockablock with lockers, have long been part of the nation's mythology, the cheery locale of Archie and Veronica, Our Miss Brooks and The Fonz.
But a rising chorus of American educators is arguing that they no longer work, particularly for youngsters growing up in a society of shattered families and a pervasive distrust of authority. With three students shot to death in the hallways of Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, the mischief of "Happy Days" seems long ago and far away. 
 Now New York City's School Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, weaving ideas and efforts made by educational thinkers and community groups, has cobbled together a plan for creating 30 small high schools over three years that would focus on such themes as the environment or world trade. The aim is to start to break down the impersonal, amorphous quality of instruction offered in the city's 124 behemoth high schools, the largest of which, Brooklyn Technical High School, has 4,660 students.
His schools, of 300 to 1,000 students each, would strive to be more intimate places where students and teachers know one another, where teen-agers going through their inevitably turbulent passages can find caring guides.
But Mr. Fernandez's plan may have a rough time. The large American high school, a product of Industrial Revolution thinking that put a premium on economy of scale and compartmentalization, is not an easy engine to take apart.
It has bred institutions like senior proms and athletic teams. It has spawned ingrained jobs like department chairmen and thousands of restricting regulations. Donald Singer, the president of the principals union, has already let it be known that he will not tolerate any school that is managed by a teacher and not a union-issue supervisor.
The large anonymous high school also has distinct advantages that smaller schools cannot match. A cornucopia of electives, everything from astrophysics to upholstery shop, cannot be offered in schools with small enrollments. The Bronx High School of Science, with 2,745 students, would be a far different place with only 500 students.
Moreover, Mr. Fernandez has taken a gamble in inviting, on an unprecedented scale, a range of collaborators into his experiment, including unions like District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, businesses like American Express and community organizers like East Brooklyn Congregations, which sponsors the Nehemiah housing program.
To some extent, Mr. Fernandez has no choice. Like so many other New Yorkers knocked down by hard economic times, Mr. Fernandez has become a panhandler and must beg for new money wherever he can find it. Intent upon solidifying his image as a reformer, he must search for ideas and energy outside the entrenched bureaucracy at 110 Livingston Street in downtown Brooklyn.
Through the nonprofit Fund for New York City Public Education, several foundations have committed a total of $1.5 million to his venture. Another $1 million will be raised by the team of Deborah Meier, the principal who founded several uncoventional Manhattan schools, and Theodore R. Sizer, a Brown University professor. The city will pay for the cost of teachers, equipment and leases in line with longstanding formulas generated by overcrowding.
But if one of the criticisms of New York's high schools is the degree of stultifying control from the central Board of Education, one danger of the Fernandez plan is the problems inherent in a dispersion of control.
 
Plenty of Questions
 How can parents comfortable with high schools reassuringly named after American Presidents and icons be confident that their children will get a bedrock education in a place with a name like "High School for the Physical City"?
Will collaborators have too much say over what gets taught? How can the Board of Education's monitors make sure that courses in community organizing, a course envisioned by the authors of one proposed school, will not enter treacherous political waters?
Ms. Meier contends that the New York City school system has to take the risk that things may go awry. They are already awry, she suggests.
"When my son graduated Stuyvesant High School, he had to give the name as a reference of a teacher who knew him well," Ms. Meier recalled. "There was not a single teacher. He never had a teacher for more than one course."
As a practical matter, Mr. Fernandez, confronting severely overcrowded schools, is never going to tear down most of the 124 high schools and he certainly has no money to build hundreds of smaller ones.
What some educational advocates have urged him to do is to break up the existing schools into separate "houses," where students on a single floor would take a more manageable cluster of courses with the same circle of teachers. A handful of high schools and junior high schools have already divided themselves into four and five cozier sub-schools, each with a different career theme.
Ms. Meier has suggested Mr. Fernandez go further and designate these houses as independent schools. A mere house, she says, has no separate budget and often must run on the same schedule as the rest of the building. In a building that once housed only a junior high school she operates two separate innovative elementary schools and the local district operates a junior high school program.
As part of his plan, Mr. Fernandez is letting her and Mr. Sizer have their way with at least two conventional high schools that are yet to be designated. The two educators will break each building into several independent schools with distinctive philosophies and staffs. The two buildings then might house six or eight singular schools.
The big American high school will still be standing. But, inside, it will be a very different place.

HEADLINE: Talks Focus on Environment In Push for Free Trade Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Canadian, Mexican and American trade negotiators labored over the environmental section of a North American free trade agreement today, trying to put the finishing touches on a deal that President Bush could announce Friday, people involved in the negotiations said.
But a Canadian spokesman, Yves Gagnon, said tonight that the three nations' trade ministers stopped talking at 9 P.M. and would resume negotiations before 9 A.M. Friday. 
 Democrats have strongly criticized the planned accord on labor and environmental grounds, forcing a review of the environmental provisions in a last-minute effort to make the pact more palatable politically.
The White House has long been said to want President Bush to have a free trade agreement to boast of at the Republican Convention, which opens in Houston in 10 days. Some Democrats have openly worried that the Administration might make costly concessions for the sake of a quick deal.
"I don't think there is any question they are trying to rush this thing through, and the Mexicans and the Canadians have very good negotiators," said Representative Robert Matsui, Democrat of California. "I'm afraid we may get the short end of the stick if they become aware of our political considerations."
But Administration officials were quick to insist that Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, would not accept a poor deal for political reasons.
"She knows there are certain things that have got to be in the deal, and if they're not there, then they have to keep going," an American official said.
Campaigning in Davenport, Iowa, this morning, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas suggested to a group of hard-hatted workers at the Nichols Home Shield Company that he could strike a better deal than Mr. Bush, while repeating his support for negotiating an agreement.
The Democratic Presidential candidate said he believed that a free trade pact with Mexico would be good for the United States. "But I don't know if it would be the kind Mr. Bush would sign," Mr. Clinton said.
The House of Representatives voted 362 to 0 tonight in favor of a nonbinding resolution calling for the accord not to jeopardize American health, safety and environmental standards. After initial opposition to such specific wording, the Bush Administration reversed course to support the resolution.
The White House, which has come slowly to agree that the environment had a place in the accord, appears ready to accept the creation of a trilateral panel on the environment, along with detailed rules to prevent countries from lowering their environmental standards to attract foreign investment.
Still under discussion are the powers of the panel and the extent to which the agreement will allow trade disputes involving environmental issues to be appealed to special arbitration panels of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Subcommittee on International Trade, has called for the trilateral panel to have enforcement powers, a position that Canadian officials briefly backed. But the Bush Administration has ruled this out as involving excessive regulation.
The broad outlines of the free-trade agreement were set by Tuesday evening, but many technical details are still being worked out, people involved in the negotiations said. These involve rules for the settling of commercial disputes and trade in autos, beer and glass. But an American official said tonight that the odds of a deal on Friday were "somewhat less than 50-50."
 
Discussions on Autos
 Progress on rules for settling disputes left the key details still unsettled in the auto trade. The negotiators have reached a rough understanding that cars and trucks will only qualify for duty-free treatment under the pact if slightly more than 60 percent of their value is produced in North America, but continue to discuss how to calculate this figure.
The possibility remains that some remaining details may prove contentious and that a pact may not be ready for an official announcement before Mr. Bush leaves for Kennebunkport, Me, on Friday afternoon.
If the trade ministers decide that too many details remain unresolved for them to announce a pact, the negotiations might be suspended for the weekend to allow the participants to recover. Friday will be the sixth straight day of talks for the ministers, who often worked until late at night, and the 10th straight day of work for their chief negotiators.
But negotiators for all three countries have been reluctant to adjourn for fear that their counterparts may backtrack on concessions made so far.

Shearson Discusses the Sale of Its Boston Company Unit

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. announced yesterday that it was negotiating the sale of the Boston Company, its large money-management subsidiary, with several financial institutions.
In a statement, Shearson described the talks about the sale as preliminary and said the firm had not yet decided to sell the unit. Citing confidentiality of the conversations, the firm declined to identify the bidders or say how many might be interested in buying the diviison. 
 But Wall Street executives yesterday named three giant banking institutions as potential bidders. They include one New York bank, Chase Manhattan, as well as two banking companies based in Pittsburgh, the Mellon Bank Corporation and the PNC Financial Corporation.
Spokesmen for the three banks could not be reached last night at their offices.
The potential sale of the Boston Company has been rumored for years, but Shearson has often said that it had no plans to sell the unit. In recent months, however, the values of such businesses have skyrocketed as increasing numbers of financial institutions have sought out the attractive, stable earnings that such businesses bring.
 
Flurry of Acquisitions
 Indeed, in recent months Wall Street has seen a flurry of acquisitions of such businesses, capped by the purchase last week of John Templeton's money-management empire, Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger. The business was sold to Franklin Resources Inc., a California fund company, for $913 million.
"If the Templeton funds can go for $900 million plus, money managers today can be a relatively attractive deal," one investment banker outside Shearson said. "That can attract a lot of buyers and sellers."
The Boston Company provides a range of administration, custodial and trust services for mutual funds and pension funds, as well as foundations and charitable organizations. The company is also involved in the mortgage-lending business through its Boston Safe Deposit and Trust subsidiary.
Investment bankers outside Shearson said yesterday that both its money-management business and mortgage business made the company attractive. With the rapid drop in interest rates, the Boston Company is one of several institutions that stands to profit from the rush of consumers seeking to refinance mortgages.
The company is in strong financial shape, with about $34 billion of assets under management as of June 30. The company also provides administrative and custodial services for more than $300 billion worth of assets.
Such a sale, if it proceeds, would help Shearson, as well as its parent, the American Express Company, both of which are recovering from years of financial turmoil brought on by growing credit problems and poor investments in the 1980's. While Shearson did not disclose the prices that are being negotiated for the money-management unit, some investment bankers outside the firm said the Boston Company would probably sell for more than $1 billion.

HEADLINE: MILLIONS PROPOSED FOR NEW YORK AREA IN U.S. TRANSIT BILL

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The New York region would receive hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal mass-transit subsidies, along with money to upgrade its rail systems, under the transportation bill now moving toward approval in Congress.
The bill, which passed the Senate on Wednesday and the House last month, now moves to a House-Senate conference committee. It exemplifies the radically new philosophy enshrined by Congress last year in giving states great leeway in spending Federal transportation dollars on mass transit. The New York region, because of its reliance on mass transit, stands to be one of the largest beneficiaries of this year's $33.8 billion transit appropriation bill. 
 "This is one of the bright spots of this session of Congress for the Northeast," Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, said. He said the bill should create jobs, reduce pollution and improve traffic flow. "It's a win, win, win."
 
Holding Fares Steady
 For the most part, transportation agencies had expected to receive the money, promised to them in an authorization bill last year, and included it in their annual budgets. It would allow the agencies to maintain their transit fares and to move ahead with construction, budgetary and modernization projects in various phases of development.
Of the $802 million in mass-transit subsidies included in the bill, $102 million would go to New York City. The money, New York City Transit Authority officials said, would enable the authority to keep its fare at $1.25 at least until the end of the year and probably through 1993.
The bill also provides money for rebuilding the Staten Island Ferry's fire-damaged Whitehall Terminal and to buy land to connect Manhattan's 63d Street subway tunnel to lines in Queens.
For New Jersey, the bill appropriates $71.7 million for the so-called Urban Core, the centerpiece of New Jersey's efforts to update its mass-transit system. Urban Core's goal is to connect all of northern New Jersey's rail systems into a unified system, including a state-of-the-art terminal in Secaucus.
The bill also earmarks $204 million to make the improvements, most of them in Connecticut, needed to bring high-speed Amtrak trains to the New York-Boston corridor -- a project considered a major economic boon to the region. The new trains, which are already in use as Metroliners between New York and Washington, would cut the five-hour trip to three hours, a change that planners hope would make Amtrak more competitive with airlines.
The House passed its version of the bill last month, and differences between the two still must be reconciled. But Senators and transit officials from the area said they were confident the region's projects would survive the negotiations because Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democrat of New Jersey, and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican of New York, are on the conference committee.
While the Bush Administration opposes the mass-transit subsidies -- as it has in previous transportation appropriation bills -- the President, who supports most of the bill, is expected to sign it, as he has previous transportation bills.
The bill follows the guidelines laid out last year when Congress, in a radical philosophical change, greatly helped mass transit by providing states with flexibility on how they could spend transportation money. That ended the era in which superhighways were built to weave the country's disparate regions into a nation and gave the Federal Government the role of a benevolent banker handing out money to the states.
The rewrite of the highway bill, the first such revision in 35 years, was masterminded by New York's Democratic Senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
 
Freedom of Choice
 The change gives the region, which completed most of its interstate-highway network years ago, the flexibility to dedicate a greater proportion of its Federal appropriation money to mass transit for the first time. But the bill provides $217 million less than legislators promised last year.
"They thought there was going to be a peace dividend," said Judith Chesser, the lobbyist for New York City. "But in fact, appropriations remained about the same, meaning at some point funding won't come through for promised projects." That, she and other regional transit officials warned, could force the cancellation or delay of some projects now under way.
Still, the bill contains money for a host of projects for the area, and so was hailed today as good news for a region buffeted by the recession and state budget gaps, which have forced sharp cutbacks in services and thousands of layoffs. Since it holds a major Federal road-building program to $18.5 billion and specifically raises mass transit spending by more than $1 billion, it is biased toward urban centers.
So legislators from the New York region have overlooked the shortfall and congratulated Senator Lautenberg, who shepherded the bill through the Senate as chairman of the Transportation Appropriations subcommittee, and Senator D'Amato, who was the senior minority member of the committee.
One of the largest of the projects in the region would be the improvement of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. The track between New Haven and Boston would be upgraded and electrified, cutting out time-consuming delays while engines are changed. The Council of New England Governors has estimated the project would provide 1,000 new construction jobs each year for nine years, a stimulus of $305 million in wages, $894 million in sales during its construction and $440 million in new business activity.
But the bill also provides money for a panoply of other projects. Many involve mass transit -- like alternative-fuel buses for Nassau County and the restoration of commuter-rail service on the Hawthorne-Paterson line in New Jersey -- while others are intended to ease auto traffic, like an electronic toll-collection system on the Tappan Zee Bridge.

LONG ISLAND
$9.5 million for at least 36 alternative-fuel buses for Nassau County. That is likely to give the county the largest such fleet in the state.
$20 million to upgrade the Southern State Parkway's motorist-information system with computer graphics on overhead billboards.
 
WESTCHESTER
$7.3 million to install electronic toll-collection systems for commuters using the Tappan Zee Bridge and Buffalo's Grand Island Bridge.
 
NEW JERSEY

High-Risk Debt From the Old Days

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IN the bad old days, when Drexel Burnham Lambert was a feared investment banking powerhouse and deals were done on the assumption that operations of acquired companies would dramatically improve, pay-in-kind bonds became a Wall Street rage.
Those bonds, known as PIK's, promised high interest rates, which buyers found attractive, but allowed companies to avoid parting with cash for years after the bonds were issued. Instead, companies would simply issue more bonds. So long as the printing presses were working, such companies could not default. 
 Unfortunately, many PIK bonds never paid a nickel to investors before their issuers went into default. Never again, went the Wall Street refrain.
But this week, almost as if it the old days were back, a California savings and loan controlled by investors including a former Treasury Secretary, William E. Simon, agreed to pay 18 percent interest on bonds -- in more bonds.
West Fed Holdings Inc. of Marina del Ray, Calif., which controls Western Federal Savings, agreed to do that because it cannot afford the outlay for the 14.5 percent cash interest it had agreed to pay.
Under the deal, the investors, who were represented by Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin, a Los Angeles investment banking firm, get bonds that do not have to pay cash interest until Sept. 15, 1995. Until then, the company can pay 15.5 percent in cash or 18 percent in bonds.
There is no question which option it will take. "The company does not have sufficient liquidity" to pay the cash, said Peter Putnam, Western Federal's controller.
The debt restructuring serves as a dramatic example of how even smart investors in savings and loans have run into trouble, in part because of unfortunate operating strategies and in part because of changes in Federal regulations. And it shows how the combination of various Federal laws can make it impossible or illegal for bondholders to take control of companies that cannot pay their debts.
Investors bought the bonds in 1988, when a group including Mr. Simon and Preston Martin, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, took control of Western, a healthy savings and loan, and bought an insolvent one, Bell Savings of San Leandro, Calif., with help from the Government. The idea was that Western would grow its way out of any problems and revive Bell's operations. It didn't work.
The first problem was regulatory change. In 1989, new savings and loan capital requirements put Western Fed, the operating subsidiary, out of compliance. And that meant that it could no longer pay dividends to the parent company, West Fed, which had issued the bonds. Because West Fed had raised more money than it really needed, cash on hand paid interest requirements until now. But that cushion has run out.
There were other problems. A looming one, which has some investors nervous, is that in 1989 and 1990, Western Fed sold mortgages with recourse, meaning that in case of default, the buyers could force Western Fed to make up their losses. With real estate prices booming, it seemed like a small risk, and, so far, losses have not been large, even with California's declining real estate market. But they may grow.
The bigger problems have come from the sources one might expect: big commercial and apartment loans. "We made some loans we wish we had not made," Mr. Putnam said. "We had this one apartment building, with 250 units. We foreclosed on it and there were four families, immigrant families, living in each unit. You can imagine the stress that places on the building, the maintenance, the utility bills. And a lot of the buildings are in gang areas, which doesn't help values."
Western Fed's strategy, under a new president and chief executive, Jim Bethel, who was recruited from the First American Savings Bank in Greensboro, N.C., is to avoid big loans and concentrate on home mortgages. It writes them at a rapid rate -- $1.5 billion in the first six months of this year -- and then sells them just as fast. The Bell Savings branches, in northern California, are being sold, with the exception of one that found no buyers and will close on Monday.
The hope now is that Western will do well enough to bring in more capital from outside investors. It is cutting costs and planning to sell mutual funds through its branches.
Theoretically, the bondholders were in a position to force the company into bankruptcy or a reorganization giving them all the equity. But a major asset of West Fed is its tax losses, many of which would vanish if there was a change in control of the company. So the bondholders have no real choice but to take pay-in-kind bonds and hope something will turn up.

HEADLINE: House Votes Billions in Aid to Ex-Soviet Republics

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
After 45 years of voting for foreign aid to combat the Soviet Union, the House voted today to provide billions of dollars in assistance to Russia and the other former Soviet republics.
The action assures Congressional approval of an aid package that President Bush has called essential to the post-cold-war world and that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia told Congress in June would help guarantee the success of his efforts to nourish democratic and economic reform. 
 Overcoming intense election year opposition from Democrats and some Republicans who said it was wrong to help Russia when Americans were in need, the House followed the Senate in approving $1.2 billion in bilateral aid and a $12 billion increase in the American commitment to the International Monetary Fund, which will finance loans to Russia and other nations.
The vote was 255 to 164, with 161 Democrats and 94 Republicans in favor and 95 Democrats, 68 Republicans and an independent opposed.
The majority included Representative Jamie L. Whitten, Democrat of Mississippi, the only member of the House who was here to vote for $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey on May 9, 1947, at the beginning of more than four decades of foreign aid intended to curb Soviet influence.
Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 House Republican, compared today's action to the 1948 adoption of the Marshall Plan for rebuilding Europe. He said the vote "may well be as important a vote as any of us will ever cast."
He said the rise of Hitler, the concentration camps and World War II might have been averted if the United States had been more helpful to the Weimar Republic in the late 1920's. With that in mind, he said, anyone who voted against this bill was in effect "willing to risk the collapse of democracy in Russia and stand to one side and do nothing about it."
There were intense arguments against the bill, especially from members of the House's black caucus. Representative Barbara-Rose Collins, Democrat of Michigan, said: "Our cities are hurting. We must learn how to take care of America first. Our cities are hurting."
Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, called domestic aid "measly" in comparison with what was being done for Russia.
 
Democrats Rally Support
 But Democratic leaders rallied the support to pass the bill by arguing that the Bush Administration was likely to approve further help to the nation's cities and highway system. And they joined in arguments that this was the critical moment to help Mr. Yeltsin.
Several lawmakers cited a letter from the nation's four living former Presidents -- Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan -- backing the measure.
Saying their Administrations had been "united in the struggle against Communism," they wrote: "We now have the opportunity, so fervently pursued for generations, to guarantee a peaceful transition to democracy. America must respond to this challenge, as we have so many times before, through leadership of an international coalition to secure the success of reform in Russia and the other states of the former Soviet Union."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, also compared today's vote to the vote on the Marshall Plan. He said, "None of us may cast the giant shadows of the architects of the Marshall Plan, but the nature of our role, and the significance of our decision, is no less momentous."
He said lawmakers had a duty to explain the necessity of this vote to their constituents. "We must compel them to see a future where American exports, American jobs, American profits and American incomes -- our very economic security -- will be protected, just as we acted to protect our military security in the cold war by approving the Marshall Plan," he said.
 
'30,000 Nuclear Weapons'
 Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, said today's vote "will help determine the shape of the world for the next century." He said: "Yeltsin and the reformers have a great test. They need our help. We cannot live safe and free if there is turmoil and upheaval in a land that possesses 30,000 nuclear weapons."
Republican support was expected to be stronger, as the minority followed Mr. Bush's appeals and advice from its leaders, like Mr. Gingrich and Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the minority leader.
Mr. Michel told the House: "We have a chance to shape the world. Let's make it a world in which 45 years of sacrifice are rewarded, in which the promise of democracy becomes a reality in the former Soviet Union."
 
The Opposing Views
 Opposition came a variety of perspectives. Representative John Kyl, Republican of Arizona, for example, wanted a guarantee that Russian troops would leave the Baltic states and Representative Mel Hancock, Republican of Missouri said, "We must start looking after America first."
The most concerted attacks, however, came from the Congressional Black Caucus. In the debate on the procedures for considering the bill, Ms. Waters said she would vote against them because they did not permit an amendment to provide loan guarantees to American cities. But she was holding a news conference when the vote came, and it passed without discernible dissent.
The increased commitment to the International Monetary Fund is part of a larger effort to increase its capital by about $60 billion. No precise share of that has been allotted to Russia and the former Soviet republics, but they are expected to get the biggest share.
On Wednesday the I.M.F. announced a $1.04 billion loan to Russia, and today the World Bank announced a $600 million loan to Russia to pay for imports to improve health, food supply, transport, oil production and private business.
The provisions concerning the International Monetary Fund do not involve direct United States spending.
The measure approved today included none of the conditions various House members sought to add to it, ranging from attempts to force the removal of troops from the Baltic states to an end of Russian aid to Cuba.
 
Separate Legislation Needed
 It provides authority to spend $1.2 billion to aid Russia and other former Soviet republics. Those funds have to be appropriated under separate legislation. Some of those measures have already been passed in the House and should have smooth sailing in the Senate.
The biggest chunk, $790 million, would go to help dismantle nuclear weapons. And $417 million more would be for direct aid to help Russia build its democratic system and its economy.
The measure also authorizes the use of $3 billion in existing American credits to support a fund to stabilize the ruble.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
Bush Urges U.N. to Back Force to Get Aid to Bosnia

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLORADO SPRINGS, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Responding to mounting international and domestic pressure to take action on the Balkan war, President Bush called today for a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of force to deliver food and medicine to the besieged populations of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"My heartfelt hope is that that will not prove necessary, but the international community cannot stand by and allow innocent children, women and men to be starved to death," Mr. Bush said at a hastily arranged airport news conference after a campaign appearance here. He said he would "press hard for quick passage" of a Security Council resolution.
 
Hardening of U.S. Stand
 
 Mr. Bush's words represented a hardening of the Administration's position on the Balkan war. But in calling for a United Nations resolution, Mr. Bush was taking a step to carry out an agreement, reached with other leaders in July, to seek United Nations authorization to protect the relief effort in Bosnia.
Administration officials said that even if force were used under these circumstances, it would be limited to supporting the relief efforts and not to impose an end to the fighting or to check Serbian aggression. Mr. Bush asserted today that no amount of outside pressure or force would end the bloodshed in the Balkans, which he said could go on for years.
American officials said that if the United States did use military force to back up relief efforts in the Balkans, it would be confined to American air and naval power.
 
Consultations at U.N.
 American officials began consulting with allies and members of the United Nations Security Council today to press for a resolution as quickly as possible, perhaps this weekend. Administration officials said Washington had secured general support from Britain and France before Mr. Bush made his announcement today.
It thus remained unclear whether the President's statements were simply another twist in a Balkan policy that has fluctuated from passivity to rhetorical threats but seems to have been driven by a desire to limit American involvement in the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Outlining a series of steps he was prepared to take to demonstrate American resolve, Mr. Bush said he would immediately establish full diplomatic relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Croatia to support those new countries, which have declared independence from Yugoslavia.
Saying he said he felt a "moral obligation" to determine the truth of reports of torture and mass killings at Serbian-run detention camps, Mr. Bush demanded that inspectors be given full access to the camps and ordered American intelligence to use "every asset available" to investigate.
The actions had been urged on the President for weeks by Democratic and Republican lawmakers as the Balkan war turned into a troubling test of the "new world order" that the President proclaimed during the Persian Gulf crisis.
At a summit meeting in Munich in July, Mr. Bush and the other leaders of the Group of Seven industrial democracies said they would seek a United Nations resolution on the use of force to deliver humanitarian supplies to Sarajevo and other places if the shipments were blocked by the Serbs.
Despite continued attacks by Serbian forces, Mr. Bush fell largely silent on the issue after the Munich conference, and withheld his first public response to the growing cry for action in Washington and from abroad until fighting in the area of the Sarajevo airport, a consequence of a Bosnian counteroffensive, forced United Nations officials to suspend their airlift of food and medicine into the besieged city. The airlift, suspended on Tuesday, has been the only active international relief effort in Bosnia.
Mindful of the political risks of sending American forces into combat in an election year, the President also said he had not yet made the final decision to do so. "You can be assured that if force proves necessary, I will do everything in my power to protect the men and women involved in this international mission of mercy," he said.
Mr. Bush's decisions largely mirrored a bipartisan resolution endorsed Wednesday by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee calling for an American response to the Balkan violence. They represented a response not only to the violent unfolding of the dissolution of Yugoslavia but also to the events of recent days, including reports of torture and mass killings of Bosnian Muslims at Serbian detention camps.
The Administration has been making conflicting statements on the camps for days and it was not until today that the President elevated the issue to the level of the Oval Office. On Wednesday, the Administration issued a written statement by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger calling for a war crimes investigation of the fighting in Bosnia.
"We know that there is horror in these detention camps," Mr. Bush said. "I cannot confirm on hard evidence some of the charges that have been made. It is absolutely essential, whatever is going on there, that there be open inspections and that humane treatment of the people in these concentration camps be guaranteed."
But, he added, "In all honesty I can't confirm to you some of the claims that there is, indeed, a genocidal process going on there."
 
Balkan War Is Called Quagmire
 Asked if he felt a "moral obligation" to stop the killing if the reports turn out to be true, Mr. Bush said, "Well, I feel a moral obligation to see that these camps are inspected."
Mr. Bush tried to walk a careful line on the question of using military force in the Balkans. His aides have been counseling him for months that the Balkan war is a quagmire from which the United States might not be able to extricate itself for years if ground forces were committed.
Asked today if television pictures from Bosnia of civilians being shot and bombed made him want to send in American bombers to destroy the Serbian artillery positions, Mr. Bush said: "It makes me want to do whatever we have to do to stop the killing. I would only suggest that this is a very complicated military question -- very, very complicated indeed."
He added, "We have the best intelligence in the world on this and it is not an easy military problem even for our fantastic Air Force."
In addition to pressing for a Security Council resolution that "will authorize the international community to use force, if necessary, to deliver humanitarian relief supplies," Mr. Bush said he would take these steps:
*Name ambassadors to Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Washington has recognized these former Yugoslav republics as independent countries but has not established full relations with them.
*Propose that international monitors be posted in neighboring countries to insure that the economic embargo on Yugoslavia is enforced.
*Propose the establishment of civilian monitors to try to prevent the violence in Bosnia and Croatia from spreading.
*Consult with "our allies in NATO on all aspects of this crisis and how the alliance, how the NATO alliance, might be of assistance to the United Nations."
Mr. Bush opened his remarks by reading from a statement in which he said the war in the Balkans "is a complex, convoluted conflict that grows out of age-old animosities."
"Let no one think there is an easy or a simple solution to this tragedy," he said. "The violence will not end overnight, whatever pressure and means the international community brings to bear."
He added, "Those who understand the nature of this conflict understand that an enduring solution cannot be imposed by force from outside on unwilling participants."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Memo;
Democrat's Road Tour: Selling the Ticket Retail

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, Aug. 6

 BODY:
This is not the way Presidential nominees are supposed to campaign.
The general election race between the Republican and the Democratic candidates is supposed to be a matter of what the people in the business call wholesale politics: big-scale, highly structured events scripted to be fitted neatly into a thematic scheme geared toward the national television audience. 
 Retail politics, where the candidate goes out in less-controlled appearances to meet the public in closer circumstances and by more random chance, is supposed to end with the early primary contests of Iowa and New Hampshire.
 
Into the Countryside
 But in a year where cliches of politics are proving even more clearly wrong than usual, another has been quietly scrapped by the Democratic ticket of Gov. Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore. They have resurrected retail politics in the wholesale season, and so far it has proved successful.
In their first bus trip after the Democratic nominating convention, the two candidates and their wives traveled through eight states; in the current three-day trip from Missouri to Minnesota, they will cover five more. Similar trips are under discussion. So far, each day has followed the same pattern.
In the mornings, the candidates, neither of whom shine much before mid-afternoon, lumber through "town meetings," in which they take dozens of questions from voters of various stripes. In the afternoon there is generally a rally or two. These things are routine, no different really from the appearances of Michael S. Dukakis or Dan Quayle or anyone else.
The difference comes in between these routine stops, when Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore do not take a jet to the next stop but board that humblest form of mass transit, the bus. They then drive slowly along back roads, through places where Presidential candidates hardly ever go.
In every town, and sometimes just at odd spots along the road, people stand and wave and cheer (some give thumbs-down signs, or even more emphatic signs of disapproval, but they are very few so far).
Whenever there are more than a few hundred people gathered in one place, the entourage comes to a gear-grinding halt, and Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore go out and work the lines, greeting and touching and smiling and talking to people who waited hours for them in lines five and 10 deep, and who literally chased the men at times in their desire for touches or words or autographs.
 
Reach Out and Touch
 When the Democrats traveled and campaigned from 6 A.M. Wednesday to 1 A.M. today, the buses stopped seven times by the side of the road. Mr. Clinton, whose motto seems to be Leave No Hand Ungrasped, must have, by conservative estimate, touched 3,000 people.
If Mr. Clinton keeps up his current pace, he will, by Election Day, have made physical contact with nearly as many voters -- 118,550 -- as made up the margin of victory for John F. Kennedy over Richard M. Nixon in 1960.
There are two calculations at work here, both well understood within the Clinton campaign. On one level the campaign does put real stock in the candidate's ability to charm anyone who comes within range of his apparently bottomless enthusiasm for talking to voters. In New Hampshire, they say, post-primary polling suggested that Mr. Clinton won the votes of 80 percent of those who actually met him.
In addition, and more important, the campaign knows that from each passing visit with each roadside crowd it derives a benefit far out of proportion to the number of voters present.
 
Winning Over the Media
 In this sense, what the Clinton bus tour is up to is not retail politics at all but wholesale, wrapped in the bright and pleasing package of retail.
Typically, the Clinton campaign press corps numbers between 30 and 40 journalists. The Gore corps has only about 10 full-time members. But the combined press corps for each of the two bus trips has so far been between 140 and 160.
The press is drawn in part by matters of economy; it is a great deal cheaper to travel with a candidate by bus than by plane. But it is also drawn by -- and impressed by -- the same thing that draws and impresses the farmers in bib overalls and the housewives in Bermuda shorts who stand with the signs "Welcome Bill and Al": the novelty of seeing a Presidential candidate wandering leisurely along country roads.
Isolated on buses, exposed to mile after mile and hour after hour of cheering Clinton supporters, even the national reporters tend to respond with positive stories. The local press is far more enthusiastic. Each county the buses roll through is good for glowing reports on the local television and radio stations and headlines like the one that greeted Mr. Clinton in The Quad-City Times this morning: "Hello, Bill."
Most of Mr. Clinton's encounters with the people who wait for him are fleeting and prosaic, but there is something about the moment of actual touch that sometimes transcends even mass politics.
In Canton, Mo., 19-year-old Cher Gross stopped Mr. Clinton with the question, "Mr. President, may I kiss your cheek?"
"Well, of course," Mr. Clinton said after the slightest of pauses. Then he hugged her as she stood on tip-toe to buss him.
 
One Family's Story
 In the Mississippi River town of Muscatine, Iowa, where hundreds of people stopped the buses at 10:30 P.M., and where Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore shook, it seemed, every hand at least twice, there was a scene of odd and poignant intimacy caught in the artificial whiteness of the cameras' lights.
As her neighbors stood around her holding candles and listening in silence, Jeanette Honts told Mr. Clinton the story of how her husband -- "a good man," she said -- lost his job at the Thatcher Tubes Company plastics factory, and how he had not been able to find another for five months now.
As she told of sending out 25 resumes a day, and of the six children at home, she nearly wept, and the candidate, caught with her in the pool of light, held both her hands in his and told her she was a brave person for waiting so long and for coming forward to tell him her story.
"I would have waited all night," she said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Says Rival Would 'Pull a Fast One' Over Taxes

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLORADO SPRINGS, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Trying to steady the Republicans' wobbly conservative base, President Bush today made his most aggressive assault yet on Gov. Bill Clinton, asserting that the Democratic nominee would "pull a fast one on the American people" and raise taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars.
Appearing before an enthusiastic group of conservative state lawmakers at the annual convention of the American Legislative Exchange Council, Mr. Bush made the economy the battleground of the day, targeting the issue on which his advisers believe he is most vulnerable and on which he has received the most fire from conservatives.
 
A Liberal Trojan Horse
 
 The President devoted his entire speech to portraying Mr. Clinton as a liberal Trojan horse. "Is all this talk about what they call a 'new covenant' simply some cover-up for old ideas?" Mr. Bush said, borrowing the slogan the Arkansas Governor introduced in the Democratic primaries and revived in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention last month.
Campaigning today in Hanoverton, Ohio, Vice President Dan Quayle also played with Mr. Clinton's call for a new covenant. "It is not a new covenant," Mr. Quayle said. "It is a new cover-up for the failed liberalism of the past. Don't be fooled by slick politicians. We want the real thing, and that's George Bush."
Mr. Bush's speech, which drew two standing ovations and much flag waving, was an exercise in minimizing the Administration's disappointments on the economy and presenting the President as the heir to President Ronald Reagan's conservative policies -- a mantle that Mr. Bush's conservative critics say he does not deserve.
The Bush campaign, for example, said today that Mr. Clinton "unabashedly proposes the largest tax increase in American history, at least $150 billion over four years."
That assertion is at best questionable. The tax increase signed by Mr. Bush in 1990, breaking his 1988 "read my lips" pledge, might actually have been larger. It was $137 billion over five years.
Moreover, the largest tax increase ever enacted was signed by Mr. Reagan in 1982. It raised taxes by a net of $214 billion over five years, Senate Budget Committee figures show.
While the Democrats have proposed a $150 billion tax increase over four years, Mr. Clinton is also proposing offsetting tax cuts -- for middle-income families or families with children, for the working poor and for businesses. According to calculations by the Senate Budget Committee, these tax cuts would total about $58 billion. Thus, Mr. Clinton is proposing a net tax increase over four years of about $92 billion.
 
Question of Credibility
 Mr. Clinton, campaigning today in Iowa, said that Mr. Bush was a candidate with "no credibility" and that the American people would not believe White House assertions that a Democratic victory would lead to higher taxes and soaring spending.
"It can't stick; the American people can't believe a guy with this kind of record," the Democratic nominee said. "They're not going to do it."
The President has been trying to take the offensive against the Democrats in recent days, peppering his speeches with criticism of Mr. Clinton's policies on health care, military spending, abortion and education. As as he wound up a two-day trip to New York, Nevada and Colorado, Mr. Bush was clearly turning up the heat significantly in the hope of lending some momentum to his campaign.
But even in the Rocky Mountain West, a traditional Republican stronghold, the President was facing bad news: The Denver Post published a poll, taken July 20-26 among 501 registered voters in Colorado, that showed Mr. Clinton leading by 47 percent to Mr. Bush's 22 percent. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
The Colorado Springs Gazette-Telegraph, which generally takes a conservative editorial stance, warned the President today: "Running as a me-too Republican content with making a few minor adjustments to the status quo will almost guarantee your defeat in November. You might as well not run."
In the face of this political pressure -- and the rumors about his physical health -- Mr. Bush appeared more good-humored, self-deprecating, energetic, angrier and confident today.
In a radio interview here the President said the Republican lawmakers, editorialists and columnists who have been suggesting he quit the race "can go jump in a lake."
 
Saving the 'C' Word
 In his speech to the lawmakers, Mr. Bush never mentioned Mr. Clinton by name, saying he would "save the 'C' word for our convention in Houston," and at one point even calling him "my nameless opponent." But today that came off as an attempt to make Mr. Bush's awkward habit of not being willing to call his opponents by name seem disarming and not a sign of timidity, as it had in past months.
"I have been blamed for everything except that crazy scoring system that was used in the Olympic boxing competition," Mr. Bush said. As the audience cheered and waved American flags, he added, "I am tired of being slugged by these people, and I will fight back and I will win this election."
Saying he had "been a little slow to fight back," Mr. Bush declared, "My opponent has mentioned my name about once every five seconds, not always in the most flattering light, and I still haven't even said his name in full."
Smiling broadly, he added, "I've referred occasionally to 'my opponent,' 'the other guy,' and even 'the Governor of a certain state with a profitable chicken industry on the Mississippi River located somewhere between Texas and Oklahoma.' "
Arkansas is east of Oklahoma. The only thing between Oklahoma and Texas, where Mr. Bush lived for 25 years and still maintains residency, is the Red River and a few sandbars.
Mr. Bush also complained that he had been unfairly criticized when he returned Mr. Clinton's fire. "Every time I tiptoe into the water with this guy, they start yelling 'negative campaigning,' " he said. "I am going to fight back, and I will define his record as he has ill-defined mine."

HEADLINE: Jobless-Benefit Claims Soar Because of G.M. Shutdown

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
First-time claims for unemployment benefits soared to a 10-year high in late July, mostly because of a two-week shutdown at the General Motors Corporation's auto plants, the Labor Department said today.
Government figures showed that 469,000 people filed initial claims for state jobless benefits in the week ended July 25, up from 400,000 for the week before. The report showed the highest one-week rise since January 1982. 
 New claims were concentrated in seven states hit hard by auto layoffs after G.M. idled 270,000 workers. Without those layoffs, the labor market was little changed, economists said.
"The bottom line is the labor market is stagnant," said Carl Palash, an economist at MCM Moneywatch.
The number of people actually receiving jobless benefits has steady remained at 3.28 million for a month, he said. That suggests July unemployment data, due on Friday, will offer few signs of an improving economy.
Wall Street economists forecast that on average 119,000 jobs were created in July, which may push the unemployment rate down a notch to 7.7 percent.
But most of the gain will come from a Federal summer jobs program for young people, rather than from new permanent positions, they said.
And next week's weekly jobless claims figures are expected to be inflated again by G.M. layoffs as 110,000 more Michigan auto workers show up in Aug. 8 claims data. Processing delays excluded that state's figures from this week's data.
G.M. said it expected 200,000 workers to seek benefits during the two-week layoff, including the 110,000 in Michigan who have yet to be counted. Of the remaining 90,000, one-third reflect seasonal trends that are factored out of the data.
For four weeks, initial jobless claims have averaged 423,250, up from 410,000 in the four-week period before, the department said.
The depressed jobs market is detracting from consumer confidence in the economy, causing huge political difficulties for President Bush in his re-election campaign.
Temporary factors are expected to distort jobs data for several months. Even so, economists see little hope for a significant upswing in the jobs market before the election.
Ohio, Indiana, New York, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Delaware and Louisiana led the increases in jobless claims in the July 25 week, and they attributed it to the rise to auto layoffs.
North Carolina reported a 11,387 drop in new claims due to fewer apparel, textile and furniture industry layoffs.
Tennessee's new claims fell by 8,160 and a drop in layoffs in food processing, rubber, leather goods and clothing was cited. Alabama and Georgia said there were fewer layoffs in the textile and clothing industries. Their new claims fell by 7,168 and 5,191, respectively, the department said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Quiet Trading; Jobless Report Is Awaited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly lower yesterday in quiet trading as currency dealers awaited the data on July unemployment.
Gold prices declined worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $349 an ounce, down 20 cents from late Wednesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted gold at $349.50 an ounce, off $3.50. 
 Currency dealers said the market shrugged off the weekly jobless-claims report. It said claims for unemployment benefits soared by 69,000 in late July -- the biggest one-week jump in more than a decade -- but analysts said this reflected a two-week shutdown by General Motors.
Earl I. Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said most dealers were awaiting the July unemployment report due out today. The currency markets keep a close watch on unemployment figures because they provide a good reading on the health of the economy. If unemployment worsens, the Federal Reserve is more likely to lower interest rates to help jump-start the economic recovery, a move that could hurt the value of the United States dollar.
In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar closed at 127.53 Japanese yen, up from 127.30 yen on Wednesday. The dollar traded at 127.70 yen in London, and at 127.65 yen in New York, up from 127.55 yen Wednesday.
The dollar turned mixed against the British pound. Sterling fetched $1.9080 in London, down from $1.9135 on Wednesday, and $1.9150 in New York, up from $1.9075.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.4775 German marks, down from 1.4815 German marks; 1.3265 Swiss francs, down from 1.3300; 4.9915 French francs, down from 5.0050; 1,117.25 Italian lire, down from 1,120.00, and 1.8505 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18375.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday, were: 1.4815 German marks, up from 1.4775; 1.3305 Swiss francs, up from 1.3240; 5.0060 French francs, up from 4.9889; 1.6705 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6655; 1,120.25 Italian lire, up from 1,116.75.

HEADLINE: $291.8 Million Bond Offering

 BODY:
The Lower Colorado River Authority, Texas, is selling $291.8 million of bonds to finance the refunding of debt securities previously sold when interest rates were higher.
Underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company said interest and principal payments on all of the bonds, with the exception of an issue due in 2015, were protected by insurance policies from the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company and Financial Security Assurance. 
 Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation have each given the insured bonds a triple-A rating. Moody's rated the one uninsured issue A-1, while S.& P. rated it A.
For a long maturity, term bonds due in 2015 and 2017 are both priced to yield from 6.175 percent, while a bond due in 2012 is priced to yield 6.125 percent. Investors interested in shorter maturities are being offered serial bonds with yields that range from 4.50 percent in 1997 to 5.35 percent in 2002 and 5.8 percent in 2007.
Besides the straight interest-bearing bonds, the financing also includes capital-appreciation bonds, or zero-coupon bonds, which pay no interest, but if held to maturity will yield from 5.75 percent for a bond due in 2002 to 6.3 percent in 2012 and 2013. These securities are priced at a discount, with investors paying from $284.08 to $590.62 per $1,000 face amount of bonds.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
First There Was Camp; Now There's Cheese

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
TO teen-agers and members of the 20-something generation, Cheese isn't simply something that comes on top of a pizza or burger; it's an esthetic concept, what Camp was to an earlier generation in the 60's.
Barry Manilow is Cheese. Pat Sajak is Cheese. Donny Osmond is Cheese. Lime-green shag carpeting is Cheese. Wide-bodied neckties are Cheese. Bill Murray's sleazy lounge-lizard impersonation is Cheese. Disco music is Cheese. 
 This usage of the word -- meaning "outdated or unfashionable enough to be brought back or imitated," according to Sol Steinmetz, the executive editor of Random House dictionaries -- hasn't made it into the dictionaries' current editions, although editors are collecting citations for possible inclusion in the future.
Some people say the new usage of Cheese derives from "cheesy" -- a term that, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, dates back to the 1890's, meaning "inferior, second-rate, cheap and nasty." Others point out Cheese's affinities with Cheez Whiz, the popular processed cheese product, which was introduced in 1953.
"It's a parody of really corny stuff," says Harper Simon, 19 years old, a student at Berklee College of Music in Boston. "Cheese started out being sort of mean-spirited, hostile like the hippies were to Middle America. It was a way of mocking the lame sort of conservative, blatantly superficial products of American mass-media culture. It was a way of putting a spin on it, parodying it. The problem is, people started to take Cheese seriously. They're not saying anymore it's so bad, it's a joke. People have gone to saying, "I really like it" -- or pretending that they do."
Hence, the bizarre popularity on college campuses today of television reruns of "Gilligan's Island" and "The Brady Bunch." The latter, a cloying, gooily sentimental sitcom from the early 1970's, has even spawned a stage show called "The Real Live Brady Bunch" (in which actors perform the original television scripts) that has enjoyed long runs in several cities and a book called "Growing Up Brady" (a Harper Perennial book by Barry Williams, who played Greg on the original television show) that has been on the New York Times paperback best-seller list for 12 weeks.
Other 70's phenomena that you thought -- or wished -- were dead and gone forever have also staged comebacks. The musical groups the B-52's and Deee-lite affect the kitschy leopard skin and leather outfits of the 70's while singing about hot pants and U.F.O.'s. And comedians like Barry Sobel use "The Brady Bunch," "The Flintstones" and "Hollywood Squares" as touchstones for their acts. Discos and leisure suits are enjoying a renaissance in Los Angeles; Karen Carpenter theme parties and lava lamp parties have become a college fad, and platform shoes and fishnet stockings have resurfaced on fashion designers' runways. Some teen-agers prefer a grungier -- if equally tasteless -- look known as "skank": the look, possibly inspired by heroin addicts, includes grubby, unwashed clothes and dirty, unwashed hair. A company in Los Angeles is even planning to market a product that is supposed to give clean hair the unwashed look.
On the surface, perhaps, there are similarities between today's Cheese and Camp, as defined almost three decades ago by Susan Sontag in a famous essay, "Notes on Camp." Both emphasize style over content, esthetics over morality; both revel in exaggeration, mannerism and artifice. Both are drawn to demode objects and personalities of the near past. Both pivot around a double, ironic sense of things: the serious, straight sense in which, say, Busby Berkeley originally devised his musical numbers versus the insider Camp sense in which modern cognoscenti enjoy the zany excess of his shows; the unintentional cheesiness of the original "Brady Bunch" television show versus the intentional Cheesiness of the stage re-creation.
Both Cheese and Camp are fundamentally unserious and playful.
There are, however, important distinctions between the two concepts, distinctions that underscore some of the changes that have overtaken American culture in recent years. Whereas Ms. Sontag noted that there is a sense in which it is correct to say something is "not marginal enough" to be Camp -- the operas of Richard Strauss can be considered Camp, she wrote, but not those of Wagner -- Cheese gravitates toward the best-known phenomena of pop culture. Whereas Camp is not necessarily bad art -- "some art," Ms. Sontag wrote, "which can be approached as Camp (example: the major films of Louis Feuillade) merits the most serious admiration and study" -- Cheese willfully focuses on the vulgar, the meretricious, the bogus.
Indeed, this is the major difference between Camp and Cheese: Camp tends to be inclusive and generous, whereas Cheese tends to be judgmental, cynical and detached. "Camp taste is a kind of love, love for human nature," Ms. Sontag wrote. "It relishes, rather than judges, the little triumphs and awkward intensities of 'character.' . . . Camp taste identifies with what it is enjoying. People who share this sensibility are not laughing at the thing they label as 'a camp,' they're enjoying it. Camp is a tender feeling."
This is not true of Cheese, a more mean-spirited, mocking esthetic. Whereas Camp is someone trying to impersonate Marilyn Monroe or Judy Garland out of a sense of identification, Cheese is someone imitating Donny Osmond or Barry Manilow out of a sense of satire and contempt.
"My generation is nihilistic," says Jenny Lyn Bader, a writer who graduated from Harvard in 1990. "Cheese is having fun with bad taste. It's saying I can be good at making fun of something bad instead of trying to be good. Trying to be good is scary; it's easier to parody Donny Osmond. I think it's a reaction to growing up with the bad art of the 70's and the terrible values of the 80's. We had very few musical or political leaders to identify with. There was no cultural center. We didn't have idols like Elvis; I didn't even know who he was the day he died. We didn't even have an Elvis equivalent."
Irony, cynicism and Cheese humor are the dominant responses of this generation, which grew up on disco music and movies like "Saturday Night Fever" (1977), "National Lampoon's Animal House" (1978) and "Conan the Barbarian" (1982). It's a passive, reactive stance that unlike the avant-garde movements that have sprung up in the past in reaction to a philistine status quo, generates no original art of its own; instead, it contents itself with putting down or making fun of the surrounding culture.
"The generation that was fed Cheese seriously is now taking Cheese ironically," says Tracy Reiner, an actress and writer, who is 28. "We didn't want to take seriously all the stuff we'd been fed as kids. All the stuff they told you about there being a new and better way to the future -- it was basically a lie."
The generation that grew up in a world seemingly filled with intractable problems (racial tensions, ecological threats, AIDS, unemployment and huge budget deficits) is skeptical about the possibility of change, and its diminished expectations have shaped an esthetic that's suspicious of sincerity and wary of making commitments, emotional, political or artistic. Purveyors and consumers of Cheese tend to regard any manifestation of high seriousness (like Ingmar Bergman's "Seventh Seal," which is parodied in "Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey") as a potential target. Earnest if self-absorbed "me generation" pleas for understanding -- the sort found in tell-all biographies and talk-show confessions -- are ripe for mockery as well.
Cheese, then, is an esthetic pervaded with irony; and in recent years, its ethos of detachment has seeped into mainstream culture. It's perhaps most noticeable in artworks that are little but recyclings or comments on earlier creations. The creators of movies like "The Addams Family," "Dick Tracy" and the "Batman" films spend millions of dollars to turn old cartoon and comic-strip characters into big-screen extravaganzas. Madonna gives reprises of the likes of Monroe and Dietrich in her videos and shows, sending up their personas even as she capitalizes on their fame. And post-modernist writers -- from Kathy Acker to Robert Coover to Donald Barthelme -- revive and reinvent the likes of Don Quixote, Pinocchio and Snow White as a means of satirizing the contemporary world.
In some cases, the spoofing of earlier art forms is gentle and nostalgic, as in the long-running Off Broadway show "Forever Plaid," which re-creates the musical world of the Four Aces and Perry Como. In other cases -- as in Ms. Acker's "Don Quixote" -- the satire is more pointed. Either way, the artist abdicates responsibility for creating genuinely original material, instead taking on the role of a commentator or critic, standing apart from his or her creation, and inviting the audience to share this detachment with a coy wink.
This attitude of detachment also animates cult television shows like "Moonlighting" (which allowed Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd to address the audience with comical, exasperated asides) and "Twin Peaks" (which parodied soap operas while at the same time exploiting their conventions). It's there in the performances of actors like Bill Murray and Chevy Chase, who always act as though they're a bit astonished to find themselves in whatever role they're playing. And it's there in "Late Night With David Letterman," which puts quotation marks of mild bemusement around everything it does -- from Stupid Pet Tricks to Dave's Top 10 lists. Occasionally, the humor on the show is patronizing: asking ordinary, unsophisticated people to give their opinions to an audience of smug, willfully hip New Yorkers; more often it is simply stupid, like crushing bowling balls in a hydraulic press or dropping objects off tall buildings.
A similarly moronic humor animates such recent hit movies as "Wayne's World," "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" and "Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey" -- films that feature pairs of teen-age boys who try to outdo one another in idiocy. Bill and Ted, who have also inspired a television show, "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures," on the Fox network, call Socrates "Sock-rates," while Wayne and his friend Garth spend their time coining cute euphemisms for throwing up. The movies trade on knowing, snide references to such popular culture phenomena as Grey Poupon mustard ads, "The Exorcist" and assorted heavy-metal bands; indeed, the films assume the audiences' familiarity with People magazine trivia the way serious literature once assumed a reader's familiarity with the classics.
To some longtime observers of Cheese, movies like "Bill and Ted" represent the decline of Cheese, evidence that its adversarial impulses have been co-opted by the mainstream commercial culture it originally poked fun at. "It's done a 360," says Harper Simon, "like everything else that starts out hip and becomes embraced by Middle American culture."
Like other manifestations of Cheese, movies like "Bill and Ted" play to audiences' feelings of superiority, and in inviting audiences to laugh at their dimwitted heroes, the films, in effect, mock themselves, eschew responsibility for their own inanity and bad taste. It's a stance not unlike the "bad faith" defined by Sartre in "Being and Nothingness," a stance in which a person steps outside himself, thereby relinquishing his subjectivity, his freedom, and his responsibility for decision making.
In the end, this Cheese attitude toward the world is cynical and defensive. Its message is, hey, I'm cool, you're cool and we won't endanger our coolness by ever admitting to a genuine emotion or serious ambition. We won't try to come up with an alternative to the trashy culture we see around us; we'll simply make fun of it by showing we can be trashy, too.
The result is entertainment that's safe, nihilistic and disposable. Processed cheese with a bad aftertaste.

HEADLINE: Review/Film: Unforgiven;
A Western Without Good Guys

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
TIME has been good to Clint Eastwood. If possible, he looks even taller, leaner and more mysteriously possessed than he did in Sergio Leone's seminal "Fistful of Dollars" a quarter of a century ago. The years haven't softened him. They have given him the presence of some fierce force of nature, which may be why the landscapes of the mythic, late 19th-century West become him, never more so than in his new "Unforgiven."
As written by David Webb Peoples and directed by Mr. Eastwood, "Unforgiven" is a most entertaining western that pays homage to the great tradition of movie westerns while surreptitiously expressing a certain amount of skepticism. Mr. Eastwood has learned a lot from his mentors, including the great Don Siegel ("Two Mules for Sister Sara" and "The Beguiled," among others), a director with no patience for sentimentality. 
 The time is the 1880's. The principal setting is Big Whiskey, a forlorn hamlet in that vast American no-man's land of high plains edged by mountains, somewhere between St. Louis and San Francisco but not on any map.
Late one night a couple of cowboys are on the second floor of the saloon with the girls. Suddenly one of the cowboys whips out his knife and slashes the face of Delilah, the prostitute he's with. It seems that she made a rude comment about his anatomy. Instead of arresting the cowboys, Little Bill Daggett, the sheriff, allows them to get off with the understanding that they hand over six horses to the saloon keeper.
Strawberry Alice, the victim's best friend, is outraged. "We may be whores," she says, "but we aren't horses." Alice, Delilah and the other girls pool their savings and offer a bounty of $1,000 to anybody who will murder the cowboys.
Thus "Unforgiven" becomes an epic about the revenge of whores. It's not sending up the women. Rather it's equating Old Western codes of honor with the handful of men who set out to collect the bounty, motivated in varying degrees by economic necessity, greed and half-baked notions of glory.
Chief among the bounty hunters is the aging Bill Munny (Mr. Eastwood), a widower trying to support his two young children on an unsuccessful hog farm. Munny has been keeping to himself in recent years. He's still trying to live down his notorious career as a gun-crazy outlaw, a man who used to shoot women, children -- anybody -- just for the hell of it.
There is something creepy about him now, especially about the way he keeps harping on how his wife "saved" him, his distaste for violence and his need to be true to his pledge never to pick up a gun again. He has something of the manner of the mild-mannered clerk who comes into the office on Monday morning and shoots everyone in sight.
When a young fellow who styles himself the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) asks Munny to join him to win the bounty, Munny at first refuses. Then he changes his mind, apparently because he is desperately hard up, but with Munny you can't be sure. Along the way to Big Whiskey, they are joined by Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), who rode with Munny in the outlaw days and appears to trust him.
Also en route to Big Whiskey for the same purpose is English Bob (Richard Harris). He's a dandyish former outlaw who, when first seen, is aboard a train, reading about the assassination of President James A. Garfield and explaining to anyone who will listen why America would be better off with a king. His admiring companion is W. W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek), whom English Bob introduces as "my biographer," the author of a penny dreadful about the outlaw titled "The Duke of Death."
Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) is ready for the bounty hunters as they arrive in Big Whiskey. He immediately spots English Bob as he gets off the stagecoach, gives him a sadistic beating and throws him in jail. Mr. Harris, who has a tendency to overpower his roles, has never been finer, funnier or more restrained than he is as English Bob, whom Daggett insists on calling "the Duck of Death."
Things turn far darker with the arrival of Munny, Ned and the Schofield Kid. Daggett suspects their purpose but is unable to prove anything. Just to let them know who runs Big Whiskey, Daggett beats up Munny as savagely as he has English Bob, but Munny appears to ask for it. Bleeding and only partly conscious, he crawls out of the saloon and into a muddy gutter.
It is a measure of how the film works that Munny's almost Christ-like acceptance of his beating is one of the film's scariest moments. There is a madness inside him waiting to emerge, but where and when? "Unforgiven," which has no relation to "The Unforgiven," the 1960 John Huston western, never quite fulfills the expectations it so carefully sets up. It doesn't exactly deny them, but the bloody confrontations that end the film appear to be purposely muted, more effective theoretically than dramatically.
This, I suspect, is a calculated risk. Mr. Eastwood doesn't play it safe as a director, but there are times in "Unforgiven," as in his jazz epic, "Bird," that the sheer scope of the narrative seems to overwhelm him. It's not easy cramming so much information into a comparatively limited amount of time. Toward the end of "Bird," he didn't seem to be telling the story of Charlie Parker as much as letting it unravel. That doesn't happen in "Unforgiven," but the tone, so self-assured to begin with, becomes loaded with qualifications.
The film looks great, full of broad chilly landscapes and skies that are sometimes as heavy with portents as those in something by El Greco. It's corny but it works.
Photographed by Jack N. Green, who was the camera operator for Bruce Surtees, Mr. Eastwood's cinematographer for "Pale Rider," "Unforgiven" favors the kind of backlighting that can add a sense of desolation and menace to even the most conventional moments. Seen against a bright background, faces turned to the camera are so hidden in shadow that they aren't immediately recognizable. It is a storyteller's gesture for the audience's benefit, since the other characters within the scene would not be so disadvantaged.
The cast is splendid, though some of the actors have more to do than others, including Mr. Freeman, whose role is not especially demanding. Mr. Hackman delights as Sheriff Daggett: no more Mr. Good Guy. Also worthy of particular note are Mr. Woolvett, who makes his feature film debut as the unreliable Schofield Kid; Mr. Rubinek as a city journalist out of his element out West, and Frances Fisher as Strawberry Alice, a woman who doesn't know when to shut up.
Yet the center of attention, from the moment he rises up out of a hog pen until the darkest fade-out in western movie history, is Mr. Eastwood. This is his richest, most satisfying performance since the underrated, politically lunatic "Heartbreak Ridge." There's no one like him.
"Unforgiven" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has a lot of violence, vulgar language and some sexual situations.

HEADLINE: Pound Foolish on Census Data

 BODY:
Census trends and economics statistics make for eye-glazing conversation. Yet they are vitally important to policy makers, scholars, corporate executives and anyone else trying to make sense of the economy. That's why the House and Senate budget bills are alarming: They propose making deep cuts in the Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis, agencies in charge of keeping statistical tabs on the U.S.
The cuts would be shortsighted. Collection of data on leading indicators that predict recoveries and recessions, and on foreign investment and other vital topics, would have to be eliminated or curtailed. The cuts threaten projects to analyze the 1990 census and improve the next census, for example, by overcoming the systematic undercount of minorities. 
 The U.S. needs better economic barometers, not truncated ones. Current statistics provide misleading snapshots of the economy by overemphasizing the once-dominant manufacturing sector and neglecting newly emerging service sectors. And the data are out of line with international convention, making comparisons impossible.
Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has led a movement to beef up data collection, and the Administration has proposed budget increases to do so. But appropriations committees proposed sizable cuts, leaving the budgets too low by $40 to $60 million.
The money would not be hard to find in less important parts of the Commerce budget. It could be generated, for example, by imposing small fees for subsidized loans from the Small Business Administration or requiring banks to pick up a larger share of losses on such loans.
It makes no sense, after spending more than $2.5 billion to conduct the 1990 census, to now refuse money to make the data usable. Good data are vital to good business decisions and good policy making.

HEADLINE: Not Tough Enough With Serbia

 BODY:
President Bush, under pressure from Bill Clinton and public opinion, has quickened his response to the carnage in the Balkans. He will ask the United Nations to authorize military protection for deliveries of food and medicine. That's commendable but hardly enough to end the savagery.
Bosnia is being overrun by Serbian-sponsored terrorists. Its cities are being shelled and starved into submission. Its people are being routed from their homes, shot at as they flee, even as they bury their dead. Reports say thousands are being herded into concentration camps. 
 But the world so far declines to defend democratic Bosnia's territorial integrity the way it did feudal Kuwait's. Mr. Bush needs to mobilize reluctant European allies to face down Serbia with a credible threat of collective military force.
Yesterday the Administration announced several steps besides seeking to protect humanitarian deliveries. It upgraded U.S. diplomatic relations with Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia. And it called for tighter international enforcement of economic sanctions against Serbia, dispatch of international civilian monitors to other threatened Balkan areas and consultations with NATO allies.
What's still conspicuously missing is a Security Council resolution that would brand Serbian aggression a threat to international security, demand full restoration of Bosnia's sovereignty and borders and authorize military force, if necessary, to insure compliance. Enforcement of such a resolution might best be delegated to NATO, which has sufficient forces already in the region.
There are risks in such an ultimatum. Air strikes alone might not be enough to silence Serbian guns. Bombing Serbian airfields and military installations would inflict pain but still might fall short. And the prospects for any ground fighting would have to be weighed carefully; a ground war would likely be more prolonged and cost many more allied casualties than did the U.N. coalition's war against Iraq.
But military force is now necessary to contemplate. Winking at Serbian aggression would betray Bosnia, and with it the professed values of civilized nations everywhere. Serbia would be emboldened to carve up other nearby territories. And success for its "ethnic cleansing" strategy would encourage like-minded demagogues to pursue ethnic wars from the Baltic to the Caucasus.
The world does not lack military options for defending Bosnia. What it lacks is the political will to deploy them. Washington alone is capable of galvanizing an effective international response. The place to begin is with the United Nations Security Council. The time is now.
