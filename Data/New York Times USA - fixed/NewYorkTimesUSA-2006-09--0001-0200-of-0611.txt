READING OF 'STUFF HAPPENS' George W. Bush (or at least someone playing him) comes to Central Park in David Hare's investigation of America's run-up to war. It runs for one free performance on Wednesday (2:30). Delacorte Theater in Central Park, (212) 539-8750.

Broadway

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'KIKI AND HERB: ALIVE ON BROADWAY' This transcendental lounge act -- made up of Kiki (Justin Bond), a molting songbird for all seasons, and Herb (Kenny Mellman), her happily suffering shadow and accompanist -- has the heat and dazzle of great balls of fire. Vital, funny and surprisingly affecting (2:00). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'CREATION: A CLOWN SHOW' Lucas Caleb Rooney is a cross between Red Skelton and Will Ferrell in this sweet, funny, poignant mostly one-man show about the biblical story of earth's first seven days (1:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)

'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'MR. DOOLEY'S AMERICA' Martin J. Dooley, the wisest fictional pub owner in 1890's Chicago, brings his old newspaper columns back to life with funny, surprisingly timely issues-of-the-day commentary in this likable two-man play (1:40). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Gates)

'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

* 'SEVEN GUITARS' (2:45). Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)

'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

Spectacles

'ABSINTHE' Think Cirque du Soleil as channeled through ''Rocky Horror'' and painted by George Grosz. Part cabaret, part circus, ''Absinthe'' aims at a kind of seedy decadence that's mingled with the simple, aw-shucks wonder of knife-jugglers, sword-swallowers and a man creating constructions out of soap bubbles. It's the main event at the Spiegeltent, a vintage European tradition visiting South Street Seaport this summer (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette)

'REVEREND BILLY AND THE CHURCH OF STOP-SHOPPING' Reverend Billy (a k a the performance artist Bill Talen) struts and preaches his way across the Spiegeltent stage accompanied by a choir and a fine seven-piece band. Radical political theater has rarely been more thoughtful or fun (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (George Hunka)

Long-Running Shows

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). 2005 New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron District, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)

'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' Another excavation of what seems to have become Broadway's favorite musical terrain -- call it Scamalot, where con men are king (see ''The Producers''). Now starring Keith Carradine and Brian D'Arcy James as the mismatched swindlers (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

'EVERYTHINGS TURNING INTO BEAUTIFUL' Seth Zvi Rosenfeld's thrill-free demi-musical about a pair of commitment-wary songwriters (Daphne Rubin-Vega and Malik Yoba) is clearly intended to progress from wintry loneliness to heated confrontation and eroticism. But it remains stolidly at room temperature. Directed by Carl Forsman, with songs by Jimmie James (1:50). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Brantley)

'INDIAN BLOOD' As slight as it is sweet, A. R. Gurney's latest is like a snow globe for the stage, in this case a memento of wintry Buffalo in the mid-1940's. Written with delicacy and old-school craftsmanship, the work is a modest memory play endowed with a measure of emotional heft by its unchallenged but unusually strong cast, which includes John McMartin and Rebecca Luker (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)

* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

'MOTHER COURAGE AND HER CHILDREN' If you ever wanted to watch one willowy human being lift a 12-ton play onto her shoulders and hold it there for hours, even as her muscles buckle, join the line to see Meryl Streep burning energy like a supernova in this otherwise less-than-stunning production. Directed by George C. Wolfe, from a new translation by Tony Kushner (2:30). Delacorte Theater, Central Park, (212) 539-8750; free; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director, John Doyle, aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'ACCEPTED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A clever slacker and his oddball crew invent a phony college in this passable example of that oxymoronic genre, the Hollywood comedy about sticking it to the man. (Nathan Lee)

* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)

'THE ANT BULLY' (PG, 90 minutes) A young boy goes to live among the ants, who talk remarkably like Academy Award-winning actors. (Scott)

'BARNYARD' (PG, 88 minutes) The barnyard animals in this crude 3-D animation walk, talk and party down like human beings. Way too often the male ''cows,'' as the film calls them, also flash their udders. (Manohla Dargis)

'THE BEALES OF GREY GARDENS' (No rating, 90 minutes) The Maysles brothers dig into their archives for this collection of outtakes from ''Grey Gardens,'' their 1975 cinema verite classic about the most fascinating cat ladies in the Hamptons. Essential viewing for drag queens. ( Lee)

'BEERFEST' (R, 110 minutes) In ''Beerfest,'' a gaseous celebration of binge drinking and family honor, the five comedians known collectively as Broken Lizard head for Munich and an underground beer-guzzling contest. Best viewed while sloshed, the movie is idiotic, tasteless and irrepressibly good-natured -- in other words, a frat-house classic. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, ''Boynton Beach Club'' is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Stephen Holden)

'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)

* 'THE BRIDESMAID' (No rating, 110 minutes, in French) The great Claude Chabrol again takes up a sharp instrument and directs it at one of his favorite targets, the family. Yet while his aim remains true, his touch has become gentler, more forgiving. (Dargis)

'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt- putt-putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)

'THE CELESTINE PROPHECY' (PG, 100 minutes) A delectable fusion of new age babble and luridly bad filmmaking based on the best-selling book by James Redfield. (Dargis)

* 'CHANGING TIMES' (No rating, 95 minutes, in French and Arabic) Gerard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star in Andre Techine's rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Tangier. A half-dozen skillfully interwoven subplots create a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. (Holden)

'CLERKS II' (R, 98 minutes) More than a decade later, Kevin Smith's New Jersey underachievers have moved from a convenience store to a fast-food franchise. The humor is reliably filthy and frequently hilarious, and the filmmaking is a few steps above rudimentary, but the movie's poignant sweetness is disarming. It has a dirty mind, but its heart is remarkably pure. (Scott)

'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)

'CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WOMEN' (No rating, 84 minutes) Two old flames meet, years after parting, and have a short fling. An arch, banal conceit, of some interest for Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter's performances and the split-screen gimmick that keeps them apart even in their intimate moments. (Scott)

'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)

* 'THE DESCENT' (R, 99 minutes) A total horror freakout from the British writer and director Neil Marshall about six women on a caving expedition who meet their fears and some scary monsters, too. (Dargis)

'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)

* 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis)

'FRATRICIDE' (No rating, 96 minutes, in Kurdish, German and Turkish) The familiar story of the innocent soul who travels from the country to the big, bad city receives a thorough workout from the Turkish-born German-transplant Yilmaz Arslan. If the human disembowelment via a pit bull doesn't bum you out, the child rape should do the trick. (Dargis)

* 'GABRIELLE' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chereau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haut-bourgeois Parisian marriage, around 1912. (Dargis)

* 'HALF NELSON' (R, 107 minutes) In their beautiful bummer about the relationship between a white teacher (Ryan Gosling) and a black student (Shareeka Epps), the gifted young director Ryan Fleck and his writing partner, Anna Boden, offer a lament for the radical fires of the 1960's and a suggestion for life and politics after the new left. (Dargis)

* 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)

'HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS' (PG, 98 minutes) The worms go in, the worms go out, but mostly the worms go into the frying pan in Bob Dolman's engaging and yucky adaptation of the Thomas Rockwell book. (Dargis)

* 'HOUSE OF SAND' (R, 115 minutes, in Portuguese) Beautifully shot in a sandy, remote corner of northern Brazil, this film tells the story of three generations of women, all of them played by Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres, mother and daughter in real life and two of the national treasures of Brazilian cinema. (Scott)

'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) Andre Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a Andre 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis)

* 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden)

'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. While Disney piles on the uplift, the director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis)

'LADY IN THE WATER' (PG-13, 108 minutes) In this watchable folly, Paul Giamatti plays a building manager who encounters a menagerie of otherworldly creatures, most important Bryce Dallas Howard's water nymph. The writer and director M. Night Shyamalan wants us to believe, mostly in the myth of his own genius. (Dargis)

'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Lee)

* 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)

'LOL' (No rating, 81 minutes) The inability to connect in a hyper-wired world is old news given fresh voice in this tragicomic indie about the way we live -- or rather, about the way white, urban, heterosexual circuit boys are failing to live. (Lee)

'MATERIAL GIRLS' (PG, 97 minutes) The real-life sisters Hilary and Haylie Duff star in this incompetent spin on the poor-little-rich-girl story from, alas, Martha Coolidge. (Dargis)

* 'MIAMI VICE' (R, 133 minutes) This updating of the 1980's television series cost more than the annual budget of the real-life Miami Police Department, making it the most expensive experimental art film ever made. (Scott)

* 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. A trio of intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott)

'MY COUNTRY, MY COUNTRY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Arabic, English and Kurdish) Filmed in Iraq from June 2004 to February 2005, ''My Country, My Country'' views the prelude to the January elections primarily through the eyes of Dr. Riyadh, a Sunni candidate and physician who runs a free clinic in Baghdad. Without comment but with unusual sensitivity, the director, Laura Poitras, exposes the emotional toll of occupation on Iraqis and United States soldiers alike, leaving us feeling that this particular mission is far from accomplished. (Catsoulis)

* 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)

'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST' (PG-13, 151 minutes) Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott)

* 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)

'PRINCESAS' (No rating, 109 minutes, in Spanish) This maudlin melodrama about prostitutes in Madrid is not, alas, the new film by Pedro Almodovar, but a dilution of his manner by the writer-director Fernando Leon de Aranoa. (Lee)

'PULSE' (PG-13, 87 minutes) Evil technology menaces idiotic teenagers in this cynical remake of a Japanese horror film. (Lee)

'QUEENS' (No rating, 107 minutes, in Spanish) A dithering but generous Spanish farce, ''Queens'' follows the forthcoming nuptials of three gay couples by focusing on their overbearing mothers. While the sons dance, bicker and fret over antiques, the mamas express their discomfort with the wedding plans by seducing inappropriate men. Despite obvious nods to Pedro Almodovar, ''Queens'' is notable only for its unadulterated worship of middle-aged women. (Catsoulis)

'THE QUIET' (R, 96 minutes) Neither ambitious enough to take seriously nor sleazy enough to enjoy, Jamie Babbit's good-girl, bad-girl face-off flirts with the trappings of exploitation cinema without going all the way. (Dargis)

* 'QUINCEANERA' (R, 90 minutes) This portrait of a Mexican-American family living in a Latino neighborhood of Los Angeles is as smart and warm-hearted an exploration of an upwardly mobile immigrant culture as American independent cinema has produced. (Holden)

'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)

* 'SCOOP' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)

'SNAKES ON A PLANE' (R, 105 minutes) Snakes + plane + Samuel L. Jackson. David R. Ellis provides the fine B-movie-style direction while Mr. Jackson supplies the cool and his trademark 13-letter epithet. (Dargis)

'STEP UP' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Ever since Kevin Bacon's rebellious hips ignited a small-town uproar in ''Footloose,'' the modern high school romance has placed a premium on rhythm. In ''Step Up'' a rough Baltimore kid (Channing Tatum), armed only with a killer smile and hip-hop moves, falls for a classically trained dancer (Jenna Dewan). Bland but likable, the movie fashions social equality from big musical numbers. If ballet and hip-hop can coexist, it asks, why can't we all be friends? (Catsoulis)

'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)

'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)

'TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Fast, fun and silly, with Will Ferrell as a Nascar driver, Sacha Baron Cohen as his nemesis, and a new course record for product placements per gallon. (Scott)

'10TH AND WOLF' (R, 110 minutes) A grisly gangster movie with moral pretensions, ''10th and Wolf'' never transcends mobster cliches recycled from ''The Godfather,'' ''Donnie Brasco'' and ''GoodFellas.'' (Holden)

'13 TZAMETI' (No rating, 90 minutes) The flashy black-and-white directorial debut of the Georgian filmmaker Gela Babluani is a sadistic, arty thriller that suggests a French new wave film infected by a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism. (Holden)

'TRUST THE MAN' (R, 101 minutes) A strained, flatulent relationship comedy about two couples, from the writer and director Bart Freundlich. With Julianne Moore, David Duchovny, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Billy Crudup. (Dargis)

* 'WORLD TRADE CENTER' (PG-13, 129 minutes) From Oliver Stone, a return to the emotions of 9/11. Powerful and almost unbearably moving. (Scott)

''Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall'' (1924) is a melodrama about a young 16th-century Englishwoman who angers the queen.

Pop
Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

ALBUM, SWEET ELECTRA (Tonight) Like Mexico City's celebrated Cafe Tacuba, Album, from Monterrey, plays an ingenious and invigorating kind of polyglot art-pop that draws from alternative and psychedelic rock as well as from oompah Mexican music. The band makes its New York debut tonight with Sweet Electra, an electronic act from Guadalajara. At 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Ben Sisario)

* MARIAH CAREY (Sunday) Before there was ''Idol'' there was Mariah, who made octave-hopping melisma a sport and never met a song she couldn't ride to No. 1. Young singers afraid of being a flash in the pan could learn a lot from Ms. Carey's recent comeback, which relied on fresh hip-hop producers and songwriters. With Sean Paul. At 7 p.m. Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $29.50 to $158.50. (Sisario)

CARNIVORE (Wednesday) For fans of obscure New York metal only: before he founded Type O Negative, Peter Steele led Carnivore, one of the most aggressive and, perhaps not coincidentally, offensive bands of the mid-1980's thrash scene. (Typical song title: ''Jesus Hitler.'') The new version of the band does not include any original members besides Mr. Steele. With Annunaki and Eyes of the Dead. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $26 in advance, $29 at the door. (Sisario)

CLIENTELE (Tuesday) This London group is dedicated to pop understatement. It plays introspective, quietly observant mid-60's-style songs that sound as if a stiff breeze or an unkind word could dispel them. With Great Lakes. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Jon Pareles)

BOB DYLAN (Tonight) It might not make sense at first glance that Bob Dylan is playing at minor-league baseball stadiums this summer, but his devotion is on record: this is the third year he has done the tour, and a baseball-themed episode of his XM Satellite Radio show -- in which the singer of ''Masters of War'' and ''Like a Rolling Stone'' does an a cappella ''Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' -- has been added to the archive of the National Baseball Hall of Fame Library. With Jimmie Vaughan, Junior Brown, Elana James and the Continental Two. At 6:30, Dutchess County Stadium, Wappingers Falls, N.Y., (845) 838-0094 or (845) 454-3388, concertstonight.com; $49.50; one child under 12 will be admitted free with each ticket holder. (Sisario)

FAMILY VALUES TOUR (Today and tomorrow) Korn resurrects its tantrum-metal package tour after a four-year absence, with the Deftones, Flyleaf, Stone Sour and the Japanese group Dir En Grey. Today at 2 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698, artscenter.com; tomorrow at 2 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $9.99 to $59.50. (Sisario)

FRENCH KICKS, SOUND TEAM (Wednesday) The new wave gets a twisted revival in the songs of the French Kicks. Bouncing along on keyboards one moment, facing guitar barbs the next, the songs are as unstable as the romances they sketch. Sound Team, from Austin, Tex., constructs dense and psychologically rich songs in which elements of white soul hint at a spiritual nourishment denied by the anxious guitars and brooding vocals. With the Subjects. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario)

GORILLA BISCUITS (Tomorrow and Sunday) The last weeks of CBGB are shaping up as a reunion of the mid-80's class of Hardcore High. This highlight this weekend is Gorilla Biscuits, who were emo before emo was emo: loudly, tunefully and sweatily struggling to keep a positive attitude. Tomorrow at 5:45 p.m., with Murphy's Law, Leeway, Comeback Kid and Sick of Talk, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; Sunday at 3 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com. Both sold out. (Sisario)

JAPANESE NEW MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tomorrow and Sunday) Somebody should have thought of this a long time ago. Three mainstays of the Japanese avant-rock scene are touring as a complete ''festival'' by arranging themselves in eight different permutations of solos, duos and trios. Yoshida Tatsuya, best known as the drummer of the long-running stop-start band the Ruins; Kawabata Makoto, a guitarist who is the main force behind the psychedelic-noise group Acid Mothers Temple; and the bassist Tsuyama Atsushi will be playing in various combinations, calling themselves Acid Mothers Temple SWR, Ruins Alone, Akaten, Zoffy, Zubi Zuva X, Seikazoku, Shrinp Wark and RonRuins. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; Sunday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $15. (Sisario)

MOSQUITOS (Wednesday) Life is but an indie-pop bossa nova dream with the Mosquitos, a New York-Brazil love story now on its third album of breezy melody and twinkling electronics. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario)

NINA NASTASIA (Wednesday) In her clear voice, Nina Nastasia offers visions of desolation and unflinching love -- ''dirty hands and dirty feet and all'' -- with melodies that can hint at the symmetries of Appalachian music and a homespun backup from instruments like accordion and banjo. With Jeffrey Lewis. At 10 p.m., Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Pareles)

'NUBLU: BROOKLYN' (Sunday) Nublu, an Avenue C bar owned by a Turkish saxophonist and home to a variety of Brazilian bands, is a classic New York multicultural incubator. On Sunday six of its signature acts step outside its warmth for a daylong gig beside the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. Forro in the Dark is one of the best and lowest-tech dance bands in the city, playing forro, a humble and sexy two-beat style made with accordion, hand-held percussion and, since this is New York, whiffs of distorted electric guitar. Love Trio features members of Brazilian Girls, a non-Brazilian band that is one of the club's success stories. Kudu plays jazz-flavored electronic dance music, with slithery vocals by Sylvia Gordon. Also on the bill are Karina Zeviani, a sultry singer for Thievery Corporation and other electronic groups; I Led 3 Lives; and the Nublu Orchestra, led by Butch Morris. From 2 to 9 p.m., 400 Carroll Street, between Bond and Nevins Streets, Carroll Gardens, ticketweb.com or nublu.net; $10 tickets available only in advance. (Sisario)

ONE RING ZERO (Thursday) This Brooklyn band has set words by authors like Jonathan Lethem, Margaret Atwood and Rick Moody to kitchen-sink songs with toy piano and theremin. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario)

RATATAT (Tuesday) The two guitarists who make up Ratatat have one simple but sometimes charming idea. They plug away at 70's-inspired riffs, creating atmospheric tracks that split the difference between minimalist post-rock and maximalist hard rock. With Envelopes and Panther. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Kelefa Sanneh)

SHAKIRA, WYCLEF JEAN (Thursday) Their flirty duet ''Hips Don't Lie'' was one of the biggest hits of the summer, perhaps because its odd stabs at political commentary (''Why the C.I.A. wanna watch us?/ Colombians and Haitians/ I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction,'' Mr. Jean raps) are no match for its old-fashioned, steamy body language (''I'm on tonight/ My hips don't lie/ And I am starting to feel you, boy,'' Shakira replies). At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; sold out. (Sisario)

* SHELLAC (Tomorrow) A great advantage of being in a so-called supergroup is that you really don't have to play very often to maintain your reputation. Steve Albini, Todd Trainer and Bob Weston keep very busy running recording sessions and playing in other bands, but every few years they gather to play propulsive, gourmet post-rock as Shellac. A new album is said to be in the works, though with these guys' schedules it could take months, if not years. Also on the bill is Uzeda, a quartet from Sicily with an uncanny grasp of the sound of Chicago avant-rock circa 1995. At 7 p.m., Europa Night Club, 98-104 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, northsix.com; sold out. (Sisario)

TEMPORARY RESIDENCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) Temporary Residence, an independent label in New York, celebrates its 10th anniversary with three nights devoted to its signature sound, a warbling guitar pulse that slowly builds to heights of tragic, cinematic grandeur. The best lineup is tomorrow, with Explosions in the Sky, the label's flagship, from Austin, Tex., and Eluvium, a one-man band that recreates the idyll of floating on clouds with layers of keyboards. Mono, the Japanese band that headlines on Sunday, finds greater turbulence. Envy, tonight, another Japanese group, uses similarly melancholy washes of guitar as a backdrop for guttural shrieks; also tonight is Sleeping People, an instrumental group from San Diego that borrows from the nervous antifunk of 90's groups like Unwound, and Cex, a k a Rjyan Kidwell, a techno wise guy with a laptop. Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $16 (sold out tomorrow). (Sisario)

TO LIVE AND SHAVE IN L.A. (Monday and Wednesday) The line between harsh metal-on-metal noise and abstract musique concrete is deliberately blurred in the music of this long-running collective led by Tom Smith, which on this tour also includes the metal provocateur Andrew W. K., Mark Morgan of the band Sightings, and Don Fleming. Monday at 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; Thursday at 8 p.m., Syrup Room, 100 Ingraham Street, at Porter Avenue, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, toddpnyc.com; $8. (Sisario)

VENOM (Tuesday) In the early 80's, this British band coined the term black metal; it has since been appropriated for a kind of operatic Scandinavian vaudeville, but for Venom it referred to a plodding, mirthless satanism. Riding the wave of ironic affection for all 80's metal, the band is on an unexpected reunion tour. With Goatwhore and Early Man. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25 in advance, $28 at the door. (Sisario)

ROGER WATERS (Wednesday) Two months after the death of Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd's first leader and an inventor of psychedelic rock as well as one of the most famous casualties of its lifestyle, Mr. Waters, billing himself as ''the creative genius of Pink Floyd,'' is touring with a live version of ''The Dark Side of the Moon,'' the band's masterly 1973 concept album about insanity. At 8 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698, artscenter.com; sold out. (Sisario)

Jazz
Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

ERIC ALEXANDER QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) The tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander favors the smart, surging hard bop of the 1950's and 60's.

At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; cover, $25. (Nate Chinen)

BRIAN ALLEN WITH TONY MALABY AND TOM RAINEY (Wednesday) Mr. Allen, an adventurous trombonist, has a new album called ''Synapse'' (Braintone) featuring the tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby and the drummer Tom Rainey. Their mode of expression is ruggedly free-form, but with a high degree of collective sensitivity. At 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)

PATRICIA BARBER (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Barber's verbosity and coolly arch intellectualism are uncommon traits for a jazz singer-songwriter. She's also a good pianist, as she demonstrates in her working band, which features the often impressive guitarist Neal Alger. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30 cover, tonight and tomorrow, $25 Sunday. (Chinen)

DAVID BINNEY'S BALANCE (Tuesday) The alto saxophonist David Binney pursues an avant-gardism that embraces harmony, melody and rhythm, along with amplification; he receives sinuous support from the keyboardist Craig Taborn, the bassist Thomas Morgan and the drummer Dan Weiss. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

BROOKLYN QAWWALI PARTY (Tomorrow) The Sufi devotional music of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan provides a repertory mandate for this sprawling ensemble. Faithful to its source mainly in terms of exuberance, the group creates a roiling polyphony of percussion, saxophones and brass, bass, harmonium and guitar. At 9 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)

CHRIS BYARS OCTET (Sunday) This band led by the tenor saxophonist Chris Byars has a new album, ''Night Owls'' (Smalls), which illustrates the cohesive benefit of a longstanding weekly engagement. A variation of the group appears here, with a front line of Mr. Byars, Jerry Dodgion on alto saxophone, Richie Vitale on trumpet, John Mosca on trombone and Mark Lopeman on baritone saxophone. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $12, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)

RAVI COLTRANE QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) ''In Flux'' (Savoy), Mr. Coltrane's most recent album, marked a milestone: his tenor and soprano saxophone playing never sounded more confident, and his compositions had a sleek modernistic hue. He fronts the same stellar band here as on the album: the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer E. J. Strickland. At 8:30 p.m., Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, schoolforimprov.org; cover, $12. (Chinen)

* CRESCENT CITY CELEBRATION (Tomorrow) The new season at Merkin Concert Hall begins with this tribute to New Orleans, timed to coincide with the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. In addition to a group led by the clarinetist Dr. Michael White, a traditional New Orleans jazz specialist, it will feature the blues-focused pianist Henry Butler and the hip-hop-influenced young trumpeter Maurice Brown. At 8:30 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $35 in advance, $40 tomorrow. (Chinen)

KRIS DAVIS QUARTET (Wednesday) On her solid new album, ''The Slightest Shift'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), Kris Davis applies her keyboard playing and compositions to a smart group consisting of Tony Malaby on tenor saxophone, Eivind Opsvik on bass and Jeff Davis on drums. At 8 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)

DIET COKE WOMEN IN JAZZ FESTIVAL (Monday through Thursday) This monthlong festival of female jazz artists kicks off on Monday and Tuesday with Rene Marie, a soulful jazz singer and vibrant performer with a growing book of original tunes. It continues on Wednesday with Ann Hampton Callaway, a vocalist who makes the most of the overlap between jazz and cabaret. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)

BARRY HARRIS QUINTET (Wednesday and Thursday) A crisp and courtly pianist firmly in the bebop idiom, Barry Harris has a new release, ''Live From New York! Vol. 1,'' on a start-up label called Lineage Records. Here he leads a group featuring the bop-oriented alto saxophonist Charles Davis. Through Sept. 9 at 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

BILLY HART QUARTET (Tuesday and Wednesday) A loose but focused drummer with a sterling resume, Billy Hart fronts the same band featured on his excellent recent HighNote album, with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the pianist Ethan Iverson and the bassist Ben Street. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25. (Chinen)

JOHN HOLLENBECK'S CLAUDIA QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow) This improvising chamber ensemble pursues texturally oriented and often contrapuntal exploration; Mr. Hollenbeck's percussion provides one color on a palette that also includes Chris Speed's clarinet and tenor saxophone, Gary Versace's accordion, John Hebert's bass and Matt Moran's vibraphone. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

CHARLIE HUNTER TRIO (Thursday) Charlie Hunter is a guitarist with a natural affinity for groove, as he has demonstrated with a handful of sturdy bands over the past decade or so. Here he introduces a new one, with Erik Deutsch on keyboards and Simon Lott on drums; they're celebrating the release of a new album, ''Copperopolis'' (Ropeadope). Through Sept. 10 at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20. (Chinen)

JAVON JACKSON QUARTET (Tonight) The tenor saxophonist Javon Jackson continues a soulful streak with his new album, ''Now,'' which Palmetto Records is releasing this month. He is leading a band well suited for that purpose, with David Gilmore on guitar, Kenny Davis on bass and Rudy Royston on drums. At 6 and 7:30 p.m., Rose Center for Earth and Space, American Museum of Natural History, 81st Street between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org; included in suggested museum admission, $14, $10.50 for students, $8 for children. (Chinen)

DONNY McCASLIN GROUP (Sunday) On ''Soar'' (Sunnyside), his most recent album, the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin applies his extroverted style to a Latin American-inspired contemporary fusion; he'll do much the same in this show, benefiting greatly from the contributions of the guitarist Ben Monder, the bassist Hans Glawischnig and the drummer Antonio Sanchez. At 9:30 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

* PAUL MOTIAN, JOE LOVANO, BILL FRISELL (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Motian, a drummer and composer, sets a tone for this blue-chip trio that's shadowy, slippery and as open-ended as a koan; his longtime partners are Joe Lovano, on tenor and soprano saxophones, and Bill Frisell, on guitar. There's no better place to see them than at the Village Vanguard. Through Sept. 17 at 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

NYNDK JAZZ COLLECTIVE (Tuesday) The New York-based trombonist Chris Washburne, the Norwegian saxophonist Ole Mathisen and the Danish pianist Soren Moller formed this pointedly cosmopolitan post-bop collective several years ago; its ranks at this performance include a drummer, Scott Neumann. 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $7, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

JEAN-MICHEL PILC TRIO (Wednesday) Jean-Michel Pilc's piano playing has a joyous bounce no matter how dark or furious the extemporization. He's at his best in the company of assertive partners like the electric bassist Richard Bona and the drummer Ari Hoenig, who will join him. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

* JENNY SCHEINMAN (Monday and Tuesday) As a violist and violinist, Ms. Scheinman often goes for rustic charm, but she never ceases to be an exploratory improviser. She convenes an all-star sextet on Monday, with Ron Miles on trumpet, Don Byron on clarinet, Larry Grenadier on bass, Kenny Wollesen on drums and a pair of playfully pseudonymous associates: ''JaMo'' on piano and ''Moe Hawk'' on guitar. On Tuesday she takes her customary stand in Park Slope, with a smaller group. On Monday at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778, joespub.com; cover, $20, $15 in advance, with a two-drink minimum. On Tuesday at 7 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)

JOHN SCOFIELD REAL JAZZ TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) The guitarist John Scofield has extensive history with the bassist Steve Swallow and the drummer Bill Stewart, and they recently made a superb album at the Blue Note, ''EnRoute'' (Verve). One suspects that the name being applied to the trio here wasn't Mr. Scofield's idea -- would he describe his funkier projects as ''fake jazz''? -- but in any case, their music will be jazz, and powerfully real. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592 bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

MATTHEW SHIPP TRIO (Monday) Matthew Shipp's pianism is often prickly but rarely off-putting, because even his free improvisations tend to follow a faintly linear path. At this show he has strongly intuitive partners in Joe Morris, on bass, and Whit Dickey, on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592 bluenote.net; cover, $15 at tables, $10 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

JEFF (TAIN) WATTS QUARTET (Thursday) Jeff (Tain) Watts, one of the most dazzlingly propulsive drummers to emerge in the last quarter-century, leads a dynamic band: Marcus Strickland, a smart young tenor saxophonist; Lawrence Fields, a pianist; and the bassist Eric Revis, Mr. Watts's rhythm section partner in the Branford Marsalis Quartet. At 10:30 p.m., Metropolitan Room at Gotham, 34 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; cover, $25, plus a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)

DENNY ZEITLIN TRIO (Tonight through Sunday) Denny Zeitlin has an appealing mainstream piano style, influenced by but not beholden to Bill Evans. He has veteran rhythm section partners in Buster Williams, on bass, and Billy Hart, on drums. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., with an midnight set tonight and tomorrow, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

Opera

'LA TRAVIATA' (Tonight) Long respected but not quite in the realm reserved for a few exalted singers, the reliable and sometimes radiant soprano Hei-Kyung Hong is performing as Verdi's Violetta on or near the baseball diamonds of the city's parks. The last ''Traviata'' of the Metropolitan Opera's summer, in which she appears with Wookyung Kim as Alfredo and Charles Taylor as Germont, takes place tonight in New Jersey under the baton of Derrick Inouye. At 8, Brookdale Park, Bloomfield/Montclair, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; free. (Anne Midgette)

'RIGOLETTO' (Tomorrow) Mark Delavan is a slightly controversial figure in the opera world: some applaud his powerful voice, others find that his bark overpowers his bite. What's not in dispute is that he's a strong and committed singer. The Met has handed him a plum role in this summer's Met in the Parks season -- Verdi's familiar jester, a part not often sung with the nuance and depth it demands. Tomorrow night, in the final concert of the summer season, he appears with Norah Amsellem as Gilda, Nancy Fabiola Herrera as Maddalena, Raymond Aceto as Sparafucile, and Jose Luis Duval as the Duke of Mantua, led by the knowledgeable veteran Joseph Colaneri. At 8, Buccleuch Park, New Brunswick, N.J., (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; free. (Midgette)

OPERA FOR ALL (Thursday) It's the money, stupid. As opera companies around the country wonder how to attract new audiences, New York City Opera offers a reminder that it's a no-brainer: slash ticket prices. For the second year in a row, the company is opening its season with a mini-festival in which all seats cost $25. This year's ''Opera for All'' includes four performances, double the number of last year's. It starts on Thursday with a gala concert of highlights from the coming season and continues next weekend with performances of ''Carmen'' and ''La Boheme.'' A party after Thursday's gala will feature the East Village Opera Company, a rock band that bases its music on -- what else? -- opera arias. Alas, ticket prices for the rest of the year will return to normal, but $25 will still get you a seat in the fourth ring. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com. (Midgette)

Classical Music

* BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This converted coffee barge is one of the most intimate chamber music halls in the city, and is offering ample musical variety this week. Tonight through Sunday, a piano trio of Olga Vinokur, the pianist; Mark Peskanov, the violinist; and Edward Arron, the cellist, offers a new work by Behzad Ranjbaran, commissioned by Bargemusic, as well as the Brahms Trio No. 3 and the Tchaikovsky Trio (Op. 50). On Thursday, the superb pianists Ursula Oppens and Jerome Lowenthal play works by Mozart, Wagner (as arranged by Liszt), Chabrier and Faure. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35, $20 for students, $30 for 65+ tonight and Thursday only. (Allan Kozinn)

ANDREA BOCELLI (Wednesday and Thursday) Clearly still kicking itself for not having given concerts with the likes of Zamfir, Helmut Lotti, Andre Rieu and other wonders of late-night classical crossover record advertising, the New York Philharmonic was not going to let the popular tenor Andrea Bocelli slip through its net. On the other hand, the orchestra didn't want to look too silly, so it is having it both ways, presenting Mr. Bocelli in his Philharmonic debut -- but outside the orchestra's official season (which begins on Sept. 13), and with its music director nowhere to be seen. Mr. Bocelli's program includes Verdi's Eight Romances (in Berio's orchestrations), and the orchestra, led by Asher Fisch, will play overtures and intermezzos by Verdi, Puccini and Mascagni. At 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; sold out. (Kozinn)

MAVERICK CONCERTS (Tomorrow) This concert series near Woodstock, N.Y., holds its performances in an open-backed barn that allows the sounds of nature to mingle with the music. For the last public concert, Zuill Bailey, a cellist, and Simone Dinnerstein, a pianist, perform Beethoven, Britten and Shostakovich. (The season ends on Sunday with a concert for donors.) At 6 p.m., Maverick Concert Hall, Maverick Road, between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., (845) 679-8217, maverickconcerts.org; $20. (Kozinn)

MUSIC MOUNTAIN (Tomorrow and Sunday) String quartets are a focus of this venerable institution in northwestern Connecticut, which closes out its summer season with two performances by the Shanghai Quartet. Tomorrow, the ensemble will be joined by Michael Tree, a violist, and Robert Martin, a cellist, in Brahms's Sextet No. 1 and Schubert's Cello Quintet in C; on Sunday, it offers an all-Beethoven program, with the second and third quartets of Op. 59. Tomorrow night at 6:30, Sunday afternoon at 3, Gordon Hall at Music Mountain, Falls Village, Conn., (860) 824-7126, musicmountain.org; $25 at the door, $22 in advance, $12 for students. (Midgette)

TAKUYA MURAMATSU AND IRATXE ANSA SANTESTEBAN: 'BECOMING' (Tomorrow) This shared program is the culmination of workshops taught by Mr. Muramatsu, a member of the Dairakudakan Butoh company, and Ms. Santesteban, a ballet dancer. Tomorrow at 4 and 8 p.m., Construction Company, 10 East 18th Street, between Fifth Avenue and Broadway, Manhattan, (212) 561-9539, becoming.caveartspace.org; $15. (Jennifer Dunning)

PHILADELPHIA LIVE ARTS FESTIVAL AND PHILLY FRINGE (Today through Thursday) During the dance drought in New York City, a trip south might not be a bad idea, and some of the participants in this funky, 10-year-old festival and its sidekick sound worth traveling for. Fourteen groups and artists -- some based in Philadelphia, others from around the world -- will perform this week. Those that sound the most interesting include Kate Watson-Wallace in ''House,'' a piece about memories and shifting emotional landscapes in rooms in a West Philadelphia row house (Tuesday through Thursday), the Jo Stromgren Kompani from Norway in ''The Convent,'' a dance about nuns going mad (Wednesday and Thursday), and the Miro Dance Theater in ''Lie to Me and shorter stories,'' a program of multimedia dances by Antony Rizzi and Amanda Miller, a choreographer with a truly individual voice (Thursday). Through Sept. 16. At various sites in Philadelphia, (215) 413-1318, livearts-fringe.org; $10, $15 and $20, with a few programs free. (Dunning)

RIVER TO RIVER FESTIVAL: EVENING STARS (Wednesday and Thursday) The big late-summer free dance sampler in New York, presented by the River to River Festival with the Joyce Theater and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, plays through next Friday with a salsa evening as a chaser next Sunday. Wednesday's opener is devoted to the Kansas City Ballet in three works, including Twyla Tharp's ''Catherine Wheel Suite''; the others are by Todd Bolender and William Whitener, the company's artistic director. Thursday is oriented toward modern dance, with Battleworks, Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet, Pilobolus and Philadanco. Through Sept. 10. Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Battery Park lawn, just north of the Staten Island ferry terminal, Lower Manhattan, rivertorivernyc.com; free. (John Rockwell)

Museums

* AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)

BARD GRADUATE CENTER: ' LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE,' through Oct. 15. The word sounds like the latest perfume or sorbet, but actually refers to the small, cunningly figurative medieval vessels used for ritual hand washing. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper-alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, acquamanilia are now having their first-ever exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show has been drawn mostly from the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and overseen by the head of the museum's medieval department and its object conservator in collaboration with Bard graduate students. But don't worry about dryness. The acquamanile's triple function as totem, prestige object and pitcher lends an undeniable energy. (The serpents are handles.) The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art, a versatile repertory of incised details and patterns and an ongoing, rarely resolved struggle between form and function. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Smith)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedeker's guides, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. And Church's oil sketches alone are worth the price of admission: exquisite, plainspoken Emersonian love poems to New York and New England. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 or ndm.si.edu. (Michael Kimmelman)

* DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Dec. 31. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Egypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, daheshmuseum.org. (Smith)

'AGNES MARTIN: A FIELD OF VISION: PAINTINGS FROM THE 1980'S,' through March 2007. Dia:Beacon, a bulwark of Minimalism on the banks of the Hudson River north of Manhattan, has three permanent galleries devoted to the artist Agnes Martin. Over the past two years they have been used for a retrospective of her paintings, installed in decade-long increments. The fourth installment is now in place. If Martin's spare, lucid compositions of drawn lines and painted bands feel different from much of the art around them here, that is because she was not a Minimalist. In fact, she called herself an Abstract Expressionist, and she was adamant on this point. The 18 paintings here confirm her conviction, in a show as deep, light-glinting, restless and purposeful as the river flowing nearby. Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100. (Holland Cotter)

* FRICK COLLECTION : 'JEAN-ETIENNE LIOTARD (1702-1789): SWISS MASTER,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Cotter)

GUILD HALL MUSEUM: 'ELIZABETH PEYTON,' through Oct. 22. Most of the 43 works in this exhibition portray beautiful people, some famous, some less so. Most immediately engaging is the tension between the painterly abstraction and the human subject matter. Images are realized in drippy swatches, squiggly lines and feathery dabs, and colors range from incandescent reds and oranges to pale lavenders and grays to dark velvety browns, blacks and purples. Yet for all that expressionistic action, likenesses are exacting. People like Nicole Kidman and Queen Elizabeth are rendered with seemingly effortless precision. Romantic feeling connects the form and content in Ms. Peyton's work. A kind of erotic yearning animates how she sees her subjects and how she makes her pictures. To paint, Ms. Peyton's works imply, is to be in love: to be in love with certain people and with painting itself. 158 Main Street, East Hampton, N.Y., (631) 324-0806. (Ken Johnson)

SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestoes and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)

KATONAH MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANDROMEDA HOTEL, THE ART OF JOSEPH CORNELL,' through Sept. 17. Although Cornell never left the United States, he translated his dreams of faraway places into delicate, sometimes overly precious works that have a sense of longing. In this show the white-painted, weathered interior of a box titled ''Grand Hotel -- Hotel Taglioni'' (1954) contains incongruous elements of collage, among them an old ad for a French bakery topped by a color cutout of the ballerina Marie Taglioni, an object of the artist's adoration. Even simpler, but equally dreamy, is another weathered box, ''Hotel de l'Etoile'' (1950), which holds only a long, vertical image of a deep blue sky rife with thousands of tiny pinpoints of light. One of the show's most striking images is a surreal photograph of Cornell by Lee Miller in which he is seen gazing upward, entranced, his shoulder adorned with a miniature sailboat (around 1935). Route 22 at Jay Street, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-9555, katonahmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)

JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 or jewishmuseum.org. (Glueck)

* MET: 'TREASURES OF SACRED MAYA KINGS,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of a kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. this is taken out because the met says it's no longer in the exhibition. mcd. Much of the work has never traveled before; m Many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)

MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: CELEBRATING REMBRANDT: ETCHINGS FROM THE MORGAN, through Oct. 1. On the occasion of the opening of its newly rethought home, the Morgan Library has mounted a show of 50 of its greatest Rembrandt etchings. The selection demonstrates the range of the master's subjects (from the heights of biblical tragedy to the casually erotic) and also his amazingly expressive technique. It serves as reminder that Rembrandt's prints represent genius of the plainest, most accessible sort: sustaining classics that encompass the earthy and the exalted and offer fresh meanings with each encounter. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, www.themorgan.org. (Smith)

* MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: HERZOG & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Kimmelman)

NEUE GALERIE: GUSTAV KLIMT: FIVE PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF FERDINAND AND ADELE BLOCH-BAUER, through Sept. 18. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: Had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman)

NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN: CHIHULY AT THE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN, through Oct. 29. Dale Chihuly, the world's most famous contemporary glass artist, has created ambitious installations of his large-scale, technically virtuosic and materially extravagant works inside the spectacular Haupt Conservatory and outside in reflecting pools and smaller gardens. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700, nybg.org. (Johnson)

* NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)

NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. The museum entrance is at 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Glueck)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'INTO ME/OUT OF ME,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)

* RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART : 'WHAT IS IT? HIMALAYAN ART' This museum is an oasis of calm in the city; you can feel your tension dissolve the minute you walk in the door. At the same time, the place jumps with activities, including lectures, films and exhibitions, many devoted to aspects of Himalayan culture. And for a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems into a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)

WADSWORTH ATHENEUM: 'AMERICAN SPLENDOR: HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL MASTERWORKS FROM THE WADSWORTH ATHENEUM,' through Dec. 31. Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt,, a leading painter of the American West, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, www.wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)

Galleries: Uptown

* SARAH SZE: 'CORNER PLOT' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)

YES BRUCE NAUMAN There has never been much in the way of ''No'' to the influential Post-Minimalist and sculptor-of-all-trades Bruce Nauman. But this astutely structured, if male-dominated, exhibition considers his importance anew, especially his use of language, neon and the body, and his visceral sense of form. The show's title is taken from a 1989 work by Jessica Diamond that is included, along with pertinent efforts by Paul McCarthy, Charles Ray, Glenn Ligon, Jason Rhoades, Peter Coffin, Diana Thater, John Bock and, of course, Mr. Nauman himself. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com, through Sept. 9. (Smith)

Galleries: Chelsea

* GALERIE DANIEL BUCHHOLZ AT METRO PICTURES This well-known Cologne gallery presents a surprisingly sweeping view of current art that includes Americans and Europeans and, despite its Conceptual slant, an impressive range of mediums and sensibilities. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)

HANS RICHTER (1888-1976), DADA; ART AND ANTI-ART This daunting yet partial survey is clogged with late paintings and reliefs that are for the most part elegant pastiches of Constructivism, Cubism and Abstract Expressionism. But it should be seen for the four short films from the 1920's, in which Richter's formalist and Dada sides balance beautifully, with elegantly Surrealist results. This is especially the case in the luminous ''Ghosts Before Breakfast,'' from 1927, which explores most of film's structural possibilities and segues briskly between abstraction and Hollywood narrative while three skittering bowler hats provide continuity. Maya Stendhal Gallery, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, mayastenhalgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)

RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, extended through Sept. 23. (Smith)

* JAMES J. WILLIAMS III: 'BY REQUEST, MY EPITAPH' Despite debts to artists like Jack Pierson, Karen Kilimnik, Richard Prince and Nan Goldin, this Haversham-ish environment and solo debut exude a promising fusion of modesty and narcissism. Its deep teal walls display scores of Polaroids, drawings, collages, notebooks and thrift-shop-worthy paintings, along with many of the artist's well-worn belongings. An illusion of stylish, if impoverished, full disclosure results. Self-conscious bohemianism teeters between nostalgia and irony, and art emerges as an incessant if nonchalant activity at the center of an eked-out existence. Envoy, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 242-7524, envoygallery.com, through Sept. 9. (Smith)

Other Galleries

'ZOO STORY' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Francoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, flcart.org through Oct. 16. (Johnson)

Last Chance

BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GRAFFITI' Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org; closes Sunday. (Johnson)

* METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. A certain confusion, both intellectual and visual, reigns, but there is more than enough to look at. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes Monday. (Smith)

* MET: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. Further sharpness comes from the placement of all parts of the altarpiece at eye level, creating a viewing intensity that more than compensates for the fact that they have not been reassembled. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes Monday. (Smith)

MET: 'ON PHOTOGRAPHY: A TRIBUTE TO SUSAN SONTAG,' How to honor the memory of a multifarious figure like Susan Sontag? The Metropolitan Museum's solution -- a small, grave, beautiful photography show -- is an apt one, with pictures by many of the artists she wrote about, from Diane Arbus to Walker Evans, a portrait of one of her early heroes, Oscar Wilde, and two of Sontag herself. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes Monday. (Cotter)

MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and usable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, madmuseum.org; closes Sunday. (Smith)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: DOUGLAS GORDON: 'TIMELINE,' This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes Monday. (Johnson)

MARTIN SCHOELLER: 'CLOSE UP' Extraordinarily large and detailed mug-shot-like portraits of celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Angelina Jolie and Bill Clinton. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, hastedhunt.com; closes today. (Johnson)

* THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'FULL HOUSE: VIEWS OF THE WHITNEY'S COLLECTION AT 75,' The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; closes Sunday. (Cotter)

HEADLINE: Lafayette, La.

BYLINE: By ALICIA AULT

 BODY:
LAFAYETTE is the geographic and cultural center of French-speaking Louisiana, and the jumping-off point for exploring the roots of the state's distinctly foreign feel. The town proper reflects little of the region's legacy, which also includes Spanish planters, Haitian and African slaves, American Indians and, later, waves of German, Italian and other immigrants. But Louisiana's essence is a short drive away, with plantation country to the south, the Atchafalaya Basin to the east and the prairie towns and musical and gastronomical incubators of Opelousas, Eunice, Ville Platte and Mamou to the north. Home to hundreds of oil- and natural-gas-related businesses, Lafayette Parish's fortunes are rising, driven by oil profits, the quest for new fuel sources and the rebuilding of offshore rigs damaged by Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. The region has added 1,500 hotel rooms in the last four years, according to the Lafayette Economic Development Authority, and 15,000 residents, mostly people from New Orleans with Acadian roots who arrived after Katrina. Lafayette -- 129 miles from New Orleans -- is traditionally even more laid back than the Big Easy. Handwritten signs sitting in shop windows that declare ''gone fishing'' should be taken literally. ALICIA AULT

Friday 


4 p.m.
1. Why Fiddles Sob
Get acclimated at the Acadian Cultural Center of the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve (501 Fisher Road, 337-232-0789; www.nps.gov/jela), a small National Park Service-operated museum across from the Lafayette Regional Airport. The exhibits may be a bit dated, but the story -- a rich culture built on forced migration to a strange land where hunting, fishing, making music and dancing still underpin much of life -- is timeless. Sit back in the air-conditioned movie theater and take in the 40-minute saga of the Acadians' expulsion from Nova Scotia in the 1750's.

7 p.m.
2. Baptism of Fire
Start your culinary tour at Prejean's Restaurant (3480 Interstate 49, North Lafayette; 337-896-3247), a semi-haute tribute to that South Louisiana trinity of salt, fat and deep-frying. ''If you're on a diet, you came to the wrong place,'' chirped our waiter, Sebastian. Prejean's has the scent of a tourist trap, with a 14-foot, 600-pound alligator watching over the dining room, but the food is the real deal. Start with the crawfish enchilada ($6.99), a baked cheese-covered tortilla rolled in a deathly rich crawfish-tail-studded veloute and move on to the blackened catfish etouffee, a moist fillet topped with a pile of roux-covered crawfish tails ($17.99). Most diners stagger out with a parting gift -- a box of leftovers.

10 p.m.
3. Roots and Beer
Since opening in 2002, the Blue Moon Saloon (215 East Convent Street, 877-766-2583; www.bluemoonpresents.com) has grown from a quirky youth hostel to a premier place to listen to local Cajun, zydeco and swamp pop, as well as national roots acts like the Iguanas and the Weary Boys. The stage is tucked under the Blue Moon Guesthouse's tin-roofed back porch, where dancers step and swirl on the surprisingly slick boards. The tiki-shack-like main bar dispenses cold beer and tropical cocktails with equal aplomb to the hip 20- to 30-something crowd that perches in the nooks and crannies that give the space such a homey feel. Cover charges range from $5 to $10.

Saturday

9 a.m.
4. Boogie-Woogie Omelets
After eight years, it's no longer a novelty, but the zydeco breakfast at Cafe Des Amis in Breaux Bridge (140 East Bridge Street, 337-332-5273) still packs them in every Saturday morning from 8:30 until the band stops at 11. A former state legislator, Dickie Breaux, holds court at a table by the kitchen, surveying couples jammed onto the postage-stamp-size dance floor and the wait staff flying by with mimosas ($4) and eggs Begnaud ($7.95), two eggs on a grilled biscuit covered with crawfish etouffee, and accompanied by cheese grits flecked with andouille.

Noon
5. Birds Are the Word
Three miles from Breaux Bridge lies one of the largest wading-bird rookeries in North America, a 2,800-acre swamp known as Lake Martin in the Cypress Island Preserve. Each spring, some 20,000 herons, ibises, roseate spoonbills and other species nest in the buttonwood bushes and cypress trees, staying until July. Birds and other wildlife can be seen just about any time of year, though, and Lake Martin is a haven for birdwatchers, boaters, fishermen and hunters. The lake is the focus of frequent debate about its stewardship -- the Nature Conservancy manages some areas. Last spring, something spooked the birds, leading literally thousands to abandon egg-filled nests.

5:30 p.m.
6. A Cajun Home Companion
Another Saturday tradition in Cajun country is the live radio show, top left, broadcast from the Liberty Theater in Eunice, ''Rendez-Vous Des Cajuns.'' The broadcast, on KRVS-FM 88.7 (www.krvs.org), began in 1987 when the Liberty, a former 1920's vaudeville theater, was restored. Munch popcorn and listen to Barry Jean Ancelet's half-French, half-English patter, peppered with Cajun in-jokes, or take a twirl on the wooden floor that separates the audience from the stage. We two-stepped and waltzed to Courtney Granger and His Darling Buds, giving us the bragging rights that we've danced on Cajun radio. The doors open at 4 p.m., and the show runs from 6 to 7:30 p.m.. The admission is $5. (337-457-7389; www.eunice-la.com/libertyschedule.html).

8 p.m.
7. SoHo in Grand Coteau
Near a convent on Grand Coteau's main street is an understated restaurant whose ambience somehow suggests a cross between a quiet country inn and Manhattan chic. The polished wood floors and oversize Kodachrome-rich photographs of local flora and fauna are the perfect backdrop to the sophisticated Louisiana-rooted offerings at Catahoula's (234 Martin Luther King Drive, 337-662-2275). The meals are still heavily influenced by the fat-salt-deep-fry trinity. We started with the sweet potato jolivette ($8) -- a flash-fried sweet potato grit cake covered with crawfish tails soaking in a smoky, wine-dark, bacon-infused reduction -- followed by a savory crabmeat cheesecake ($24), a Frisbee-size crab pie baked in cheese custard, and seafood extraordinaire ($28), a buffet of shrimp, ahi tuna, gravlax and crabmeat. The wine list is serious and deep.

10:30 p.m.
8. Red-Hot Music, Too
There is never a shortage of live music in and around Lafayette. Head downtown to the growing strip of bars and nightclubs clustered on Jefferson Street, including Nitetown (524 Jefferson Street, 337-593-8551; www.nitetowndowntown.com), which had Marcia Ball on our visit, and 307 Downtown (307 Jefferson Street, 337-262-0307; www.307downtown.com), which had two New Orleans groups, the Hot 8 Brass Band and Big Sam's Funky Nation. Grant Street Dancehall (113 West Grant Street, 337-237-8513; www.grantstreetdancehall.com) has just reopened and is again booking swamp pop, blues, Cajun, zydeco and national acts like Ani DiFranco. Randol's Restaurant & Cajun Dancehall (2320 Kaliste Saloom Road, 337-981-7080; www.randols.com) is host mostly to Cajun music. For zydeco check the full listings and directions provided by the Patsy Report (http://users.erols.com/ghayman/thepatsyreport.htm).

Sunday

9:30 a.m.
9. Scalawags and Alligators
It would be a crime against Louisiana nature to leave without getting to the Atchafalaya Basin. Covering 595,000 acres, the Atchafalaya is home to myriad plants and animals, including the inevitable alligator, at least 250 species of birds and the endangered Louisiana black bear. You'll find an affable guide in Coerte Voorhies, a semiretired geologist and Lafayette native who started his Atchafalaya Experience in 1990 (tours $45; 338 North Sterling Street, 337-233-7816). Mr. Voorhies -- a man's man straight out of Hemingway -- can summon an osprey with his birdcalls and entertain for hours with yarns about Louisiana scalawags.

2 p.m.
10. Mighty Fine Mudbugs
Watch the beehive of water-oriented activities from the porch overlooking the Atchafalaya at McGee's Landing (1337 Henderson Levee Road, Breaux Bridge; 337-228-2384) as you chow down on boiled crawfish ($12.99 for 3 pounds). Coming from the mid-Atlantic, we knew all about picking crabs, but not the art of freeing a mudbug's meat. Our waitress, Chrysta Collet, gave us a quick lesson, but we were poor students.

4 p.m.
11. Honky-Tonk Sabbath
You won't stay parched for long at this honky-tonk. Once named one of the 50 best bars in America by Men's Journal, Angelle's Whiskey River Landing (Henderson Levee Road, Henderson, 337-228-8567) is equally well known for a dance style -- the Whiskey River Jitterbug -- as for its occasionally rough-and-tumble crowds. Several hundred people, many in their finest Western wear, pack the low-slung plywood building for the Sunday afternoon dances, which feature either zydeco -- usually Geno Delafose -- or Cajun. Dancing is encouraged on all surfaces, bars included. You'll be humming all the way back to the airport.

THE BASICS

Look, Listen, Eat
 Visitors to Lafayette can choose from among three airports: Lafayette Regional, Baton Rouge Ryan (52 miles away) or New Orleans Louis Armstrong (129 miles away). Fares from New York are cheaper into Baton Rouge (about $250 round trip) and New Orleans (under $200), compared with about $350 into Lafayette. A rental car is a must.
 Most of the major hotel chains have outlets downtown and around crossroads of Interstates 10 and 49 north of Lafayette. For a more intimate stay, accompanied by lessons in history, culture and the current political landscape, try Bois Des Chenes Bed & Breakfast (338 North Sterling Street, 337-233-7816; www.hometown.aol.com/boisdchene/bois.htm), owned by the tour guide Coerte Voorhies and his wife, Marjorie, who also have a side business collecting and restoring antiques. 
 Only eight miles from Lafayette in Breaux Bridge is Maison Des Amis (111 Washington Street, 337-507-3399; www.maisondesamis.com), a four-room Creole cottage-style bed-and-breakfast overlooking the Bayou Teche. Rooms are $100 to $125.

HEADLINE: Panel Plans to Make Cities Reveal More on Pensions

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The board that writes accounting rules for state, county and local governments said yesterday that it was starting a project to improve cities' disclosure of information about the pension funds they run for municipal employees. 
 The project was announced after a report in The New York Times last month that New York City's pension fund has appeared to be fully funded for the last seven years chiefly because the city uses an unusual pension calculation that does not comply with accepted accounting rules.
Senior city officials have said they thought that New York's financial statements complied with accounting rules. But the city's chief actuary, Robert C. North, also said that he thought the pension numbers in the city's audited financial statements were ''meaningless'' for showing the fund's financial health.
 Actuaries use a technique called smoothing when they calculate yearly pension contributions. The technique is known to distort pension numbers, and accountants and economists have repeatedly questioned its place in financial reporting. Since 2003, Mr. North has been preparing a set of alternative pension numbers that are not smoothed. Found in the back of the city's financial reports, these calculations show the pension fund with a $49 billion shortfall. 
 The Governmental Accounting Standards Board said that it expected to make the rules for public pensions more like its rules for retiree health plans. None of these accounting rules require cities to put any money into their plans; they merely set requirements for disclosing how much money is already there, and how much more may be needed.
 The current pension rules, under which cities and states can choose from a list of six actuarial methods, have made it all but impossible for analysts to compare different cities' and states' pension funds. And some places, like New York City, have used actuarial calculations that are not among the six accepted ones. 
 Mr. North said he chose New York's actuarial method because it was known to be a good one for building pension assets quickly. He said that he knew it gave a meaningless picture of the pension fund and that was why he began to do his alternative calculations as a supplement. 
 The accounting board appears unlikely to make Mr. North's alternative method the required method for all local governments. The board said in a statement yesterday that cities like New York whose actuarial methods make their pension funds look fully funded at all times would be asked to do a second calculation for their disclosures, based on another actuarial method that is on the list of six. Those cities would still be permitted to use their own methods for calculating their yearly pension contributions. 
 These changes would probably affect New York State as well. It also uses an actuarial method that makes its pension fund look fully funded at all times. 
 The accounting board said it expected to provide detailed information about the changes by the end of 2007.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending in July Grew at Twice the June Rate

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Spending by American consumers grew in July at twice the rate it did in June, suggesting that the economy may not be slowing as suddenly as some economists had thought. 
 Personal income also rose in July, although not as much as spending did. And a widely watched measure of consumer inflation indicated that the pace of price increases may be easing somewhat.
All together, the data provided some encouraging evidence that economic expansion may be slowing, not stalling, on its way to the soft landing that policy makers like Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, are hoping for. 
 The Commerce Department reported yesterday that total personal spending rose 0.8 percent in July, adjusted for seasonal factors -- the sharpest increase since January. By contrast, personal income rose 0.5 percent in July, largely in line with the pace of the last several months. 
 Along with gauges of inflation like the Consumer Price Index, the Federal Reserve pays attention to one derived from the monthly consumer spending figures known as the core personal consumption expenditure index.
 The index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, registered an increase of just 0.1 percent in July, the smallest this year. 
 Still, the core index was 2.4 percent higher in July than a year earlier; the Fed considers 2 percent annual inflation to be at the high end of what the economy can comfortably tolerate. 
 Wall Street seemed to take the July statistics in stride, as investors left stock prices virtually unchanged from Wednesday's close. 
 The data in the report showing low inflation was seen as particularly positive because the Fed has said it may be forced to quickly resume interest rate increases if any sign appears that prices are shooting up. 
 At the Aug. 8 meeting of the Fed's policy-setting committee, members voted to leave interest rates unchanged at 5.25 percent. But, according to minutes of the meeting released this week, some members expressed concern that inflation was still running high. The committee said its decision to hold its overnight lending rate steady was ''a close call,'' and warned that ''additional firming could well be needed,'' meaning another rate increase was not out of the question.
 The spending and income report issued yesterday was the latest economic indicator to suggest that economic growth is not contracting too quickly. The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the United States economy grew more quickly in the second quarter than initially estimated. Revised gross domestic product figures showed that the economy expanded at a 2.9 percent pace in the quarter, not the 2.5 percent first reported. The department also said that inflation was slightly lower.
 ''It would appear, therefore, that some of the more pessimistic forecasts being bandied about for third-quarter G.D.P. growth will be revised up in coming days,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist with MFR, wrote in a report yesterday.
 The Commerce Department also reported that factory orders, excluding transportation equipment, rose 1.1 percent in July.
 The Labor Department, meanwhile, reported a decline in the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits. The number of new claims fell by 2,000, bringing the total number of claims to 316,000. The government will report today on unemployment for August.

HEADLINE: Generic Of Plavix Is Blocked

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
A federal judge in Manhattan ordered a Canadian company yesterday to stop distributing its generic version of the blockbuster anticlotting drug Plavix, granting a reprieve to Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis, which co-market the brand-name drug. 
 The Plavix marketers had seen a drastic erosion of their United States sales since the Canadian company, Apotex, introduced its generic version on Aug. 8 in a challenge to the patent held by the big companies. Analysts say that the large supplies of the generic drug already on the market could continue to impinge on sales of Plavix for several months. 
While ordering Apotex to stop shipments, United States District Judge Sidney H. Stein declined a request by Bristol-Myers and Sanofi to recall the generic pills already on the market. The judge ruled that the companies had negotiated away that right in their attempts earlier this year to settle the patent dispute with Apotex. 
 Judge Stein did say that the patent was likely to be enforceable, based on the evidence and testimony so far. He also observed that Bristol-Myers and Sanofi had suffered ''irreparable harm'' as a result of the patent infringement. 
 He nonetheless required Bristol-Myers and Sanofi to post a $400 million bond to compensate Apotex in the event the generic company won in a trial on the validity of the patent, now set to begin in his court next January. 
 Shares of Bristol-Myers were up more than 9 percent in after-hours trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Sanofi were little changed. 
 Bernard C. Sherman, the chief executive of Apotex, a private company based in Toronto, said yesterday that it planned to appeal. ''We believe that the ruling is erroneous in many respects,'' he said. 
 Mr. Sherman said that the volume of the Apotex drug already on the market amounted to about three months' worth of sales, while some analysts have estimated the amount at even more. A spokesman for Bristol-Myers, Tony Plohoros, said the company was trying to assess the amount of generic inventory in wholesale channels. Neither Sanofi nor Bristol-Myers had issued any other statement about the ruling, but in a letter to employees being sent last night, the Bristol-Myers chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, said it was ''certainly good news that the preliminary injunction has been granted, but unfortunately the economic and other consequences of the intrusion of the generic product that competes with Plavix in the U.S. market are impossible to fully reverse.''
 A Deutsche Bank analyst, Barbara Ryan, said the ruling was relatively good news for Bristol-Myers, which derives 30 percent of its profit from sales of Plavix. The drug, used by 48 million Americans, primarily to prevent the recurrence of stroke and heart attack, had United States sales last year of $3.5 billion. 
 But Ms. Ryan said that Mr. Dolan remained on the hot seat. She predicted that he could be replaced or that control of the company might even change, possibly before the patent trial, partly as a result of the company's mishandling of the Plavix case. 
 ''I think that Peter Dolan is clearly under significant pressure, and this it not an isolated situation,'' Ms. Ryan said, citing shareholder displeasure over Plavix as well as several other management missteps. 
 For Bristol-Myers, which is based in New York, the ruling very likely means the company can preserve its 5.1 percent dividends, according to David S. Moskowitz, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. 
 But the situation also seems to suggest that Bristol-Myers and Sanofi, a French company, should never have entered negotiations they began last year with Apotex, which created the opening that has allowed the generic maker to ship its product for more than three weeks. 
 The patent covering Plavix gives market exclusivity to Bristol-Myers and Sanofi until the end of 2011. Apotex began challenging that patent in 2002, arguing that it was not valid. The case has been pending in court ever since and originally was set to go to trial in June. 
 But the dynamic changed earlier this year, after the Food and Drug Administration approved Apotex's version of the drug. Despite that approval, under federal law Apotex would have run the risk of paying financial damages amounting to three times the generic's total sales, if it brought its product to market but then eventually lost the patent case. 
 Bristol-Myers and Sanofi began negotiations with Mr. Sherman to settle the dispute. Under an agreement reached in March, the companies granted Apotex exclusive generic rights for a six-month period that was to begin in September 2011. 
 That settlement deal was rejected by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general who viewed it as restricting competition.
 It was during efforts to renegotiate the deal that Bristol-Myers and Sanofi agreed to provisions that made it easier for Apotex to market its generic immediately if the revised agreement was also turned down. Those concessions included a waiver by the big companies of their rights to collect triple Apotex's sales of the generic, as well as an agreement that they would not go to court to challenge distribution of the Apotex product until five days after it began shipment. 
 After the second agreement was also rejected, Mr. Sherman's company began shipping its product to the United States on Aug. 8. 
 Under terms of the agreement Mr. Sherman negotiated, Apotex is liable to repay Bristol-Myers and Sanofi for only half of the generic drug's sales should Apotex lose at the patent trial. The negotiations, and accusations by Mr. Sherman that the companies entered a secret side deal, are the subject of a Justice Department investigation. 
 In his 57-page ruling, Judge Stein wrote, ''The public interest in lower-priced drugs is balanced by a significant public interest in encouraging the massive investment in research and development that is required before a new drug can be developed and brought to market.''

HEADLINE: On the Job, Nursing Mothers Are Finding a 2-Class System

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR

 BODY:
When a new mother returns to Starbucks' corporate headquarters in Seattle after maternity leave, she learns what is behind the doors mysteriously marked ''Lactation Room.'' 
 Whenever she likes, she can slip away from her desk and behind those doors, sit in a plush recliner and behind curtains, and leaf through InStyle magazine as she holds a company-supplied pump to her chest, depositing her breast milk in bottles to be toted home later.
But if the mothers who staff the chain's counters want to do the same, they must barricade themselves in small restrooms intended for customers, counting the minutes left in their breaks.
 ''Breast milk is supposed to be the best milk, I read it constantly when I was pregnant,'' said Brittany Moore, who works at a Starbucks in Manhattan and feeds her 9-month old daughter formula. ''I felt bad, I want the best for my child,'' she said. ''None of the moms here that I know actually breast-feed.'' 
 Doctors firmly believe that breast milk is something of a magic elixir for babies, sharply reducing the rate of infection, and quite possibly reducing the risk of allergies, obesity, and chronic disease later in life. 
 But as pressure to breast-feed increases, a two-class system is emerging for working mothers. For those with autonomy in their jobs -- generally, well-paid professionals -- breast-feeding, and the pumping it requires, is a matter of choice. It is usually an inconvenience, and it may be an embarrassing comedy of manners, involving leaky bottles tucked into briefcases and brown paper bags in the office refrigerator. But for lower-income mothers -- including many who work in restaurants, factories, call centers and the military -- pumping at work is close to impossible, causing many women to decline to breast-feed at all, and others to quit after a short time.
 It is a particularly literal case of how well-being tends to beget further well-being, and disadvantage tends to create disadvantage -- passed down in a mother's milk, or lack thereof.
 ''I feel like I had to choose between feeding my baby the best food and earning a living,'' said Jennifer Munoz, a former cashier at Resorts Atlantic City Casino who said she faced obstacles that included irregular breaks and a refrigerator behind a locked door. She said she often dumped her milk into the toilet, knowing that if she did not pump every few hours, her milk supply would soon dwindle.
 The casino denies discouraging Ms. Munoz from pumping. ''We have policies and procedures in place to accommodate the needs of all of our employees,'' Brian Cahill, a Resorts spokesman, said. 
 Nearly half of new mothers return to work within the first year of their child's life. But federal law offers no protection to mothers who express milk on the job -- despite the efforts of Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, who has introduced such legislation. ''I can't understand why this doesn't move,'' she said. ''This is pro-family, pro-health, pro-economy.''
 Meanwhile, states are stepping in. Twelve states have passed laws protecting pumping mothers -- Oklahoma's law, the newest, will take effect in November. But like Oklahoma's, which merely states that an employer ''may provide reasonable break time'' and ''may make a reasonable effort'' to provide privacy, most are merely symbolic.
 Public health authorities, alarmed at the gap between the breast-feeding haves and have-nots, are now trying to convince businesses that supporting the practice is a sound investment. ''The Business Case for Breastfeeding,'' an upcoming campaign by the Department of Health and Human Services, will emphasize recent findings that breast-feeding reduces absenteeism and pediatrician bills.
 In corporate America, lactation support can be a highly touted benefit, consisting of free or subsidized breast pumps, access to lactation consultants, and special rooms with telephones and Internet connections for employees who want to work as they pump, and CD players and reading material for those who do not. According to the nonprofit Families and Work Institute, a third of large corporations have lactation rooms.
 Even without these perks, professional women can usually afford a few months of maternity leave during which to breast-feed. When they return, they can generally find an office for the two or three 20-minute sessions per workday typically necessary. Even bathrooms -- the pumping spots of last resort -- are more inviting at an accounting firm than in a fast-food restaurant. 
 Wealthier women can spend their way out of work-versus-pumping dilemmas, overnighting milk home from business trips and buying $300 pumps that extract milk quickly, along with gizmos that allow them, in what seems like a parody of maternal multitasking, to pump while driving to and from work.
 In contrast, said Dr. Lori Feldman-Winter, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on breast-feeding, her patients cannot afford a basic $50 breast pump -- an investment, she said, that ''could prevent a lifetime of diseases.'' The academy urges women to breast-feed exclusively for six months and to continue until the child turns 1.
 Many of her patients learn about breast-feeding through the government nutrition program Women, Infants, and Children, which distributes nursing literature to four million mothers, and also provides classes and lactation consultants.
 Because of this and similar efforts, 73 percent of mothers now breast-feed their newborns, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But after six months, the number falls to 53 percent of college graduates, and 29 percent of mothers whose formal education ended with high school. In a study of Oklahoma mothers who declined to breast-feed, nearly a third named work as the primary reason. Others, like Ms. Moore of Starbucks, find the early days of breast-feeding frustrating, and their impending return to work means they have little incentive to continue.
 ''Sometimes my co-workers will sneak in two or three smoking breaks'' before she can steal away to pump, said Laura Kruger Rowe, who works at a Starbucks in Rochester. 
 The company, known for its generous benefits, has no breast-feeding policy, but will ''work with partners to accommodate their needs on a case-by-case basis,'' said Valerie O'Neil, a spokeswoman.
 As at Starbucks, the gap between working mothers can play out within a single organization. At many law firms, lawyers can pump in their offices, while secretaries use bathroom stalls; in the Army, which also has no policy on the matter, officers are less likely to encounter problems than enlisted soldiers, who have less autonomy and a more complex chain of command.
 ''They're scared to death to even talk to their employers,'' Dr. Barbara L. Philipp, an associate professor of pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine, said of the housekeepers and fast-food servers whose children she treats. They may fear the kind of harassment that Laura Walker, a former server at a Red Lobster restaurant in Evansville, Ind., said she faced. 
 According to the complaint Ms. Walker filed with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, the restaurant ignored a note she brought from her nurse explaining her need to pump. The managers cut her hours, assigned her to the worst tables and ridiculed her -- for instance, jiggling the restaurant's milk containers and joking that they were for her. Eventually Ms. Walker's milk ducts clogged, landing her in the hospital with mastitis. 
 Officials of the restaurant chain said they did assist Ms. Walker.
 ''We at Red Lobster work with all new mothers to accommodate their needs so they can take care of their child,'' said Wendy Spirduso, a spokeswoman. ''That occurred multiple times in this case,'' she said, declining to go into detail because of a confidential settlement Ms. Walker reached with the company.
 Shortly after Marlene Warfield, a dental hygienist in Tacoma, Wash., began pumping on the job, she said her boss wore a Halloween costume consisting of a large silver box -- his interpretation of a pump, perhaps -- with a cutout labeled ''insert breast here.'' When he instructed Ms. Warfield to leave her pump at home, she said, she quit her job-- and consulted the local human rights commission, which found nothing illegal about the dentist's actions.
 In contrast, higher-paid women can often pump without anyone knowing -- or with everyone knowing. Nina Wurster, who works in human resources for the Advisory Board, a consulting group in Washington, conducts phone interviews from the lactation room. ''I just say, sorry about the background noise and I keep going,'' she said. But breast-feeding is now so accepted in white-collar circles that some women are completely matter-of-fact about it, pumping right in their open cubicles.
 ''It's been great,'' said Melany Richmond, an electrical engineer at Zilog, a semiconductor company, in Bellevue, Wash. ''I put a little sign up -- it says 'Do Not Disturb,' with a little 'Moo' on the bottom.'' 
 Pumping breast milk has one benefit that cannot be quantified: it makes working mothers feel less guilt-ridden about leaving their children. ''There is a lot of satisfaction in knowing I am doing right by him,'' Ms. Wurster said of her son, James.
 Dr. Philipp recalled a small furor about whether Jane Swift, the former governor of Massachusetts who gave birth to twins, would breast-feed after returning to work.
 ''That's a great thing to do, but she had her own office and could set her own schedule,'' Dr. Philipp said. ''The one I want to know about is the lady cleaning her office.''

HEADLINE: Staten Island Man Killed 2 Children, Then Himself, Police Say

BYLINE: By EMILY VASQUEZ; Ann Farmer, Sarah Garland and Ethan Wilensky-Lanford contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Believing he had been cursed by voodoo, a Staten Island man drowned his two children in a bathtub in the St. George section late Wednesday, then went to Brooklyn and made a fatal jump in front of a northbound Q train, the police said yesterday. 
 The man, Frantz Bordes, 39, was home with the children Wednesday evening while their mother, Francoise Mercier, a nurse's aide, worked from 3 to 11 p.m. 
When Ms. Mercier returned home about 11:40 p.m., she found the bodies of her daughter, 2, and son, 4, in the bathtub, and her husband missing, the police said. Her daughter's diaper was soaked with bath water but the tub had been drained.
 When Ms. Mercier found her children she screamed, neighbors said, then cried out repeatedly, ''The kids, the kids,'' as she banged on doors in her building on Daniel Low Terrace.
 ''She was hitting the walls hysterically and saying, 'Why did he do that, I left my husband with the kids, why did my husband do this?' '' said a neighbor, Rosalind Bradshaw, adding that her daughter called 911.
 In remarks to reporters yesterday, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said that Mr. Bordes left seven suicide notes. Mr. Kelly said that in rambling Creole and English, Mr. Bordes, a Haitain immigrant, wrote that voodoo had been ''worked on him'' by a relative.
 One of the notes was found in his wallet, another on the couple's bed, according to an official. Another official said that in one note he had written that an unidentified ''they'' were trying to destroy him and ''most of all they use voodoo.''
 The police said Mr. Bordes was the only suspect in the murders, adding that officers had never been called to the couple's home for a domestic dispute and that the city's child welfare administration had no history involving the family.
 But Ms. Mercier's brother, Phraner Mercier, 45, spoke of a troubled relationship. He said Mr. Bordes had lied to Ms. Mercier, concealing from her that he had two sons from a previous relationship.
 Mr. Mercier also said that he and his family did not practice voodoo and were ''very Christian.'' 
 ''I don't know about the voodoo thing; the police say that,'' he said.
 Neighbors of Ms. Mercier and Mr. Bordes called them a quiet family that kept to themselves. Several said they rarely saw Mr. Bordes or the children, just Ms. Mercier as she came from and went to work.
 ''She's a nice lady, a quiet lady, didn't bother anyone,'' Ms. Bradshaw said. 
 After the police found identification that led them to relatives of Mr. Bordes in Brooklyn they learned that he was unemployed and often cared for the children alone while their mother was at work.
 While the police were en route to the couple's apartment in Staten Island, Ms. Mercier came home and found her children in the bathtub. Neighbors were still trying to calm her when the police arrived and went into the apartment.
 Still unsure of many of the details of the killings, the police initially seemed to suspect Ms. Mercier, according to neighbors.
 One of the officers came out and asked Ms. Mercier, ''Why did you do it?'' Ms. Bradshaw said. Ms. Mercier replied that she did not do it, Ms. Bradshaw continued, then ''they handcuffed her and took her in.''
 Ms. Mercier spent most of yesterday with the police at the 120th Precinct in Staten Island. Co-workers at St. Elizabeth Ann's Health Care and Rehabilitation Center who came to visit her at the precinct said it seemed as if she had not stopped crying all day.
 ''She loves her kids,'' said a co-worker who called herself Cassie. ''She talked about them all the time, especially the little girl.'' Cassie said that Ms. Mercier worked only part time at the nursing home because she said she needed to take care of the children, and hoped to go back to school in the future.
 About 5 p.m., Ms. Mercier was driven to her brother's home on Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn. As she walked in, she spoke to reporters and, in her grief, seemed unable to condemn her husband.
 ''He was a good father,'' she said. ''He was a good one; he take care of them.''

HEADLINE: Where Katrina Lingers, Football Is a Refuge

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: PORT SULPHUR, La., Aug. 31 

 BODY:
Last year, nothing floated through the goal posts of the ruined high school here but the storm surge from Hurricane Katrina. Now football is again being played in lower Plaquemines Parish, a rudder-like peninsula below New Orleans that steers the Mississippi River to its delta. There is a new school, South Plaquemines High, and a chance for a new start Friday night against Belle Chasse, in upper Plaquemines.
 ''This is bigger than us,'' Roger Halphen, an assistant coach at South Plaquemines, told his players at practice Wednesday, his voice low and wounded. ''People want to move back. They say it's going to take three months for a FEMA trailer. They're losing hope. I've seen them crying. They don't certify the levees. Businesses don't open up. We win this game, this is going to give hope to people.
 ''This is for the hope of south Plaquemines.'' 
 Only four parish residents died in Katrina's pummeling wind and water, yet almost no structures survived intact in the citrus, fishing, and oil-and-gas communities of lower Plaquemines. Port Sulphur High still stands, but it remains uninhabitable except for the occasional raccoon and skittering armadillo.
 Its campus is now the site of South Plaquemines High, which has consolidated wrecked schools from Port Sulphur, Buras and Boothville-Venice. The modular buildings of the new school, like the unsettled lives here, are temporary and vulnerable. Last Friday, classes were canceled when rain seeped into the improvised classrooms, which house 266 students in grades 7 through 12.
 Students got to choose the new mascot, and youthful immortality prevailed. Inevitably, they chose Hurricanes.
 ''Two other choices were Eagles or Gators,'' Lance Wallace, a sophomore cornerback, said. ''Hurricanes sounded better. We lived through a hurricane.''
 Cyril Crutchfield, who coached Port Sulphur to the 2002 small-school state championship and was runner-up in 2001, was a natural choice to become head coach at South Plaquemines. In six seasons, he did no worse than reach the state quarterfinals in Class 1A.
 Stubbornly, Crutchfield refused to evacuate ahead of Katrina, sleeping in the Port Sulphur High cafeteria until waves licked at the steps and sprayed against the door. Then he fled to the gym, where water rose above the rims on the backboards.
 ''God, get me through this one and I'll never stay again,'' he prayed.
 The water, brown as the tobacco that Crutchfield chews, was salty from the gulf. Then, as the eye of the storm apparently arrived, the hissing of the 120-mile-an-hour wind, and the 28-foot storm surge, began to subside. As the water receded, Crutchfield and six other men swam out, eventually alighting on the roof of the industrial arts building. Six hours later, they were rescued by boat.
 ''I thought I was invincible, but I wasn't,'' Crutchfield, 39, said. ''I was scared to death.''
 A year later, he feels chastened about his mortality but not about his expectations for his team, which now plays in Class 2A. 
 Warren Mayes, a senior receiver, said, ''Anything less than a state championship is unacceptable.''
 But the challenge will be great.
 Practice is held on a borrowed field 30 miles from the school, the same distance Crutchfield must travel to wash the game uniforms. Sod for the home stadium was installed this week, but it will not be ready for play until mid- to late September. The Hurricanes have no locker room, no place at school yet to shower or even to eat a hot lunch. To get drinking water for practice, someone must make a daily run for ice at a local fishing dock. 
 When practices extend beyond sundown, some players step off the team bus with their helmets and shoulder pads and disappear into the inky darkness. There are few streetlights to illuminate their scattered government trailers. Others commute 80 miles or more round trip from New Orleans. Everybody lost everything.

New Start, Uncertain Future
 Katrina shoved the home of the brothers Jordan and Maverick Ancar into a canal, where it sits like an artificial reef. 
 ''They got alligators watching TV in your house,'' Wayne Williamson Jr., a junior receiver, said jokingly to the brothers before a recent practice. ''They sitting on the couch, eating chips.''
 Everyone laughed, but the season remains as fragile as it is new. The FEMA trailers where many players live are not built to withstand hurricane winds. Last weekend, when Tropical Storm Ernesto was forecast to enter the gulf, another year of football seemed threatened.
 Devin Boutwell, a defensive lineman and tight end, cried at the thought of losing his senior season and his chance to receive a major-college scholarship. Other players prayed. Eventually, Ernesto swerved toward Florida.
 ''I was scared,'' Williamson said. ''We can't withstand nothing here. I don't think they would pay for us again.''
 By they, he meant the government. Any approaching storm is sure to stir the same gale-force nervousness. Hurricane season extends for two more months, the length of football's regular season. No one needs a reminder.
 Each afternoon on the way to practice, players have ridden past the detritus of Katrina: Past the parish library with its broken spine and crippled books. Past coffins that popped up like toast and floated away. Past shredded buildings with exposed ribs that suggest this rural community starved as well as drowned.
 And, unavoidably, past the earthen levees that hold out the Mississippi on one side of Highway 23 and the marsh and the Gulf of Mexico on the other. Because so few people have returned to lower Plaquemines -- an estimated 2,000 to 4,000 of the prestorm population of 14,000 -- the federal government will not immediately spend the $1.6 billion needed to buttress the levees.
 Without such bolstered protection, people have questions that waver into fears. Should they rebuild? How high? How much will flood and wind insurance cost if they can get it at all? Life here seems stuck in a kind of limbo, not unlike the coffins sheathed in cement vaults that await interment and remain anchored to the ground in the meantime, lest they wander off in the next storm.
 The post office, the pharmacy and the bank have yet to reopen here. The grocery store operates out of a double-wide trailer. A boat nests like a bird in a tree, while spray paint on the side of a two-story house pleads, ''Rebuildin Do Not Bulldoz.''
 But a medical clinic, a natural gas plant, a hardware store and a couple of restaurants are open. St. Patrick's Catholic Church is back, school is back, and so is football. Hope is budding that a village left crawling by the storm is taking baby steps toward recovery. 
 ''Once you get school back, you get people and businesses coming back,'' said Stanley Gaudet, the principal at South Plaquemines High. ''Then you can rebuild a community.''

There's No Place Like Home
 The school received a library grant from the Laura Bush Foundation, and on Tuesday, Katrina's anniversary, Gaudet met President Bush in New Orleans. On Wednesday, an 18-wheeler arrived with new weight-lifting equipment. Football has always been popular here. Now it is a refuge.
 ''I have a lot of stress, but football makes me happy,'' Jordan Ancar, a junior lineman, said.
 It is comforting to be back among friends, and oddly liberating, because living amid Katrina's destruction frees everyone from having to talk about it constantly, said Rory Jones, a senior receiver who evacuated last year to Lafayette, La.
 ''When you're an evacuee, everybody always wants to talk about Katrina,'' Jones said. ''They think you have it easy because everything is free. Or they think you're from New Orleans and they say, 'Our school will be better when you leave.' ''
 Once a company town for the now-shuttered Freeport Sulfur Company, Port Sulphur struggled economically long before Katrina struck. According to the 2000 census, about 20 percent of the 3,115 residents in this racially diverse hamlet lived below the poverty level. ''It was a dying town,'' said Jiff Hingle, the sheriff of Plaquemines Parish.
 But to the locals, census figures are merely an official skin that hides a community's heart and gristle and connective tissue. 
 ''It's peace of mind,'' said Theresita Ancar, the principal at South Plaquemines Elementary School and a cousin to the Ancar brothers. ''We marry each other in these little towns, and grandma is five minutes away, and you look after mine and I look after yours. You can leave your doors unlocked. If you do lock them, you don't need three bolts and a chain.''
 Still, Katrina imposed harsh new realities. The halting pace of recovery has spurred Coach Crutchfield to run for a seat on the parish council, the rough equivalent of a county commission. Election Day is Sept. 30. People need to have patience in lower Plaquemines, Crutchfield said, but there is a limit.
 He worries that debris removal, while considerable, has begun to stagnate in and around Port Sulphur. In some areas, water comes out of the faucet rust-colored and smelly, he said, while a nearby bayou community still lacks electricity.
 ''People want to come home,'' Crutchfield said. ''Dorothy of Kansas said it best. 'There's no place like home.' ''

Scandal After the Storm
 It is too soon to know what home will become. Crutchfield believes the future of Port Sulphur and lower Plaquemines will be tied to the future of the levees and perhaps to whether billions are spent to restore Louisiana's subsiding wetlands.
 If the levees do not meet the Federal Emergency Management Agency's standards for flood protection, Crutchfield said: ''We're not going to get our community back. We're not going to get economic development.''
 For now, he is focused on football. But even football has brought unwelcome distractions. One of his best players, running back James Brown, faces a loss of eligibility in a hurricane-related scandal.
 Brown and four other players, including the star quarterback Randall Mackey, left Port Sulphur ahead of Katrina and ended up 300 miles away, winning a Class 4A state championship at Bastrop, La. Unlike Mackey, Brown has returned home, hoping to play his senior season at South Plaquemines, but his future is as cloudy here as the afternoon skies.
 The Louisiana High School Athletic Association has stripped Bastrop of the title for improperly recruiting the former Port Sulphur players by picking them up at a hurricane-evacuation center. Those involved are also accused of making false statements. Unless they prevail on appeal, Bastrop will lose its championship, and Brown and Mackey will lose any chance to play this season, according to the association.
 Even if rules were technically violated, and some penalty was deserved, Crutchfield said, any player who lost everything in a storm would have been tempted by someone who offered a ride, money, a place to live, a chance to keep playing football. ''I might have taken it, too,'' he said.
 This is not how Crutchfield wanted to start the season, looking back instead of ahead. But the effects of Katrina will linger. There is no way around it. The South Plaquemines cheerleaders, with the school mascot in mind, believe this can even be an advantage. They have a new battle cry: Hurricane season never ends.

HEADLINE: Iran Remains Steadfast in Pursuing Nuclear Plans as U.N. Deadline Arrives

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Tehran for this article, and Mark Landler from Berlin.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Aug. 31 

 BODY:
Iran remained defiant Thursday, ignoring a deadline set by the United Nations Security Council to suspend enrichment of uranium or face the threat of economic and political sanctions, which could choke its access to international banks and block the ability of its officials to travel abroad.
 As the hours ticked down to midnight, Iran's officials did not flatly reject the deadline. But for months they have remained adamant about pursuing enrichment, having turned the issue into a matter of national pride. In domestic political terms, they could hardly have reversed course at this point without risking a loss of face and credibility at home, political analysts here said.
Since his election in June 2005, Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has been the public face of Iranian defiance to the West, and he was again on Thursday. As other Iranian officials worked foreign capitals to press their case and block sanctions, the president traveled to the northwest of Iran where he again denounced what he called ''arrogant powers.'' 
 ''They claim to be supporting freedom, but they support the most tyrannical governments in the world to pursue their own interests,'' he said at a crowded stadium in West Azerbaijan Province. ''They talk about human rights while maintaining the most notorious prisons. Those powers that do not abide by God and follow evil are the main source of all the current problems of mankind.''
 In images broadcast on state television across Iran, the audience cheered the president while chanting: ''Nuclear energy is our inalienable right.''
 The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in a report issued Thursday that Iran was enriching small amounts of uranium. It also deepened suspicions by reporting that inspectors had detected traces of highly enriched uranium at an Iranian nuclear facility. Iran has argued in the past that such traces came from contamination on equipment from Pakistan, but the inspectors said that these traces did not match samples provided by Pakistan.
 But the inspectors drew no conclusions, writing that because Iran had denied them access to certain facilities the inspection team was unable to make ''further progress in its efforts to verify the correctness and completeness of Iran's declarations'' that it is running a peaceful nuclear program -- and not developing weapons. 
 On Thursday, Muhammad Saeedi, the deputy leader of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, told the official Iranian news agency that Iran was not ''fully satisfied with the report,'' but that it showed ''America's propaganda and politically motivated claims over Iran's nuclear program are baseless and based on American officials' hallucinations.'' 
 As it was shaping up, deadline day was likely to be less a climactic conclusion to years of conflict than another step down a lengthy road that has seen Iran, Western Europe and the United States battling over Iran's nuclear ambitions.
 Even before the deadline, the United States, Britain, France and Germany were working to build a consensus for imposing strong sanctions on Iran. At the same time, Iranian officials worked feverishly to try to split the European coalition and to curry support from Russia and China, which have economic and energy interests in Iran and wield veto power on the Security Council.
 In Germany, which is not a permanent member of the Security Council, the foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said in an interview in the daily Bild, that Iran had no use for a uranium-enrichment program other than to build a nuclear bomb. ''We must prevent an Iranian atomic bomb,'' he said in the interview.
 From Asia to Europe, Iran tried to lobby influential capitals, insisting that it was pursuing only peaceful nuclear energy, as it says is its right under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which it has signed. Without publicly stating it, Iran has hinted it is using access to its lucrative oil reserves as an incentive -- and threat -- in pressing its case.
 After a brief visit to China on Tuesday, an Iranian envoy arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday to promote its nuclear agenda with senior officials. The backdrop to the discussion was Iran's persistent haggling with Japan over a multibillion-dollar deal that would allow Tokyo to co-explore Iran's Azadegan oil fields. 
 ''The atmosphere is suitable for reaching a fair solution if the parties are willing to return to the negotiating table,'' Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, said in a meeting with Japanese officials on Thursday, according to Iran's official news agency.
 The West has taken two paths in trying to persuade Iran to suspend enrichment: a package of economic incentives aimed at voluntary compliance and sanctions. On Aug. 22, Iran gave its response to the incentives package, ignoring the demand that it suspend enrichment immediately and instead calling for more talks and clarification of what it called more than 50 ''ambiguities'' in the incentives package.
 Publicly, Iranian officials have displayed confidence that the five permanent members of the Security Council would not agree, at least in the near future, on a package of tough sanctions. They also publicly expressed indifference toward the pain that sanctions might cause.
 ''If they refuse to be logical, we will not be fearful and concerned,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said at a news conference earlier in the week, when he was asked about the threat of sanctions. ''We are able to protect our rights.''
 But the government's public posture was not unanimously accepted, as some began to express anxiety about the drag that sanctions could impose on an already troubled economy. Iran's official inflation rate is more than 10 percent, and unemployment is widespread.
 ''Sanctions can face the country with serious economic pressures,'' said Mohammad Ali Najafi, the former chief of the Planning and Management Organization, in a daily newspaper, Kargozaran. ''Sanctions by U.N. Security Council would be much more harmful.''
 The nuclear conflict has often been portrayed by Iranian officials as a beachhead against American influence in Iranian affairs. Officials and former officials routinely say that if Iran gives in, it would find itself pressured on many other fronts, such as human rights and support for Hezbollah in Lebanon.
 Mahmoud Vaezi, a former deputy foreign minister, said that the United States appeared to want a confrontation, while Europe was signaling it might want ''a kind of win-win deal.'' The Europeans, he said, recognize the value of offering both sides a ''face-saving'' deal. 
 ''But, of course, if this kind of pressure from the U.S. continues, we must continue to resist, and we cannot draw back,'' he said. 
 Still, for all the attention world leaders were focusing on the nuclear standoff, people across Tehran seemed hardly moved by the looming deadline as they went about their business. Many said it was not that they were unconcerned, but that after living from one crisis to the next, it was hard to find the energy to get excited.
 ''The public is indifferent about this,'' said Hassan Fashami, 70, who has sold newspapers for more than half a century at one of the busiest corners in central Tehran. ''They have heard lots of noise. They are just tired.''
 Up the block, Ahmed Zadeh, stood outside his small shop selling electronics. He said he was a concerned about the prospect of sanctions, but that few of his customers were. His biggest disappointment, he said, was that sanctions would only make it harder to procure American-made products. He said his biggest-selling items are American brands that he can stock because they are assembled in Japan or China.
 ''Of course I am worried,'' he said. ''I have been to different countries, to Rome, to Australia, to Asia. I have seen the world. I know what it is to have sanctions.''

HEADLINE: Rendezvous With Oblivion

BYLINE: By THOMAS FRANK. 
Thomas Frank, a guest columnist, is the author, most recently, of ''What's the Matter With Kansas?''

 BODY:
Over the last month I have tried to describe conservative power in Washington, but with a small change of emphasis I could just as well have been describing the failure of liberalism: the center-left's inability to comprehend the current political situation or to draw upon what is most vital in its own history.
 What we have watched unfold for a few decades, I have argued, is a broad reversion to 19th-century political form, with free-market economics understood as the state of nature, plutocracy as the default social condition, and, enthroned as the nation's necessary vice, an institutionalized corruption surpassing anything we have seen for 80 years. All that is missing is a return to the gold standard and a war to Christianize the Philippines. 
Historically, liberalism was a fighting response to precisely these conditions. Look through the foundational texts of American liberalism and you can find everything you need to derail the conservative juggernaut. But don't expect liberal leaders in Washington to use those things. They are ''New Democrats'' now, enlightened and entrepreneurial and barely able to get out of bed in the morning, let alone muster the strength to deliver some Rooseveltian stemwinder against ''economic royalists.'' 
 Mounting a campaign against plutocracy makes as much sense to the typical Washington liberal as would circulating a petition against gravity. What our modernized liberal leaders offer -- that is, when they're not gushing about the glory of it all at Davos -- is not confrontation but a kind of therapy for those flattened by the free-market hurricane: they counsel us to accept the inevitability of the situation and to try to understand how we might retrain or re-educate ourselves so we will fit in better next time. 
 This last point was a priority for the Clinton administration. But in ''The Disposable American,'' a disturbing history of job security, Louis Uchitelle points out that the New Democrats' emphasis on retraining (as opposed to broader solutions that Old Democrats used to favor) is merely a kinder version of the 19th-century view of unemployment, in which economic dislocation always boils down to the fitness of the unemployed person himself.
 Or take the ''inevitability'' of recent economic changes, a word that the centrist liberals of the Washington school like to pair with ''globalization.'' We are told to regard the ''free-trade'' deals that have hammered the working class almost as acts of nature. As the economist Dean Baker points out, however, we could just as easily have crafted ''free-trade'' agreements that protected manufacturing while exposing professions like law, journalism and even medicine to ruinous foreign competition, losing nothing in quality but saving consumers far more than Nafta did. 
 When you view the world from the satisfied environs of Washington -- a place where lawyers outnumber machinists 27 to 1 and where five suburban counties rank among the seven wealthiest in the nation -- the fantasies of postindustrial liberalism make perfect sense. The reign of the ''knowledge workers'' seems noble.
 Seen from almost anywhere else, however, these are lousy times. The latest data confirms that as the productivity of workers has increased, the ones reaping the benefits are stockholders. Census data tells us that the only reason family income is keeping up with inflation is that more family members are working. 
 Everything I have written about in this space points to the same conclusion: Democratic leaders must learn to talk about class issues again. But they won't on their own. So pressure must come from traditional liberal constituencies and the grass roots, like the much-vilified bloggers. Liberalism also needs strong, well-funded institutions fighting the rhetorical battle. Laying out policy objectives is all well and good, but the reason the right has prevailed is its army of journalists and public intellectuals. Moving the economic debate to the right are dozens if not hundreds of well-funded Washington think tanks, lobbying outfits and news media outlets. Pushing the other way are perhaps 10.
 The more comfortable option for Democrats is to maintain their present course, gaming out each election with political science and a little triangulation magic, their relevance slowly ebbing as memories of the middle-class republic fade.

HEADLINE: Getting Past Katrina

BYLINE: By Juan Williams. 
Juan Williams, a senior correspondent for NPR and a political analyst for Fox News Channel, is the author of ''Enough: The Phony Leaders, Dead-End Movements and Culture of Failure That Are Undermining Black America.''

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
A YEAR ago this week, the entire nation caught a chilling look in the mirror. We watched as the citizens of New Orleans, clutching their essential belongings in plastic trash bags, struggled through fetid flood waters in search of shelter. But even with all that's been said and written on this painful anniversary, one of the real issues remains unaddressed.
 The shock of Hurricane Katrina awoke many of us to the reality that poverty persists, especially among African-Americans. It persists even after the go-go 1990's, the welfare-to-work reform of the Clinton years and the passage of earned-income tax credits to put more money in the pockets of the working poor. 
In fact, poverty in the United States has been on the rise since the start of the new century. The number of Americans in poverty is now 12.6 percent overall, essentially holding steady after having risen for four years. The number of the nation's children in poverty -- also climbing until last year -- is even more alarming, at close to 18 percent. But even before the great storm, New Orleans was a city of concentrated poverty: nearly a quarter of the population, about double the national average. And the poverty rate among New Orleans blacks (nearly 70 percent of the city's population) was a sky-high 35 percent. 
 For a brief time our guilt and shame seemed to put America on the political edge of a new try at something like a 1960's-era Great Society program. But that newfound energy was squandered amid racial and political arguments. 
 First, the left made the case that the reason the government was failing to help the desperate, bedraggled poor people left behind in New Orleans was that the faces on television were black -- and a Republican administration ruled in Washington. The power of that argument failed when it became apparent that poor white people, both in New Orleans and throughout the Gulf Coast, had also suffered because of FEMA's incompetence. 
 The right, meanwhile, depicted the poor -- that is to say the black poor, because TV cameras focused on the big city -- as looters, rapists and criminals. But when those claims turned out not to be true, there was no return to the core issue of how to help the poor escape poverty. 
 A year later, the best the national political class can do with American poverty is to renew stalemated conversations about increasing the minimum wage. The will to create innovative programs is missing because of a national consensus few people dare to say out loud: Americans believe that the poor can help themselves. 
 A Pew Research Center poll (conducted the week after Hurricane Katrina) found that two-thirds of black Americans and three-quarters of white Americans believe that too many poor people are overly dependent on government aid. Inside those numbers is the sense that welfare programs meant to help the poor create a dependency on handouts, draining people of the confidence, will to work and values that are crucial to success. 
 This is telling, because people of color and especially black Americans are more likely than whites to know someone who is struggling with poverty. According to the Census Bureau, 24.7 percent of black Americans and 21.9 percent of Hispanics lived in poverty in 2004, as compared to 8.6 percent of whites. Interestingly, the same proportion of black Americans who say the black poor need to do more to help themselves also told pollsters that they felt the government would have done more to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina had those victims been white. But it's clear that even with a strong racial consciousness, black people believe that the poor bear some responsibility for their troubles. 
 There is good reason for a majority of Americans to hold that belief. For anyone who wants to get out of poverty, the prescription is clear. 
 Finish high school, at least. Wait until your 20's before marrying, and wait until you're married before having children. Once you're in the work force, stay in: take any job, because building on the experience will prepare you for a better job. Any American who follows that prescription will be at almost no risk of falling into extreme poverty. Statistics show it.
 The suspicion that the poor cause problems for themselves was at the heart of President Clinton's effort to ''end welfare as we know it.'' It is also the guiding principle in the latest wave of poverty programs. Backed by private dollars from nonprofits and foundations, these programs encourage individual responsibility by rewarding the poor for getting high school diplomas, finding jobs and being good parents. There are programs to help determined inner-city residents find good jobs in the suburbs, where they can live in neighborhoods that haven't been defined for generations by the bad schools and rampant crime that breed poverty. The emphasis is on nurturing a will to do better. 
 Bill Cosby's controversial appeal, in 2004, for the poor to see -- and seize -- the opportunities available to them is in line with the inspiring African-American tradition of self-help and reliance on strong families and neighbors. There were complaints that he was blaming the victim, minimizing the power of racism, and failing to understand that larger social forces keep the poor -- especially black poor -- at the bottom of the economic ladder. But Mr. Cosby's critics ignored some sound advice: getting those in need to recognize that there is a way out, and that it's in their power to find it, is the best anti-poverty program. 
 The crisis in New Orleans has now been reduced to a matter of government financing for rebuilding homes while reviving the business community. But the real rebuilding project on the Gulf Coast requires bringing new energy to confronting the poverty of spirit. Because that's what was tearing down the city, long before Hurricane Katrina.

HEADLINE: Drastic Layoffs at Newark Housing Agency Are Defended

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK, Aug. 31 

 BODY:
The head of the embattled Newark Housing Authority said on Thursday that the agency's plan to lay off nearly half of its workers was dictated by unprecedented federal cuts in public housing appropriations and a need to take corrective action to deal with past mismanagement.
 Keith Kinard, the executive director, who took over at the agency three months ago, when the administration of Mayor Cory Booker entered office, said that about 425 of the agency's 989 workers would be laid off in the coming weeks to trim about $11 million in expenses from its approximately $70 million annual budget. 
About 200 of those workers are part-time employees, many of whom live in Housing Authority apartments. 
 Mr. Kinard said the layoffs were intended to address a 20 percent cut in federal subsidies to the agency and make up for its failure to make 10 percent and 15 percent cuts in previous years under the administration of Mayor Sharpe James.
 The leader of the union that represents 90 percent of the agency's workers said that past mismanagement was not a factor driving the steep cutbacks in the agency, which manages 13,000 apartments with 32,000 tenants. 
 Rahaman Muhammad, the president of Local 617 of the Service Employees International Union, said that the cutbacks were almost entirely the result of ''a neoconservative agenda in Washington'' to downsize public housing programs nationally and privatize them. The immediate impact in Newark, he said, was to rob ''a poor city'' of a good number of its middle-class jobs.
 ''They are coming for the workers first, but the tenants are next,'' said Mr. Muhammad, who called on Mr. Kinard, Mayor Booker and others to speak out against the direction in which federally backed housing programs are heading. 
 The layoffs were reported in The Star-Ledger on Thursday. 
 The Newark Housing Authority's failure to make the budget cuts required by federal regulators over the last three years was a big part of the reason for a two-year investigation of the agency that ended in 2005. In addition to finding that the agency's administrators had improperly used capital funds to avoid job cuts, the investigation found that the agency spent lavishly on refurbishing its headquarters, paid millions of dollars to the city for services that could not be documented and improperly used agency funds to buy land for a downtown economic-development project.
 To avert a federal takeover of its operation, the Housing Authority's commissioners agreed to a stringent new set of management and spending restrictions imposed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
 Donna White, a HUD spokeswoman, said that the layoffs planned by Mr. Kinard showed that ''they are moving in the right direction.'' She confirmed that operating subsidies to housing authorities were staying level with last year at about $3.5 billion nationwide, but that some agencies might get increases and others decreases. 
 Both Ms. White and Mr. Kinard spoke of the national requirement for housing authorities to move toward ''asset-based management,'' in which each housing project has its own budget and revenue, much like private housing complexes are run.
 To answer critics, Mr. Kinard said: ''We simply are not an employment agency or a social services agency. At the end of the day we are a property management agency.''
 Mr. Muhammad said that such an attitude troubled him, coming from an official appointed by Mayor Booker.
 ''I supported Cory Booker and I continue to support him,'' Mr. Muhammad said. ''But he has to get out there and fight the federal government on what is happening with public housing and not let them use past mismanagement as an excuse for what they are doing.''

HEADLINE: Canadian Gold Companies Merge Into Giant

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
Goldcorp and Glamis Gold, two Canadian mining companies whose executives have clashed on other takeover deals, agreed yesterday to a friendly merger worth about $21.3 billion.
 When the all-stock transaction is completed, the company will keep Goldcorp's name and its home base in Vancouver, British Columbia; Goldcorp shareholders will own about 60 percent of its stock. Glamis is incorporated in British Columbia, but has executive headquarters in Reno, Nev.
Under the offer, Glamis shareholders will get 1.69 shares of Goldcorp for each Glamis share. Based on Wednesday's closing price, that exchange is worth $51.49, giving Glamis shareholders a premium of just over 32 percent. 
 Executives from the two companies said the merger would allow Goldcorp to compete better in an industry that is increasingly dominated by large multinational mining companies. They estimated that with Glamis, Goldcorp would become the third-largest gold mining company in the world, with annual production of about three million ounces.
 ''What we are looking at now is competing with our peers, the majors, for world-class mines,'' Kevin McArthur, the president and chief executive of Glamis, said during a conference call. Mr. McArthur will assume the same titles at the newly merged Goldcorp.
 Goldcorp's chief executive, Ian Telfer, who will be chairman of the merged company, added, ''It will be the lowest-cost, fastest-growing, unhedged gold company in the world.''
 Not all investors were immediately impressed, however.
 Goldcorp's shares fell $2.81, or 9.22 percent, to $27.66 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. 
 Frank E. Holmes, chairman and chief executive of U.S. Global Investors, a mutual fund company that is a major Goldcorp shareholder, said that for him the deal represents an unwelcome change of strategy for Goldcorp.
 Mr. Holmes said that Goldcorp had been unusually successful to date by acquiring only companies with operating mines that immediately add to its cash flow. By contrast, the Glamis deal will lower Goldcorp's cash flow.
 Both Mr. Telfer and Mr. McArthur said that decline would be more than offset as Glamis properties, particularly a major mine in Mexico, start up or move to full production.
 But mining mergers built around the future, Mr. Holmes said, can be dangerous for investors because of political, environmental and economic issues that can delay or derail mine openings. 
 ''The further you are from pouring a brick of gold, the greater the risks,'' Mr. Holmes said. ''But concentrating on the Warren Buffett model of immediate cash flow is what has made Goldcorp a great performer.''
 During the conference call, Mr. Telfer acknowledged the shift in strategy, but argued that it would ultimately bring even greater gains.
 ''If you look at the two companies, one of them has a fantastic present and the other has a fantastic future,'' he said.
 In 2004, Glamis tried to derail a friendly takeover of Goldcorp by Wheaton River Minerals, which was headed by Mr. Telfer. While Mr. Telfer won that fight (and adopted Goldcorp's name for his company), he and Mr. McArthur had few kind words for each other during the takeover.
 If the new merger is completed, Canada will be home to two major gold mining companies. This year, the Toronto-based Barrick Gold became the world's largest gold producer by acquiring Placer Dome of Vancouver for just over $10 billion.
 There may be further upsets, however. Mr. Holmes said that it was still possible that another mining company might make a hostile bid for Goldcorp.

HEADLINE: LOCKHEED WINS JOB OF BUILDING NEXT SPACESHIP

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY and LESLIE WAYNE; Warren E. Leary reported from Washington for this article and Leslie Wayne from New York. Kenneth Chang contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31 

 BODY:
Lockheed Martin won a multibillion-dollar contract from NASA on Thursday to build the nation's next spaceship for human flight, a craft called Orion that is to replace the space shuttle and eventually carry astronauts to the moon and beyond.
 The much-awaited announcement was a major victory for Lockheed and a startling setback for its rival, a joint venture of Boeing and Northrop Grumman.
Before the announcement, many analysts had said the deal was the Boeing team's to lose. A leader in building unmanned rockets and spacecraft, Lockheed has little experience with human spaceflight; by contrast, Northrop, Boeing and their subsidiaries built not only the space shuttle fleet but the Apollo vehicles that took men to the moon in the 1960's and 70's. 
 In a late-afternoon news conference to announce the decision, NASA was tight-lipped about the reasons, saying the details of the two competing bids were ''proprietary.'' Doug Cooke, a deputy associate administrator who led the selection team, said both proposals ''were sound and carefully prepared.'' 
 Mr. Cooke said the Lockheed Martin design looked ''achievable,'' an indication that it relied more heavily on known technologies than developing new ones. ''This is a design that is based on known capabilities,'' he said.
 The NASA decision is likely to change the dynamics of the space business, setting Lockheed up to be the dominant player in space exploration and perhaps forcing Boeing to rethink its role.
 ''For both companies, this was a make-it-or-break-it award to stay in the manned space business,'' said Brett Lambert, managing director of the Densmore Group, an aerospace consulting firm, adding, ''This decision defines who will continue to be a major player in space for the next 10 years.''
 The plan calls for building a space capsule with an emergency escape tower similar to the Apollo capsule that ferried men to and from the moon. Orion, though, would be much larger than Apollo. The NASA administrator, Michael D. Griffin, who did not speak at the news conference, has called the new ship ''Apollo on steroids.'' 
 Orion is to carry up to six astronauts to the International Space Station; a later version would take four astronauts to the moon, where they would use a separate lander ship to reach the surface. Still later versions could serve as crew-return vehicles for ships that one day may take humans to Mars, NASA officials said.
 The shuttle fleet is to be retired in 2010. Orion is to make its first human flight by 2014, but at Congress's urging NASA hopes to fly at least a year earlier to minimize a gap in the nation's ability to send people into space. The agency is also developing new booster rockets, based on space shuttle technology, to launch Orion and cargo to the moon. The rocket to launch Orion is set to make its first flight in 2009.
 The Orion contract calls for Lockheed Martin to get $3.9 billion through 2013 for designing, developing, testing and evaluating the new craft and building two for initial flights into space. A second stage, from 2009 to 2019, provides $3.5 billion for building an unspecified number of manned ships to go to the space station and the moon, and some cargo-only versions for supplying the station. The contract also includes $750 million for engineering work to modify or improve the ships.
 But some experts say that these numbers are conservative and that NASA projects typically run 50 percent above initial estimates, in part because there is little incentive to stay within budget once a contract has been awarded. 
 Howard McCurdy, a space policy expert at American University in Washington, said that once Boeing's subsidiary Rockwell got the contract to build the space shuttle, ''they had NASA over a barrel -- they were like a monopoly supplier.'' 
 The shuttle program is estimated to have cost around $10 billion since it began in the 1980's. No price tag has been announced for the Bush administration's plan for manned exploration of the moon and Mars, but estimates have run above $200 billion.
 This will be the first time that Lockheed has been given a lead role in manned space flight. It comes after the company failed in a 1996 attempt to design the X-33 space plane, which was to be a replacement for the quarter-century-old shuttle fleet but was abandoned because of technical problems after NASA spent more than $900 million on it. 
 Joan Underwood, a spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin Space Systems, said that even her company would not know the exact reasons for its selection ''until each team is debriefed by NASA in a week or two.'' 
 But she said Lockheed had been the only maker of capsule systems used by NASA since the Apollo program, from the Viking missions to Mars in the 1970's to those of the rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which are still gathering information on Mars.
 ''We are the capsule company,'' she said.
 The big loser on Thursday was Boeing, which has stumbled in its space business lately. Its entry into the commercial space launching business came as commercial demand for satellites began to fall. Its spy satellite program was so plagued with problems that the Pentagon took it away from Boeing and gave it to Lockheed.
 In addition, it was a major contractor for the International Space Station, which has suffered from enormous cost overruns. Its engineers were blamed, in part, for the problems that led to the Columbia shuttle disaster in 2003, and the United States Air Force recently withheld $1 billion of rocket launching contracts from Boeing after it was found that company employees had stolen proprietary documents from Lockheed to compete for Air Force rocket business.
 A victory yesterday would have been a signal that Boeing had turned the corner.
 ''For Boeing, it would have been a real vote of confidence in their ability to manage a major program,'' said John Pike, director of Global Security.org, an aerospace research company.
 Tanya Deason-Sharpe, a Boeing spokeswoman, said that while Boeing was disappointed, it would compete for other manned space vehicle contracts, including the Ares I rocket that will launch Orion into space and the Ares V cargo launcher, also part of the program.
 ''Boeing is bigger than any single contract win or loss,'' she said. 
 The blow to Northrop and Boeing is softened by the prospect of additional work as subcontractors to Lockheed or in other parts of the program.
 Lockheed plans to spread out the work on the program in a number of locations where NASA already has a strong economic and political presence. Work is expected to be done in Houston, where Lockheed estimates that 1,200 new jobs will be created; in Denver, with 500 new jobs; in Florida, with 300; and at the Michoud plant in New Orleans, with 200.
 The announcement was welcomed by members of Congress from those regions. Representative Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat, called it ''great news for Colorado'' and ''a boon to Colorado's aerospace industry, which is third in the nation.''
 While Lockheed and Boeing were the big competitors on this contract, they are partners on other government space contracts. Both are partners in United Space Alliance, a joint venture that provides support services for the shuttle. In addition, Boeing and Lockheed have formed another venture, United Launch Alliance, to jointly provide Air Force rocket launchings.
 Mr. Griffin, the NASA administrator, who has been a forceful presence in the space shuttle fleet's return to orbit after the Columbia disaster, stayed in the background at Thursday's news conference. A spokesman said that the announcement spoke for itself and that Mr. Griffin did not take part because his presence would have been a distraction.

HEADLINE: A Younger India Is Flexing Its Industrial Brawn

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: PUNE, India 

 BODY:
India's economic advancement no longer rests on telephone call centers and computer programmers.
 Among villages with thatch-roofed huts and dirt roads on the outskirts of this city in central India, John Deere and LG Electronics have recently built factories turning out tractors and color television sets for sale in India and for export to the United States.
In Hazira, in northwestern India, where some residents still rely on camels to carry traders' goods, the Essar Group is making steel to be used for ventilation shafts in Philadelphia, high-rise structural beams in Chicago and car engine mountings in Detroit.
 For decades, India followed a route to economic development strikingly different from that of countries like Japan, South Korea or China. While its Asian rivals placed their bets on manufacturing and exports, India focused on its domestic economy and grew more slowly with an emphasis on services. 
 But all that is starting to change.
 India's annual growth in manufacturing output, at 9 percent and accelerating, is close to catching growth in services, at 10 percent. Exports of manufactured goods to the United States are now rising faster in percentage terms than China's, although from a much smaller base. More than two-thirds of foreign investment in the last year has gone into manufacturing in India, not services.
 ''Saying we are a back office and China is a factory is a backhanded compliment,'' said Kamal Nath, India's minister of commerce and industry. ''It's not really correct.''
 Indeed, in interviews at 18 Indian factories and other businesses in 10 cities and villages scattered across the length and breadth of the nation, the picture that emerges is of a country being driven by advances in manufacturing to a much brisker pace of economic growth.
 A prime reason India is now developing into the world's next big industrial power is that a number of global manufacturers are already looking ahead to a serious demographic squeeze facing China. Because of China's ''one child'' policy, family sizes have been shrinking there since the 1980's, so fewer young people will be available soon for factory labor.
 India is not expected to pass China in total population until 2030. But India will have more young workers aged 20 to 24 by 2013; the International Labor Organization predicts that by 2020, India will have 116 million workers in this age bracket to China's 94 million.
 India's young population will also make it a huge and growing market for years to come, while the engineering skills and English skills of its educated elite will make it competitive across a wide range of industries. So even though India remains a difficult place to do business, several multinationals have been placing big bets on India in hopes of taking advantage of this shifting global dynamic.
 General Motors and Motorola are preparing to build plants in western and southern India. Posco of South Korea and Mittal Steel of the Netherlands have each announced plans to erect giant steel mills in eastern India, where Reliance of India will soon construct one of the world's largest coal-fired power plants.
 They are finding India's labor force well suited to their goals. When LG set out in 2005 to fill 458 assembly line jobs at its factory here at a starting wage of $90 a month, it required that each applicant have at least 15 years of education -- usually high school plus technical college.
 Seeking a young work force, the company decided that no more than 1 percent of the workers could have had any prior work experience. Despite the limitation, 55,000 young people met its criteria for interviews.
 ''In the villages there is little income,'' said Siddu Matheapattu, 24, in between applying sealant to refrigerator frames. ''Here I can earn more.''
 By contrast, cities in the export-oriented Guangdong Province in southeastern China raised monthly minimum wages this summer by 18 percent, to $70 to $100 a month, after factories reported that they had one million more jobs than workers to fill them. Factories elsewhere in China face less severe labor shortages, but they also are being forced to raise wages.
 As India has deregulated its economy, output has gradually accelerated to a growth rate of 8 percent a year, feeding a national euphoria and a few hopes of someday even beating China's annual growth of more than 10 percent.
 Plenty of obstacles remain, however, notably India's weak infrastructure. China invests $7 on roads, ports, electricity and other backbones of a modern economy for every dollar spent by India -- and it shows. Ports here are struggling to handle rising exports, blackouts are frequent and dirt roads are common even in Bangalore, the center of the country's sophisticated computer programming industry.
 Pervasive corruption has slowed many efforts to fix these problems. India's labor laws, little changed since they were enacted just after independence in 1947, also continue to discourage companies from hiring workers, by making it very difficult to lay off employees even if a company's fortunes sour or the economy slows.
 Still, a new optimism prevails in India, bordering at times on euphoria.
 ''The Chinese are very good at copying things, but Indians believe in quality work, we believe in meeting pollution norms,'' said S. S. Pathania, the assistant general manager of the Hero Honda motorcycle factory in Gurgaon, 30 miles south of New Delhi. ''I think India will pass China very soon.''

An Unexpected Boom In Manufacturing
 Sprawling across more than a square mile next to a gray tidal estuary, the scale of the Essar Group's complex in Hazira is already impressive. Essar has its own port to bring in iron ore and its own large gas-fired power plant for electricity. At the steel mill, giant buckets pour 150 tons of molten metal at a time to form slabs 2 yards wide and up to 10 yards long.
 But the complex is just starting to grow. Essar is quintupling steel production and pushing forward a sevenfold increase in power generation, most of it for sale to a national grid desperately short of electricity.
 Growth on that scale, especially in industries like steel and power but also in areas like car parts and household appliances, is what India has long lacked. Industrial production accounts for only a fifth of India's economic output, compared with two-fifths of China's. But this ratio is starting to rise in India as manufacturing, led by exports, grows faster than agriculture and even some service industries.
 Until recently, legislation effectively barred companies with more than 100 employees from competing in many industries. The laws were intended to protect tiny businesses in villages, often employing women and minorities; high tariffs were placed on imports as well.
 But a result was hundreds of thousands of businesses too small to be competitive; India lags behind even the impoverished Bangladesh next door in exports of garments, a big creator of jobs for China. The Indian government has responded by narrowing the list of protected industries to 326 categories of goods from 20,000 and has lowered tariffs.
 Comparing factories in India to their competitors in China, many of the Indian factories are smaller but some appear more efficient. 
 India's stronger financial system demands higher interest rates than China's state-owned banks, making it costlier to hold the small mountains of components awaiting assembly that are often seen in Chinese factories. The Confederation of Indian Industry, a national trade group, has also been highly successful in pushing companies to adopt the latest Japanese lean manufacturing techniques.
 The drawback is that the nation's manufacturing boom, built on higher-quality goods made under more modern conditions than in China, is not likely to create as many factory jobs as India needs. 
 The Essar steel mill, for example, has been replacing old, labor-intensive equipment with more modern gear. ''We were having it all done manually, but because the customers demand very high quality, we have to do it automatically,'' yelled Rajesh Pandita, an Essar manager, over the roar of a house-size machine that was stretching a minivan-size coil of steel back and forth through large rollers until it was little thicker than plastic kitchen wrap.
 The Whirlpool factory in Pune uses machines, not people, to fold the steel exteriors of refrigerators. It has some of the highest productivity per worker of any Whirlpool factory in the world, with just 208 line workers producing up to 33,000 refrigerators a month.
 Labor laws, however, discourage flexibility. They still ban companies from allowing manufacturing workers to put in more than 54 hours of overtime in a three-month period even if the workers want to earn extra money. Firing workers is extremely difficult.
 ''Companies think twice, 10 times before they hire new people,'' said Sunil Kant Munjal, the chairman of the Hero Group, one of the world's largest manufacturers of inexpensive motorcycles.
 Hero in Gurgaon, on the southern outskirts of New Delhi, and its archrival, the Lifan Group in Chongqing, a city in western China, produce comparable motorcycles but the similarity ends there. Hero markets heavily to its domestic market, protected from foreign competition by high import tariffs, while Lifan emphasizes exports.
 With scant ventilation, Lifan's factories are filled with diesel exhaust as workers test engines and ride finished bikes at breakneck speed out the doors, zigzagging past co-workers. Hero's factory in Gurgaon, where Honda holds a minority stake, has far better safety standards and excellent ventilation.
 The Lifan factory pays less than $100 a month. The heavily unionized Hero factory pays $150 a month plus bonuses of up to $370 a month; nearly half the workers earn the top bonus, Mr. Pathania said.
 Lifan's labor force is quiescent -- would-be organizers of independent labor unions face long jail terms or worse in China. Hero's workers staged a successful nonviolent protest in 2005 to call for more contract workers to be eligible for the bonuses as well.

Bad Roads and Blackouts Take a Toll on Efficiency
 But the biggest question mark hanging over the rise of manufacturing in India lies in whether the country has enough roads, ports and electricity-generating plants to move huge quantities of goods and power the factories that make them.
 Captain Abhay Srivastava, an operations manager at India's busiest port, was on duty on a recent afternoon when a phone call suddenly came in from the docks below. An enormous container ship from Qatar needed to slide 35 feet backward along the privately managed dock at the Nhava Sheva port near Mumbai to allow another large vessel to squeeze into the dock in front of it.
 Captain Srivastava grabbed his white hard hat and dashed for the elevator. As soon as he reached the water's edge, a dozen laborers in orange jumpsuits began straining to arrange a cat's cradle of heavy, five-inch-thick ropes that would allow the ship to use its powerful winches to pull itself out of the way.
 ''They are efficient people; they don't speak a lot,'' said Captain Srivastava, who has visited most of the world's major ports either as a ship captain or for port training exercises. ''You go to some places and they just stand around.''
 The efficiency of the Nhava Sheva port -- it approaches West Coast ports in the United States in the number of containers moved per hour -- shows that India is capable of producing world-class facilities.
 But big as it is, Nhava Sheva is too small to handle the crush of traffic. John Deere tractors wait in a container at the dock for one to four days before being loaded on a ship.
 ''If this pace of growth continues, we will see more congestion at the port,'' said Raj Kalathur, the managing director and chief executive of Deere's operations in India.
 Similar worries prevail in Chennai, formerly Madras. ''Another four or five years, we'll be choked,'' said M. Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of the Farida Group, a 9,000-employee shoe manufacturer in Chennai that needs the port for exports.
 Infrastructure improvements are particularly important because manufacturing companies are buying more and more components from far-flung suppliers. Making sure all those parts arrive on time requires a reliable transportation system.
 ''Manufacturing is no longer done all under one roof,'' said Victor Fung, the chairman of the Li & Fung Group, a large Hong Kong-based company that buys goods from factories across Asia for sale to retailers and wholesalers in the United States and Europe. 
 Indian officials are talking about expansion. Planning is under way for new wharves at Nhava Sheva, but the years-long task of construction has not yet started.
 China has faced capacity problems, too. A surge in steel production in early 2004 overwhelmed bulk cargo ports. Inflation quintupled in a year, to 5.3 percent, as bottlenecks at ports, highways, railroads and elsewhere in China drove up companies' costs.
 The Chinese response was swift and decisive. The pace of port investment nearly tripled in six months. Work crews labored around the clock to erect more cranes and expand wharves.
 The Chinese economy grew at a breathtaking pace of 11.3 percent in the second quarter of 2006, but consumer prices were just 1 percent higher in July than a year earlier.
 By contrast, India is struggling with 8 percent inflation this summer as bottlenecks have appeared after three years of 8 percent growth.
 Belatedly, India's roads and ports are improving. Just four years ago, Sona Koyo Steering Systems, an auto parts manufacturer, incurred hefty financing costs to keep a month's inventory on hand in case deliveries were delayed. Now its factory in Gurgaon makes six deliveries a day to a nearby Maruti car assembly plant; the eight-mile drive takes an hour or more because of traffic jams, but the deliveries get through.
 ''I'm not going to deny infrastructure is bad,'' said Surinder Kapur, Sona's chairman and managing director. ''But a lot of our vendors are around us, a lot of our customers are close to us.''
 India is also starting to address chronic power shortages. But it is still a serious problem in northern India, where Mr. Kapur has his steering systems factory. He receives electricity from the national grid just seven or eight hours a day. So the factory has three enormous diesel generators, one bigger than a typical Manhattan living room, operating at four times what an industrial user in the United States usually pays.
 Despite such obstacles, India's manufacturing sector appears poised for further growth. In a country where the national symbol has shifted from government bureaucrats at aging desks to call center operators in cubicles, it looks as if the next icon will be the laptop-toting engineer on a factory floor.
 ''The old philosophy was, 'I should work in an office, come in at 10 and leave at 4,' '' said Nitin Kulkarni, 35, an engineer at the Hazira steel mill. But in recent years, he added, ''there has been a revolution.''

HEADLINE: Shares Tread Water as Investors Await a Report on Jobs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street ended an aimless session barely lower yesterday after investors shrugged off comments about productivity by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and awaited the government's August employment report. The major indexes ended August with gains.
 With Mr. Bernanke saying little to inspire the market in light preholiday trading, investors decided against making major moves in advance of today's report on nonfarm payrolls. Wall Street is keeping a close eye on the unemployment rate both as an indicator of how quickly the economy is slowing and out of concerns over wage inflation. 
There are questions among investors about whether the economy has slowed enough to ward off further interest rate increases.
 Also yesterday, the Labor Department released figures showing a drop in the number of recently laid-off workers filing for unemployment benefits. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed modestly lower, down 1.76, or 0.02 percent, at 11,381.15. The Dow showed gains in each of the previous three sessions, and remains at a three-month high. For August over all, the Dow rose 1.8 percent, its best showing since April.
 Broader stock indicators also declined. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.45, or 0.03 percent, to 1,303.82, while the Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.98, or 0.09 percent, to 2,183.75. The S.& P. 500 had its strongest month since January, rising 2.1 percent, while the Nasdaq added 4.4 percent for its best month since November.
 ''I didn't think any major market-moving number came out; everything was in line with what was expected,'' said David Sowerby, chief market analyst at Loomis Sayles. ''We're not getting anything earth-moving out of a majority of the retail sales reports. And, as for Bernanke, there's been enough that's trickled out of the Fed for investors to feel there's a better chance for neutrality versus a month ago.''
 In bonds, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.73 percent, from 4.75 percent late Wednesday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, increased 7/32, to 101 5/32. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies. Gold prices rose.
 Oil prices, which had generally eased as Tropical Storm Ernesto veered away from oil infrastructure along the Gulf Coast, advanced amid continuing political tensions with Iran over its nuclear program. Crude prices settled up 27 cents, to $70.30 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 In corporate news, several retailers posted improved same-store sales results for August, the crucial back-to-school buying period. Wal-Mart Stores, Limited Brands and Federated Department Stores, the parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, posted gains in sales at stores open at least a year. Wal-Mart rose 10 cents, to $44.72, while Limited gained 54 cents, to $25.73. Federated rose 51 cents, to $37.98.
 Ford Motor said it was considering the sale of all or part of its Aston Martin luxury line as it seeks to generate cash for its North American turnaround plan. News of Ford's latest plan pushed its shares up 10 cents, or 1.21 percent, to $8.37.
 Goldcorp, a Canadian gold producer, agreed to buy a rival, Glamis Gold, for about $8.6 billion in stock. Glamis shares surged $7.26, or 19 percent, to $46.12. Goldcorp shares fell $2.81, or 9.22 percent, to $27.66 after announcing the deal, which would create one of the world's largest gold producers.
 Dow Chemical gained 23 cents, rising to $38.13 after announcing plans to close several plants outside the United States to trim annual operating costs by $160 million.
 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock closed up 1.69 percent. At the close, Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.39 percent, Germany's DAX index dropped 0.14 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.34 percent.

HEADLINE: It's High-Tech vs. Smokestack, With Lots of Money to Be Made

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
After becoming chief executive of PG&E last year, Peter Darbee met with a large number of leading climate scientists, he said, to make up his own mind about global warming. 
 As a result of his wide inquiries, PG&E, the parent of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, which serves Northern California and is one of the nation's largest energy utilities, broke away from the industry pack to support sweeping efforts to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions that are widely blamed for global warming.
''The evidence in the scientific community is lopsided -- it's not even close,'' Mr. Darbee said. ''Climate change is a problem.''
 California is once again at the forefront of the nation's environmental policy, with a far-reaching pledge to curb carbon emissions by 2020. But the deal struck on Wednesday between Democratic legislators and the Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has divided businesses and industries in California. 
 While high-technology companies have lined up behind the move, arguing that it will put California at the forefront of alternative energy development, most of those representing basic industries contend that it will retard the economy, force energy-intensive businesses out of state and increase costs for all Californians.
 Mr. Darbee, a former investment banker and financial expert who brings an outsider's perspective to the inbred utility industry, cuts across those lines, pointing to a potential advantage for business in California: predictability. 
 ''The incentives really aren't there for the creation of new technologies and investments to reduce carbon dioxide unless mandatory caps are put in place,'' he said. ''Now, that creates an element of certainty.'' 
 The California plan, which won final legislative approval yesterday but faces a battle in the courts before it can go into effect, calls for a 25 percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2020. It envisions controls on some of the largest industrial groups -- including utilities, oil refineries and cement plants.
 While many of the details remain to be worked out, the law will include a mixture of mandatory regulations, incentives and market-based mechanisms, including a so-called cap-and-trade system allowing companies to buy and sell carbon allowances. The California Air Resources Board has until 2009 to draft regulations that are to become mandatory in 2012. 
 ''The United States is the world's biggest carbon emitter, and California is a big part of it,'' said Jim Marston, who runs the state global warming initiative at the activist group Environmental Defense, which has played a big role in California and elsewhere in promoting alternative energy use. ''The key aspect of the law is that it's multisector and it imposes hard caps.''
 Given a lack of national policy toward global warming, local and state authorities are increasingly taking the matter into their own hands, creating a patchwork of competing rules that will be potentially harder for businesses to navigate. Seven states in the Northeast, for example, have proposed to reduce carbon emissions from power producers 10 percent by 2019.
 Mr. Marston acknowledged that a system adopted by the European Union in response to the Kyoto Protocol to curb global warming gases had not been very effective.
 ''No system we have works perfectly,'' he said. ''The cap-and-trade system in Europe has some flaws because they didn't do a great job with the baseline. California will learn from what went wrong in Europe.''
 California has had a long tradition of leading the way in environmental regulations that in time are adopted by other states and cities across the country. The federal Clean Air Act of 1970, for example, originated in efforts starting in the 1960's to limit smog in Southern California.
 In 2004, the state became the first to adopt regulations intended to limit greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles. Several states in the Northeast, including New York, have followed suit. A coalition of the world's largest automakers, which opposed the regulations from the beginning, is suing many of these states to prevent the laws from taking effect.
 The restrictions, scheduled to go into effect on 2009 model vehicles, roiled the global auto industry because automakers would have to increase fuel economy to meet them.
 Unlike smog-forming pollutants, carbon dioxide and other emissions from vehicle tailpipes that are linked to global warming cannot be filtered. Reducing those emissions would therefore require redesigning engines, which would increase the cost of building a vehicle.
 But for Jack Stewart, the president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, an industry trade group, California's go-it-alone approach risks harming the competitiveness of the economy.
 ''We think it is draconian,'' he said, ''for the state of California to put these California-only rules when companies outside of the state will not have the same restrictions and costs imposed on them.''
 It is not clear how California will accomplish its goals. Companies have traditionally found that reducing their carbon emissions could be best achieved by improving energy efficiency. Large corporations, including I.B.M., DuPont and Johnson & Johnson, have found that steps to curb energy use through efficiency gains not only cut their power bills but often led to overall gains in productivity.
 Mr. Stewart, though, argued that such ''low-hanging fruits'' were harder to find in California today because the state had long been at the forefront of the energy-efficiency effort. ''California's energy costs are the highest in the country,'' he said. ''Most manufacturers who use a lot of energy have already done a lot of conservation. This law puts us at a huge disadvantage.'' 
 Myron Ebell, director of energy policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington, and a prominent critic of efforts to curb global warming, also dismissed the California plan. 
 ''We cannot reduce our carbon emissions by making ourselves poorer,'' he said. ''That is not acceptable in a democratic society. It might work in North Korea, but it will not work here. If global warming turns out to be a problem, we have to work on technological changes. All of that is something California has tremendous capacity to do -- not by going on an energy diet.'' 
 But the backers of the law said that developing new energy sources and emphasizing efficiency would actually help expand California's economy.
 They cited a recently published study by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, which argued that cutting carbon emissions back to 1990 levels would add $74 billion in value, or 3 percent, and contribute to the creation of 89,000 jobs.
 ''There is a great deal of energy efficiency still left in California that will produce both lower greenhouse gases and lower the consumption of fossil fuels,'' one of the Berkeley researchers, Alexander E. Farrell, said.
 Jim Wunderman, president and chief executive of the Bay Area Council, a coalition of businesses in and around San Francisco, said the new emissions legislation would allow California businesses to be at the forefront of developing energy technology, much as they were with personal computers, semiconductors and the Internet.
 ''We think this is going to contribute to a boom in industries focused on alternative energy development,'' Mr. Wunderman said. ''Enlightened businesses can participate in an economic boom that's going to serve both the business interest and the public's interest."
 And a leading venture capitalist, John Doerr, a partner in the firm of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in Palo Alto, said the new rules would force corporations to innovate. 
 ''The folks who don't change, they lose, they die,'' he said. ''I do not see it as a system that's going to encourage businesses to leave California." 
 Still, adapting to such new regulations should be easier for companies that make semiconductors and computer keyboards than for those that make cement or refine oil. Mr. Doerr predicted that most industries would come around in the end because they would be squeezed by the costs associated with not complying. 
 ''Manufacturers are going to go green,'' he said. 
 There is already evidence of this in the oil industry, he continued, with companies investing in alternative forms of energy like biofuels. And technology companies are in a strong position to innovate.
 ''High-tech industries thrive on innovation and new technology,'' Mr. Doerr said. ''Already, it's even easier for them to be nimble, and shift and respond to different market mechanisms.'' 
 In the end, he predicted, it will make more sense for most businesses to stay and adapt. 
 ''It doesn't matter where they make this stuff, '' Mr. Doerr said, ''because if you put the gasoline refinery across the border in Nevada, the same law applies. If you want, you can decide you don't want to sell gasoline in the sixth-largest economy in the world, but I guarantee you won't do that."
 And if California succeeds, Mr. Doerr said, the rest of the nation will follow. 
 ''Every new, important, environmentally sustainable policy has come from California and spread to other states,'' he said. ''Then the federal government decides we ought to consolidate this.''

HEADLINE: Highly Enriched Uranium Is Found at an Iranian Plant

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO; William J. Broad and David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: VIENNA, Aug. 31 

 BODY:
The global nuclear monitoring agency deepened suspicions on Thursday about Iran's nuclear program, reporting that inspectors had discovered new traces of highly enriched uranium at an Iranian facility.
 Inspectors have found such uranium, which at extreme enrichment levels can fuel bombs, twice in the past. The International Atomic Energy Agency concluded that at least some of those samples came from contaminated equipment that Iran had obtained from Pakistan.
But in this case, the nuclear fingerprint of the particles did not match the other samples, an official familiar with the inspections said, raising questions about their origin.
 In a six-page report to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday, the agency withheld judgment about where the material came from and whether it could be linked to a secret nuclear program. 
 Iran says that its nuclear program is intended only for the production of energy, which would use uranium enriched at far lower levels than the sample described in the report. 
 As expected, the report confirmed that Iran had continued producing enriched uranium, but only on a small scale and at relatively low levels, at its vast Natanz facility. 
 Thursday was the deadline set by the Security Council for Iran to freeze its enrichment-related activities. Iran's failure to comply means that it is vulnerable to further punitive action, perhaps economic and political penalties, either by the entire Council or a smaller group of countries led by the United States.
 In a speech at the American Legion national convention in Salt Lake City, President Bush ratcheted up his warning to the Iranian leadership, saying that the war in Lebanon and Iran's support for Hezbollah ''made it clearer than ever that the world now faces a grave threat from the radical regime in Iran.''
 He concluded by saying that while he was committed to a diplomatic solution to the confrontation with Iran, ''There must be consequences for Iran's defiance, and we must not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.''
 The European Union foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, and Iran's nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, are to meet in Europe next week in a final attempt to seek a way out of the impasse. Afterward, the major world powers will meet in Europe to discuss Iran's case. But Russia and China are resisting sanctions and Iran has shrugged off all threats, vowing to continue its nuclear activities even as it seeks negotiations.
 As in the past, the nuclear agency painted a confusing and incomplete picture of the state of Iran's nuclear program, underscoring the limits of outside inspectors whose access to Iran's nuclear sites was curtailed by Iran early this year.
 On one hand, the report makes clear that, as the official familiar with the inspections said, ''Inspectors have not uncovered any concrete proof that Iran's nuclear program is of a military nature.''
 On the other hand, the report captures the long pattern of confusion, stonewalling, partial disclosure of information and a minimum of cooperation under Iran's international obligations to the agency and details new suspicious activities.
 Since February, when the agency referred the Iran dossier to the Security Council, Iran has drastically reduced the access of the international inspectors. The decision has limited or blocked inspections of hundreds of the country's atomic sites, programs and personnel; the result is more uncertainty and less information about Iran's progress in mastering the basics of uranium and plutonium, the foundations for both producing electricity and building bombs.
 Most noteworthy in the report was the discovery of particles of highly enriched uranium on a container at a waste storage facility at Karaj, not far from Tehran.
 The particles were taken from the container for testing a year ago, but the agency obtained the result only a few weeks ago because of the limited capacity of its verification laboratory.
 In late 2003, the discovery of traces of highly enriched uranium in Iran touched off international concern about the country's nuclear intentions and raised questions about where the material had originated. Another find of the radioactive material earlier this year redoubled the sense of alarm.
 But Thursday's disclosure was different, diplomats said. ''This is the first case with no known linkage,'' said one European diplomat who could not be quoted by name because of diplomatic rules. ''But we have to be careful because over time these things can be explained away, at least in theory.''
 Robert Joseph, the under secretary of state for arms control and international security, was cautious in talking about the new evidence, but said, ''We need to be very concerned that Iran may well be undertaking experiments, and may be undertaking the construction of centrifuge machines, out of sight of I.A.E.A. inspectors.''
 Highly enriched uranium, containing 80 percent or more of the rare uranium-235 isotope, is considered bomb grade and can be fashioned into the core of a nuclear weapon.
 Iran says its atomic program is meant to enrich uranium to the low levels of up to 5 percent for the production of nuclear power, but the United States calls that effort a cover for the acquisition of a nuclear arsenal.
 The agency has written to Iran asking for an explanation of the source of the highly enriched particles, but has not received a response.
 The report did not specify the level of the particles or whether they were weapons-grade quality. The official who was discussing the report refused to be drawn into that discussion, suggesting that such a definition was meaningless. ''You cannot say weapons-grade, but very high,'' he said.
 The report also concluded that Iran had continued to produce enriched uranium but on a modest scale, despite claims of various Iranian officials of plans to build and operate thousands of gas centrifuges on an industrial scale.
 Indeed, Iran has built and operated only one 164-machine cascade or set of centrifuges, and other isolated machines.
 Over the summer, the centrifuges did not produce enriched uranium continuously, but only for a few days and then often operated empty, the report said.
 In addition, only a few kilograms of nuclear material was fed into the machines; only a small amount of uranium -- tens of grams -- was enriched, the official said.
 ''The qualitative and quantitative development of Iran's enrichment program continues to be fairly limited,'' the official said. He added, ''From a technical point of view, we have not seen a very extensive experimentation with those machines.''
 The program appears to be lagging behind Iran's stated deadline to install 3,000 centrifuges at Natanz in the last quarter of this year.
 The report documented Iran's refusal last summer to allow inspectors into an underground part of the Natanz facility and to give inspectors multiple-entry one-year visas for easy access to the country. Iranian officials since have backed down. 
 The report also faulted Iran for once again failing to answer questions and provide documents and access on a wide range of issues, some of which have been outstanding for more than three years.
 ''There is a standstill'' in resolving these issues, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of normal diplomatic rules. The agency, he added, is losing confidence that it can give the world assurances about the ''completeness'' of Iran's program.

HEADLINE: The Big Disconnect

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
Thomas L. Friedman is on vacation.

 BODY:
There are still some pundits out there lecturing people about how great the economy is. But most analysts seem to finally realize that Americans have good reasons to be unhappy with the state of the economy: although G.D.P. growth has been pretty good for the last few years, most workers have seen their wages lag behind inflation and their benefits deteriorate.
 The disconnect between overall economic growth and the growing squeeze on many working Americans will probably play a big role this November, partly because President Bush seems so out of touch: the more he insists that it's a great economy, the angrier voters seem to get. But the disconnect didn't begin with Mr. Bush, and it won't end with him, unless we have a major change in policies. 
The stagnation of real wages -- wages adjusted for inflation -- actually goes back more than 30 years. The real wage of nonsupervisory workers reached a peak in the early 1970's, at the end of the postwar boom. Since then workers have sometimes gained ground, sometimes lost it, but they have never earned as much per hour as they did in 1973. 
 Meanwhile, the decline of employer benefits began in the Reagan years, although there was a temporary improvement during the Clinton-era boom. The most crucial benefit, employment-based health insurance, has been in rapid decline since 2000.
 Ordinary American workers seem to understand the long-term disconnect between economic growth and their own fortunes better than most political analysts. Consider, for example, the results of a new poll of American workers by the Pew Research Center.
 The center finds that workers perceive a long-term downward trend in their economic status. A majority say that it's harder to earn a decent living than it was 20 or 30 years ago, and a plurality say that job benefits are worse too. 
 Are workers simply viewing the past through rose-colored glasses? The report seems to imply that they are: a section pointing out that workers surveyed in 1997 also said that it had gotten harder to make a decent living is titled, ''As usual, people say things were better in the good old days.'' 
 But as we've seen, real wages have been declining since the 1970's, so it makes sense that workers have consistently said that it's harder to make a living today than it was a generation ago. 
 On the other side, workers' concern about worsening benefits is new. In 1997, a plurality of workers said that employment benefits were better than they used to be. That made sense: in 1997, the health care crisis, which had been a big political issue a few years earlier, seemed to have gone into remission. Medical costs were relatively stable, and in a tight labor market, employers were competing to offer improved benefits. Workers felt, rightly, that benefits were pretty good by historical standards.
 But now the health care crisis is back, both because medical costs are rising rapidly and because we're living in an increasingly Wal-Martized economy, in which even big, highly profitable employers offer minimal benefits. Employment-based insurance began a steep decline with the 2001 recession, and the decline has continued in spite of economic recovery. 
 The latest Census report on incomes, poverty and health insurance, released this week, shows that in 2005, four years into the economic expansion, the percentage of Americans with private insurance of any kind reached its lowest level since 1987. And Americans feel, again correctly, that benefits are worse than they used to be.
 Why have workers done so badly in a rich nation that keeps getting richer? That's a matter of dispute, although I believe there's a large political component: what we see today is the result of a quarter-century of policies that have systematically reduced workers' bargaining power.
 The important question now, however, is whether we're finally going to try to do something about the big disconnect. Wages may be difficult to raise, but we won't know until we try. And as for declining benefits -- well, every other advanced country manages to provide everyone with health insurance, while spending less on health care than we do.
 The big disconnect, in other words, provides as good an argument as you could possibly want for a smart, bold populism. All we need now are some smart, bold populist politicians.

HEADLINE: From California, a Breakthrough

 BODY:
California, long a leader on environmental issues, has done it again, approving a pathbreaking bill that would impose the country's broadest and most stringent controls on emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas. California's action stands in bold and welcome contrast to the federal government's reluctance to take aggressive action on a problem of mounting concern among scientists and the general public. 
 The deal between the state's Democratic leadership and its Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, would reduce California's carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. This is by any measure a huge undertaking. It will be up to state agencies, chiefly the California Air Resources Board, to work out the details, but the plan allows for market-based mechanisms like emissions trading to achieve the maximum possible gains at the lowest cost.
 Of the bill's many architects, the most important were two Democratic members of the Assembly, Fabian Nunez and Fran Pavley. Ms. Pavley was also the author of another groundbreaking measure four years ago limiting carbon dioxide emissions from cars and light trucks. That measure, which Mr. Schwarzenegger also embraces, is now the subject of a lawsuit from the automobile companies and the Bush administration.
 Taken together with other state actions -- including an important agreement among several Northeastern states to limit carbon dioxide emissions from power plants -- California's assertiveness has suggested to some people that the country may be at a transformational moment on climate change, with the states leading a powerful ''bottom-up'' movement to deal with the problem.
 That could well be so, but a global problem cannot be solved by state and regional initiatives, however admirable and necessary. There is no real substitute for determined action at the national level, since states that make the necessary capital investments to reduce emissions could well end up at a temporary economic disadvantage. Nor is there any substitute for American leadership globally; China and India, two big polluters and getting bigger, are unlikely to undertake costly controls while the world's biggest polluter sits on its hands. 
 Given California's size and economic reach, its initiative will surely help. But Congress and President Bush are by no means off the hook.

HEADLINE: Canada to Arm Its Border Guards

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MASON

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 31 

 BODY:
Responding to a demand from border guards for weapons to defend themselves and combat criminals, the federal government said Thursday that it would begin arming guards in September 2007. 
 Prime Minister Stephen Harper said some guards would begin receiving firearms next fall, with about 150 expected to be armed by March 2008. But it will take at least a decade to arm all of the nearly 5,000 guards along Canada's southern border, Mr. Harper said. That part of the border runs 3,145 miles on land and nears 4,000 miles when water boundaries are included. 
The plan calls for 500 to 600 guards to be armed each year over the course of the program. 
 Mr. Harper, announcing the plan at a crossing south of Vancouver, British Columbia, said the move was ''vital to our country's economy, and will protect the safety and security of all of our local communities.'' 
 The plan will also add a second guard at crossings that now have only one on duty, an increase of 400 guards at a cost of about $91 million. 
 Larger crossings, like the one at Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, will remain relatively unaffected at first because the Royal Canadian Mounted Police already provide armed security there. The guards at airports will not receive firearms because armed police officers are present. 
 The unarmed guards, members of the Canada Border Services Agency, have walked off the job several times in the past year, saying they need guns to defend the border and themselves. The union representing them threatened a strike over the issue in 2005. In January, Canadian guards in British Columbia fled their posts amid reports that two gun-wielding suspects were headed north for the border. Armed American officials apprehended the suspects. 
 That incident came days after a federal election campaign that pitted the long-ruling Liberal Party against Mr. Harper's Conservatives. The Liberal Party opposed the arming of border guards, offering instead to add armed officers of the mounted police at the busiest crossings. Mr. Harper promised more border guards and firearms for them. 
 Some experts see the move as an acknowledgment that border security is a growing concern, even if it comes at the expense of smooth-flowing border traffic. 
 ''It's a move away from the border being a place where essentially we collect taxes -- recognition that it has a real security component to it that directly affects the safety and security of Canadians,'' Scott Newark, a security expert, said in a television interview. 
 Since taking office in February, Mr. Harper has tried to improve relations with the White House through an increased role in Afghanistan, a greater willingness to settle trade disputes and a more conservative stance on social issues. 
 Mr. Harper's decision to arm guards may allay fears in the United States that Canada is not doing its part to secure the border. When 17 homegrown terrorism suspects were arrested in Toronto in June, several American newspapers ran editorials questioning the attention paid to the Canadian border at a time when most of the focus was on Mexico.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Board Supports Giving China and 3 Others Bigger Voices on Policy 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund's executive board, responding to appeals by the United States, has taken a step toward giving more of a voice to China and three other developing countries in setting policy on global economic matters, the fund announced on Friday. 
 The fund said that the board also endorsed a two-year process that would eventually give more weight to economic growth and performance as criteria for apportioning voting rights on the fund, but details remain to be worked out.
Besides China, the countries that would get a bigger share of voting rights are Mexico, South Korea and Turkey. These and other expanding countries could see their influence increase even more at the end of the two-year process, fund officials said.
 Votes on the board's decisions are expected later this month in Singapore at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. is planning to attend the sessions.
 The United States has pressed for a greater voting share for the fast-growing countries of Asia, South America and parts of Europe to make them more involved in the fund's main task of bailing countries out of financial crises.
 The Bush administration has also sought a greater share for China because it wants the fund to play a more aggressive role in monitoring capital flows and any possible cases of currency manipulation by member countries. 
 The administration has complained that China has kept the value of its currency, the yuan, artificially low to make its exports cheaper to people paying in dollars. Partly as a result of its effort to keep the yuan from rising, China has amassed nearly $1 trillion in dollar-denominated reserves.
 Timothy D. Adams, the under secretary of the Treasury for international economics, welcomed the board's move on Friday. 
 Rodrigo de Rato, the fund's managing director, said, ''The executive board's decision represents an endorsement of fundamental reform that will enable the fund to evolve to meet the challenges of a changing global economy.''
 The changes were small but seen as symbolically significant. China's share of the votes at the I.M.F., which has 184 members, would climb to 3.719 percent from 2.98 percent. The voting weights of South Korea, Mexico and Turkey would jump by even smaller amounts. The United States has about 17 percent of the voting rights and the European Union has about 23 percent.

HEADLINE: Jobs and Wages Increased Modestly Last Month 

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Job growth seems to be reaching its peak. Employers added a modest 128,000 jobs in August while wages inched up, confirming that economic activity is slowing from its brisk pace earlier this year to a more sustainable rate, a government report yesterday showed. 
 The report eased the concerns of many that wage growth might push inflation higher, or that the weak housing market might abruptly slow the economy. But at the same time, the report also underscored how little the economic recovery has done for the pay of workers.
''Wages are still swimming upriver,'' said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist for Goldman Sachs. ''Sometimes it's harder and sometimes it's less hard. But it's still upriver.'' 
 The number of jobs added in August fitted into the pattern of the previous four months, when employment grew by 117,000 jobs, on average, about 50,000 a month less than in the previous year, according to the Labor Department. The gain was enough to push the unemployment rate down to 4.7 percent from 4.8 percent in July. 
 But wages kept treading water. Hourly earnings for typical private- sector workers -- excluding managers -- inched up 2 cents in August, to $16.79, about 3.9 percent higher than a year earlier. While the government has not yet released pricing data for August, inflation has been topping 4 percent in recent months, so it is likely that the increase in pay will be swallowed by rising prices as it has for the last two years.
 The tableau of a gradually cooling economy was further supported by a government report that construction spending declined by 1.2 percent in July, the biggest drop in nearly five years -- while spending on home building tumbled 2 percent. 
 Moreover, the Institute for Supply Management's index of factory activity slipped in August, and the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment declined as well, adding further to the picture of a slowing economy. 
 The data sent stock and bond prices higher, as it suggested to investors that the Federal Reserve -- which held interest rates steady at its meeting last month after 17 straight increases since June 2004 -- will refrain from raising rates again at its next meeting on Sept. 20.
 The August job numbers are the latest in a series of economic reports measuring American incomes. The disparate picture from each data release shows how differently the job market has performed for different kinds of workers. 
 Most individual workers' wages are barely keeping up with inflation. And while households have more money to spend, that is mainly because more people are working in each household. Over all, wage earners at the top of the income scale are doing far better than those at the bottom. 
 This being election season, the administration and Congressional Democrats seized on the job numbers from yesterday to underscore, respectively, how strong and how weak the labor market is.
 Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez pointed to the low unemployment rate, which remains below the average of the last three decades. ''This is something workers throughout the country should feel very good about,'' he said. 
 Mr. Gutierrez argued that the hourly earnings exclude health insurance and other benefits paid by employers and are not the best measure of the well-being of workers. He pointed instead to the rapid increase in disposable income, an after-tax measure that includes wages, dividends and other sources of income and which rose by 2.5 percent in July compared with a year earlier, after accounting for inflation.
 But Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the senior Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee, said that workers were being squeezed between stagnating wages and rising energy costs, while many have lost their health insurance. ''Most working families are beginning to sense this is a very difficult economy for them,'' Mr. Reed said. 
 The Labor Department report, because it excludes management, accounts for only about 80 percent of workers in the private sector outside of agriculture. The pay figures also exclude employer contributions to the health and pension benefits of workers, as well as bonuses. 
 At first blush, these workers' wages seem to have risen briskly. The 3.9 percent annual rise recorded in August is not far below the 4.4 percent increase reported in April 1998, its peak month during the Internet-driven boom. The difference this time around is that inflation, driven mostly by an increase in oil prices, has eaten up all the gains. 
 Nonetheless, incomes have risen. This week, the Census Bureau reported that household income increased slightly faster than inflation in 2005 -- but mainly because more family members had jobs and because of increasing returns on investments. 
 Finally, the Commerce Department reported that workers' earnings grew strongly in the first half of this year. From the second quarter of last year to the second quarter of this year, total compensation, including all pay, bonuses and benefits, grew at an annual pace of about 8 percent, beating inflation of about 4 percent.
 Still, the Commerce Department's numbers, which include management earnings as well as those of the rank and file, are pulled upward by bonuses and other compensation to workers at the top of the economic ladder, many economists say. 
 ''Most earnings are continuing to go to people at the top end, in things like stock options and dividends,'' said Nigel Gault, United States economist at Global Insight, an economic research firm. ''If an average worker looks at these numbers, he's going to say, Who is getting that, because it's not me.''
 Mr. Gault pointed out that these types of wage gains would start to look better if inflation retreats from its current high level, which is likely if oil prices stop rising.
 The August data still revealed a relatively resilient demand for workers in some sectors. Health and education added 60,000 jobs. Despite the widely reported decline in the housing market, construction companies added 17,000 jobs. 
 Kenneth Simonson, chief economist of the Associated General Contractors of America, said that even as residential construction declines, nonresidential builders, which account for about 40 percent of construction employment, are expected to keep hiring as companies keep building everything from hotels to ethanol plants. 
 Even some residential contractors are hiring. Joseph Milazzo, who owns the drywall contractor S. G. Milazzo & Company in Rocky Hill, Conn., said he expected to do some hiring in October to start work on a new residential condominium complex in West Hartford. In August, residential building contractors added nearly 4,000 workers -- mainly for the construction of rental apartments.
 Still, other builders see a bleaker outlook. Dwight Messinger, chief executive of Power Curbers of Salisbury, N.C., has not let anybody go yet. But, he said, demand is cooling for his machines to lay down curbs and sidewalks, mainly because of the drop in construction of new subdivisions. If it falls too far, he said, he would have to consider layoffs.
 There are mounting signs of job market weakness in the offing. In August, the Monster employment index, which is derived from help-wanted postings on the Monster.com job hunting Web site, registered its slowest year-on-year gain since it was started three years ago. ''Demand for labor will continue to grow but at more moderate levels, said Steven Pogorzelski, group president, international of Monster Worldwide.
 Retailers cut 14,000 jobs in August, while manufacturers shed 11,000. Some worry that as the economy and the job market start cooling, the odds of an averageworker's getting a raise will weaken, too. ''I fear that wages may have plateaued,'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
 Mr. Hatzius of Goldman observed that this would fit the pattern of wage growth over the last 30 years. ''Since the 1970's, real wage growth for people below the top 20 or 30 percent has been pretty much zero.''

HEADLINE: A Swoon In Autumn, With Asterisks

BYLINE: By Conrad de Aenlle

 BODY:
ECONOMIC growth is ebbing and the housing boom seems to have run its course, while political tension and high energy prices appear as though they will go on forever. Investors have more than enough to worry about, but as Labor Day nears, the calendar may provide an added source of anxiety.
 Returns on stocks are lower, on average, in September than in any other month, followed by October, when the market often puts in its bottom for the year. Share prices also tend to fall in the months leading up to an off-year election, as they did during the last three such periods. 
Some investment advisers find reasons to hope that this year will provide a break with tradition, citing moderate valuations and the prospect that the Federal Reserve is finally done raising interest rates. They also point to palpable discouragement on Wall Street as stocks have gone nowhere despite a year of solid earnings.
 The monthly UBS/Gallup Index of Investor Optimism, released Monday, showed a low for the year in August. That may be a promising sign because shareholders tend to declare their pessimism after they have gotten their selling out of the way.
 Before rushing into the market, however, investors should note that many bullish assessments come with an expiration date. More cautious market watchers may not expect an imminent decline, but they express doubts about what lies beyond the next several months. 
 Robert B. MacIntosh, chief economist at the fund manager Eaton Vance, is among those not expecting seasonal weakness. The looming end of Fed tightening encourages him, and the prospect of stagnation in Washington leads him to think the off-year election curse may not hold. 
 ''If the Republicans look as though they are going to lose one or two houses of Congress, that means gridlock, and the markets have tended to like gridlock,'' he explained. ''The Fed, coupled with election season, makes me think it's going to be different this fall.''
 Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup Investment Research, said in a report to clients that stocks might move lower at the start of the month, confirming the historical pattern, but that the picture might then brighten.
 He tracks investor sentiment with an indicator he calls the Panic/Euphoria Model. It falls as investor gloom increases, and lower readings tend to foretell higher share prices.
 THE model has declined for several months and stands close to a two-decade low. By Mr. Levkovich's reckoning, there is a 90 percent chance that stocks will be higher six months from now.
 He also said valuations are in a ''sweet spot,'' a price-earnings multiple for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of about 15; in the past, that has preceded strong returns.
 There is a broad consensus that stocks appear more attractively priced than a year ago, but other advisers find the spot less sweet than Mr. Levkovich does. They remind investors that valuations that seem cheap may turn out not to be.
 James Stack, editor of the InvesTech Market Analyst newsletter, cited numerous formulas -- comparing share prices with dividend yields and earnings, or price-earnings ratios with bond yields -- that show valuations at close to their lowest levels in up to 25 years. But Mr. Stack warns his subscribers that they are ''navigating treacherous waters.''
 He described the economy as being ''on a collision course with a recession.'' Reasonable valuations may make the losses he anticipates for stocks reasonable, too; he pointed out that bear markets since the 1930's that began when P.E. ratios were less than 17 have typically produced losses of around 20 percent, while bear runs afflicting more overvalued markets have often run up losses of 30 percent to 50 percent. Either way, he advises holding high cash positions.
 Pete Kendall, co-editor of The Elliott Wave Financial Forecast newsletter, is a longstanding bear. He says valuations and sentiment must fall further before he will feel comfortable buying stocks again.
 He sees little cause to put faith in seasonal patterns -- except for their long history of success. ''Seasonals can be somewhat annoying because they are such darn simplistic reasons for being bearish or bullish, and yet they seem to work more times than not,'' he said. The autumn swoon ''is certainly one of them.''
 Mr. Kendall expects the market to conform to the pattern this year -- up to a point. ''If there is a surprise this time,'' he said, ''we think it will be that even though it is another rough two-month stretch for stocks, October fails to mark a low.''

HEADLINE: Where Detroit Pins Its Hopes 

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 1 

 BODY:
If you had to put one vehicle in a time capsule that describes the 1990's, it would have to be a sport utility vehicle -- the bigger, gutsier and more gas-guzzling the better.
 Baby boomers by the millions abandoned sedans and minivans to buy them. Now they are turning away again, to something that has better gas mileage and more comfort, but still gives them the roominess that Americans prize.
The new vehicle of choice is the crossover, a vehicle that generally looks like an S.U.V. but that is built on the nimble underpinnings of a car instead of the stiffer platform of a pickup truck.
 Sales of crossovers will pass two million this year and, for the first time, will top sales of conventional S.U.V.'s., according to estimates by analysts and the auto companies. For comparison, nearly three million S.U.V.'s were sold in 2002. 
 In monthly sales reports that carmakers released Friday, sales of crossovers were up 4.4 percent and sales of S.U.V.'s, while still exceeding crossovers, were down 13.3 percent, according to the industry statistics firm Autodata. [Page C3.]
 Crossovers did not even exist when Ford put its Explorer on sale in 1990 and Jeep rolled out the Grand Cherokee in 1992. They have been available in the United States only since 1995, when the Toyota RAV4, a hit in the Japanese market, became the first crossover sold here. 
 There are now 40 models of crossovers, from all manner of American, Japanese, South Korean and European companies, and their sales are climbing as those of S.U.V.'s are falling. 
 ''The crossover market is going to get much, much larger,'' said Jim Lentz, an executive vice president at Toyota Motor.
 Detroit companies, initially outgunned by their foreign competition, are grabbing for their share of crossover sales.
 General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler, which have more than a dozen new crossovers planned for the rest of the decade, see them as a crucial tool in their efforts to recapture sales that have been lost as S.U.V.'s have faded.
 Most S.U.V.'s and crossovers sell for $25,000 to $30,000.
 The rise in the appeal of crossovers has caught many people by surprise because they are not easy to categorize.
 Their structure gives them a smoother ride and makes them easier to handle than conventional sport utilities. But most are designed so that drivers sit up high behind the wheel, and many have as much interior space as S.U.V.'s. Almost every model, 36 out of 40, is available with all-wheel drive, allowing for better traction in bad weather.
 On average, their fuel economy beats that of conventional S.U.V.'s, by 18 percent in the city and 9 percent on the highway, an important selling point now that fuel prices have risen to $3 or more.
 Both S.U.V.'s and crossovers are considered light trucks under the federal government's rules for fuel efficiency, so the increase in sales of crossovers also helps car makers meet the mileage standard, which is 20.3 miles per gallon for light trucks. 
 The average fuel economy for all crossovers is 20 miles per gallon in city driving and 24 on the highway, compared with 17 in the city and 22 on the freeway for conventional S.U.V.'s, according to an estimate by Edmunds.com, which offers car-buying advice. 
 ''Crossovers are S.U.V.'s with all the traits that people like and without the things that people don't like,'' said Karl Brauer, the editor in chief at Edmunds.
 Charlee Smith, 56, used to borrow an S.U.V. from a friend when he needed more cargo space than his Eagle Talon coupe could provide. Now Mr. Smith of Templeton, Calif., and his wife own two crossovers: a Chrysler Pacifica and a Lexus RX 330.
 They chose both vehicles for their safety and maneuverability. "To me, they're the most comfortable cars on the road," Mr. Smith said. "I had no desire to have a big gas hog."
 And more are on the way. This fall, Ford is bringing out a crossover called the Edge (no connection to the U2 guitarist of the same name), on which it is pinning its hopes for its North American turnaround. Jeep, the war-tested workhorse of off-road vehicles, resisted the move to what became derisively known as ''cute utes'' for more than a decade. But now it plans to introduce two models this fall: a small one called the Compass and a bigger one called the Patriot. Jeep, which does not make cars, will use the platform of a DaimlerChrysler relative, the Dodge Caliber, for its crossovers. 
 Acura, whose MDX was one of the original crossovers, is adding another, called the RDX. G.M., whose Chevrolet HHR and Equinox crossovers are among the 10 leading sellers, has 14 more crossovers set to be introduced by 2009.
 The popularity of the crossovers puzzles automotive enthusiasts whose hearts race when they feel the power of a V-8 or slide behind the wheel of a sports car. Although some, like Chrysler's PT Cruiser and the retro Chevrolet HHR, have a style of their own, most crossovers are reminiscent of a 1960's station wagon, hardly evoking the sex appeal that excites car buffs.
 And their car genes mean crossovers lack the heritage of older S.U.V.'s like Jeeps and Hummers, which were designed for war. 
 But many owners of crossover vehicles are happy to give up the aura of those S.U.V.'s for something a little more comfortable. 
 Kyle MacRae, 35, who lives outside Boston, is on his second crossover, an Acura MDX, which he bought after driving another Honda, the CR-V, for seven years. The MacRaes bought the bigger crossover after the birth of their daughter, Zoe, 11 months ago. 
 They needed more room to transport her, their pair of greyhounds, Mr. MacRae's woodworking tools and their skis. But Mrs. MacRae was loath to switch to a minivan, and Mr. MacRae did not like the ride of conventional S.U.V.'s. 
 ''It doesn't feel as big as it is,'' Mr. MacRae said. ''It simply was able to do everything I was looking for a vehicle to do, without having to spend a lot of money.''
 Japanese auto companies had an unintended advantage over their Detroit rivals in developing crossovers, Mr. Brauer said, because their lineups did not include the big pickup trucks on which Detroit companies based their S.U.V.'s.
 That meant Toyota had to use its Camry sedan to develop the Lexus RX, which became the first luxury crossover and helped make Lexus the best-selling luxury brand in the United States, a title it has held since 2001.
 Ford hopes the Edge will work similar sales magic once it reaches the market in November. The Edge is based on the Ford Fusion sedan, itself built from a Mazda platform, and features Fusion's three-bar front grille.
 Ford plans to load the Edge with features like an MP3 player jack, all-wheel drive and seats that are easy to fold away. ''We have high expectations'' for Edge's success, said Mark Fields, Ford's president for the America's region.
 Ford dealers, who have seen sales of the Explorer slump this year, say they are eager for the Edge's arrival. ''We feel the Edge is the crossover vehicle that everybody has been looking for,'' said Chris Matchett, a partner at Butler Ford in Indianapolis. Mr. Matchett said he planned to promote the vehicle's versatility to potential customers. ''In today's market, that's really important,'' he said.
 But crossovers cannot match S.U.V.'s in a crucial area: profit. At the peak of their popularity in the mid-1990's, garden-variety S.U.V.'s meant a profit of $8,000 to $10,000 a vehicle; luxury models could bring in twice that. 
 One reason was that the demand exceeded the supply. Ford, for example, did not offer incentives on the Explorer for almost a decade after it was introduced.
 By contrast, crossovers are more readily available, making them the fleece pullovers of the automotive world. Buyers are able to find just about any size they want at a price they can afford, so crossovers rarely generate the kind of waiting lists that S.U.V.'s generated a decade ago.
 On the other hand, crossovers are cheaper for car companies to develop, since they have already spent the money to engineer the cars on which crossovers are based. Lower development costs mean crossovers, in theory, can get to the market more quickly, while demand is still at its strongest.
 How big will that market be? 
 Ford's chief sales analyst, George Pipas, estimates that automakers are likely to sell more than two million crossovers a year for the next several years.
 But Toyota, which kicked off the original shift to crossovers, is already thinking about the kind of vehicle that could be the industry's symbol for 2010 and beyond. 
 Mr. Lentz of Toyota theorizes it will be something that combines a sport utility's interior space with the practicality of a minivan and the comfort of a crossover vehicle in a stylish package. ''As you go into the future, what's the magic formula between those three?'' he pondered.
 For now, however, Brooks Davis, a dentist in Houston, is happy to be part of the crossover trend. Mr. Davis, 49, chose his Chrysler Pacifica because it was different from the sport utilities parked in his neighbors' driveways.
 ''I said, 'You know, I'm going to be a little different,' '' Mr. Davis said. ''I thought, 'There's got to be a better way to haul four people around for the weekend.' ''

HEADLINE: It's Their Holiday, but Wage Earners Aren't Happy 

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
RETAILERS posted better-than-expected sales this week, but the figures were from July and there is ample evidence that the economy might have taken a turn for the worse since then.
 Corporate news was scarce during the last week before Labor Day, which symbolically draws summer to a close. At least good corporate news was scarce. There were several developments in criminal court.

GLUM AND GLUMMER -- Consumer confidence plummeted last month amid slowing job growth, the weak housing market and stubbornly high energy costs. In its steepest one-month drop since Hurricane Katrina a year ago, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to 99.6 in August, its lowest level since November.
At the same time, three opinion polls found deep pessimism among American workers, with most saying that their wages were not keeping pace with inflation, that they had less job security and more on-the-job stress and that they were worse off in many ways than a generation ago. 
 The Labor Department issued a report saying that hourly wages are 1.9 percent higher than in 2000, taking inflation into account. Over the last two years, however, wages have failed to keep up with inflation for most workers.
 Using a different measure, the Census Bureau said the median household income rose slightly faster than inflation last year for the first time in six years. But it said the rise occurred because more family members were taking jobs to make ends meet and some people made more from investing. The bureau, part of the Commerce Department, confirmed that wages had fallen.
 Consumer pessimism suggests there will be a significant drop in consumer credit statistics that the Federal Reserve is scheduled to release on Friday.

PENSION CUT -- DuPont, the giant chemical company, said it would reduce its contribution to workers' pensions by two-thirds after 2007, becoming the first big company to cut its retirement benefit since Congress passed a law its sponsors said would make pensions safer.
 To partly compensate for current employees' smaller pensions, DuPont said it would contribute 3 percent of each employee's pay to a 401(k) plan beginning in 2008 and would match its employees' own retirement savings up to 6 percent of their annual wage.
 Kenneth W. Porter, DuPont's director for global benefits, told The Wall Street Journal that the 401(k) plans would not fully replace the pension benefits, but that workers could come out ahead if their investment returns were exceptional.
 New workers will receive no pension, only help with 401(k) savings. Existing pensioners and employees abroad will not be affected.

MUTUAL FUND SCANDAL -- In the first admission of criminal acts in the mutual fund market-timing scandal, Prudential Financial agreed to pay $600 million to settle charges with federal and state regulators that one of its units engaged in more than $2.5 billion worth of inappropriate trades.
 The payment is the second largest levied against a financial institution over the practice, which involves rapid-fire trading of mutual fund shares to capture price inefficiencies. The practice can hurt small shareholders by inflating administrative costs and disrupting investment portfolios.
 Prudential's admission is likely to end the investigation, which began in 2003 and resulted in $4 billion in fines and penalties against some big Wall Street firms, including $675 million from Bank of America in 2004 and $600 million from AllianceBernstein in 2003.

CRIMINAL SELLING -- Schering-Plough, which makes Dr. Scholl's foot products and Coppertone tanning lotions as well as prescription drugs, pleaded guilty to a criminal charge stemming from a federal inquiry into whether it had advocated using drugs for unapproved uses and had overcharged Medicaid.
 In addition to pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy, the company agreed to pay $435 million: $255 million in civil penalties and a criminal fine of $180 million.
 Two years ago, Schering-Plough agreed to pay $346 million to settle charges that it paid a kickback to a health insurer to protect the market for its allergy drug Claritin.
 The latest agreement is subject to the approval of a federal court in Boston. 

BIG PROBLEMS -- BP, the largest oil and natural gas producer in America, said federal investigators were looking into whether its traders had manipulated part of the crude oil market in 2003 and 2004 and the market for gasoline trading in 2002.
 Federal investigators had already started investigating whether the company's traders manipulated the market for propane. And a judge in Texas has ordered BP's chief executive, Lord Browne, to be available for questioning about an explosion at a BP refinery in Texas. Fifteen employees and contractors died in the blast last year.
 The House Energy and Commerce Committee will question BP executives next week about a large oil spill from the Alaska pipeline that BP operates.

SALE OF THE CENTURY -- In what would be the most expensive American real estate transaction of modern times, Metropolitan Life said it wanted to sell Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, a collection of 110 apartment buildings with 11,000 units spread over 80 acres in Manhattan.
 Analysts said the property, which MetLife built during and after World War II to provide middle-class housing for veterans and their families, could fetch $5 billion, or almost $450,000 for each apartment. They also said the price would probably force a buyer to raise rents significantly as quickly as possible.
 Real estate executives said MetLife, which began registering potential bidders last week, hoped to select a winner by November.

HEADLINE: The Odd Recovery: Unemployment Is Low and So Is Employment 

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
NEARLY five years after the end of the 2001 recession in the United States, this recovery can be painted using employment statistics as the worst -- or one of the best -- of the aftermaths of the 10 post-World War II recessions. 
 On the good side, the unemployment rate, at 5.5 percent in November 2001, was down to 4.7 percent in August, the Labor Department reported yesterday. In similar periods after ends of the nine previous downturns, the unemployment rate was that low only once.
The low unemployment rate has come about despite a slow rate of job creation. At this point after the previous nine recessions, there were an average of 11.9 percent more jobs in the economy than there had been at the end of the recession. 
 But so far, as the charts show, there are just 3.5 percent more jobs than at the end of the last recession. That is less than half the lowest of the nine previous moves -- a gain of 7.6 percent in the period after the 1953-54 recession. And that figure was held down by the fact that another recession, in 1957-58, had taken place by then.
 To some extent, the divergent indicators reflect the fact that the numbers come from two surveys with different methodologies and, in recent years, differing trends. The jobs figure comes from a Labor Department survey of establishments and lately it has tended to produce gloomier numbers than the other survey the department performs, in which households are asked which members have jobs.
 The trends are expected to be a little different, in that self-employed people would show up with jobs only in the household survey, while a person holding two jobs would be double-counted in the establishment survey. But the differences in this cycle have been substantial and are not easy to explain.
 Even the household survey, with its more positive numbers, indicates that little progress on jobs has been made in this recovery. There has been almost no increase, by these statistics, in the percentage of working-age Americans who are working. The decline in the unemployment rate reflects the fact that fewer of those without jobs say they are looking for work, as is required to be counted as unemployed.
 The job growth picture is also complicated now by the different nature of work in America.
 Back in 1949, when the first postwar recession ended, slightly fewer than half the jobs were in private-sector service industries. Now the figure is more than two-thirds. In the same period, the government share of the civilian work force went up a couple of percentage points, to about a sixth.
 The share of employment represented by private-sector goods-producing industries fell by more than half, to less than 17 percent from more than 37 percent. Employment in that sector peaked at 25.2 million people in 1979. Now it is 22.4 million, even though total employment is up 50 percent since 1979.
 In the current recovery, service industries have led the way, with the number of jobs up by more than 5 percent, while the government figure is a little over 3 percent. But employment in goods-producing industries has fallen by more than 3 percent.


GRAPHIC: ChartAs the economic recovery from the 2001 recession nears its fifth birthday, the unemployment rate is lower than it has been at a similar point after most other United States recessions. But the gain in jobs has been the lowest of any period, including those when the economy fell into a new recession long before five years had elapsed.Change in civilian jobs in the U.S. from the month a recession officially endedGraph tracks change in civilian jobs in the U.S. from the month a recession officially ended since 1949.Unemployment rate of beginning and ending monthsOCT. 1949: 7.9%JULY.1954: 5.8%MAY 1954: 5.9%FEB. 1959: 5.9%APRIL 1958: 7.4%JAN. 1963: 5.7%FEB. 1961: 6.9%NOV. 1965: 4.1%NOV. 1970: 5.9%AUG. 1975: 8.4%MARCH 1975: 8.6%DEC. 1979: 6.0%JULY 1980: 7.8%APRIL 19875: 7.3%NOV. 1982: 10.8%AUG. 1987: 6.0%MARCH 1991: 6.8%DEC. 1995: 5.6%NOV. 2001: 5.6%AUG. 2006: 4.7%(Sources by Bureau of Labor Statistics, via Haver Analytics

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
A freelance video journalist jailed after he refused to turn over film of a political protest to a grand jury was released while a federal appeals court considered his case. The man, Josh Wolf, 24, videotaped a July 2005 protest in San Francisco during the G-8 economic summit where anarchists were suspected of vandalizing a city police car. One police officer was struck during the rally and his skull was fractured. Mr. Wolf refused to turn over tapes of the demonstration to a federal grand jury. A judge found him in contempt of court and ordered him jailed on Aug. 1.

PERSON: Rev. James B. Reuter

HEADLINE: Beloved Priest Defends Marines, Angering Filipinos 

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: MANILA 

 BODY:
LEANING forward in his wheelchair at the front of a courtroom is a small, bald man in a crisply ironed white cassock, his eyes darting from witness to judge to angry lawyer, drawing his own conclusions.
 ''I think it was seduction,'' said the man in the cassock, the Rev. James B. Reuter, of the highly charged case in which four American marines are accused of raping a Filipino woman.
 ''She was 22 and Danny was 19,'' said Father Reuter, 90, an American Jesuit priest who has lived in the Philippines for most of his life. ''The only one accused of touching her is Danny, the baby boy,'' he said, referring to Lance Cpl. Daniel Smith, who is at the center of the case.
 The words have a discordant ring in a trial that has been cast by nationalists and women's-rights groups as a symbol of American abuse and exploitation of its former colony. 
 They come as a particular surprise from Father Reuter, whose fondness for the Philippines and high-profile involvement in public affairs have offered a contrasting view of the American presence here.
 He has no formal role in the case but has taken it upon himself to be not only a spiritual adviser but also an energetic advocate for the marines. ''I don't think they're guilty,'' he said, ''not a bit.''
 In taking the side of his countrymen he has gambled a lifetime of affection and respect that has led people here to embrace him as one of their own, ''more Filipino than many Filipinos'' in the words of one admirer. In 1996 the Philippine Congress awarded him honorary citizenship.
 Father Reuter first came to the Philippines as a Jesuit missionary in 1938. He was imprisoned by the Japanese for more than three years during their World War II occupation of the Philippines, then plunged full-tilt into the life of the country.
 As part of the Jesuit mission here, he has written and staged dozens of plays, organized singing groups, written newspaper columns and appeared on television and radio. He helped set up the Catholic radio station, Radio Veritas, and still serves as director for mass communications for the Roman Catholic Church here.
 During the martial-law regime of President Ferdinand E. Marcos, he spent two years under house arrest in the 1970's for publishing critical articles in a church journal.
 People who have worked and studied with him call themselves ''Reuter babies'' and refer to him as Papa Bear. His office is adorned with teddy bears brought by visitors. So his involvement in the nationally polarized case has been a puzzle to many people here. Not surprisingly, some of the sharpest words come from the lead prosecutor, Evalyn Ursua.
 ''I feel pity for Father Reuter, who has been such a respected priest in the country for so long,'' she said during a break in testimony recently.
 ''I think he is allowing his position to be used as a propaganda ploy to deodorize the accused,'' she said. ''And for that reason alone I have lost all respect for him. Obviously his nationality is a paramount factor of his being on that side.''
 FATHER REUTER has an innocent look. He requires a wheelchair because of arthritis and a recent bout with pneumonia. But he has never been as mild as the statues of the Virgin Mary cluttering his office suggest.
 ''Let's be polite to everybody so they will treat us with love,'' he said dryly as he entered the courthouse. Anti-American chants from members of the women's-rights group Gabriela echoed in the hallway.
 ''Oh my, oh my,'' he said when told of Ms. Ursua's remarks. ''In the beginning she took about 15 minutes to come out with a diatribe against the V.F.A.,'' the Visiting Forces Agreement that allows the presence of American troops in the Philippines.
 ''I'm not doing this because I'm an American,'' he said. ''The reporters run after me. They say, 'Why are you with the Americans?' I tell them, 'Because I'm a priest, for heaven's sake. I deal with Filipinos 99 percent of the time. Now I'm asked by an American. Am I going to say no?' ''
 Beyond that, he said, ''I think those guys are getting a pretty rough deal. The poor guys have nobody to back them up. They're nice guys, clean-cut guys. Especially the one who's going to get it in the neck, Danny Smith.''
 The four marines are accused of the rape while riding in a van last November on the former American naval base at Subic Bay, which reverted to Philippine control in 1992. According to testimony in the case, three of them cheered on Corporal Smith as he had sex with a woman they had just met in a bar, then left her lying by the road and drove away.
 The case has become a rallying cry for people who want to expel American soldiers altogether from the country.
 But Father Reuter has little use for the kind of ritualized nationalist outrage that leads to periodic demonstrations in front of the United States Embassy. ''They bring a mob,'' he said. ''They're always the same guys.''
 But Father Reuter knows better. Beneath its self-doubts and feelings of inferiority, this is a nation that loves America as few others do, and Father Reuter has returned that love. ''It's the people,'' he said. ''The people are the most lovable in the world, very generous. They are suffering but they are very prayerful. They manage to smile no matter how hard things get.''
 Perhaps, though, at this late stage in his life, some small recalibration was needed.
 After all these years living as what he calls ''a non-Filipino Filipino,'' joining in the passions and crises of this high-strung country and taking an active part in the ''people power'' uprising of 1986, it may be a relief to remind himself and others who he is.
 ''I am very content to be heart and soul with the Philippines and live and die here,'' he said. ''But I still hold on to that commitment of being an American.''
 IT was the American Army that drove the Japanese from the Philippines and liberated his prison camp in 1945, and that moment of jubilation and gratitude has never left him. ''That's when I knew what it was to have a country,'' he said. ''That's when I made up my mind that I would never change my citizenship.'' Then, as if reciting a passage from the Bible, he quoted Sir Walter Scott: ''Breathes there a man with soul so dead that never to himself has said, this is my own, my native land.''
 For Father Reuter, the United States is a land of sentiment and of the imagination; he rarely returns for a visit. And when he speaks of the Philippines he sometimes allows himself to use the word ''we.''
 ''Are we poor?'' he said. ''Yes we are. Are we getting poorer? Yes we are. How is it going to be getting better? I don't know.''
 It seems a discouraging assessment after nearly 70 years in the Philippines, but by profession, Father Reuter has no choice but to be an optimist. ''I think somehow God will take care of us,'' he said. ''That's doesn't sound like an economic plan, but that's what I think.''

HEADLINE: Echoes of the Antiwar Marches

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''There Is Silence in the Streets; Where Have All the Protesters Gone?'' (Editorial Observer, Aug. 31):
 Andrew Rosenthal raises a timely question. The silence in the streets is partly a sign of millions of tired or retired protesters. There is also silence because we currently have an administration that would not listen to protests if 200 million Americans marched on Washington.
 Many of us who were the protesters in the 1960's and 70's have retired to comfortable lifestyles. We have given our children every comfort we could afford, and they have never had to worry about a draft that would require them to give two years of service to their country. 
 Most Americans see no urgency to protest a war that doesn't seem to directly involve us or our children. Our volunteer military seems to be looked on as a group of people we pay to fight and die for us wherever and whenever our commander in chief chooses. 
 If the draft or a combination of a military draft and some other mandatory service were established, we could re-engage the attention of the country, and a new generation of protesters might arise. 

Theodore S. Voelker
Copake, N.Y., Aug. 31, 2006

To the Editor:
 I think one reason we have so few protests is that the news media in general did not and do not cover any protests in more than a cursory way. 
 From the earliest antiwar marches, protesters learned that it wasn't worth the effort because their demonstrations were not covered by the news media and thus their message was not reaching their audience.

Nancy Goor
Bethesda, Md., Aug. 31, 2006

To the Editor:
 Andrew Rosenthal writes that there is silence in the streets about the Iraq war. Does he mean the streets of New York City, where a million people have marched and protested since before the war? Five major antiwar demonstrations have been held here since February 2003, most recently last April 29. 
 Or is Mr. Rosenthal referring to the streets of Washington, where hundreds of thousands of people have marched and protested since before the war? At least four major antiwar demonstrations have been held there since January 2003. 
 More than 1,000 local antiwar groups are active in at least 530 cities and towns. Every week since the war began, peace vigils have taken place in at least 90 locales. 
 Mr. Rosenthal says that ''it takes crowds to get America's attention.'' Large crowds have consistently taken to the streets to call for the troops to come home. Why is the scope of today's antiwar movement, like the war itself, ''largely hidden from American eyes''?

Leslie Kauffman
New York, Aug. 31, 2006

The writer is the mobilizing coordinator of United for Peace and Justice.

To the Editor:
 Andrew Rosenthal hit the nail on the proverbial head. Online protests don't make enough noise, and without a military draft, people will not hit the streets.
 What a tragedy has befallen America and the world with the election of this president.

Stephany Yablow
North Hollywood, Calif., Aug. 31, 2006

To the Editor:
 Andrew Rosenthal wonders where the protesters have gone. I suggest an explanation.
 The human suffering, courage and deaths of the Vietnam War were so well publicized that they aroused the street. 
 Iraq is causing the United States to bleed financially at the rate of at least $6 billion a month, with no end in sight. But the pernicious nature of the damage caused by this war goes unnoticed except for passing references to the creeping inflation that comes in its train. Monetary crises are no clarion calls.
 With the United States pinned down in Baghdad indefinitely, Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups can afford to rest on their laurels.

HEADLINE: IRAQI CASUALTIES ARE UP SHARPLY, U.S. STUDY FINDS 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 1 

 BODY:
Iraqi casualties soared by more than 50 percent in recent months, the product of spiraling sectarian clashes and a Sunni-based insurgency that remains ''potent and viable,'' the Pentagon said in its latest comprehensive assessment of security in Iraq.
 During the period from the establishment of the new Iraqi government on May 20 until Aug. 11, the average number of weekly attacks jumped to almost 800. That was a substantial increase from earlier this year and almost double the number of the first part of 2004. 
As a consequence, Iraqi casualties increased 51 percent over the last reporting period. The document notes that, based on initial reports, Iraqi casualties among civilians and security forces reached nearly 120 a day, up from about 80 a day in the pervious reporting period from mid-February to mid-May. About two years ago they were running about 30 a day.
 ''Although the overall number of attacks increased in all categories, the proportion of those attacks directed against civilians increased substantially,'' the Pentagon noted. ''Death squads and terrorists are locked in mutually reinforcing cycles of sectarian strife, with Sunni and Shia extremists each portraying themselves as the defenders of their respective sectarian groups.''
 The Pentagon report, titled ''Measuring Security and Stability in Iraq,'' is mandated by Congress and issued quarterly. It covers a broad range of subjects, including the economy, public attitudes, and security.
 This time, the study is the focus of special interest because of increasing fears that Iraq is sliding into civil war and because it is being published at a time when President Bush and members of his cabinet have been trying to present a strong case in support of the war, in the face of vehement criticism from Democrats.
 The report does not take account of the latest efforts to bring order to Baghdad, operations that involved 12,000 additional soldiers, including some 7,000 additional American troops. Col. Thomas Vail, the commander of a brigade of the 101st Airborne Division, told reporters on Friday that his troops had made progress in recent days in tamping down the violence in the capital. The last several days have been particularly bloody, with about 250 Iraqis killed and scores wounded since Sunday. The Pentagon acknowledged that the grim data on attacks, casualties and executions was distressing. ''It's a pretty sober report this time,'' said Peter Rodman, a senior Pentagon official, who met with reporters to discuss it. ''The last quarter, it's been rough. Sectarian violence has been particularly acute and disturbing.''
 Democratic lawmakers portrayed the report as evidence that the administration's strategy was failing. ''They have not provided the real resources, in terms of both military and civilian advisers, nor real dollars to reconstruct and help Iraq emerge from this period of instability,'' Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island said.
 The report chronicles dangers on an array of fronts. Although the Sunni-based insurgency has received less news media attention since the surge of sectarian violence, the report cautions that it is resilient and strong. The number of attacks in Anbar Province, a vast Sunni-dominated region in western Iraq, averages more than 30 a day.
 Regarding Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia's operations in Iraq, the report says the network's ''cellular nature'' has enabled it to continue attacks despite the death of its leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
 But sectarian strife has emerged as the biggest worry. In recent months, the Pentagon noted, ''The core conflict in Iraq changed into a struggle between Sunni and Shia extremists seeking to control key areas in Baghdad, create or protect sectarian enclaves, divert economic resources, and impose their own respective political and religious agendas.'' Echoing recent statements by senior American military commanders, the report says that ''conditions that could lead to civil war exist in Iraq, especially in and around Baghdad, and concern about civil war within the Iraqi population has increased in recent months.''
 The report notes that sectarian violence is gradually expanding north to Kirkuk and Diyala Province. Further, the confidence of Iraqis in the future has diminished, according to public opinion surveys cited in the Pentagon report.
 Still, the study says the fighting in Iraq does not meet the ''stringent international legal standards for civil war,'' without further explanation. Even so, the sectarian fighting has been bloodier than ever.
 In discussing daily casualty rates, the report did not distinguish between the number of dead and wounded. But it noted that execution-type killings, in particular, reached a new high in July. ''The Baghdad Coroner's Office reported 1,600 bodies arrived in June and more than 1,800 bodies in July, 90 percent of which were assessed to be the result of executions,'' the report states.
 The report says that progress has been made in fielding Iraqi Army units and police that can take over the main responsibility for security. It says 5 Iraqi Army divisions, 25 brigades and 85 battalions have the lead for security in their areas. It notes that a lack of noncommissioned officers and absenteeism are obstacles to fielding an effective Iraqi force. Though the 63-page report does not discuss military operations in Baghdad in detail, it has become clear in recent months that Iraq could not be effectively secured without the active involvement of the Americans. When the Americans cut back patrols in Baghdad, violence rose and American commanders decided to send additional troops to the capital from elsewhere in the country.
 The report notes that Iraq's Interior Ministry does not have a system to determine how many of the forces trained by police advisers are still on the job. Advisers from the American-led forces estimate that the attrition rate is about 20 percent a year.
 Citing polling data from the International Republican Institute, the report states that almost 80 percent of Iraqis thought in April 2006 that the general situation would be better in a year. By June, it was less than 50 percent. ''In general, Iraqis have had an optimistic outlook,'' the report stated. ''However, as time has passed, their optimism has eroded.''

HEADLINE: Russia Hints It Won't Back Any Penalties Against Iran

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Peter Kiefer contributed reporting from Rome for this article.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 1 

 BODY:
Russia on Friday cast new doubt on the prospects for the Bush administration's efforts to punish Iran for refusing to suspend its nuclear program, even as European leaders expressed wariness at moving quickly to impose sanctions.
 In Moscow, officials expressed regret that an Aug. 31 deadline had passed without an agreement by Iran to halt its efforts to enrich uranium that could be used for building nuclear weapons, as American and European officials believe Iran intends to do.
 At the same time, Russian officials made it clear that they do not support retaliatory sanctions or other steps to isolate Iran's leadership. That was a view that seemed to be widely shared across Europe, despite public consternation over Iran's defiance of a United Nations Security Council resolution. 
 Despite weeks of diplomacy and compromise among the Security Council's permanent members -- the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia -- the resolute deadline set by the Security Council for Iran to halt its nuclear work seemed fairly irresolute once it passed.
 Russia's defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, said that the issue of sanctions was ''not acute,'' and added that diplomats from the five permanent members and Germany would meet to discuss further steps. France's Foreign Ministry said the meeting was scheduled for next Thursday in Berlin.
 Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said that Russia favored continued negotiations and not punitive measures, calling into question their effectiveness.
 Even though Russia previously joined the other permanent members of the Security Council in setting the deadline for Iran to comply -- with the implicit threat of sanctions -- Mr. Lavrov left in doubt whether Russia would ever agree to any penalties. His view echoed one heard increasingly here: that sanctions could be a first step toward a new American-led military conflict in the Middle East.
 ''We cannot support ultimatums that lead everyone to a dead end and cause escalation, the logic of which always leads to the use of force,'' Mr. Lavrov said, speaking broadly in an address to students at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations.
 At a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Finland, the Union's chief foreign affairs official, Javier Solana, was quoted as saying that there would now be ''a period of talks'' over the conflict with Iran, making any discussion of sanctions unreasonable for now.
 Other European leaders also expressed eagerness to avoid the immediate imposition of punitive measures, which they fear would worsen the confrontation with Iran.
 At a joint news conference in Rome with Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy, the French prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, called Iran's response to the international demands ''totally unsatisfying,'' but said it remained possible ''to go forward with dialogue.''
 Mr. Prodi agreed. ''If there is a even a small opening to get to the negotiating table,'' he said, ''it should be taken.''
 United States officials have said no action will be sought against Tehran until after Mr. Solana meets with Ali Larijani, Iran's nuclear negotiator, next week. 
 ''We'll find out in the next several weeks whether we're able to proceed to sanctions,'' the American ambassador to the United Nations, John R. Bolton, told CNN on Friday. ''We're consulting with European countries. What we're going to aim at is the leadership of Iran and the programs involving their nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities.''
 In Iran, meantime, officials remained defiant, arguing that the country is pursuing a peaceful, civilian nuclear program that it has a right to engage in.

HEADLINE: Would Ruth Have Left New Orleans?

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
WHEN I took this job in 2004,'' said Craig S. Miller, ''the first thing I did was get a little plaque to put on my desk that said, 'What Would Ruth Do?' ''
 Mr. Miller, 57, the chief executive of Ruth's Chris Steak House, was referring to the company's founder and guiding spirit, Ruth Fertel, who had died two years earlier. In New Orleans, where she lived most of her life, Ms. Fertel was a legendary restaurateur. In 1965, then a divorced mother raising two sons, she mortgaged her home to buy a New Orleans steakhouse and turned it into one of the city's enduring institutions.
''My mother knew that taking care of people in a warm, comfortable way was going to sell steaks,'' her son, Randy Fertel, told me.
 She was also no slouch as a businesswoman. With no formal training, but plenty of smarts and ambition, she transformed her steakhouse into an upscale restaurant chain. Ruth's Chris was a rare example of a vibrant, growing national company in a city that never had much of a business culture. In 1999, when she was 72, Ms. Fertel sold Ruth's Chris to a private equity firm for $160 million. 
 Mr. Miller arrived five years later, at a time when the company was struggling, with a mandate to right the ship so that Ruth's Chris could be taken public. This he did so successfully that the company completed its I.P.O. less than 18 months later, giving the company a market capitalization of $400 million. That happy event took place on Aug. 9, 2005. Three weeks later, Hurricane Katrina hit.
 Everyone in New Orleans knows the rest of this story. Mr. Miller and his management team evacuated to Orlando, Fla. Other New Orleans business owners also had to leave town, of course -- setting up temporary quarters in Dallas or Houston or Atlanta
 But within days of the levees bursting, Mr. Miller announced that Ruth's Chris wasn't coming back, making his the first company to abandon the wounded city. Ever since, people have been asking a variation of Mr. Miller's question: ''What would Ruth have done?'' 
 FORTY years before Katrina, barely three months after Ms. Fertel bought what was then known as Chris's Steak House, Hurricane Betsy ripped through New Orleans. With no electricity, and thousands of pounds of meat in warming refrigerators, Ms. Fertel cooked steaks on gas grills and handed them out to victims and relief workers.
 When embittered New Orleanians think about what Ruth would have done, that is what they have in mind. She would have stayed, they're convinced, and helped rebuild the city she loved. ''Loyalty would have been at the top of her list of paramount virtues,'' James Ryder, a former accountant at Ruth's Chris, told New Orleans City Business. Describing the timing of Mr. Miller's announcement as ''pretty callous,'' he added, ''I don't think the executives appreciate how strongly Ruth felt about keeping the company here.''
 Tom Fitzmorris, who has a local radio call-in show devoted to food, told me that even now, he still gets calls from listeners who vilify Ruth's Chris for moving its headquarters. There are locals who won't eat at the suburban Ruth's Chris that has since reopened. (The flagship steakhouse, in Mid-City, was so badly damaged that it is unlikely to ever reopen.) ''There are a group of people who are furious at Ruth's Chris,'' said Douglas Brinkley, the Tulane University historian and author of ''The Great Deluge (William Morrow, 2006).'' 
 Yet Mr. Miller makes no apologies for what he did. ''I've never second-guessed the decision,'' he told me this week, speaking between bites of short ribs at a Ruth's Chris in Midtown Manhattan, where we were having lunch. 
 He laid out what amounted to three parallel arguments. The first was purely practical. The company's headquarters in Metairie, a New Orleans suburb, suffered extensive damage when a large section of its roof ripped off. But only about 60 people worked there. Meanwhile, the company had 1,800 employees around the country who needed to be paid. It had logistics to manage, and new restaurants to open. From a corporate point of view, it really didn't matter where those 60 people worked; all that mattered is whether they could do their jobs efficiently. Clearly, they could work a lot more efficiently in Orlando than in New Orleans.
 He also made it clear, though, that he did not view what he had done as an example of heartless corporate behavior. Quite the contrary. The company had paid out $1,000 in cash to every New Orleans employee it could find. It invited virtually everyone who worked in the old headquarters to come to Orlando and take their old jobs. Displaced restaurant workers were encouraged to relocate to a city that had a Ruth's Chris, where they were guaranteed a job. And so on.
 ''When you go through something like this, there is a pecking order of priorities,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Yourself, your family, your employees and your company.'' Though he owned a home in the northern suburbs, Mr. Miller's community wasn't New Orleans -- or any other city. Like many executives, he has lived in a dozen places during his career, and had roots in none of them. Rather, his community was Ruth's Chris. As he saw it, he hadn't betrayed New Orleans so much as he'd been loyal to the Ruth's Chris community.
 Mr. Miller's third rationale spoke to yet another condition of modern business life: the primacy of the stock price. Ruth's Chris Steak House was a spanking new public company. Right after Katrina, its stock took a hit. It was his job -- indeed, it was his fiduciary duty -- to get the stock price back up. He had to play by the rules of the market. Why, for instance, did he announce so quickly that the company would be staying in Orlando permanently -- callous timing or not? ''In this day and age, you don't have much choice,'' he replied. ''If you have news you have to release it.'' 
 What did the market care about? ''Eliminating the uncertainty about the future of the company.'' Moving to Orlando took care of that. Andrew Barish, an analyst who covers the company for Banc of America Securities, said the hurricane ''forced the company to prove itself''-- and from Wall Street's point of view, the move showed that management was up to the task. Indeed, most analysts openly cheered when they learned the company was staying in Orlando. Soon enough the stock started climbing again. (More recently, it has been bumpy, along with most other restaurant stocks.)
 However you feel about ''shareholder value'' -- and I've got plenty of my own reservations -- this modern-day focus on shareholders is why Mr. Miller believes that the founder of Ruth's Chris would have probably made the same decision he made. And there are plenty of people who agree with him, including, it seems, her son.
 Last November, Mr. Fertel, a literature teacher who also runs a foundation his mother set up, said at a conference that his mother would never have left New Orleans. But when I spoke to him this week, his tone had softened. ''She was a smart, tough businesswoman,'' he said, ''and she might have made the same decision. The treadmill they run on in the world of public companies is tough. They have to answer to their stockholders.'' 
 Once companies like Dayton Hudson in Minneapolis or DuPont in Wilmington, Del., viewed their responsibilities to their host city in broad, even paternalistic terms. They helped finance city projects, underwrote the arts and rolled up their sleeves in times of trouble. But those days are long gone. When I asked Mr. Miller if he felt bad about Ruth's Chris not being involved in the rebuilding effort, he began listing all the things the company was doing to help the city. But he also said, ''That's not my job.'' Given the narrow way we define corporate responsibility in America today, he's right.
 There's one other thing. As you've undoubtedly been reading this anniversary week, New Orleans is still a mess. For all the positive steps that have been taken, the serious business of rebuilding is really just getting started. When I called businessmen in the city for this column, I got a litany of problems: crime, housing shortages, labor shortages, a brain drain, skyrocketing rents and other costs, sporadic water pressure, occasional brownouts and phone failures, a subpar airport. 
 And perhaps most troubling of all, far too much uncertainty still. ''It is a real uneasy time,'' said Jean-Paul Layrisson, a local lawyer who specializes in corporate work. Companies still don't know what the ''footprint'' of the city is going to be, how much housing stock will be rebuilt, and whether the political structure and city services will be better than they were before the hurricane. 
 Mr. Layrisson told me that many of his corporate clients that left ''temporarily'' haven't come back. In all likelihood, they won't. Before the storm, New Orleans was home to 23 public companies, a pretty paltry number to begin with. Now it's down to 17. New Orleans has more pressing needs right now than getting companies to return, but without a healthy, growing business sector it will never truly come back.
 Indeed, companies are still faced with the same decisions Mr. Miller faced a year ago. Some of them, even now, are coming to the same conclusion he did. In February, Chevron, one of city's biggest employers, moved back into a downtown office building, giving the city a nice morale boost. Two months later, however, Chevron made another announcement: it was going to construct a new building in the northern parish of St. Tammany, some 20 miles away, and relocate there as soon as its offices were completed. When I asked a Chevron public relations hand what was driving the decision to leave the city proper, he was pretty blunt. ''Safety, security and reliability,'' he said. 
 Tell me again what Ruth would have done?

HEADLINE: Pace Slowed in Manufacturing and Construction Last Month

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The growth in manufacturing in the United States eased in August to a pace that is consistent with the recent cooling in the economy, according to one set of data released yesterday, while a second report found that construction spending fell sharply in July. 
 The Institute for Supply Management said that its manufacturing index declined to 54.5 last month from 54.7 in July. A reading higher than 50 signals expansion. A measure of prices paid by factories for raw materials fell to the lowest level since April.
Manufacturing has throttled back since last year, reinforcing Federal Reserve forecasts that growth is moderating and may limit inflation. 
 The report ''corroborates other recent data indicating a moderation in the economy as we head toward the end of the year,'' said Thomas J. Duesterberg, chief executive of the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a consulting group for factory owners in Arlington, Va.
 The slower growth in manufacturing comes as the housing market continues to show signs of strain. Construction spending in July fell by the most since 2001, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The 1.2 percent drop reflected the biggest decline in home building since January 2002 and came after a 0.4 percent rise in June.
 In addition, the National Association of Realtors said that contracts to buy previously owned homes plunged in July by the most since September 2001. The group's index of signed purchase agreements fell 7 percent, after no change.
 In another report released yesterday, consumer confidence also rose in the final two weeks of August because of a decline in gasoline prices, a survey from the University of Michigan showed. The 82.0 reading in the university's index compared with a preliminary reading of 78.7. It was down from 84.7 in July.
 In the Institute for Supply Management's report, the gauge of prices paid declined to 73 from 78.5 in July. The decrease from July was the biggest this year. The index of new orders, which makes up about a third of the total index, fell to 54.2 from 56.1 in July.
 And the production index, a measure of work being performed, dropped to 56.6 in August, from 57.6 in July. The supplier deliveries gauge, a measure of how long it takes companies to receive goods, fell to 55 from 55.4.
 Yesterday's manufacturing report comes after regional measures that painted a mixed picture for manufacturing during the month. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said in mid-August that its general economic index rose to the highest level in more than a year as orders and shipments jumped.
 Purchasing managers in the Chicago area reported that business expanded less in August than in July.

HEADLINE: 10 Brands To Freshen, Plus Linens

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Stephen P. Holmes, chairman, president and chief executive of Wyndham Worldwide, the hotel company spun off last month by the Cendant Corporation, has 10 solid lodging brands competing in what is now a thriving market. Cendant acquired Wyndham Hotels and Resorts in October from the Blackstone Group. Wyndham's other brands include well-known names like Ramada, Days Inn, Super 8, Howard Johnson and Travelodge. Mr. Holmes discussed their prospects recently. Following are excerpts:

Q. New companies and brands are entering the hotel industry. How can Wyndham, which has many old-line brands, remain fresh?

A. The economy-hotel sector is where we compete heavily; Days Inn and the Super 8 brands, our two largest in that sector, are powerhouses, have been and will be for a very long time. A lot of what you're seeing come on now is niche players in certain markets, but they will not be as broadly distributed. There are new-construction Days Inns and Super 8's that are built all the time, so it's really a matter of keeping on the quality of the brands that are out in the marketplace. 
 Over the last three years, we've gone through a very determined process, called Project Restore, where we have taken out a lot of the product that is not up to our brand standards, and have been bringing in new product that's better.

Q. In the United States, you sell franchises for individual hotels. Will you do the same thing overseas? Will you sell the franchises through a middleman? Or will you require a regional franchisee to operate a minimum number of hotels?

A. All of the above. You need to be flexible when you're competing in an international market. Some of these markets are just developing in their infrastructure. In the U.S., we have a combination of franchised and managed properties. Internationally, our focus will be on direct franchising; master franchising, where we work with a developer who's going to build multiple products in a particular market; as well as management. We would like to manage the properties that are in the upscale sector, particularly the Wyndhams and Ramadas.

Q. When will the new Michael Graves Wyndham hotels open?

A. We contracted with Michael to create a new prototype for Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, and also to create products that would be included, the smart chair and a variety of other in-room features, all the way from the coffee machine to the hair dryer and clock radio. Those products are being integrated into the hotels beginning in 2007, some toward the end of this year. The interiors will appear at the beginning of next year, overall exteriors in late 2007-early 2008.

Q. I understand a number of Wyndham franchisees are not renewing their franchises, in cities like Atlanta, Baltimore, Tampa, Dallas, Boston and Washington. How are you dealing with these losses?

A. When we acquired the Wyndham brand at the end of 2005, we acquired it with the knowledge that there would be a number of properties leaving the system, and, frankly, there were a lot of properties that were not necessarily well suited for Wyndham.

Q. What percentage of your business comes from leisure, as opposed to business, travelers?

A. Sixty-forty, leisure compared to business.

Q. Leisure travelers supposedly are affected more by rising gasoline prices than business travelers. Are high gasoline prices hurting your business?

A. We don't see high gas prices affecting the business. We've seen a very strong year so far, year-over-year increases continue in revenue per available room, so we don't see a downturn.

Q. A coalition of conservative groups is asking the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate if adult pay-per-view movies in hotels violate obscenity laws. Do any of your hotels offer such movies, and, if they do, how do you feel about this proposed investigation?

A. The hotels that are part of our system are franchised; a few are managed; many use a variety of on-demand services. We don't prohibit pay-per-view movies as a standard. We allow that to be the decision of the franchisee. I'm a believer in free speech, and I don't think there should be restrictions on what somebody decides they want to view, as long as it fits within the legal restrictions.

HEADLINE: Can This Party Be Saved?

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
Republicans in Washington did not abandon their principles lightly. When they embraced ''compassionate conservatism,'' when they started spending like Democrats, most of them didn't claim to suddenly love big government. 
 No, they were just being practical. The party's strategists explained that the small-government mantra didn't cut it with voters anymore. Forget eliminating the Department of Education -- double its budget and expand its power. Stop complaining about middle-class entitlements -- create a new one for prescription drugs. Instead of obsessing about government waste, bring home the bacon.
But as long as we're being practical, what do Republicans have to show for their largess? Passing the drug benefit and the No Child Left Behind Act gave them a slight boost in the polls on those issues, but not for long. When voters this year were asked in a New York Times/CBS News Poll which party they trusted to handle education and prescription drugs, the Republicans scored even worse than they did before those bills had been passed. 
 Meanwhile, they've developed a new problem: holding the party together. As Ryan Sager argues in his new book, ''The Elephant in the Room,'' the G.O.P. is sacrificing its future by breaking up the coalition that brought it to power.
 A half-century ago, during the Republicans' days in the wilderness, a National Review columnist named Frank Meyer championed a strategy that came to be known as fusionism. He appealed to traditionalist conservatives to work with libertarians. It wasn't an easy sell. The traditionalists wanted to rescue America from decadence, while the libertarians just wanted be left alone to pursue their own happiness -- which often sounded to the traditionalists like decadence.
 Meyer acknowledged the fears that libertarianism could lead to ''anarchy and nihilism,'' but he also saw the dangers of traditionalists' schemes for moral regeneration.
 ''If the state is endowed with the power to enforce virtue,'' he wrote, ''the men who hold that power will enforce their own concepts as virtuous.'' The path to both freedom and virtue was the fusionist compromise: smaller government.
 The coalition started with Barry Goldwater but persevered to elect Ronald Reagan and take over Congress. But then Republicans' faith in small government waned, partly because they discovered the perks of incumbency, and partly because they were outmaneuvered by Bill Clinton, who took their ideas (welfare reform, a balanced budget) and embarrassed them during the government shutdown of 1995.
 The shutdown didn't permanently traumatize the public. In poll after poll since then, respondents have preferred smaller government and fewer services. But the experience scared Republicans so much that they became big-government conservatives.
 Soccer moms were promised social programs; the religious right got moral rhetoric and cash for faith-based initiatives. Meyer's warnings about enforcing virtue were forgotten, along with the traditional Republican preference for states' rights. It became a federal responsibility to preach sexual abstinence to teenagers and stop states from legalizing euthanasia, medical marijuana and, worst of all, gay marriage. 
 Big-government conservatism has helped bring some votes to the G.O.P., particularly in the South. But as Sager writes: ''It's not as if the Republican Party could do much better in the South at this point; it's not really the ideal region to which to pander.''
 The practical panderer should look West -- not to the Coast, which is reliably blue, but to the purple states in the interior. Sager notes that a swing of just 70,000 votes in Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico would have cost Bush the last election, and that he lost ground in the Southwest between 2000 and 2004. 
 The interior West is growing quickly, thanks to refugees from California seeking affordable housing. These Westerners have been voting Republican in presidential elections, but have also gone for Democratic governors. They tend to be economic conservatives and cultural liberals. They've legalized medical marijuana in Nevada, Colorado and Montana. They're more tolerant of homosexuality than Southerners are, and less likely to be religious.
 They're suspicious of moralists and of any command from Washington, whether it's a gun-control law or an educational mandate. In Colorado and Utah, they've exempted themselves from No Child Left Behind. 
 They're small-government conservatives who would have felt at home in the old fusionist G.O.P. But now they're up for grabs, just like the party's principles.

HEADLINE: Roves Word Is No Longer G.O.P. Gospel 

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2 

 BODY:
Karl Rove, the presidents chief political adviser, is struggling to steer the Republican Party to victory this fall at a time when he appears to have the least political authority since he came to Washington, party officials said.
 Mr. Rove remains a dominant adviser to President Bush, administration officials say. But outside the White House, as Mr. Bushs popularity has waned, and as questions have arisen among Republicans about the White Houses political acumen, the partys candidates are going their own way in this difficult election season far more than they have in any other campaign Mr. Rove has overseen.
Some are disregarding Mr. Roves advice, despite his reputation as the nations premier strategist. They are criticizing Mr. Bush or his policies. They are avoiding public events with the president and Mr. Rove. 
 Influential conservative commentators have openly broken with the White House, calling into question the continued enthusiasm of evangelicals, economic conservatives and other groups that Mr. Rove has counted on to win elections. Some Republicans are ignoring Mr. Roves efforts to hold the party together on issues like immigration and Iraq. 
 In a reflection of this difficult environment, the White House has decided to concentrate nearly all its resources on the critical fight to keep control of Congress, party officials said, largely stepping away from the governors races, at least for now.
 In Michigan last week, Dick DeVos, a Republican candidate for governor and a longtime contributor to Mr. Bush, startled national Republican Party leaders with a searing attack on the president for failing to meet with the leaders of the Big Three automakers. Were being ignored here in Michigan by the White House, and it has got to stop, Mr. DeVos said.
 His communications director, John Truscott, said the attack was timed to coincide with Mr. Roves visit to Michigan for a fund-raiser, in an effort to goad Mr. Bush into a response. Asked if the DeVos campaign was worried about angering Mr. Rove, Mr. Truscott said, That never even crossed our mind.
 Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, who was chairman of the Congressional Republican campaign committee in 2002, said Mr. Rove and the White House seemed measurably less involved this year.
 Its been more of a bunker mentality, dont you think? Mr. Davis said. They have been good in terms of raising the money. The problem is, you have a president with a 38 percent approval rating, and it just changes the dynamics of what they can do.
 This midterm election presents Mr. Rove with a particularly difficult challenge. Beyond testing his reputation for always finding a way to win, the outcome could determine the extent of Mr. Bushs influence for the rest of his presidency and shape the way he is perceived by history. Mr. Rove has warned associates that a Democratic takeover in Congress would mean an end to Mr. Bushs legislative hopes and invite two years of potentially crippling investigations into the administration. 
 The White House said that Mr. Rove would consider an interview for this article if it were conducted off the record, with the provision that quotations could be put on the record with White House approval, a condition it said was set for other interviews with Mr. Rove. The New York Times declined.
 The diminishment in Mr. Roves influence reflects the fact that his power is to some extent a function of Mr. Bushs popularity. In some cases, Republican candidates have made a deliberate strategic decision that the way to win is to distance themselves from the White House. 
 But a central problem, Republicans said, is that Mr. Rove is seen as juggling two potentially conflicting agendas: protecting the presidents legacy and taking steps to help Republican candidates win re-election.
 Mr. Rove enters the campaign season after a year of personal tumult. Until mid-June he faced the threat of indictment in the investigation into the leak of a C.I.A. officers identity, and in April, he was stripped of some of his duties in the White House. Mr. Rove was moved from a West Wing corner suite to a smaller windowless office across the hall, a shift one friend said he found demoralizing. 
 Mr. Roves associates said that throughout the leak investigation, he was coiled and withdrawn. They said his demeanor brightened the moment he learned he would not be indicted. Associates described him as displaying relentless optimism about an election that is filling Republicans with a sense of doom. 
 Mr. Rove determines the bulk of the presidents schedule and is a crucial figure in determining what Mr. Bush should say this fall. He is the White Houses main conduit to conservatives whose willingness to turn out at the polls could help determine the partys success.
 Mr. Rove has become a star fund-raiser for the Republican Party, raising $10,357,486 at 75 events in 29 states, according to the Republican National Committee. Mr. Rove runs regular White House meetings, typically at 6:30 a.m. in the White House mess, reviewing high-profile House and Senate races with the White House political director, Sara Taylor, and sometimes with Congressional leaders. He shares his view of the landscape with Mr. Bush in a daily 8:30 a.m. briefing. 
 Mr. Rove with Ken Mehlman, the Republican National Committee chairman, and Ms. Taylor, both of whom have assumed a higher profile than in past years has settled on a narrow strategy to try to minimize Congressional losses while tending to Mr. Bushs political strength. The White House will reprise the two Ts of its successful campaign strategy since 2002: terrorism and turnout. 
 They have determined that control of Congress is likely to be settled in as few as six states and have decided to focus most of the partys resources there, said Republican officials who did not want to be identified discussing internal deliberations. Those states will likely include Connecticut, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington, though officials said the battle lines could shift in coming weeks.
 The White House is largely turning away from the 36 governors races, although Mr. Rove and Mr. Bush will continue to help Republican candidates for governor raise money, party officials said. The decision has broad significance because building a foundation of Republican governors had been a main part of Mr. Roves goal of creating a long-lasting Republican majority.
 The Republican National Committee expects to spend over $60 million, which would be a record, for the midterm elections. Officials say half of that would pay for get-out-the-vote operations in the targeted states. 
 In states where Mr. Bushs presence could be problematic, like Pennsylvania and Connecticut, the turnout operations give Mr. Rove a way to provide below-the-radar help.
 Mr. Mehlman, whom Mr. Rove assigned to master get-out-the-vote techniques years ago, has handed custom compact discs with lists of voters, along with information on their voting and consumer habits, to every state Republican chairman.
 One administration official said that Mr. Rove was also looking beyond Mr. Bushs term, to the creation of his library. And he is quietly making his influence felt in the 2008 presidential campaign. Most significantly, the White House has signaled to Bush supporters that they are free to work for Senator John McCain of Arizona, which could provide Mr. Rove a network of intelligence in 2008. Mr. Rove has made clear to associates that he is not supporting any candidate in that race. 
 Mr. Roves associates said it was inevitable that his clout would diminish somewhat given the presidents declining approval rating and the history of two-term presidents generally weakening by their sixth year in office. 
 Anytime youre in the position of being the prime mover, and youve got five people saying we should do it this way and five others saying we should do it that way, youre going to aggravate five people inevitably when you come down with a decision, said Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman. But Karl is willing to do that, and youre going to get your share of slings and arrows when you are.
 Indeed, Democrats aware of Mr. Roves reputation for pulling out all the stops when necessary and his ability to call on a shadow political machine of interest groups and donors to attack opponents said they remained worried about what kind of effort Mr. Rove might unleash in the closing weeks of the campaign. 
 But the limits of Mr. Roves influence were made clear this year when he was unable to persuade the speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Allan G. Bense, to run in the Republican primary for Senate against Representative Katherine Harris, whom the party judged to be a weak candidate. Mr. Rove invited Mr. Bense for a sit-down at his vacation home in Rosemary Beach, Fla., as part of a long but failed effort to get him to challenge Ms. Harris for the nomination, said Towson Fraser, a spokesman for Mr. Bense. 
 And Mr. Roves associates say he appreciates the need of candidates to distance themselves from the White House to win. But he was described as angered by candidates who he thought were going too far in criticizing Mr. Bush out of concern that attacks could further damage an already weakened president, they said.
 Mr. Rove meets in person only infrequently with the Republican heads of the Senate and House campaign committees, Senator Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina and Representative Thomas M. Reynolds of New York, though Mrs. Dole said he was always ready to jump on a plane to a fund-raiser at her request.
 Mr. Reynolds said the White House had been untiring in raising money and providing surrogates. But he made clear that when it came to the House races, he was running the show.
 Im the one who put together what I think is our best effort to win a House majority in 2006, Mr. Reynolds said.
 In the Ohio Senate race, Mr. Rove has found himself in a back-and-forth with Senator Mike DeWine. Mr. DeWine has at times resisted Mr. Roves counsel that he employ an unrelenting focus on terrorism, exhibiting what other Republicans described as ambivalence about a television commercial depicting the World Trade Center burning. 
 Candidates and strategists across the country say that they hear from Mr. Rove infrequently. 
 Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said he encountered Mr. Rove at a dinner at Vice President Dick Cheneys home here in late July. We chatted for a minute, Mr. Romney said. He was interested in how the governors races were looking. But it was interest as a fellow Republican.

HEADLINE: A Bank Survives. Now, the Hard Part.

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: New Orleans 

 BODY:
TO reach the executive suite of the Liberty Bank and Trust Company here, you first have to navigate a stretch of town that still lacks street signs. Finding an entrance to the bank's headquarters is another challenge. You have to circle behind the building, a six-story glass box that is still missing several windows, and -- as if there to work on the plumbing -- walk up a set of corrugated steel steps sandwiched between a Dumpster and an oversized air-conditioning unit. 
 After traversing a bare room that smells of mildew and walking past three disabled elevators, you trudge up five more flights of steel stairs to reach the office of Alden J. McDonald Jr., the chief executive of this institution, which was the country's third-largest black-owned bank until Hurricane Katrina and floodwaters roared through New Orleans one year ago.
Mr. McDonald and his staff count themselves among the fortunate, despite the general state of disrepair inside and outside their building. While their neighborhood wants for many basic amenities, including mail delivery and phone service, their company is one of the few enterprises back in business in the vast northeastern quadrant of New Orleans. And in a city where an estimated two in three businesses remain shuttered, Liberty is not only open but also turning a profit. 
 Floodwaters still covered much of New Orleans last September when Mr. McDonald first agreed to allow a reporter to chronicle his efforts and those of his staff to resuscitate their battered bank. Working out of a beachhead that Mr. McDonald established in Baton Rouge just after the storm, Liberty seemed on the edge of ruin. Its long-term survival seemed in doubt. 
 Liberty's most impressive accomplishment, like that of New Orleans itself, may simply be that it has regained some semblance of its old self in only 12 months. But Liberty is also like New Orleans and its ravaged economy in another crucial way: its recovery has a long way to go. 
 Liberty faces enormous hurdles, chief among them the lingering doubts about the viability of large stretches of the drowned-out, predominantly black eastern half of the city, where Liberty's customers were concentrated and which is still largely in ruin. Liberty's success in helping black professionals and others settle the east established a large African-American homeownership class for the first time in the city's history. But that legacy, combined with the bank's backing of the city's small but growing ranks of black entrepreneurs, prompts concern among experts contemplating how well Liberty will fare if its carefully cultivated customers never return. Liberty's very success, it seems, presents the bank with its greatest challenge.
 HURRICANE Katrina delivered body blows to virtually every business along the Gulf Coast, but few were more devastated than Liberty. One year after the storm, only half of the bank's eight New Orleans branches are open, and one of those has limited hours. Flooding badly damaged five branches and looters stole $700,000 from several branches, according to Mr. McDonald. Floodwaters overwhelmed a one-story operations center, which housed its paper records, and putrid water sat for weeks on the ground floor of its headquarters in New Orleans East, destroying the building's electrical system and elevators. Wind damage and rain destroyed sections of the building's top floors. 
 Insurance will offset some of those losses, but there is no compensating Liberty for the miseries visited upon its customers. Jobs disappeared as businesses closed and flooding destroyed or badly damaged the homes of roughly three-quarters of Liberty's customers -- and of most of the bank's staff, including Mr. McDonald. 
 By some measurements, Liberty is doing astonishingly well. After posting losses of $3.4 million in 2005, its worst performance since opening its doors 34 years ago, Liberty reported a $2 million profit in the first half of 2006. ''We're feeling very hopeful about the future,'' Mr. McDonald said recently. Even so, Liberty has already slipped to fifth in a ranking of the country's largest black-owned banks, according to Creative Investment Research, a firm that tracks minority-owned financial institutions.
 ''Liberty seems to have done a remarkable job in a trying situation, certainly better than I ever thought possible,'' said William Michael Cunningham, an African-American who runs Creative Investment Research in Minneapolis. ''But my concern is with the health of the bank two years, three years out, especially with so many questions around the rebuilding.'' 
 Will New Orleans truly come back, or is it destined to stand as a paler, less diverse version of its former self? There may be no better stand-in for addressing that question than this homegrown bank that, until Katrina, sparkled as a success tale, a black-owned institution in a predominantly African-American city that offered crucial service to sections of town historically underserved by mainstream banks.
 Alden McDonald awoke early on the Sunday before Katrina hit New Orleans last year. He planned to check on Liberty's various properties, ensuring that they had been properly secured, and then to join his wife inside the concrete fortress of the Hyatt hotel in the central business district, to ride out the storm. But Mr. McDonald, a native New Orleanian, changed his mind about staying as he toured the city. Listening to his car radio, he began to appreciate the might of Katrina. He phoned his wife, who checked them out of the Hyatt one hour after checking them in. The pair decided to retreat to the home of good friends in Atlanta.
 Then Mr. McDonald, like much of the world, hunkered down helplessly as he watched television coverage of his flooded city and tried hard to think about something other than retiring. ''My entire operation was under water,'' Mr. McDonald, 63, said. ''Which meant I had to go back and rebuild everything. I had to rebuild all systems. I had to rebuild all files. I didn't know how many of my customers would stay with me.'' 
 He also did not know the fate of tens of millions of dollars that Liberty had lent to homeowners and entrepreneurs in the part of the city that locals referred to simply as ''the east.''
 ''The only thing I could think of is, 'All of these people lost their real estate, which I had as collateral,' '' Mr. McDonald said. ''I knew I had insurance on a lot of it, but I still didn't know how much at the time.'' Sitting in his friend's home, he wondered if his bank's days as an independent institution were over.
 This bout of pessimism lasted two or three days, Mr. McDonald said, and over the coming months he was careful never to betray even a hint of doubt about the bank's future. He had been Liberty's chief executive since its founding in 1972, when its sole facility was a trailer in a sketchy part of town. He knew about hard times. After a few days in Atlanta, he started working on a survival plan that would quickly bring him to Baton Rouge. 
 ''There were a lot of people depending on me to make this thing come back,'' he said. ''My staff. The community.'' 
 Liberty had three outposts in Baton Rouge, 80 miles northwest of New Orleans, and two in Jackson, Miss., 160 miles due north. Those branches would prove crucial in the coming months, providing both ballast in unstable times and a base from which to operate. For the next six months, one of the Baton Rouge branches, a homely, spacious brick building missing a corner of its corrugated tin roof, served as the command post for Mr. McDonald and about 20 employees. Two of them, seated on beat-up borrowed chairs behind a pair of folding tables, served as Liberty's loan department. Four tables pushed together in the middle of a room accommodated a makeshift call center -- after BellSouth installed extra phone lines, nine days after the hurricane.
 Even after the bank set up a dozen phone lines to field calls, customers preferred driving to Baton Rouge from as far away as Houston and northern Louisiana, in order to meet in person with a bank employee. ''Basically it's everyone's job to deal with customers right now,'' Mr. McDonald said at the time, ''including mine.'' 
 Customer service was one major concern right after the storm; reconnecting the bank to the global A.T.M. system was another. Unlike larger banks, which had operation centers around the country, and smaller ones, which tended to outsource data processing, Liberty housed its central computers in New Orleans, which was without electricity or working telephone lines in Katrina's aftermath. 
 Mr. McDonald had prepared for the hurricane the same way he prepared for past storms, by creating several backup copies of the bank's computer records. Two employees got copies and Mr. McDonald sent two more via FedEx to a Pennsylvania company that handles the bank's computer operations during emergencies. But Mr. McDonald did not hear from either employee for more than a week after the storm, and Katrina interrupted FedEx's service for days.
 With customers scattered around the nation and desperate for cash, Mr. McDonald faced a tough choice: to lock out customers from A.T.M.'s and branches in the midst of the crisis and risk being cast as a Scrooge, or to allow them to withdraw cash and risk being ripped off because he temporarily had no way to determine how much money customers actually had in their accounts. Mr. McDonald chose the second option, permitting anyone with a Liberty account to withdraw up to $100, and then up to $500, per day. In the end, that cost the bank hundreds of thousands of dollars in overdrafts during the 10 days that Liberty's records were off the A.T.M. network. 
 Mr. McDonald's next big worry was cash flow. The same floods that destroyed homes also wiped out jobs. That meant Liberty needed to brace for a steep drop in deposits and mortgage payments. Liberty, like many other area banks, gave both homeowners and its small-business customers until Jan. 1 to resume monthly loan payments -- depriving the bank of its two largest revenue streams for four months while it racked up a number of extraordinary expenses.
 EMERGENCY computer services were costing the bank more than $50,000 a month, so Mr. McDonald ordered a new computer system, despite its $500,000 price. He spent thousands of dollars dispatching boats to eastern New Orleans to assess damage and to retrieve computers and furniture for Liberty's temporary home in Baton Rouge. Once the floodwaters receded, he brought in emergency generators to keep air blowing through his headquarters to fight mold; filling the generators' fuel tanks cost $1,500 a week. Apartments in Baton Rouge for displaced employees cost thousands of dollars a month. 
 ''I hate losing money,'' Mr. McDonald said in early October, six weeks after the storm. ''But everywhere I look I'm losing money.'' He had packed only a few short-sleeved shirts and one pair of slacks when he left New Orleans, thinking that he was leaving for a few days. Yet four weeks passed before he was finally able to take a day to relax in Baton Rouge and buy new clothes. ''Thank goodness I thought to bring four pair of underwear with me,'' he joked. 
 A courtly man with a shock of wavy white hair and a bushy white mustache, Mr. McDonald is more animated than one might expect of a bank president. He laughs often, and, to underscore a point, will let his mouth hang slack-jawed. It would be a month after Katrina before he visited his home for the first time in New Orleans East -- a journey he took, he said, because ''my wife was bugging me to get stuff out of the house.''
 Amid muck and mold, he found little to salvage in his home.
 At the end of each day, usually around 7 p.m., Mr. McDonald convened a small group in his office for what he called ''my daily crisis management meeting.'' Early on, the gatherings served as forums for sharing bad news. The new computer had arrived (cheers) but parts were missing (groans). New parts had arrived (huzzahs) but not crucial software components (more groans). Tasks that people thought might take a week or two, such as reviving the bank's Web site, ended up requiring a month or more.
 The daily financial updates were still more depressing. Before the storm, Liberty generated $150,000 a month in loan fees, but those funds largely evaporated in the first weeks after the storm because the bank was writing virtually no loans. The bank normally collected $70,000 in monthly charges from checking accounts -- but Liberty temporarily suspended this fee for most of its customers. 
 These grim financial realities invariably caused people to ask Mr. McDonald how Liberty could survive. The bank had roughly $40 million in securities, an ample cushion against insolvency if Mr. McDonald could stabilize its finances. But the clock was ticking, and to raise much-needed cash, Liberty sold a portion of its securities at a $1 million loss.
 '''These are nervous times for the bank,'' said Norman C. Francis, Liberty's chairman, five weeks after Katrina. 
 MR. McDONALD was largely alone in those first months after the storm. The bank's chief operating officer had resigned earlier that year to take a job in Detroit and Mr. McDonald had let his chief financial officer go shortly after the storm. 
 Monthly board meetings continued, but directors had their own distractions. All but one had lost a home in the storm, and all had other responsibilities that needed attention. ''All of us had a lot going on,'' said Mr. Francis, the president of Xavier University, a historically black college in New Orleans that had been flooded. That was especially true for Mr. McDonald, who was appointed by Mayor C. Ray Nagin to the 17-member commission created last September to devise a blueprint for rebuilding New Orleans.
 ''Anything we do to get people back in town helps my bank,'' Mr. McDonald said at the time. 
 If the first two months after the storm were about bailing water to keep a sinking bank afloat, the next six months were about reigniting Liberty's financial engines. Mortgage payments would restart after the first of the year, and the bank could once again count on a steady stream of fee income. But every week brought more closing of accounts by longtime customers, often because there were no Liberty branches near their new homes. 
 The top priority during this second phase was to analyze the bank's loan portfolio and to gauge the likelihood of loan defaults. That meant figuring out who had adequate homeowner insurance and who did not. Those without flood insurance were likely to default on their loans and leave Liberty with largely worthless collateral: flood- and hurricane-ravaged homes and businesses. Analyzing potential defaults would have been fairly routine if the bank had access to its paper records, but the floods had destroyed those. So Mr. McDonald assigned a small team of people to track down individual borrowers.
 ''I can't even begin to tell you how many hundreds of hours we spent on that piece,'' he said. (In time, though, he will know the precise costs: he has asked his new chief financial officer to tally the figure so he can submit it with insurance claims.) 
 IN October, Mr. McDonald opened a pair of branches in neighborhoods that were beginning to repopulate: the Garden District and the West Bank. Almost immediately, lines began to form as customers were eager to get on with their lives. By November, the precipitous drop in Liberty's deposits had stopped. 
 ''People were increasing their balances rather than decreasing their balances,'' Mr. McDonald said. It was then, he realized, that his bank might make it.
 He might have been confident about the bank's prospects, but a large portion of his customer base still had no idea when they would move home, if ever. Working with lobbyists in Washington, he tried, unsuccessfully, to have Congress pass a law requiring the federal government to funnel a large portion of Gulf Coast redevelopment funds through smaller community banks like Liberty. He thought, too, about raising his profile nationally and catering to larger corporate depositors, like Aetna and American Express, which he already had as customers.
 In the end, ''Phase 2,'' as Mr. McDonald took to calling it, entailed doing what the bank always did -- selling its services to individuals -- but doing so with more creative flair. 
 Earlier this year, Liberty repackaged certificates of deposits as Katrina Investment Deposits, or K.I.D.'s, which were nothing but C.D.'s offered at a below-market interest rate and wrapped in a feel-good package. Countless people had offered to help Liberty, and this was the financial vehicle it created to capitalize on that goodwill.
 Though he gave people a choice between interest rates of 2 percent and 2.5 percent, ''quite a few people chose 2 percent,'' Mr. McDonald said. (That rate was well below the 5 percent or so that a customer could have earned on a regular C.D. last spring.) Over the coming months, Liberty would sell $10 million worth of K.I.D.'s -- using the money to jump-start lending, its primary source of profits. 
 To further bolster his flagging loan business, Mr. McDonald offered 100 percent mortgage financing and set in motion a plan to open loan centers in strip malls in other parts of Louisiana as well as Texas and Mississippi. 
 ''I needed those fees,'' he said. ''I needed to get my interest income up.'' Liberty's staff was able to qualify enough people to approve $10 million in loans in less than three months. That amount exceeded Mr. McDonald's expectations, but it was still just a fraction of the $10 million a month that Liberty lent, on average, before Katrina. Today the bank is writing no more than $3 million a month in loans, Mr. McDonald said, and has stopped writing riskier, no-money-down loans.
 In time, Mr. McDonald would complain that while he took time every Monday to drive to New Orleans to attend meetings of Mayor Nagin's commission, the group never discussed the core issue of what to do about the city's most heavily damaged neighborhoods. To this day the city is without a coherent plan for the east. But his trips gave Mr. McDonald an excuse to drive through neighborhoods to see where people were returning. Those tours persuaded him to open two branches in January in Gentilly, a large, racially mixed area in the center of New Orleans. 
 Other banks, including Chase and Whitney National Bank, a venerable local institution, have followed him into Gentilly. A visit to all three banks in mid-August found what seemed to be a brisk pace of business. But Mr. McDonald stressed that he was the first to open in Gentilly, and that move inspired envy in at least one rival. 
 ''Right now I wish I had a branch in Gentilly,'' said Virgil Robinson Jr., the chief executive of Dryades Savings, a smaller black-owned bank based in New Orleans. An executive at Liberty until leaving in 1994, Mr. Robinson said his former boss had deftly negotiated that delicate balance between reopening a branch too early and waiting too long. 
 ''We want to be back in the area early but not so early that we're the first one out there,'' said Mr. Robinson. ''There's protection in numbers.'' 
 Mr. McDonald proved a trailblazer again in March, when he moved back into his headquarters in the east. When he is too tired to commute back home to Baton Rouge, he sleeps in a borrowed recreational vehicle.
 Viewed from the vantage point of the central business district or the French Quarter, the city and its business environment can seem to be in good shape. These areas have been repopulated, and businesses large and small have returned. Most of the city's hotels are open again, as are most of its major employers and its more popular restaurants and music clubs. Focusing solely on Liberty's branches in the western, predominantly white half of the city also might suggest that the bank's operations are more or less back to normal.
 But there appears to be relatively little forward motion in the city's eastern business corridors. In New Orleans East, for instance, home to 90,000 people before Katrina, maybe a half-dozen restaurants have opened. A few car dealerships are back in business, along with several gas stations and a giant Home Depot -- and Liberty. 
 Mr. McDonald had anticipated that Katrina would translate into $10 million to $12 million in losses in the last four months of 2005. It ended up costing him half that much. When Katrina hit, Liberty was on pace to post a $3 million profit for the year. Instead, it lost $3.6 million. 
 Some bright spots emerged. Only seven borrowers let their flood insurance lapse after taking a loan from Liberty; out of a $150 million loan portfolio, Liberty wrote off only $2 million last year. Most of those bad loans, Mr. McDonald said, were car loans or credit card debt. Like many other banks across the Gulf Coast region, Liberty is now flush with cash as people park large insurance settlements in their accounts while considering their next financial steps.
 This year has brought Mr. McDonald and his staff more good news. Based on results from the first half of 2006, he predicted that the bank would earn $4 million for the entire year. ''This is going to be the most profitable year in the history of this company,'' he said. 
 Yet Liberty's buffed-up bottom line can be deceiving. A widespread lack of housing in New Orleans, Mr. McDonald acknowledged, has meant that the bank has fewer employees than it needs. Where he once had 160 employees, he now has 90. The shortage has kept expenses low, bolstering profitability, but the same shortage makes it hard to generate new revenue. Mr. McDonald wishes that he could hire more tellers, branch assistants, and loan officers and open a fifth branch in New Orleans, he said, ''except I'd have no one to staff it.'' 
 ONE year ago, Liberty had 35,000 customers. Today it has 20,000 to 25,000, Mr. McDonald said. ''I know I have to get an exact count on that,'' he added, before letting his voice trail off. His half-staff bank, it seems, has other priorities. 
 Elevator repairs alone will cost Liberty $350,000, and the bank has lost about $100,000 a month in rental income from tenants who once leased office space in its New Orleans headquarters but now have no immediate plans to move back home. 
 Water, not wind, did most of the damage to Liberty, and it is still uncertain how much its insurers will cover. Mr. McDonald had business-interruption insurance, for instance, but he said it was not clear, even one year after Katrina, whether insurers would approve flood claims. ''Everyone is still struggling with insurance companies,'' he said. 
 There is another question preoccupying anyone with a financial stake in the eastern half of New Orleans: Which parts of the city will come back and which will end up as forlorn, half-occupied neighborhoods without basic services? Mr. Nagin ended up ignoring his own commission's recommendation that New Orleans devote its limited resources to neighborhoods that can prove that a critical mass of their residents are returning. Instead, the mayor has encouraged people to rebuild anywhere they want in the city. 
 Mr. McDonald's best guess is that only half the population of the east will eventually move home -- if that. Of the 150 families in his subdivision in New Orleans East, he knows about 10 families that are returning. He even counts himself among the undecided. 
 From his sixth-floor office, Mr. McDonald has a perfect view of the mall next door. Its huge parking lot is empty, except for piles of debris, and its stores sit as ruined reminders of how much the east has lost and how little it has recovered. Mr. McDonald, meanwhile, intends to try to ''go to where my customers are'' by opening loan centers in strip malls and in places like Houston and some cities elsewhere in Louisiana and in Mississippi. 
 ''Whenever you have obstacles,'' he says, ''you always have opportunities.''

HEADLINE: This Season's Must-Have Urban Accessory

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

DATELINE: COSTA MESA, Calif. 

 BODY:
TALL and silver-haired, wearing a pin-striped suit and the prosperous air of Orange County, Calif., Henry Segerstrom made his way recently to the conductor's podium of the concert hall that bears his and his wife's name. Before he could speak, the musicians of the Pacific Symphony Orchestra, who were there for the hall's baptismal rehearsal, applauded and cheered. Mr. Segerstrom, a prominent real estate developer, bowed and addressed them in a soft but steady voice.
 ''You have been an inspiration from the start,'' he said. ''We're in complete control of our artistic destiny. This hall can do anything you guys can do.''
Designed by Cesar Pelli, it has already done something: it has made a splash, with its undulating glass walls, curvaceous tiers, silver-leafed foyer ceiling, chandelier of 300 individual hanging crystal lights and well-coifed public plaza. 
 But such architecture does not come cheap. The new Renee and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall cost $200 million. Mr. Segerstrom led the drive to have it built and provided about a quarter of the money; other donations came from the county's wealthy business class. Several of the donors were there with him at the rehearsal that evening, joined by orchestra administrators, builders, designers and the elated music director of the Pacific Symphony, Carl St. Clair.
 All in all, it was a scene in an increasingly familiar American civic drama: the building of a new concert hall, a lavish statement of civic pride and cultural ambition.
 The new hall (not to be confused with the existing Segerstrom Hall, across a plaza at the Orange County Performing Arts Center) opens on Sept. 14, in the beginning of what will be a banner season for major new performance spaces. Five are opening in North America this fall, at a total cost of nearly $1 billion. They include the Schermerhorn Symphony Center in Nashville, the new home of the Nashville Symphony, which opens next Saturday; the Four Seasons Center for the Performing Arts in Toronto, the new house of the Canadian Opera Company, which had special inaugural concerts in June and opens its first season with a Wagner ''Ring'' cycle later this month; and the Carnival Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, which comprises both a house for opera and ballet and a concert hall and opens officially on Oct. 5.
 The stories behind these buildings show the wide array of hopes that a community invests in a new performing space, even at a time when many fret that classical music is becoming less relevant. 
 As concert halls have evolved into multipurpose destinations -- complete with chic restaurants, bars and the inevitable education centers -- local officials and business leaders have come to view them as a chance to revive a downtown or add luster to their city. Orchestra administrators see a draw for new audiences and a means of raising their group's profile. Music directors envision a platform to artistic greatness. Orchestra members hear wonderful new acoustics. The music-loving public looks forward to more and better concerts. 
 ''There's a sense that a concert hall can truly enrich a community,'' said Deborah Borda, the president of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. ''People have seen successful examples of that, and they aspire to it.'' She should know: the orchestra's Walt Disney Concert Hall, which opened in 2003 and was designed by Frank Gehry, has quickly become a cultural touchstone, attracting full houses and plenty of buzz.
 Visually arresting concert halls with sophisticated acoustical setups have also opened in Philadelphia; North Bethesda, Md.; Fort Worth; and Omaha in the last eight years. Atlanta is raising funds to build a hall designed by Santiago Calatrava.
 ''It's a great expression of optimism in the art form,'' said Gary Hanson, the executive director of the Cleveland Orchestra. For any orchestra that aspires to greatness, he added, a hall to match is a prerequisite. 
 Yet for all the boosterism behind new halls and the hoopla surrounding their openings, some observers call for tempered expectations.
 ''A new theater is not automatically simply great news,'' said Marc Scorca, the president of Opera America, an organization serving opera companies nationwide. When a hall is added, he said, it may just divert audiences and their dollars from other performance and cultural institutions.
 ''This is all redistributing people's expenditures from one activity to another,'' said David Galenson, an economist at the University of Chicago who focuses on the arts. 
 Tyler Cowen, a professor of economics at George Mason University and the author of ''Good and Plenty: The Creative Successes of American Arts Funding,'' said there was little solid research measuring the economic impact of arts centers on a city, although there was for sports stadiums. Such research shows no benefit for a city's growth, he said, adding that he was skeptical about economic claims for new concert halls.
 ''The glorious tales are typically exaggerations,'' said Mr. Cowen, who also contributes a monthly economics column to The New York Times. 
 A look at how the new halls came into being reveals a pattern. 
 An orchestra outgrows its old multipurpose hall. A powerful person steps up with drive and money. The planners woo local officials and donors. A celebrity architect is engaged. A large public relations firm begins an expensive campaign trumpeting the architectural and acoustic glories of the new hall.
 Nashville followed much of this script. In the spring of 2000 the Nashville Chamber of Commerce arranged for city leaders to visit Seattle in search of ideas about civic improvement. The last stop was a visit to Benaroya Hall, the home of the Seattle Symphony since 1998. The visitors heard a rehearsal of a Beethoven symphony, said Alan D. Valentine, the president of the 60-year-old Nashville Symphony and a member of the touring group.
 ''They were just blown away by the quality of the building,'' he said. The visitors were then polled on the top five ideas they could take back to Nashville. A dedicated concert hall was No. 2, behind public transportation. ''I said, 'Oh my God, they got it,' '' Mr. Valentine recounted.
 That September he took the orchestra, which used to play in the acoustically and architecturally drab Tennessee Performing Arts Center, to Carnegie Hall, and 1,100 Nashville citizens and orchestra supporters went along. ''It was the Carnegie Hall concert which really helped the board and leaders of the community to understand how a good orchestra can sound in a good space,'' Mr. Valentine said.
 Board members, administrators and designers toured Europe's best halls. Martha Ingram, a wealthy orchestra supporter who was the companion of Kenneth Schermerhorn, the orchestra's music director for 22 years, provided $30 million to the project. Mr. Schermerhorn, who died last year, was instrumental in building the orchestra's quality and reputation.
 ''What really matters is doing this project in a way that will benefit Nashvillians and make things better here,'' Mr. Valentine said. ''That's ultimately what we are, community servants.''
 The neo-Classical limestone-clad hall is in keeping with the character of Nashville's other civic buildings. It has the natural light of the Musikvereinsaal in Vienna and the alcoves and intimate lobby seating of the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. 
 ''They were looking for a building that would appear timeless and not be dated 10 years after opening,'' said Craig P. Williams, the project manager for the architectural firm, David M. Schwarz. 
 Then the Nashville Symphony, like the Orange County Performing Arts Center, hired an outside public relations firm, Ruder Finn, to promote the hall, arranging meetings with reporters in New York well in advance. 
 Mayor Bill Purcell of Nashville said the city's investment of $16 million so far and the private money spent on the hall were worth it. ''For me, this is really the last essential part for our being the Music City,'' he said. Along with the Grand Ole Opry and other bluegrass and country music sites, ''this particular symphony hall frankly finishes out that range of venues, of special places, that we had to have,'' he said. ''We needed this, and we needed it now.''
 Mr. Valentine added: ''The hall itself is a great reflection of what Nashville feels about its orchestra. That's good for our long-term well-being, financially and otherwise.'' This season the orchestra has more than doubled its ticket revenue, a development that Mr. Valentine attributes to excitement over the hall. The orchestra will present about 100 concerts a season, instead of the previous 65. 
 But the hall will cost more to run: about $2.5 million in the orchestra's budget. The orchestra hopes to make up the difference with rentals, more ticket and endowment income and annual giving increases, Mr. Valentine said. 
 BEFORE construction of the Carnival Center for the Performing Arts could begin in Miami, backers commissioned at least three economic impact statements to convince public officials that it would improve depressed downtown Miami streets the way Lincoln Center did for part of the Upper West Side of Manhattan. 
 ''That's been a strong argument here,'' said Michael Hardy, the Carnival Center's president and chief executive. ''We've used it a lot.'' 
 A study by Michael Connolly, an economics professor at the University of Miami, said the center would generate $122 million annually for businesses in the area and $6 million in taxes, and add 1,059 jobs. Professor Connolly said it had stimulated development in the depressed area around it and had helped push up property values at a faster rate than in the rest of Miami. Already 35,000 condominium units have been built within a 15-block radius of the center, Mr. Hardy said. But Professor Connolly's estimate of $491 million in new building investment fell below the expectations of its backers.
 The Carnival Center also came with huge cost overruns. It was budgeted at $255 million but rose to $461 million. ''It was a much harder building to build than people realized,'' Mr. Hardy said. Most of that money came from the proceeds of a local hotel tax, along with $85 million in private, corporate and foundation money.
 The Miami center is an anomaly. There is no resident orchestra, although the Cleveland Orchestra will have a yearly three-week residency, and the New World Orchestra, a training group, will also play there regularly. Barely two-dozen classical concerts will be presented this season. The rest is mostly jazz, world music, Broadway shows and popular entertainers. The resident Florida Grand Opera and the Miami City Ballet will benefit the most.
 Some arts groups in Miami have argued that some of the vast amount of money raised for the center could have gone to pay musicians, dancers and singers.
 ''Concert halls are needed, but when concert halls are sucking up all the money of a community, I don't believe they are really serving the community,'' said Luciano Magnanini, the former principal bassoonist of the Florida Philharmonic Orchestra, which declared bankruptcy in 2003. ''Great civilizations are known for their culture. They're not known for the money. I don't know anybody who goes to Florence because the Medicis were great bankers.''
 One important motivation in Orange County was to free up space in the existing Segerstrom Hall, which plays host to touring Broadway shows, a concert series and the Pacific Symphony: more than 350 performances a year. Since the old hall was built in 1986, the county's population has increased 50 percent, to three million, creating more demand for seats. 
 The orchestra was chafing. The hall was so overscheduled that musicians had to rehearse in a former church. And it was so big that it did not fit smaller works, like Mozart and Haydn symphonies, putting a damper on the orchestra's development, said Mr. St. Clair, the longtime music director. Founded only in 1978, the Pacific Symphony lacks a major national profile and pays by the service, meaning that the members, many of them crack Los Angeles studio musicians, do not receive fixed salaries like players in major orchestras. But it has big ambitions and has come up with innovative programming. 
 ''We had reached our plateau,'' said John Forsyte, the orchestra's executive director. ''We're just trying to catch up to where an orchestra like the Boston Symphony is.'' 
 Mr. St. Clair holds a yearly American composers festival and has released several recordings and produced important commissions. The orchestra's patrons raised money to send it on a European tour this summer, a calculated maneuver to attract attention, lift orchestra morale by letting it play in first-rate halls and give it experience in adjusting to new spaces.
 ''We have a golden opportunity to take our young history and mold ourselves,'' Mr. St. Clair said. ''This is much more than a building. I really hope this will be the breath and soul of Orange County.''
 But the orchestra's situation is not ideal. It holds a year-to-year lease with the center, which has ultimate say in programming. 
 The hall was built on former lima bean fields owned by the Segerstrom family, which transformed farmland into the sleek office buildings, malls and arts hub of Costa Mesa's downtown. Mr. Segerstrom, 83, a competitive man beneath his patrician exterior, says the performing arts center is part of his vision for Orange County. He calls it the ''symbol of Orange County's pride and self-esteem.''
 He and other backers also hope that it will give a focus to the county, an agglomeration of nearly three dozen towns flung south and east of Los Angeles, and help lift it out of that city's shadow. Mr. Segerstrom said the new hall was mainly a source of cultural distinction but acknowledged that well-heeled concertgoers would be welcome in his company's luxury South Coast Plaza shopping mall next door.
 All told, he put up $50 million for the new hall. But later fund-raising lagged, forcing backers to scrape up donations to meet interest payments on construction bonds. Still, few expect Orange County's wealthy pillars to let the campaign fail.
 During the first rehearsal, of Holst's ''Planets'' and ''Shooting Stars'' by Frank Ticheli, the orchestra came out full of smiles. Backstage, wine bottles with yellow caution-tape bows stood in rows.
 Mr. St. Clair, began the rehearsal with a carefully considered passage, the lush, regal theme from the ''Jupiter'' movement of ''The Planets.'' The musicians were impressed by the sound, some saying they could hear one another for the first time and play softly with ease.
 Mindy Ball, a harpist, teared up. ''It's a musical jewel,'' she said. ''It's for the 21st century, and it's all ours.''

HEADLINE: The I'm-Not-Ugly American

BYLINE: By Ann Hulbert. 
Ann Hulbert, a contributing writer, is the author of ''Raising America: Experts, Parents and a Century of Advice About Children.''

 BODY:
Going through passport control on our return from a recent two-week trip to Istanbul and the Turkish coast, my family and I faced the routine question, ''And what was the purpose of your travels?'' Asked at the start, I might well have answered ''personal diplomacy'' instead of ''vacation.'' In an era plagued by anti-Americanism -- and by terrorism alerts and battles in the Middle East, not to mention bird flu -- summer travel abroad, especially to a Muslim country, has acquired an aura of more than mere tourism. Sun and fun were in store, of course, yet as we packed, we weren't feeling like carefree sightseers exactly. 
Anxious cultural emissaries was more like it, and high on our list of goals -- along with seeing the Hagia Sophia -- was not being mistaken for ugly Americans. I went so far as to veto one of my teenage son's T-shirt choices, an item from his array of Quaker-school stuff, of all things. The text printed on it wasn't very likely to offend (or, for that matter, be understood). ''The Fighting Quakers,'' it said, followed by the joke, ''Beat them 'til they reach consensus.'' What worried me was the accompanying caricature of a Ben Franklin look-alike, with his teeth bared and his dukes up. The pilgrim as pugilist: we didn't need to be walking billboards for belligerence.
 I was, I have since discovered, proceeding in just the hypersensitive fashion recommended to U.S. travelers by the World Citizens Guide, a pamphlet published by a nonprofit organization called Business for Diplomatic Action, founded two years ago to help burnish America's image abroad. B.D.A.'s president, a renowned advertising executive named Keith Reinhard (the wizard behind the McDonald's account, with its award-winning ''You deserve a break today'' jingle), decided that the beleaguered national brand couldn't be rescued by the likes of the State Department's Karen Hughes alone. Public diplomacy needed a boost from the private sector.
 Give America a break today is the B.D.A. booklet's basic message to citizens and businesses: don't behave with the rude arrogance that has become the national trademark. Be humble and patient and steer clear of politics. Strive for sartorial modesty and cultural awareness -- read a book (I chose Orhan Pamuk) and learn a phrase (my husband inspired awe by discovering the unusual Turkish word for an especially delicious variety of watercress and then ordering it wherever we went). Adopt dulcet tones and always be ready to listen, not lecture, and to flash a smile. ''It's a universal equalizer.''
 The advice is all very practical. But it's also a little pat and, as that salute to smiles as a social leveler suggests, naively patronizing in a way that's worth examining. Critics of public diplomacy have been quick to disparage the American belief that international tensions can be eased by dispatching an official to proclaim that deep down we are all united by our love for, say, children -- a Hughes staple -- when the animus, in fact, arises from real policy differences with the U.S. government. The pursuit of private diplomacy rests on the opposite innocent illusion: just tone down crass Americans' noisy cultural differences from others, and political and economic harmony can follow. But what if Americans have no monopoly on brashness and don't really rate any longer as the overweening cultural trendsetters our demonizers, and we, reflexively assume?
 In essence, the mission of the American as World Citizen is to try and fit in better, or at any rate to stick out less: just what the U.S. as a nation is resented for making no attempt to do. But it's hard to know which of our features cry out for modulation. Does Turkey, a proudly secular and deeply devout society, distrust us for our wild popular culture or for our moralizing piety? Whatever might be the case, a mere 17 percent of respondents registered a positive image of Americans, according to a recent Pew survey, and only 3 percent expressed confidence in Bush, putting Turkey at the top of the list of U.S. detractors. Meanwhile, two recent pop-culture sensations -- a pulp thriller called ''Metal Storm'' and a film called ''Valley of the Wolves'' -- feature the U.S. military as marauding invaders. Paradoxically enough, the Turkish forces who take brutal revenge resemble nothing so much as their nemesis. There isn't much difference, it seems, between the Hollywood invasion thriller and the anti-Hollywood invasion thriller.
 What may be most confusing of all is the warm welcome U.S. visitors actually receive in a country that is as culturally cacophonous as America and labors under no inhibitions when it comes to boasting and bullying. The demurely dressed American tourist (shoulders and knees covered, often in khaki) can't walk a block in Istanbul without seeing Turks wearing hijabs and jilbabs (those modest coatdress coverings) side by side with tank tops and tight jeans -- and without getting lectured about where the true cradle of cultural diversity lies. Here's a collision of secularism and Islamism, the Turks are right, that owes more to Ataturk and centuries of entanglement with Europe than to the corrosive allure of New World exports. 
 Busily monitoring our well-known tendency to strident self-importance, earnest American practitioners of personal diplomacy can risk missing the genuinely humbling lesson of being abroad: an awareness of how bewildering another country's own blend of boorishness and fervent belief, of openness and defiance, of backwardness and progress and of internal dissensions can be. In the end, it's as narcissistic to assume we're the overbearing cause of everybody else's national identity crises in a dizzying world as it is to imagine that we can orchestrate the solutions to them. The sobering, and liberating, truth is that our britches are not that big.

HEADLINE: The State of Research Isn't All That Grand

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK

 BODY:
WHEN analyzing a company's performance, investors pay particular attention to what is spent on research and development. That's because R.& D. represents investments that, over all, are likely to pay dividends in the future. It's one of the most important sources of value creation for any company and can reveal much about its prospects.
 The same holds true for the economy. Few other investments can pay off the way research and development can. Imagine, for instance, how the American economy would have performed without enormous investment in new technologies during the 20th century.
So what do the trends in R.& D. spending reveal about the economy's future? 
 Unfortunately, no single number captures the state of such spending today. That is partly because official statistics take three years to compile and partly because aggregate numbers say little about important matters like the composition and quality of the spending. 
 Still, by working through national and international data, it's possible to piece together what's happening. While the United States remains the world's biggest investor in research and development, there are troubling signs. At a time when some of the nation's most formidable competitors are investing heavily in research, the United States is treading water.
 Start with the aggregate numbers. Total R.& D. spending in the United States grew for decades until 2002, when it dropped for the first time in 50 years after the crash of technology stocks. According to the latest figures from the National Science Foundation, such spending climbed slightly in 2003, to $291.9 billion, after adjusting for inflation, and is estimated to have increased to $312.1 billion in 2004. 
 Because the official numbers stop there, industry groups try to make more up-to-date estimates. Battelle, the science and technology company based in Columbus, Ohio, working with R&D magazine, expects research and development spending to grow 2.9 percent this year, to $328.9 billion. That growth rate is around the historical average, and about half the average growth of the late 1990's.
 The underlying picture, however, is less comforting than these numbers suggest.
 After several years of spending a bit more on research and development, the federal government is cutting back in some areas, after adjusting for inflation. While the government will continue to spend more on developing weapons systems and spacecraft, overall government investment in basic and applied research -- the foundation of the nation's innovative capacity -- is in some ways shrinking. 
 Kei Koizumi, director of the research and development budget and policy program at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, says federal investment in research as a share of the nation's total economic output is projected to drop to 0.4 percent in 2007 from 0.5 percent this year. (While 0.4 percent has been the average since the 1970's, Mr. Koizumi said it was widely recognized that as technology drives more of the economy, research to replenish the knowledge base for future innovations becomes more important.)
 It wouldn't be so bad if this were just a blip. But R.& D. investment has been a declining priority for the government -- once the dominant source -- for several decades. Forty years ago, the government accounted for 67 percent of total R.& D. spending; today, its share is roughly 30 percent. Corporate America makes up most of the rest. 
 ''The government is spending a smaller and smaller amount of our economy on R.& D., and that comes at a time when other countries are dramatically increasing their investments,'' Mr. Koizumi said. ''It raises big concerns for the future of U.S. innovation.'' 
 Economists have long understood that the government makes crucial R.& D. investments that the private sector doesn't. These investments, mainly in basic research, play out over the long term and are risky in that they may or may not pay off commercially. 
 Basic research is the foundation of innovation because it advances scientific knowledge and generates ideas that industry can then use to develop products and services for commercial use. Without basic research, there would be far fewer great ideas in which corporate America could invest.
 What is the private sector doing while the government cuts back? Business investment in research and development is still recovering from the technology bubble, growing only 0.3 percent a year in real terms from 2000 to 2004, according to the National Science Foundation. That compares with an average real growth rate of 7.2 percent from 1994 to 2000. 
 The foundation and other agencies have detected higher expectations for corporate R.& D. spending recently, but more and more are developing research sites overseas, raising concerns about how the benefits will filter back to the United States. In their 2006 forecast, Battelle and R&D magazine said ''major increases in the funding of offshore operations will have an impact on the United States R.& D. enterprise.'' The magazine found that 40 percent of the American high-tech industry already had a research and development presence in Asia, and, of that share, about one-third plan to increase their presence.
 That comes as other nations are ramping up their research investments. In recent years, China and South Korea, in particular, have increased government spending on research by 10 percent or more annually, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
 Having a large share of the world's scientists is crucial to a nation's innovation. According to a recent survey by the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton and Insead, the French business school, China and India will account for 31 percent of the world's research and development personnel by the end of 2007, up from 19 percent in 2004. 
 In global R.& D. rankings, the United States is still the clear leader in spending, with 34 percent of the total. In fact, about half of all such spending comes from just two nations: the United States and Japan. 
 But the United States falls down the list when it comes to more meaningful comparisons. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the nation ranks seventh in R.& D. spending as a share of the economy, trailing Sweden, Finland, Japan, Switzerland, Iceland and South Korea. In spending on basic research as a share of R.& D., the United States ranks 11th. And when measuring nondefense research as a share of the economy, it's 22nd.
 Looking ahead, there is good reason to expect even greater pressure on R.& D spending in the United States. The federal government will be only more constrained in its ability to invest in research as large unfunded commitments like Social Security and Medicare come due. Corporate America will continue to face competitive global pressures, seeking investments that pay off in the short term. And fast-developing countries like China and India will strive to become even more powerful global forces. 
 It all leads to a question: Where will the innovation come from to drive the American economy of the future?

HEADLINE: The Last Stand of the 6-Percenters?

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

DATELINE: Seattle 

 BODY:
WHEN David and Annette Wolf decided that their family was outgrowing its Seattle area home, they also decided that they did not need much help finding a new one.
 They combed Internet listings of homes for sale until they spotted a four-bedroom house on a cul-de-sac with a three-car garage and 2.5 acres.
But the seller's agent refused to show it to them. Why would she turn away an eager buyer? Not because of the Wolfs' race, creed or color. Instead, Mr. Wolf, a software engineering manager at the online directory InfoSpace, said he and his wife were shunned once the agent learned they used an online broker called Redfin.
 Mr. Wolf said they turned to Redfin because it gives two-thirds of its sales commission (which is usually 3 percent of the sale price) to its customers. ''I didn't want to pay 3 percent for the opening of a door,'' he said. But customers like Mr. Wolf -- affluent and comfortable with the Internet -- are a frightening prospect for real estate agents who, as a group, reap at least $60 billion a year in commission income. 
 Redfin and other innovators, including ZipRealty and BuySideInc.com, are using technology to reduce costs and to save time for their brokers. Agents don't find and recommend homes -- customers do that on their own, using Internet listings -- and that enables agents to charge less for the services they do provide, chiefly handling the paperwork and negotiations.
 The Internet has radically changed the way consumers buy books and airline tickets, trade stock and learn news. But the real estate industry has resisted change -- and protected its commission structure -- by controlling the information on its Multiple Listing Service database of properties for sale. 
 ''You can find out more on the Internet about an eBay Beanie Baby than you can about a $1 million house,'' said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a licensed broker in Washington State and California. 
 The M.L.S. is the only place that contains nearly all the homes for sale in a community. Only brokers can post there, but agents can also display selected information about a listing on their own Web sites and on Realtor.com, a site that works with the National Association of Realtors. 
 Traditional agents still firmly control the M.L.S., which allows all participating brokers, including Redfin, to view almost every home for sale in a particular area, even those being offered through competitors' agencies. But the typical 6 percent commission, paid out of the seller's proceeds and split between the seller's and buyer's agents, is under attack because, as economists note, it does not serve consumers well. 
 Economists who have studied the current system say that it also does little for most agents -- except for a few stars, whose impressive earnings give hope to the large majority of less-successful agents and thus encourage them to protect the status quo. Rivals on the Internet say they do this by refusing to cooperate with buyers using Web-based brokers and by denying M.L.S. information to some online firms.
 THEY have not, as yet, fought back by reducing their commissions. And Paul B. Goodrich, the managing director of the Madrona Venture Group in Seattle, an investor in Redfin, says he thinks that they are unlikely ever to do so. ''It will be hard for the real estate industry to change the way it compensates its agents,'' he said. ''If Coldwell Banker announced it was paying 1 percent commission to its agents, there would be a mass exodus.''
 As it turned out, the Wolfs' offer was the highest of five bids made for the house they wanted, and they were able to buy it despite the balky broker. (They toured the house with a friend who is an agent.) They also received a $16,300 commission rebate from Redfin and became firm believers in online real estate brokers.
 But as the couple's story shows, people who want to use Web-based brokers often have to fight to do so. Many are, and there are growing signs that they are succeeding. BuySideInc.com, an online buyer's broker in Chicago that offers a 75 percent commission rebate, said that at one point 12 percent of its customers reported that traditional agents had refused to show houses to them. 
 The rate is now down to about 6 percent, perhaps because of responses like this: One client who was denied a showing made an offer anyway that was contingent on getting a tour -- a move intended to alert the seller to the refusing agent's actions.
 ''I'd like to have been the fly on the wall for the conversation between that seller and his agent,'' said Joseph J. Fox, chief executive of BuySide and a founder of one of the earliest online stock brokerage firms, WebStreet. ''The amazing thing,'' he added, ''is that the selling agent still got paid and made $15,000 to $20,000.''
 In many cities, real estate agents have tried to restrict access to M.L.S. information or to limit its use on the database. Some have asked state legislatures to pass laws forcing brokers to offer certain levels of service, a move that Mr. Kelman sees as intended to squeeze out discount brokers. ''It's a thousand tiny shackles on innovation,'' he said.
 The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have fought these tactics in Texas, Kentucky, Tennessee and Oklahoma, among other states, and the department is suing the National Association of Realtors, the powerful trade group of agents and brokers, over what it calls anticompetitive rules. 
 ''Where it comes to our attention that significantly anticompetitive state laws or regulations are under consideration, we approach state officials to advocate that they take into account the benefits to consumers of a more competitive approach,'' said J. Bruce McDonald, deputy assistant attorney general for the antitrust division of the Justice Department. 
 The battle by the traditional agents reveals how vulnerable the broker's 6 percent commission has become. Agents are quick to point out that the average commission may be closer to 5 percent -- a 17 percent decline over 10 years, they say -- but no one knows for sure because no one collects data on that.
 In many cities, of course, even a one-point drop in commissions has been more than offset by soaring sale prices in recent years. In 1994, for example, a home in San Francisco that sold for nearly $500,000 earned a total of almost $30,000 for the agents commanding a 6 percent fee. Even if the commission slipped to 5 percent when the same house sold this year for more than $1.5 million, the higher price earned its agents a $75,000 commission.
 Some economists wonder why agents fight so hard to maintain this pricing system when it is making so few of them rich. In every housing boom, the number of new agents entering the market tracks the climb in home prices. As a result, the average agent sells far fewer homes and makes less money. On average, agents earn $49,300 a year, according to the National Association of Realtors, and that is before paying for their own health insurance and retirement benefits.
 ''It's a case where nobody wins,'' Chang-Tai Hsieh, an associate professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, said of the current system. Mr. Hsieh, who has studied real estate commissions, said that they did not vary much from 6 percent and did not generally change in good times or bad. He said it was a form of price fixing, but an odd one. ''Consumers pay a lot of money, and even the people who do the price fixing don't win,'' he said. ''So it is a colossal waste.''
 Traditional agents spend very little time brokering a deal, Mr. Hsieh added. Most of their time is consumed looking for new clients, which is of no benefit to consumers. An agent working for a salary, he said, would be freed of the need to prospect and would thus be more inclined to focus on negotiating.
 Others agree. Steven D. Levitt, an economics professor at the University of Chicago, found that commissions did not align the interests of agents with those of their customers, a conclusion he recounted in his book ''Freakonomics.'' The agent has little incentive to get a few thousand dollars more for a homeowner, he wrote, because it will not much improve the commission. It is far more important for an agent working on commission to get the deal done and move on, he added. 
 A salaried agent is less likely to pressure a customer to make a deal, especially if the agent's bonus depends on customer satisfaction, as at Redfin. Agents at that company, like Allie Howard in Seattle, are quick to point this out. ''I don't have to sell anything to the client,'' she said. 
 Traditional agents portray their service as more personal and thus more valuable, but such agents, unlike Ms. Howard, are not paid unless a deal is completed.
 Redfin opened in 2004 as an online real estate listings site for Seattle, and now has 35 employees, including 12 agents in Washington State and California. Its first innovation was to layer maps with historical prices for each area as well as information on property taxes and which homes had a view, for example. 
 In February, it introduced a Web site that automates the bidding process -- and the commission rebates. The sale of a $500,000 house, for example, typically yields a 3 percent commission of $15,000 for the buyer's agent. A Redfin customer would get $10,000 back. 
 ''At that point we became a true pariah to the industry,'' said Rob McGarty, Redfin's director of West Coast operations. Buying a home online is not too different from ordering a book at Amazon.com or a computer at Dell.com. A prospective buyer finds a house on the Redfin site, which populates its maps with homes found on the local M.L.S. A request to see the house can be made with the click of a mouse. 
 Buyers also enter details of their offers -- the price they want to pay, the size of the deposit they are willing to put up and, for example, whether they will pay for the termite inspection. Then they click on ''Submit.'' A Redfin agent checks everything with the customer before passing along the offer to the seller.
 ''It took eight minutes,'' said Perry Webster of Des Moines, a suburb of Seattle, who bought a new four-bedroom house through Redfin. ''But it didn't really matter that it was online. We just liked the business model.'' He asked, ''Is it really worth $10,000 to ride in a real estate agent's Lexus?''
 Redfin can also work the seller's side of a real estate transaction. It uses a disruptive method there, too: it lists homes in the M.L.S. for a flat fee of $2,000. The customer is responsible for showing and advertising the home; Redfin handles paperwork and negotiations. But one part of the old system is steadfastly adhered to: buyer's agents are offered their full share of the usual commission.
 Like many Redfin customers who were interviewed, Mr. Webster and his wife, Robin Meyers, told of encountering hostile selling agents who said their offers would not be competitive if they used Redfin. But other agents' antagonism only seems to make Redfin customers more loyal. 
 Matt Bell, general manager of sales at RealNetworks in Seattle, said that ''when the listing agent wouldn't show me the house, that's when I knew Redfin was on to something.'' He added: ''If agents don't like it, then it must be better for consumers.''
 A dozen Redfin customers described similar experiences during the last few months. The selling agents, at least those who returned calls, denied that they had refused to work with Redfin. ''That's an absolute absurdity,'' said Leslie Hancock, an associate broker at Windermere Real Estate, the dominant agency in the Seattle region. ''I don't represent buyers on my own listings. I don't care if it's a Redfin agent or a Windermere agent. I'm not going to turn anyone away.''
 INITIALLY, many people used Redfin to submit lowball offers, so that the company was not taken seriously by other agents. But those ''goofy offers'' have disappeared, Mr. Kelman said. His agency, he said, has closed 89 transactions and returned $900,000 in customer rebates.
 Traditional agents have criticized Mr. Kelman for appearing, as did representatives of the Justice Department and the F.T.C., before a House subcommittee that was looking into real estate law. At the hearing, Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, wasn't buying his complaints that agents would not show homes to his clients, and seemed doubtful that it was a serious matter. ''You want us to stop people from bullying you?'' she asked. 
 Some agents say the biggest problem with Redfin is that it complains too much. ''Someone may be trying to manufacture controversy, even going so far as to bait other real estate practitioners, invite 'war stories' on their blog and whine to Congress and to newspaper reporters that they're being treated unfairly,'' said Marlow Harris, a Seattle agent with Coldwell Banker Bain Associates who also runs the real estate blog 360digest.com.
 Still, Redfin agents -- like their customers -- say they meet real resistance from traditional brokers. Ms. Howard, for example, said that in her first days at Redfin, several agents for sellers said they were too busy to show a house to her clients. ''That was my boot camp,'' she said.
 When that happens, Redfin agents contact the sellers and let them know that their agent will not show the house. When they cannot find a phone number, they send a registered letter. When sellers have moved, they track them down through the relocation service that moved them.
 That is hardball, but the online agents have learned to be tough. ''If we didn't do that, the word would get out that Redfin can be blocked,'' Ms. Howard said. When Redfin said it would try to make peace with rival agents by sending them gift cards for coffee, some of them told Redfin that such a move could violate a Department of Housing and Urban Development regulation having to do with transactions between agents. Redfin scuttled the plan.
 Mr. Fox, the chief executive of BuySide, a start-up that operates in five states, says his company is working harder to get along with existing agents. ''You have to play by their rules until the value to the customer drives the change,'' he said.
 Redfin's financial backers, who so far have invested $8 million in the company, say they see parallels in the past introductions of automatic teller machines, big-box stores and discount stock brokerage firms -- all innovations that faced industry resistance until consumers embraced them and forced change. 
 ''You can only move as fast as the consumer; you can't move faster,'' said Marc A. Singer, general partner at BEV Capital, a venture capital firm in Stamford, Conn., that specializes in consumer businesses and is a Redfin investor. Redfin, he said, is becoming smarter in each market it enters. ''You learn to cookie-cutter that fight,'' he said.
 AMID its battles, a funny thing happened to Redfin. It realized it was not primarily a tech company, but a real estate broker. It moved to stylish offices in Pioneer Square in Seattle because many customers wanted to meet agents the old-fashioned way: in person. Redfin posts pictures of agents on the Web so that customers realize, as Mr. Kelman says, ''they won't be talking to a person in Mumbai, India.''
 Redfin said it planned to use the power of the Internet to personalize listings -- if local M.L.S.'s allow it. Sellers, for example, could post online brochures that describe the history of their houses, any improvements made or what makes the homes special to them. Buyers, meanwhile, would automatically get help in searches through software that analyzes their past queries. 
 (Some local M.L.S.'s are particularly eager to fight one Redfin innovation: a display of how long homes have been listed on the market, a possible tip-off to buyers of an eager seller.)
 ''If you give people freedom, you can't take it away,'' Mr. Kelman said. ''A consumer force has been unleashed.''

HEADLINE: Aiming to Level a Global Playing Field

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KOTKIN

 BODY:
IF a prize in politics were awarded for self-righteousness, Joseph E. Stiglitz, despite stiff competition, might be near the top of the list. In 2001, he shared the Nobel in economic science for seminal work in the economics of uncertainty, particularly for what happens when parties to a transaction possess unequal information, as they invariably do. Economists measure impact by citations, but many of his papers are so fundamental that the results are no longer even cited. They're part of the ecosystem. From these brilliant heights, Dr. Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University, has been fulminating about other people's blind spots.
 During President Bill Clinton's first term, Dr. Stiglitz served as a member and then as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Then he became chief economist of the World Bank, and blasted the policies of its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund. He also emptied his hip holster at the next level up the chain of command, the Treasury Department. Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, helped to ease Dr. Stiglitz, after seven years in Washington, back into academia. 
Dr. Stiglitz's new book, ''Making Globalization Work'' (Norton, $26.95), is billed as a sequel to his ''Globalization and Its Discontents'' (2002). It reads like an unacknowledged reply to a searing review in The Economist of that previous best seller. Gone is the innuendo about colleagues in Washington doing the dirty work of Wall Street in their capacity as public servants charged with lifting up the poor. New are The Economist's requested chapters on trade and growth, market forces and the environment, the multinational monopoly -- in short, on globalization, the advertised subject.
 Two notions still animate the author. The first is that neoliberal economics -- derided as ''market fundamentalism'' or the ''Washington consensus'' -- vandalized the developing world. This supposed reign of neoliberal economic terror (privatization, open capital markets) has become a bogeyman of political liberalism (social justice, environmentalism), in whose ranks Dr. Stiglitz enjoys cult status globally. The second is that smart people in Washington and New York with the correct ideas can help set the world right. This supposition -- even when cast in terms of promoting democracy rather than proffering special expertise -- is an occupational hazard, and it enthralls many conservatives, too.
 Dr. Stiglitz's vision for more equitable globalization -- with caveats about the toughness of the task -- entails freer trade (no more loopholes for rich countries or corporate lobbies), curtailed intellectual property rights (''monopolies'') and green accounting (factoring resource depletion and ecological damage into G.D.P.). It also means more transparency in international finance (to curb corruption), debt forgiveness (foolhardy creditors must take responsibility, too) and democracy (less secretive procedures opened to nongovernmental organizations and others).
 ''It seemed terribly unfair,'' he writes, ''that in a world of richness and plenty, so many should live in such poverty.'' 
 Unfair it is.
 Designing a new global trade regime is a snap for Dr. Stiglitz. But how might it be put into place? He is dead right that the current configuration of globalization is political. But then, a different incarnation could be brought about and sustained only by politics -- and not periodic protest, however effective at times. Dr. Stiglitz identifies some ''special'' interests opposed to change, but he offers less sense of the powerful stakeholders who will level the field for all.
 Often, he exhorts. ''Rich countries,'' he writes, ''should simply open up their markets to poorer ones, without reciprocity.'' As for global enforcement of rules, ''what is needed is an international tribunal.'' Would its judges be appointed or elected? Would there be some disincentives, too, for global class-action suits? Details omitted.
 There is another catch. Developing countries, after getting their ''fair share,'' must ''use the money well,'' he writes. So they'll need nonkleptocratic governments, uncensored media, enforced property rights, the rule of law. How to acquire them? He wants ''developed country governments to provide role models,'' and to inhibit the collusion in malfeasance abroad.
 Intent on championing regulation over an ''unfettered'' market, he turns to postwar Japan and South Korea as examples of how governments can pilot an economic boom, though this view has been undermined on empirical grounds. He commends China for go-slow liberalization, without noting that the late-70's dismantling of peasant communes was a liberalizing big bang or that critics inside China today accuse the central government of abandoning economic liberalization, under the guise of gradualism, to gorge on the spoils of office. The rigor and nuance of his economics work are not as evident in his handling of recent world history.
 FAITHFUL to post-Soviet legend, Dr. Stiglitz conflates I.M.F. advice and Russian rhetoric about shock therapy with what actually took place in the 1990's. Some prices, but far from all, were instantaneously liberalized. Much property was privatized, though often by management theft before any government program; privatization of land had to wait more than a decade. Dr. Stiglitz spotlights Ukraine's 3,300 percent inflation, neglecting to add that Ukraine had even more fitful liberalization and limited privatization, just as he advocates. Arguing that liberalization is right, but that it must be done slowly, he fails to note that for most states, Russia and Ukraine included, rapid neoliberal reform is beyond their capacity. But never mind. The talking point that neoliberalism wrecked Russia is too valuable to yield to facts.
 Attacking the idea of free-for-all markets in a superfluous debate with conservative purists only overshadows Dr. Stiglitz's practical suggestions, like adding labor and environmental ministers to trade negotiations. Boasting that his many critics now see the light, thanks to him, is not a technique of persuasion. From a thinker of such stature, readers might appreciate more of the nimble acuity he displays in praising while devising flexible ways to supersede the Kyoto Protocol to win over the key polluter, America.
 In his most intriguing chapter, Dr. Stiglitz explains how the United States benefits from other countries holding vast quantities of dollars, while those countries incur substantial costs, from depressed growth to instability -- the very condition that such foreign reserves are meant to forestall. He observes that in Asia -- which drives globalization more than Washington does -- an alternative reserve system may be emerging. Dr. Stiglitz imparts his spin to this issuing of money substitutes, calling them ''global greenbacks,'' which could be used to finance global public goods like health vaccines. ''This single initiative,'' he suddenly concludes deep into the book, ''could do more to make globalization work than any other.'' 
 And instead of waiting for the United States to act in the interests of global humanity, he says, a coalition of Asian countries could move to this new reserve system even if America objected. Here is the new global economy already upon us.

HEADLINE: How to Become a World Citizen, Before Going to College 

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
FOUR jobs. Seventy hours a week. All summer. That has been Erin Sullivan's schedule since graduating from high school. (Dinner was often in her car, driving from lifeguarding to baby-sitting.)
 But it has been worth it, said Ms. Sullivan, 18, of Lawrenceville, N.J., who was to leave this weekend for Latin America on a mostly self-financed ''gap year'' of volunteering, home stays and Spanish lessons before attending college in fall 2007. ''I want a better idea what I'm going for before I go,'' said Ms. Sullivan, who is deferring admission to American University.
Many of this year's high school graduates are now settling into college dorms, but an increasing number of middle-class students, like Ms. Sullivan, are opting to take a gap year before or during college. Such a transition was once considered the province of the well heeled, but many students of various financial backgrounds now pay all or part of the cost. And as college costs soar, more families see the moves as good investments, because their children often return more focused. 
 As it is, many freshmen don't stay in college for long. ''About 30 percent of freshmen don't see sophomore year. It's like World War I trench warfare,'' said Brian R. Hopewell, a college consultant on Cape Cod. ''That's the dirty little secret many don't take into account.'' 
 Data from the National Center for Education Statistics indicates that only 35 percent of students graduate in four years. Many take as long as five or six. 
 ''Parents are thinking twice before writing hefty tuition checks,'' said Holly Bull, president of the Center for Interim Programs, in Princeton, N.J., which helps students plan gap years. Despite increased pressure to have their children attend good colleges, many boomer-generation parents seem more open to gap-year options than their predecessors were. 
 It makes economic sense for students to explore their interests before college, advocates of gap years say; freshmen who do so are less likely to party too much, fail courses or change majors repeatedly -- all of which can result in more time needed to graduate, and more expense.
 And gap years can help build resumes: students who are interested in medicine have more contact with patients volunteering in clinics in Costa Rica, for example, than they can in the United States, Ms. Bull said. And, on various foreign trips, they can attain a level of fluency in a new language. 
 Many students learn valuable life skills by earning and handling money during gap years, said Gail Reardon, founding director of Taking Off, a Boston consulting firm that also helps students plan gap years. 
 ''One mother said to me: 'I don't know what you did to her, but before she wouldn't use an A.T.M. Now she'll go anywhere, often taking the cheapest way to get place to place,' '' Ms. Reardon said. ''We spoon-feed our kids and they don't develop any sense that they can do things. And once they do it, it changes everything.'' 
 Many families do not view a gap year as an extravagance. 
 ''It was the best investment we could have made in her life,'' said Dale B. Krieger, a financial adviser, who estimated the cost for his daughter's year at $30,000 for a semester in India, a month in Italy and a semester in New York, taking art classes and serving as an intern at a museum. Mr. Krieger, citing her month living in one room with a Tibetan family in exile in India, said his daughter transformed from a ''limo liberal'' to a ''responsible worldly citizen.''
 ''That's definitely well put,'' said his daughter, Casey J. Krieger, 19. ''The experience was definitely an eye-opener, and fascinating. And it really changed my life.'' She is now a freshman at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. 
 Average costs for a gap year run about $10,000 to $12,000, which includes any consultants' fees you might pay. 
 Foreign trips, of course, can mean expenses beyond air fare, program fees and spending money. Among the possible extras are health and medical evacuation insurance (about $350), inoculations and other predeparture medical costs (about $150), and expenses for specialty gear and documents like passports and visas. 
 Students often combine a costly overseas group program in the fall with a cheaper one in the spring. Among the least expensive are service programs or internships.
 But some programs are free, except for travel expenses. A recent internship at a school for the deaf in Vermont offered room and board in exchange for work and the chance to learn American Sign Language. 
 Some students may initially have unrealistic expectations.
 ''Some guy told me a year in a tent in the wilderness would cost $1,000'' in New Zealand, said Sam Coggeshall, 20, of Princeton, about a New Zealander he had met. His parents knew better. ''He thought he'd get to the airport and ask somebody for a job or find work online,'' said Susan Henoch, his mother. ''I don't think so.'' They hired a consultant. 
 After graduating from high school in 2004, her son headed to New Zealand, where he spent the year tending sheep, working in conservation and ''wwoofing'' (as part of a program called Willing Workers on Organic Farms -- going from farm to farm to work for room and board). The year cost roughly $7,000, including air fare. But one year wasn't enough, said Mr. Coggeshall, who went back to New Zealand and spent his second year volunteering at an elementary school in Wellington and living in a rented apartment. The cost was about $5,000, including air fare. 
 Both years, he bought an international student identity card through STA Travel, which offers discounted air fares and flexible return policies. This month, he begins his freshman year at the University of Oregon in Eugene. 
 ''If you do your research, there are a wide variety of financial opportunities,'' said Rae Nelson, who with her husband, Karl Haigler, wrote ''The Gap-Year Advantage'' (St. Martin's Griffin, 2005). The book describes resources for low-cost programs, student discounts and other money-saving tips. 
 ''Financial obstacles remain the No. 1 barrier of at least 50 percent of students who apply,'' said John Eastman, executive director of Global Learning Across Borders, a nonprofit group based in New York that focuses on international programs. 
 The group recently started a pilot after-school program to reach out to low-income students, who have historically been underrepresented in study-abroad programs.
 ''It can't be viewed as a luxury,'' Mr. Eastman said, adding that overseas travel was important for helping young Americans become ''culturally competent and globally aware.'' Mr. Krieger became chairman of this organization after his daughter's positive overseas experience. 
 Caitlin Thurrell, 18, of Meredith, N.H., received a scholarship for half the $8,950 program fee for a semester in India, offered by Global Learning Across Borders, by agreeing to be a student ambassador when she returns, visiting schools to talk about her experiences. She also sought backing from local organizations, like the Rotary Club and the town newspaper, offering to serve as a foreign correspondent. 
 ''I've worked very hard, over 60 hours a week,'' said Ms. Thurrell, who will spend additional time in India with an uncle who lives there. She had two summer jobs -- including one making sandwiches and scooping ice cream in Center Harbor, N.H., by Lake Winnipesaukee. 
 She was concerned about the financial-aid implications of deferring admission to college. Shortly after Brown University granted her request to wait a year, she learned that she would have to reapply for aid. ''But they said I can definitely count on the same package I was offered this year,'' she said, ''provided there are no substantial changes in my family's financial situation.'' 
 Some people have reservations about even the lower-cost service programs.
 ''It's an important service, but the way it is set up, with some volunteer programs asking steep fees, it prevents the experience from being broadly accessible,'' said Abigail Falik, who worked in the global education field for 10 years and is now in an M.B.A. program at Harvard. 
 ONE morning last month, Dalit Gulak, 23, who grew up in Harpswell, Me., was on her way to Esteli, Nicaragua, with 400 pounds of donated medical equipment to apprentice with a midwife before attending Georgetown in January to work on a master's degree in women's health and nurse midwifery. 
 Ms. Gulak also completed a service-based gap year in Latin America four years ago. She agrees that volunteer fees should be less, but credits her experience in an oncology ward in Peru with prompting her interest in health care.
 ''It makes you grow up,'' she said. ''It makes you completely responsible, especially financially. It's life-changing. It makes you want college even more.''

HEADLINE: Why the Tide Hasn't Turned Toward Growth Stocks

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
GROWTH-STOCK investing has required the patience of Job during the last few years.
 Since the Internet bubble burst in March 2000, growth stocks -- the shares of companies whose earnings are expanding faster than average -- have fallen by around 7 percent, annualized, based on the Russell 1000 growth index. By comparison, the Russell 1000 index of so-called value stocks -- slower-growing companies whose shares are selling at discounts to the broad market -- has risen more than 8 percent a year, on average.
Is it time for a turnaround, for growth to overtake value? Perhaps soon, but not quite yet. While growth shares have been in a slump for more than six years, some investors say these stocks may need several more months to regain the lead.
 Growth stocks did show signs of life from April to December last year, only to lose ground against value stocks this year as investors lost their appetite for risk. 
 But the fact that growth stocks have trailed value stocks for so long -- through nearly an entire business cycle -- leads many investors to believe that growth is long overdue for a comeback: more professional money managers are bullish on large-cap growth stocks than on any other asset class, according to a recent survey by the Russell Investment Group.
 Before jumping into growth stocks, however, investors should consider where we are in the economic cycle, said Jason Hsu, director of research and investment management at Research Affiliates, an asset management firm based in Pasadena, Calif.
 Typically, growth stocks tend to outperform value in the early phases of economic expansions and bull markets, Mr. Hsu said. A recent study by Ned Davis Research showed that growth tends to perform best relative to value in the first third of a bull market.
 That's certainly not where we find ourselves today. An aging bull market is near the end of its fourth year. And according to a majority of money managers surveyed in August by Merrill Lynch, we are in the late stages of an economic cycle.
 In this environment, ''if you go out and buy really expensive companies, you're going to be fighting an uphill battle,'' said Dennis M. Bein, chief investment officer at Analytic Investors in Los Angeles.
 Moreover, a number of the market's largest growth stocks -- which were the darlings of the late 1990's -- have run into a host of difficulties maintaining their growth rates. ''There have been some very notable fundamental issues in some large-cap bellwether growth companies,'' said Larry J. Puglia, manager of the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth stock fund. ''Intel has had serious deterioration in its fundamentals, Dell has had serious deterioration, and Pfizer showed some pretty dramatic slowing of growth,'' he said.
 Mr. Puglia said he still expects growth stocks to recover soon. But the fact that so many of the biggest and most influential growth stocks are struggling will make it that much harder for the category to mount a serious comeback in the coming weeks.
 There's another factor: By most accounts, the economy is either in or near a so-called plateau: the time between the last in a series of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve to cool the economy and the first in a series of Fed rate cuts to jump-start a new expansion. Plateaus are important because they are often transitions between business cycles. 
 Historically during plateaus, ''traditional defensive sectors of the economy do the best,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's. These include utilities, consumer staples and health care, he said. 
 During plateaus since 1971, consumer utilities stocks have gained 6 percent, on average; consumer staples, 8 percent; and health care stocks, 10 percent, according to S.& P. The market as a whole gained just 3 percent, on average, during those periods. 
 If these same sectors are the leaders over the next several months, the market would seem to favor defensive-minded value investors (though the health care sector is generally divided between both growth and value stocks).
 In light of the slowing economy, ''our preference is in taking a defensive posture, and that puts us in the value camp,'' Mr. Hsu said.
 Some investors disagree. ''In a slowing economy, people tend to look for growth wherever they can find it -- and companies that can generate growth in difficult times will be rewarded,'' said Ernest M. Ankrim, chief investment strategist at the Russell Investment Group in Tacoma, Wash. 
 In effect, this boils down to a question of probabilities. ''Within the spectrum of growth stocks, you are going to see some companies that meet and exceed expectations, and they will be rewarded,'' Mr. Hsu said. ''But in a recessionary period, the odds for a lot of them doing that are going to be low.''
 The question for investors is this: How confident are you that you can find companies that will continue to increase profits in a slowdown -- or a recession? If you aren't so sure, you may do better by playing the averages, sticking with defensive-minded value stocks that pay higher dividends than growth stocks, Mr. Hsu said.
 At the very least, investors should stick to growth stocks that aren't so economically sensitive -- health care shares, for example -- while avoiding highly cyclical industries like technology, money managers said.
 Moreover, before betting on a big comeback for growth, investors may want to ''wait for some evidence that the Fed is not only done tightening rates, but that it's set to start easing rates,'' said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.
 THAT may be a smart idea. Historically, growth stocks have beaten value stocks shortly after the Fed starts trimming interest rates in its efforts to jump-start economic growth. Since 1974, growth stocks in the S.& P. 500 index have gained 11 percent, on average, in the six months after the first in a series of Fed rate cuts, according to an analysis by Mr. Stovall. By comparison, value stocks have gained just 7.9 percent.
 If growth stocks don't re-emerge as the market's leaders until the Fed starts trimming rates and a new economic expansion begins, it will mean that growth has underperformed value for an entire business cycle.
 But it may take an entire cycle to wash out the imbalances of the previous bull market, in which growth trounced value throughout the mid- to late 90's. ''I think after a full business cycle, we'll just get back to the point where things will start getting back to normal with growth and value,'' Mr. Hsu said.

HEADLINE: The World According To China

BYLINE: By James Traub. 
James Traub is a contributing writer. His book about the United Nations, ''The Best Intentions,'' will be published in November.

 BODY:
In Late July, as the United Nations Security Council argued long into the night over the wording of a so-called presidential statement castigating Israel for the bombing attack that killed four U.N. observers in southern Lebanon, Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador, blew his stack. This was almost unprecedented: Wang, a veteran diplomat, typically comports himself with unnerving calm. But one of the four fatalities had been Chinese, and Wang had grown increasingly frustrated with the refusal of the United States to condemn Israel outright for the bombing. Worse still, the United States was represented not by Ambassador John Bolton but by a junior diplomat, a breach of etiquette that Wang apparently took to be a calculated insult. 
Without naming any countries -- he lost his temper, not his grip -- Wang lashed out at ''a tyranny of the minority in the council'' and vowed that there would be ''implications for future discussions'' on other subjects. Once the meeting ended, Wang planted himself before the U.N. beat reporters and engaged in 10 minutes of robust public diplomacy, complaining that the presidential statement had been ''watered down,'' observing in several different formulations that ''we have to take into account the concerns of other countries'' and predicting that the ''frustration'' his country felt ''will affect working relations somewhat.''
 It was a delicately calibrated performance. In an earlier era, when the People's Republic of China tended to conduct diplomacy by tantrum, this might have been the signal for a real breach. But China cares too much about the international order for such revolutionary shenanigans.
 Actually, in an earlier era Chinese nationals would not have served in an observer mission in Lebanon, and the People's Republic would have taken a pass on the whole subject. But China now aspires to play an active role on the global stage, which is why it sends skilled diplomats like Wang Guangya to the U.N. That's the good news. The bad news is that China's view of ''the international order'' is very different from that of the United States, or of the West, and has led it to frustrate much of the agenda that makes the U.N. worth caring about. The People's Republic has used its position as a permanent, veto-bearing member of the Security Council to protect abusive regimes with which it is on friendly terms, including those of Sudan, Zimbabwe, Eritrea, Myanmar and North Korea. And in the showdown with Iran that is now consuming the Security Council, and indeed the West itself, China is prepared to play the role of spoiler, blocking attempts to levy sanctions against the intransigent regime in Tehran. 
 It's a truism that the Security Council can function only insofar as the United States lets it. The adage may soon be applied to China as well. 
 It was only in 1971 that the People's Republic of China supplanted Taiwan as the representative of China in the United Nations. During the remaining years of the cold war, the hermetic Communist regime was generally content to follow the lead of the Soviet Union. Little changed even after the fall of the Berlin Wall: China's permanent representative in the early 90's, Li Daoyu, was known around the U.N. as Ambassador Look Out the Window. The Chinese stirred to action only in order to block peacekeeping missions to countries that had been so foolish as to recognize Taiwan. 
 Beijing sleeps no longer. The astonishing growth of China's economy has made it a global force, and the accompanying need for resources has pushed it to forge new ties throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America. The old revolutionary ardor is gone, and China surveys the world with increasing pragmatism and confidence. China is now a status quo power -- ''an exporter of good will and consumer durables instead of revolution and weapons,'' as David Shambaugh, a China scholar at George Washington University, remarked in a recent essay. Unlike the United States and the West generally, China views the current global situation as fundamentally benign and malleable -- a setting conducive to diplomacy. 
 China has chosen to enmesh itself in global bodies like the World Trade Organization, regional groupings like the six-member, security-oriented Shanghai Cooperation Organization and a vast range of bilateral partnerships. China has begun routinely signing arms-control agreements and antiterrorism conventions. And it has begun playing a more active role at the U.N., contributing troops -- almost all of whom provide medical or engineering services rather than front-line patrolling -- as well as policemen to U.N. peacekeeping operations.
 Wang Guangya, at 56, is a senior member of a new generation of Chinese diplomats vastly more sophisticated and better educated than the party ideologues of old. His English is quite good, and he so relishes speaking to the U.N. press corps that he sometimes keeps answering questions even as he edges away from the pack while graciously thanking the reporters. Still, he doesn't often attend diplomatic functions, and the occasional dinner in his Trump Tower apartment is normally limited to Asian diplomats. Earlier this summer, I became the first Western reporter to whom he agreed to speak at length. 
 Wang greeted me in a cheerless reception room in the Chinese mission and invited me to sit parallel to him, as though we were a pair of notables at a reviewing stand. (I took a corner chair instead.) The embassy spokesman and a political counselor seated themselves at a respectful distance across the room. At first the ambassador dutifully recited China's history at the U.N. But once we got on subjects that exercised him, like Japan's bid for Security Council membership, he dispensed with the abstractions and assumed the forthright and confident manner that seems natural to him. Throughout our conversation, Wang chain-smoked Chinese cigarettes -- Zhonghuas -- a habit that had turned his teeth slightly brown.
 Wang is bespectacled and slight and has little of the artful smoothness of the more Westernized Asian diplomats. He grew up in Shanghai, the son of a worker, he says, with a low-level position in the Communist Party. Wang graduated from high school in the midst of the Cultural Revolution and along with tens of millions of other Chinese was sent out to the countryside for ''re-education.'' But after President Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972, the leadership recognized that it needed trained officials to exploit the new opening to the West. Wang passed a test that gained him entry to one of the country's 11 foreign-language schools. In 1974, he was selected as part of a group of 140 to go to England for further study, making him among the very first citizens of postrevolutionary China to receive a Western education. ''You think it's a good thing or a bad thing?'' Wang asked me, with a disarming grin.
 Apparently, it was a good thing. At the London School of Economics, Wang met Cong Jun, a student from the Beijing foreign-language school and the daughter of Chen Yi, one of Mao's great comrades. They married soon thereafter. (Cong Jun now works as a minister counselor in the mission and has served as co-president, with the wife of the British ambassador, Emyr Jones Parry, of a discussion group called the Women's International Forum.) In 1977 Wang was sent to New York as a junior diplomat and stayed for six years. He returned as a political counselor in 1988, remaining until 1992. He became director of international-organizations policy in the Foreign Ministry, ultimately rising to the position of vice foreign minister before returning to New York as ambassador in 2003. Wang is considered the favored candidate to replace China's foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, when he steps down a year from now. 
 Wang is one of the U.N.'s most adroit diplomats. Ambassador Jones Parry says that his Chinese colleague has a trick he's never seen anyone else perform: ''In the council, he speaks in Chinese, but at the same time he listens to the English translation. Sometimes he pauses, and then he'll switch into English to say something similar to the translation but nuanced from it.'' Wang operates by suggestion, by indirection -- often by silence. ''They play a very skillful game at the U.N.,'' says Vanu Gopala Menon, the Singaporean ambassador. ''They make their opinions felt without much talking. They never come in first and make a statement. They always listen first and then make a statement which captures the main thrust of what the developing world wants.''
 But the game the Chinese play virtually ensures the U.N.'s regular failure in the face of humanitarian crisis. Indeed, the combination of Wang's deft diplomacy and China's willingness to defend nations it does business with from allegations of even the grossest abuse has made a mockery of all the pious exclamations of ''never again'' that came in the wake of the Security Council's passive response to Rwanda's genocide in 1994. The most notorious example of China's new activism in this regard is Darfur. While none of the major powers, with the intermittent exception of the United States, have shown any appetite for robust action to protect the people of this Sudanese province from the atrocities visited upon them by the government and its proxy force, known as janjaweed, the Chinese, who buy much of the oil Sudan exports, have appointed themselves Khartoum's chief protector. 
 China first worked to keep the issue of Darfur off the council agenda when both Kofi Annan and Jan Egeland, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator, tried to mount a publicity campaign in early 2004. When this failed and Egeland publicly described the horrors there, Wang -- along with the ambassador of Pakistan, a regular ally -- diluted the ensuing press statement so that the council simply called on ''the parties concerned to fully cooperate in order to address the grave situation prevailing in the region.'' In the summer, after Congress had declared the ruthless assault on unarmed villagers ''genocide,'' China vowed to veto an American resolution threatening (not even imposing) sanctions against Khartoum. 
 And yet, according to Munir Akram, the ambassador of Pakistan: ''China was not nearly as active on Darfur as people think. The proposals came from us or from Algeria.'' The Islamic countries then serving on the council, as well as several African nations, considered any interference in Sudan's affairs a violation of its national sovereignty, even though the citizens being abused were Islamic and African. Wang was more circumspect. At moments of friction, according to a Western diplomat, he would quietly insist, ''You cannot alienate the Sudan government; without them, the U.N. mission will fail.'' Akram is the kind of bombastic figure who suits Chinese purposes to a tee. ''Their national style is different from the style of other people, including India and Pakistan,'' as Akram puts it. ''We are an oral people; the Chinese are not. They make their position clear, and they stand by it.'' 
 And then, when it no longer suits their purposes, they change their position. Several years ago, China joined India in principled repudiation of the chlorofluorocarbon reductions mandated by the Montreal Protocol. But when the international community offered to pay for the technology needed to reduce emissions, China decided that global regulation of pollution did not, in fact, constitute a violation of national sovereignty, leaving the Indians all alone in their principled opposition. On Darfur, as well, China has seen the virtue of bending before the wind, if ever so slightly. As the hopelessly overmatched troops of the African Union failed to stem atrocities throughout 2005, China (along with Russia) continued to block a resolution authorizing a U.N. peacekeeping force. Then this past May, the Sudanese regime and one of the rebel armies signed a cease-fire pact, increasing the pressure for U.N. intervention. China's position was looking increasingly untenable. And so Beijing agreed to withhold its veto from -- though not actually endorse -- a resolution authorizing a U.N. military-planning mission. 
 The great issue that divides the U.N. is no longer Communism versus capitalism, as it once was; it is sovereignty. Ever since the catastrophes of Bosnia and Rwanda, and increasingly in recent years, the Security Council has been asked to defend individuals against an abusive state. When critics in the West deride the U.N. as a failed institution, they almost always mean that the Security Council cannot find the will to do so, whether through intervention, sanctions or merely opprobrium. But this failing is a Western preoccupation: most developing nations, with their history of colonial rule and often their wish to abuse their own citizens without interference, object to all such inroads on sovereign rights. And in China, where memory of ''the century of humiliation'' at the hands of Western imperialists runs deep -- and where the state's right to abuse its own citizens is not to be questioned -- sovereignty has long been a fighting word. During the 90's, the Chinese abstained on, or publicly criticized, key resolutions authorizing the use of force to dislodge Saddam Hussein from Kuwait and establishing or fortifying peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Bosnia, Rwanda and Haiti. China is now more flexible in practice, but the doctrine of absolute sovereign rights remains central to its foreign policy.
 My conversations with Wang kept looping back to this fraught topic. ''Each country has to provide the well-being of their own people,'' Wang said to me. ''In some countries there is a problem, where the protection of their own people is'' -- here the diplomatic diplomat searched for the right word -- ''neglected. The U.N. can come in a quiet way, providing help, providing advice. But the role to play is not to impose it when the government is functioning. Of course there are cases where you can say that the country is a failed country. But wherever there is a government, I think the best way to do it is by giving good advice wherever you can, tough way or soft way, to let the government pick up its main responsibility.'' 
 China has, for example, engaged in some gentle prodding of Myanmar -- the former Burma -- whose authoritarian regime depends on Beijing for weapons and trade. But the generals who run the country have shown no signs of releasing their grip or of ending the house arrest of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Nevertheless, Wang says that he has ''firm'' instructions to block a U.S. resolution, now circulating in draft form, that would condemn the regime and threaten sanctions. China does not feel that this issue belongs in the Security Council. ''In our contact with the United States,'' he says, ''their argument is that of course they have the human rights problem, they have the problem of drugs, they have the problem of AIDS. And then may I ask: 'The U.S. doesn't have the problem of AIDS, doesn't have the problem of human rights, doesn't have the problem of drugs? Then you ask the Security Council to be involved?' I don't think that is the case.'' I said that I didn't think John Bolton would be much impressed by this claim of moral equivalency. Wang waved this away.
 In another conversation, held a week later in the U.N.'s Delegates Lounge, where Wang blithely violated the no-smoking rules, the ambassador insisted that the right to exercise sovereignty free from outside interference was enshrined in international law. But, I asked, when the world's heads of state, gathered at the U.N.'s 60th-anniversary summit last September, approved the principle of ''the responsibility to protect,'' didn't this, too, become a matter of international law?
 This was true, Wang conceded -- even though China has strong reservations about the doctrine -- ''but you have to decide how to apply this.'' And since this new obligation applied only to genocide or ''massive systematic violations of human rights,'' it had no bearing on Darfur. Wang had just returned from a Security Council visit to the region, where he had concluded that the situation was very complicated and that the government had been unfairly criticized. China still stood by Khartoum. After abstaining on the peacekeeping resolution, Wang had asked for the floor in order to reiterate China's position that U.N. peacekeepers could deploy only with the government's consent.
 Unfortunately, I observed, President Omar Hassan el-Bashir of Sudan had just flatly rejected the proposed peacekeeping force.
 The African Union ''is doing a good job on the ground,'' Wang insisted. ''The U.N. force would be a good way to help them, but if in their judgment the Sudan government thinks the A.U. forces are enough, that is their decision.'' And second, the Sudanese had agreed to disarm the janjaweed.
 ''And if they can't?''
 Wang ground a cigarette into his ashtray. ''If you are not sure that it will not be successful, then why impose a solution on them before you prove that they will not be able to do it?''
 China has become so influential a country, such an object of imitation, respect and fear, that you can no longer talk about an ''international community'' that does not include it. The West has a profound interest in China's development as a global power and its acceptance, however gradual and grudging, of the rules by which the West has defined global citizenship. As Mark Malloch Brown, the deputy secretary general of the U.N., puts it, ''How much less intractable so many issues would be if China was as fully engaged in the management and leadership of the United Nations as so many Western nations are.'' Malloch Brown takes the optimistic, or perhaps wishful, view that China will find itself inevitably adopting Western rules as it seeks to join the global club, arguing that ''as soon as you start grappling with global issues, you find that things like human rights and development and legitimate government are things you come to care about as vital to international stability.'' 
 You can see why a high-ranking U.N. official would wish for such a denouement. If, alternatively, China continues to insist that the Enlightenment principles enshrined in the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights are little more than a Western hobbyhorse, then the great issues will remain intractable, and they will be resolved elsewhere than the U.N. In recent years, both liberal interventionists and conservative unilateralists have begun to call for some new body, or new mechanism, that will not sit idly by during the next Darfur (or more problematically, the next Iraq). This new entity would not include obstructive nations like China and Russia. But excluding China from the world's foremost decision-making body could have very grave consequences, since it might well rekindle the Middle Kingdom's old sense of encirclement and exclusion. You'd have to save a great many lives to compensate for that kind of damage.
 China plainly wishes to join the international community on its own terms. The People's Republic is a singular entity, a world-class power almost wholly preoccupied with harnessing its internal energies and preventing domestic conflict. Unlike Russia, for example, China has little wish to use the power at its disposal, save to establish a harmonious environment for its ''peaceful rise.'' And in any case, China has progressed so rapidly from an insular and impoverished state to a confident and immensely influential one that it has not had time to figure out what to do with its power, or even fully to acknowledge it. China thus cares a very great deal about matters of little concern in the West -- ''territorial integrity,'' for example -- and very little about the burning issues in Washington, London and Paris. China has, for example, played almost no affirmative role in the reform debate that has exercised the U.N. over the last year. China is a member of the bloc of developing nations known as the Group of 77 -- the group's formal name is ''the G77 plus China,'' even though the 77 have grown to 131 -- and it shares the organization's view that the U.N. should pay more attention to economic and social issues and less to matters of peace and security. But even on these questions, according to Ambassador Menon of Singapore, ''They were basically just going with the tide.'' 
 Even with its negative agenda -- the reforms it wanted to prevent -- Ambassador Wang was happy to remain in the shadows. China had spent more than a decade fighting off resolutions introduced in the U.N.'s Human Rights Commission, and it implacably opposed Kofi Annan's proposal to replace the toothless commission with a much tougher body. But in the crucial final days last September, it was Munir Akram, not Wang, who produced a vague plan supposedly designed to break the deadlock. Western diplomats theorized that China allowed Pakistan to show good faith, intending all the while to block any substantive reforms. Akram, not surprisingly, denies this and says that he does not generally coordinate tactics with Wang. In the end, the General Assembly established a new Human Rights Council with membership standards sufficiently lax that Iran, Cuba, Russia and, of course, China were elected members. 
 The one issue that roused China to fury was Japan's bid for permanent membership on the Security Council. China's all-hands-on-deck mobilization was a reminder that propriety goes out the window on matters China deems to be of national interest, just as had been the case a decade earlier when it openly tried to kill peacekeeping missions in Guatemala, Haiti and Macedonia to punish those countries for their dealings with Taiwan. The merits were plainly not on China's side. No other country so self-evidently belongs on the council as Japan, which pays 19 percent of the U.N.'s budget, slightly below the U.S. assessment. (China pays 2 percent, and Russia 1 percent.) But Japan is China's chief competitor in Asia, as well as America's staunchest ally in the region. 
 Even more important, though, is China's deep sense of historical grievance over Japan's notorious invasion of Nanking in 1937 and its aggression in World War II. Wang explained to me that Japan's wealth and generosity could not erase this blot: ''The current five has been selected not because of their economic power but because of the role they played during the Second World War. China played an important role, and also we didn't occupy other people's territory'' -- unlike you-know-who. (It seemed too niggling to point out that the regime that had fought with the Allies now held sway in Taipei, not Beijing.) China's bitterness at Japan's alleged lack of repentance has only been sharpened by the annual visits of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to the Yasukuni shrine, popularly seen to be a symbol of militarism. ''For the last couple of years,'' as Wang expressed this in his oblique manner, ''the signal from Tokyo is not that positive.'' 
 In April 2005, soon after Japan, Germany, India and Brazil formalized their candidacy for an expanded Security Council, anti-Japanese demonstrations sprang up in China. Japanese missions and businesses were trashed. The Japanese were shocked both by the virulence of the demonstrations and by the obvious signs of high-level toleration, if not approval. Meanwhile, Wang and several of his lieutenants worked on the ambassadors of wavering countries. Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid al-Hussein, the permanent representative of Jordan, which was considering becoming a co-sponsor of the resolution expanding the council's permanent membership, says that he was called to a caucus room at the Security Council to meet with a Chinese diplomat. ''The guy was apoplectic,'' Prince Zeid recalls. ''He said, 'How can a great power refuse to accept essential, fundamental truths and yet take pride in the good works it does across the globe?' '' He later sent Prince Zeid a copy of a book titled ''The Rape of Nanking: An Undeniable History in Photographs.'' Jordan continued to support the resolution but declined to become a sponsor. 
 China failed to persuade African countries to reject Security Council expansion as such, yet it still delivered the coup de grace at a meeting of the African Union in Libya in early August, where heads of state met to choose two nations that would join the other four in seeking permanent membership. Several weeks earlier, China was the host of a lavish state visit for Robert Mugabe, the increasingly tyrannical and eccentric Zimbabwean strongman and a longtime Chinese client. Soon after returning, Mugabe declared that African countries must insist not only on permanent representation in the Security Council but also on the veto. This demand was obviously self-defeating, since neither China nor the four other permanent members would agree to dilute the value of their veto. Nevertheless, vast shoals of Chinese diplomats roamed the halls in Tripoli, appealing to African pride, to the imperative of global parity and so on. The demand for an African veto carried the day, and with that, Security Council expansion died. The corpse bore no sign of Chinese fingerprints. 
 Last month, the U.N. began the process of selecting a successor to Secretary General Kofi Annan. Asian countries feel that it is their ''turn'' for the job, and China has promised to deliver an Asian. Any potential successor must survive both American and Chinese scrutiny. The Americans will reject too open an advocate for the third world agenda; China will reject an aspirant from too close an ally of Washington. Other difficulties will arise. China may be happy to firm up its ties with India by backing Shashi Tharoor, a career U.N. official who is India's candidate, but Pakistan, a close ally, may object strenuously. China may, for once, have to disappoint or even anger some fraternal members of the G77 -- a situation it tries very hard to avoid.
 The Chinese are much too subtle to throw their support behind a single candidate, but it is widely assumed that they want a technocrat who will put aside Annan's (admittedly tarnished) mantle of moral authority. Wang, of course, disclaims any such ambition, but he does express the hope that Annan's successor ''might bring some perspective from Asia.'' By this, he explained, he meant ''patience over rush'' and an emphasis on collective rights -- those of the state -- rather than individual ones. If China succeeds in this regard, the U.S. might find the U.N. an even less hospitable place than it is now.
 China and the United States are the twin betes noires of the U.N.: the U.S. insists on enlisting the organization in its crusades, while China refuses to let any crusade get in the way of national interest. Washington is all blustering moralism; Beijing, all circumspect mercantilism. Both can afford to defy the consensus view. The emissaries of the two capitals are united by a wary mutual regard and understanding. Bolton and Wang met as midlevel diplomats in the early 90's and worked together on nonproliferation issues in 2001 and 2002. In their first meeting in this latter capacity, according to an American diplomat, who agreed to talk with me only if he remained unnamed, as he was not authorized to speak publicly, Bolton and Wang talked for four and a half hours without finding much common ground. As the discussion drew to a close, the time came for the inevitable speech on China's inalienable claims to Taiwan. Wang, who knew Bolton to be impervious to all such oratory, simply said, ''Taiwan.'' And Bolton nodded and said, ''And Taiwan.'' 
 Relations between the two are strictly professional. But Bolton, who declined to be interviewed for this article, is said to appreciate his counterpart's pragmatism and lack of polemics. China and Russia take the same view on issues involving sovereignty, but whereas Russia, with a home audience to play to, likes to snap Uncle Sam's suspenders, China, with no wish to harm its relations with Washington, looks for common ground. While Russia openly threatened to veto any resolution authorizing war in Iraq, for example, China stated its opposition as undemonstratively as possible. More recently, both Russia and China have resisted any Security Council condemnation of Iran's nuclear program, but China has proved far more accommodating of White House concerns. ''The Russians spent 45 minutes arguing over the meaning of consult,'' the American diplomat recalls. ''Wang finally said, 'Consult is fine.' '' Wang also earned points when he and the ''director'' of Taiwan's unofficial mission to the U.N. happened to arrive simultaneously at the Saudi mission to sign the condolence book after the death of King Fahd; Wang walked over and shook the hand of his diplomatic nemesis.
 Wang talked with me about Bolton, and about America diplomacy generally, with the faint irony and mellow wisdom of an antique culture. ''I can talk to many people,'' he said equably, ''those who wish to have nice discussion or those who wish to quarrel.'' Wang is, of course, a partisan of the nice discussion. ''I do not want to give advice to my good friend,'' he went on to say, delicately, ''but I believe that sometimes the way that you work, especially the way that your work is respected by others as showing due respect for others, is where common ground can be found.'' But what exactly does Wang mean by ''common ground''? The consensus that China has sought on Darfur looks like a formula for paralysis. And China's insistence on showing ''due respect'' for Iran seems designed less to persuade Tehran to end its nuclear program than to preclude any of the punitive actions currently being contemplated by the West.
 Wang told me he believed that blunderbuss diplomacy is the American way ''because America is a superpower, so America has a big say.'' China would appear to have a big say of its own, but that's not Wang's view. At the end of our second conversation, he returned to a favorite theme. ''The Americans have muscle and exercise this muscle,'' he said. ''China has no muscle and has no intention of exercising this muscle.'' 
 I said that, in fact, China had a great deal of muscle but punched below its weight. Wang smiled at the expression and said, ''It's not good?'' Well, I said, that depends. And then Wang said something quite startling: ''China always regards itself as a weak, small, less powerful country. My feeling is that for the next 30 years, China will remain like this. China likes to punch underweight, as you put it.''
 Why was that? Why did China want to punch underweight? Wang spoke of China's peaceful rise, of the need to reassure all who fear its growing clout. ''We don't,'' he said, ''want to make anyone feel uncomfortable.''

HEADLINE: A Landmark's Middle-Class Myth

BYLINE: By Samuel Zipp. 
Samuel Zipp is a visiting assistant professor of history at the University of California, Irvine. He is writing a book about the history of urban renewal in Manhattan.

DATELINE: Long Beach, Calif. 

 BODY:
THE announcement, last week, that Metropolitan Life intends to sell Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village to the highest bidder has given new life to the familiar worry that people of modest means can no longer afford to live in New York, particularly in Manhattan. The fear and fact of middle-class flight are age-old New York phenomena; indeed, it was a version of this anxiety that helped raise Stuyvesant Town in the first place. 
 The immediate post-World War II years were marked by a devastating housing shortage. Returning soldiers and families moving up from the tenements found few options they could either abide or afford. Met Life planned Stuyvesant Town to meet this need, envisioning the project as a ''suburb in the city,'' a place where middle-class families could enjoy the greenery, space and modern accommodations of the suburbs along with the convenience of urban living. 
It is hard now to recall the downright eventfulness of Stuyvesant Town's arrival on the Lower East Side. Today the project's austere brick towers tend to disappear in the skyline, but in the late 40's and early 50's Stuyvesant Town was a Manhattan landmark. Magazines and newspapers around the world tracked its progress from drawing board to construction to move-in. 
 Built with generous city and state subsidies, Met Life's project pioneered the practice of urban renewal, serving as the inspiration for similar slum clearance projects like Penn South, Lincoln Towers and Washington Square Village. And yet the familiar refrain should not disguise the fact that Stuyvesant Town has become, in many ways, a casualty of its own success.
 From the very beginning, Stuyvesant Town's benefits came with a number of conditions. Veterans were given preference and only two-parent families were eligible. Most important, though, Met Life planned to bulldoze an old Lower East Side neighborhood called the Gas House District and follow a strict whites-only policy in renting out apartments in the new development. 
 In 1943, when Stuyvesant Town was announced, the Gas House District -- named for the gas storage and distribution sites that dominated the northern edge of the neighborhood -- was little different from the area to its south that we today call the East Village. A polyglot collection of European immigrants and their children lived and worked in 18 blocks of tenements, storefronts and warehouses. Rents in the neighborhood were about half what Stuyvesant Town planned to charge: one study determined that no more than 3 percent of the 3,000 Gas House District families would be able to afford it. 
 Residents of the area rose to defend their homes, but their protests largely fell on deaf ears. The promise of Stuyvesant Town was just too alluring. The neighborhood had problems -- run-down and abandoned buildings, the stench and danger of the gas works -- but clearance also dispersed the relations of kinship, friendship and commerce that come to characterize a neighborhood. As the urban renewal projects inspired by Stuyvesant Town obliterated acre after acre of working-class, black and Puerto Rican neighborhoods, New Yorkers came to feel these losses more deeply. By the mid-1960's, few were willing to countenance the kind of destruction Stuyvesant Town had required. 
 Of all the controversies that attended the building of Stuyvesant Town, the campaign to desegregate the project attracted the most attention. Met Life, like most housing developers of the time, believed that renting to blacks would jeopardize its investment. As a private landlord, the insurance giant thought itself well within its rights to restrict residency. A broad coalition of black and white civil rights activists -- some of whom were project residents -- disagreed, claiming that Stuyvesant Town's public subsidy subjected it to the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. Their protests resulted in legislation prohibiting discrimination in all city housing, and in 1952 Met Life finally relented, bowing to public pressure and the letter of the new city law.
 But civil rights activists were more successful at pioneering legislation than in securing actual integration in the new spaces inspired by Stuyvesant Town. In fact, Stuyvesant Town itself didn't have a substantial black population until the 1970's. With a few exceptions, urban renewal projects served to reinforce already existing patterns of racial segregation. They reclaimed desirable real estate for white-collar institutions and provided bastions of middle-class urban living for primarily white populations.
 Meanwhile, public housing, often built on cheaper land within existing ghettos, became overwhelmingly black and Puerto Rican, in a pattern of segregation that continues to bedevil us half a century later. Of course, Stuyvesant Town should not shoulder the blame for this turn of events, but the racial divisions it predicted for the new cityscape of urban renewal remain its deepest and most discouraging legacy. 
 Stuyvesant Town has always been a pleasant refuge from the city. Many of its residents fought, over the years, to make it a more inclusive place. We are right to rue the loss of this city institution -- there's no doubt that we are all the poorer for it. But however congenial life in Stuyvesant Town has been for those lucky enough to live there, the project's less savory legacy should not be forgotten. 
 Having begun its life as the state-of-the-art method for supplanting working-class neighborhoods with middle-class apartment towers and white-collar institutions, Stuyvesant Town will end up as a victim of a newer, less abrupt and violent version of the very forces of urban change it helped unleash more than 50 years ago.

SECTION: Section 12; Column 1; Automobiles; BEHIND THE WHEEL/Volkswagen Rabbit; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1050 words

HEADLINE: Less of a Tortoise, More of a Hare

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
VOLKSWAGEN gives the impression it was a last-minute thing, something of an afterthought, to revive the Rabbit name -- almost as arbitrarily as the company killed its lovable bunny in 1984. 
 Actually, executives at Volkswagen of America were suggesting as far back as four years ago that they might make the rabbit reappear. At the introduction of the New Beetle convertible, the company's vice president at the time, Frank Maguire, was asked what the company's next retro revival might be.
 Reporters were angling for a commitment that VW would start producing the acclaimed Microbus design study; instead, Mr. Maguire gave an unexpected answer. ''Actually,'' he said, ''we've been giving some thought to the Rabbit.'' 
 At the time, the idea that VW would revive a popular model name that it had euthanized so suddenly, inexplicably and largely without justification nearly 20 years earlier seemed to make little sense. Yet, as the company's fortunes faded in recent years with disappointing sales, a dwindling lineup, spotty reliability and unfavorable euro-dollar exchange rates, the original Rabbit's 1975-84 heyday started looking better by comparison.
 The fifth-generation Golf went on sale in Europe in the winter of 2004, but VW is just now getting around to selling it in the United States. VW's American operation sorely needed a new angle for this somewhat dated car. Hence, the company pulled a rabbit, quite literally, out of its hat.
 Architecturally, the 2006 Rabbit is a Jetta with its trunk sheared off; the cars share underpinnings, drivetrains and major mechanical components. 
 As always, the Rabbit is a hatchback. The base two-door starts at $15,620; adding two more doors costs you $1,000 apiece. The workhorse engine is a 2.5-liter in-line 5-cylinder. For a mere $7,000 more, you can have the sporty GTI with a 2-liter turbo 4.
 After 2006, VW will no longer offer a turbodiesel in the United States.
 The original 1974 Rabbit was promoted as a performance machine, which makes sense only if you recall that the car replaced the legendary, and legendarily sluggish, Beetle. The first Rabbit's 71-horsepower 1.5-liter engine seems laughably underpowered these days, though they must have seemed quicker than they were.
 Today's base Rabbit comes with more than twice the horsepower -- 150, to be exact -- and a comparatively lavish 170 foot-pounds of torque. The 20-valve engine delivers its thrust in satisfying measures, while still conforming to California's stringent partial zero emissions vehicle regulations. Along with PZEV-rated cars from other companies, the Rabbit is one of the cleanest vehicles on the road.
 The engine seems particularly well-matched to the five-speed manual transmission in my four-door test car. While I did not drive a Rabbit with the optional six-speed automatic, that gearbox has been a smooth operator in other VW's. The floor-mounted shifter, which waved around like a broken butter churn in Rabbits from the disco era, feels particularly crisp and precise. It seemed to find gears intuitively, both up or down the shift pattern. The only sour note was the hair-trigger (hare trigger?) clutch. If you stall the car, you must turn off the ignition, which locks the steering wheel, before attempting a restart (your foot must also be on the brake). This is not a pleasant experience in the middle of a busy intersection.
 At a time like this, when a fast getaway is needed, the Rabbit will oblige with zero to 60 miles an hour in nearly 9 seconds flat with the manual and 9.4 for the automatic, according to Car and Driver magazine.
 This represents a significant gain in performance over the outgoing base engine, a 115-horsepower 4-cylinder tortoise, which will not be missed. But fuel economy takes a slight hit with the new in-line 5, which is rated at 22 miles per gallon in the city, 30 on the highway. 
 A more robust power plant was essential because, over the years, the cuddly Rabbit has become a little porky. The aforementioned 1974 model tipped the scale at less than 2,000 pounds; today's hare-ball spins that dial to 3,000. 
 Few will fault a more Rubenesque Rabbit; the car no longer feels as tinny as a soda can on wheels. Many pounds were devoted to safety features, structural upgrades, layers of sound damping and improved crash resistance. Other improvements include standard four-wheel antilock brakes, side-impact and side-curtain air bags, active head restraints and tire pressure monitors.
 A new independent rear suspension is a welcome upgrade. A new electromechanical steering system, not exactly a hit in the Jetta, feels more at home in the Rabbit.
 Traction control and a limited-slip front differential further tame the Rabbit's ramblings. Electronic stability control is a must-have, but VW has made it a $450 option.
 Exterior dimensions are nearly identical to those of the previous Golf, although the interior is slightly roomier. Would-be backseat drivers will enjoy the extra room for legs and heads, but they won't be able to see much because of the huge headrests in front of them. 
 The rear seatback, which is split in a 60-40 configuration, folds down for expanded cargo space. But the capacity is less than it would seem because of the intrusive, sharply angled seatbacks. Also, the back of the front passenger seat folds forward to make way for skis or surfboard. 
 Look out when loading: the hatch flips up so quickly you could get rabbit-punched. Over all, cargo capacity is probably too limited for you to cruise around, humming ''da da da'' and picking up discarded furniture. 
 Creature comforts include an auxiliary audio input and an optional iPod adapter, one-touch power windows, heated side mirrors, cruise control, a CD player and keyless locking. Heated seats and a sunroof are options.
 Simple lines and an uncluttered fascia give the car a suitably rakish look and an aerodynamic stance; if you dislike the overwrought grilles of most other VW's, you'll find the Rabbit easier to live with. 
 Somehow, the styling speaks directly to the youthful audience that VW is aiming to attract. Within five minutes of its arrival in our driveway, a gaggle of teenagers was swarming over it, bestowing a triple dose of the coveted rating of ''cool!''

INSIDE TRACK: That wascally wabbit is back.

HEADLINE: Westchester Economy Fails to Aid Poor

BYLINE: By DAVID SCHARFENBERG

 BODY:
Westchester's strong economy has done little, if anything, to improve the fortunes of the county's poorest residents, according to census data released last week.
 Almost one in 10 Westchester residents lived below the federal poverty level last year, the data shows. That figure has changed little since the 2000 census. 
Winston A. Ross, executive director of the Westchester Community Opportunity Program, a not-for-profit antipoverty agency based in Elmsford, said the stubborn poverty rates were troubling.
 ''We're in what's supposed to be good economic times here in this area, and yet, many people are being left behind,'' he said.
 The county must invest more in job training if it hopes to lift residents out of poverty, Mr. Ross said. Westchester municipalities also need to build more low-income housing so that the poor are not priced out of the county, he said.
 Susan Tolchin, chief adviser to Andrew J. Spano, the county executive, defended the county's job training efforts. She noted, for instance, that the One Stop Employment Center jointly run by Westchester and Putnam Counties had trained 1,000 people since 2002. Ms. Tolchin added that Mr. Spano was working with the county's 43 municipalities to build more low-income housing.
 In the 1990's, Westchester's cities, towns and villages oversaw construction of just 2,300 of the 5,000 low-income housing units the county Board of Legislators set as a goal for the decade, according to a report issued last fall by the Westchester County Housing Opportunity Commission, a panel that advises the county government on housing issues. The report also showed that progress on the roughly 10,700 new units that the county had determined it needs by 2015 was slow. 
 The census data, collected as part of the American Community Survey, also show a significant racial gap in poverty in the county. While 13 percent of blacks and 16 percent of Hispanics in Westchester lived below the federal poverty level last year, 5 percent of whites were in that category.
 The census data also showed that the New York metropolitan region claimed some of the highest median household incomes in the country. Nassau, Rockland and Suffolk counties ranked 8th, 9th and 10th among the nation's large counties. Putnam County, with a median household income of $81,076, ranked fifth nationwide among counties with less than 250,000 people.
 Westchester's median household income was $71,800 last year, ranking fifth statewide. The figure put the county on par with Fairfield County, Conn., at $71,633, and Bergen County, N.J., at $71,394. DAVID SCHARFENBERG

HEADLINE: Who Is Killing Long Island Sound?

BYLINE: By Tom Andersen. 
Tom Andersen is the author of ''This Fine Piece of Water: An Environmental History of Long Island Sound.''

DATELINE: Pound Ridge 

 BODY:
EIGHT years ago, Connecticut, New York and federal officials vowed to work together to prevent Long Island Sound from turning into a vast dead zone incapable of supporting striped bass, flounder, porgies, scup and other fish. 
 They agreed that they would reduce the pollutants -- particularly nitrogen in treated sewage -- that cause oxygen levels to plummet in the western half of the Sound. (Healthy concentrations of oxygen are essential to a marine ecosystem and the creatures that live in it.) The goal was a 58.5 percent reduction, and Connecticut moved so aggressively on a well-financed plan to improve sewage plants that within a few years it was almost halfway toward its goal.
The result was that the Sound enjoyed a period of small but measurable water quality improvements. 
 In each of the last five summers, however, water quality in the Sound has been about as bad as it's ever been. Oxygen levels have fallen close to zero in more than 300 square miles, from roughly Bridgeport, Conn., and Long Island's Huntington Bay to City Island in the Bronx.
 Yet just when efforts to save the Sound should be increasing, the Connecticut Legislature is doing the opposite. It is backing off its clean-up commitment by slashing money for sewage plant improvements. This is particularly distressing not just because of the ecological implications but because Connecticut had been the leader in the cleanup, surpassing both New York State and New York City.
 After the 1998 cleanup agreement (and for several years before in anticipation of it), the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection worked with local communities, which own sewage plants in Connecticut that empty into the Sound, to plan for nitrogen reduction, and then helped to finance the sewage plant improvements. Connecticut's mechanism was the Clean Water Fund, through which it provided grants for up to 30 percent of the nitrogen removal costs and 2 percent loans to cover the rest. 
 From 1987 through 2002, Connecticut put an average of $47.9 million a year into the Clean Water Fund. But that changed starting in 2003, when the Connecticut Legislature began taking money out of the fund, including $18 million in 2003 and $60 million in 2004, and using it for other projects, like road building and transportation initiatives. The Department of Environmental Protection had little choice but to scale back its nitrogen reduction program drastically.
 By how much? In 2005, Connecticut treatment plants discharged 4,947 tons of nitrogen. For 2006, the Connecticut D.E.P. had planned to require a further 17 percent reduction, to 4,110 tons, thereby getting that much closer to the 58.5 percent goal. 
 Instead, the Connecticut D.E.P. cut back on grants and loans -- and on the size of the nitrogen reduction it will require. Rather than 17 percent, or 750 tons, it settled on a reduction of 1.1 percent, or just 55 tons for 2006.
 New York, on the other hand, has become the tortoise that might reach the nitrogen reduction goal of 58.5 percent first. Taken together, the treatment plants in New York that discharge into New York's part of the Sound have achieved a 19 percent cut in nitrogen discharges. And New York City, which has four big treatment plants that empty into the western end of the Sound, agreed earlier this year to follow a nitrogen reduction schedule mandated by state officials. In return, the city will get an extra three years, until 2017, to reach its 58.5 percent goal. 
 But with Connecticut's share of the Sound cleanup stalled, far too much nitrogen will continue to enter the water, where it will encourage the growth of the algae that make up most of the Sound's plankton. The algae will then die and decompose, consuming oxygen in the process. 
 It's worth recalling what low oxygen levels can mean. In 1987, virtually every harbor from New York City's Eastchester Bay in the west to Bridgeport, Conn., and Huntington farther east saw vast fish kills from late July through late August. Two years later there were fewer fish kills, but the near zero levels of oxygen had spread almost to New Haven.
 Those dire conditions led to the cleanup plan. And for a few years, oxygen levels improved. But in 2002, perhaps because of unusually warm and rainy weather, the area with the lowest oxygen levels began to grow, spreading across the waters of Westchester, Nassau and Fairfield Counties. And by last summer, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection found oxygen readings as low as 0.5 milligrams per liter off Greenwich, Conn. (In an estuary where 8 milligrams per liter is ideal, and 3.5 is the minimum for acceptable water quality, 0.5 signals an ecosystem in crisis.) But the conditions drew little attention -- so little, in fact, that the Connecticut General Assembly was able to continue ignoring the Clean Water Fund with impunity.
 Several environmental groups in Connecticut tried to persuade legislators to restore money for the program. But in the end they were rejected.
 This is a shame. Long Island Sound is both an irreplaceable ecological resource and an important economic resource. According to a study by a University of Connecticut economist, the Sound contributes $5.5 billion a year to New York's and Connecticut's economies. 
 For the ecological and economic values to be protected, Connecticut's sewage treatment plants need to be upgraded. And the only way to do that is for the Connecticut General Assembly to return to session and come to an agreement with the governor to restore the Clean Water Fund.

HEADLINE: State Shows Extremes in Median Income

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY

 BODY:
New Jersey's diversity is nowhere more apparent than in median household income, where Hunterdon County ranked first in the nation among small counties and Camden ranked last among small cities, according to census data released last week. New Jersey remained the wealthiest state over all, with a median household income of $61,672. 
 Hunterdon, a largely rural county of about 126,000 residents in central New Jersey's so-called Wealth Belt, topped the list of counties with populations of 65,000 to 249,999, at $93,342, according to estimates in the Census Bureau's 2005 American Community Survey, the first report to rank small and large areas separately. Douglas County, Colo., was second, at $87,670. The poorest small county was St. Landry Parish, La., at $22,460.
 St. Landry was wealthy compared to the City of Camden, which had a lower median family income than any other small city or county in the country, at $18,007 a year. The wealthiest small city was Pleasanton, Calif., which at $101,022 was the nation's only six-figure locale. 
 Newark ranked seventh poorest among large cities, at $30,665.
 Among larger counties, perennially affluent Somerset ranked fourth wealthiest in the country at $88,532, and Morris ranked fifth at $84,010. 
 News of Hunterdon's income primacy may not be welcome to everyone. Paul Gorski, president of the Hunterdon Central Education Association, the teachers' union for a regional high school, said the union's members, like police officers and firefighters, are having a tough time keeping up with real estate prices, which tend to rise with incomes.
 ''Quite a few of our teachers and staff members live in Pennsylvania,'' Mr. Gorski said. ''People of all working class backgrounds -- not just in Hunterdon County, but in all of New Jersey's affluent counties -- are having a really tough time.''

HEADLINE: Some Things Old, but a Whole Lot of Premieres

BYLINE: By CARLA BARANAUCKAS

 BODY:
FOR New Jersey audiences, the 2006-7 theater season may seem a little like the New Play of the Month Club.
 With a number of world and New Jersey premieres on the schedules of the state's professional theaters, there's no guarantee that ticket holders will like what they see. But it seems unlikely that they'll leave a performance feeling ''been there, done that.''
Among the more heralded plays are ''The Things You Least Expect'' by Joan Vail Thorne, which begins a four-week run on Oct. 3 at the George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick, and Anne Stockton's one-woman play ''The Speed Queen,'' being presented for three weeks beginning Oct. 26 at the New Jersey Repertory Company in Long Branch. 
 ''The Things You Least Expect,'' having its world premiere, is the story of a widow in a romance with a man half her age and the consequences she faces. The play, by the writer of ''The Exact Center of the Universe,'' had a staged reading as part of the George Street's Next Stage program last spring. Mary Beth Peil, best known to television viewers as Evelyn Ryan on ''Dawson's Creek,'' takes the lead under the direction of David Saint, the theater's artistic director.
 ''The Speed Queen,'' directed in its New Jersey premiere by Austin Pendleton, stars Ms. Stockton as a woman on death row who reviews the events that landed her there and tries to set the record straight. Mr. Pendleton, who is also an actor and a playwright, was nominated for a Tony Award in 1981 for his direction of ''The Little Foxes'' on Broadway.
 Also on the schedule at New Jersey Rep, whose mission is to focus on new plays, are four world premieres: ''The Best Man,'' a comedy by Robert King, Sept. 14 to Oct. 15; ''October 1962,'' a drama by D. W. Gregory, Jan. 4 to 28; ''tempOdyssey,'' a dark comedy by Dan Dietz, Feb. 22 to March 18; and ''Love and Murder,'' a seriocomic murder mystery by Arthur Giron, April 12 to May 6.
 Another leader in play development, Playwrights Theater in Madison, has three new works scheduled for its main stage. ''The Good German'' by David Wiltse, about a professor in Nazi Germany who is asked to help hide a Jewish man, runs Oct. 5 to 22 in its New Jersey premiere. ''Where the Sun Never Sets'' by Robert Clyman, a comedy that brings together shopping malls, trickle-down economics and three Irish cops, is set for its world premiere run from Feb. 1 to 18. ''When Something Wonderful Ends'' by Sherry Kramer, billed as a ''one-woman Barbie play,'' has its New Jersey premiere run from April 19 to May 6.
 Passage Theater Company in Trenton offers two world premieres. ''Second Line'' by Seret Scott, playing Oct. 5 to 29, follows two African-American college students who fall in love in the civil rights era of the 1960's. ''The Deacons'' by Yusef Komunyakaa, May 3 to 27, portrays the reunion of two men 35 years after they served in an underground civil rights militia.
 The 12 Miles West Theater Company in Bloomfield offers the world premiere of ''Tales of an Urban Burb,'' a comedy by Rose Caruso of Glen Ridge, who died in 1999. The play, to run April 26 to May 20, looks at the friendships of city dwellers and suburbanites. Also on the 12 Miles schedule are two New Jersey premieres: ''Fat Pig'' by Neil LaBute, Sept. 21 to Oct. 15, and a musical, ''Island,'' about a Manhattan couple who go to Jamaica seeking solutions to their problems, Nov. 24 to Dec. 17. 
 The Women's Theater Company at the Parsippany Arts Center includes in its three-play schedule ''My Sister Underground,'' by Jewel Seehaus-Fisher of Highland Park. The play, which runs March 2 to 18, tells the story of a radical activist wanted by the F.B.I. who tries to visit her family on Sept. 11, 2001. 
 Even the Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey in Madison is bringing a new play to the stage. Bonnie J. Monte, the theater's artistic director, has written an adaptation of Jane Austen's ''Pride and Prejudice.'' Ms. Monte is also directing the production, which runs from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19.
 And for those who like their plays as fresh as possible, the Two River Theater Company in Red Bank promises a new play to run March 7 to 25. The play, as yet untitled, will be developed this season in a collaboration with New Dramatists. Also worth looking for are ''The Shape of Things,'' by Neil LaBute, Sept. 7 to 17 at Premiere Stages at Kean University, and ''Expecting Isabel,'' by Lisa Loomer, Oct. 27 to Nov. 12 at Dreamcatcher Repertory Theater in South Orange; both are comedies making their New Jersey premieres. ''Little Beasts'' at Luna Stage in Montclair, April 25 through May 20, is the world premiere of a drama by the company's resident playwright, Jeanne Marshall. 
 Theatergoers seeking the tried and true will also have plenty to choose from.
 The schedule for the McCarter Theater in Princeton includes ''The Birthday Party'' by Harold Pinter, Sept. 8 to Oct. 15; ''Translations'' by Brian Friel, Oct. 8 to 29; and ''Radio Golf'' by August Wilson, March 18 to April 8. 
 The six-play schedule of Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn features the musicals ''Godspell,'' Sept. 20 to Oct. 22, and ''Romance/Romance,'' Feb. 28 to April 1, along with Tennessee Williams's classic ''Summer and Smoke,'' Jan. 10 to Feb. 11.

(In an estuary where 8 milligrams per liter is ideal, and 3.5 is the minimum for acceptable water quality, 0.5 signals an ecosystem in crisis.) But the conditions drew little attention -- so little, in fact, that the Connecticut General Assembly was able to continue ignoring the Clean Water Fund with impunity.
 Several environmental groups in Connecticut tried to persuade legislators to restore money for the program. But in the end they were rejected.
 This is a shame. Long Island Sound is both an irreplaceable ecological resource and an important economic resource. According to a study by a University of Connecticut economist, the Sound contributes $5.5 billion a year to New York's and Connecticut's economies. 
 For the ecological and economic values to be protected, Connecticut's sewage treatment plants need to be upgraded. And the only way to do that is for the Connecticut General Assembly to return to session and come to an agreement with the governor to restore the Clean Water Fund.

HEADLINE: Pirates and Spinsters and Spies, Oh My

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
THE Arthur Miller drama ''The Archbishop's Ceiling'' is the best thing the Westport Country Playhouse has done this year. The five-member cast is sterling. (Even Heather Kenzie, whose job, it seems, is simply to sit around looking young and pointless.) The actors and their director turn this piece of late Miller (1986) -- set in an unidentified Eastern European capital during the Soviet era -- into both a satisfying thriller and a potent commentary on political invasions of privacy. 
 It could be seen as the end of Westport's summer lineup, but it feels more like the beginning of fall. Which makes it one of more than a dozen new and forthcoming Connecticut productions with particular promise.

Hartford Stage

SUMMER AND SMOKE (Through Oct. 1). Michael Wilson's Tennessee Williams marathon rolls on. (It began with ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' in the fall of 1998, shortly after Mr. Wilson became artistic director.) Amanda Plummer, who appeared in the company's production of Williams's ''8 by Tenn'' three years ago, is back. She plays Miss Alma Winemiller, the repressed-spinster heroine of this drama, best known from the 1961 movie version starring Geraldine Page and Laurence Harvey. Marc Kudisch plays the Mississippi doctor next door.

NO EXIT (Oct. 12-Nov. 12). The adage ''Hell is other people'' comes from this 1944 Jean-Paul Sartre classic, in which three recently deceased characters wait in a stark room and try to figure out where they are and in what new ways they can torture one another. To keep everyone off balance, literally, this production takes place on a see-saw floor. This is the American Repertory Theater production (with the same cast), of which The Boston Globe's critic Ed Siegel wrote, ''Who knew that French philosophical drama could be this much fun?''

A CHRISTMAS CAROL (Nov. 24-Dec. 30). Charles Dickens's holiday classic has been an audience favorite here since 1998. As always, Ebenezer Scrooge, the crabby Victorian miser, will be transformed into a caring human being by Christmas Eve visits from three spirits. In this production, children sing and ghosts fly.

Goodspeed

THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE (Oct. 6-Dec. 10). Described as '' 'Pirates of the Caribbean' meets Gilbert and Sullivan,'' this new adaptation of the 1879 comic opera has a lot to offer beyond ''I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major General.'' It also has numbers like ''Pour, O Pour the Pirate Sherry'' and ''O, Dry the Glistening Tear.'' The director is Gordon Greenberg, who also directed this year's New York revival of ''Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris.''

Theaterworks

TAKE ME OUT (Oct. 12-Dec. 3). The original Broadway production of Richard Greenberg's 2003 tale of sexual politics --about a godlike baseball star who announces that he is gay -- won three Tony Awards, including best play. At least one crucial aspect of the play will not change in Hartford. As Elisa Hale, the company manager, told one recent audience, referring to the actors, ''Many of them will be naked and wet.''

Long Wharf

DURANGO (Sept. 13-Oct. 15). Julia Cho is back. Ms. Cho's ''BFE,'' a study of isolation and superficiality, was one of the company's spring 2005 offerings and then went on to Playwrights Horizons in New York. Ms. Cho continues her examination of Asian-American identity and alienation in the story of an unemployed man who takes his two sons on a road trip to Colorado. The cast includes James Yaegashi, making his Long Wharf debut, and James Saito, who played the central character's lonely uncle in ''BFE.'' Chay Yew will direct. ''Durango'' is scheduled to move to the Public Theater in New York later this season.

ROCKET TO THE MOON (Oct. 25-Nov. 19). Clifford Odets's romantic triangle is one of his less political works. It involves Dr. Ben Stark (David Chandler), a Depression-era dentist; his wife, Belle (Christina Kirk); and his secretary (Louise Krause), with whom he is having an affair.

SANTALAND DIARIES (Nov. 29-Dec. 31). Let others present heartwarming holiday classics. Long Wharf has decided to go irreverent this year with the work that made David Sedaris famous. This is the very funny story of Mr. Sedaris's real-life experiences playing Crumpet the Elf at Macy's.

Yale Repertory

EURYDICE (Sept. 22-Oct. 14). In myth, Eurydice was the wife of Orpheus. She died. Orpheus talked Hades and Persephone into letting her return to the world of the living. Then he didn't follow instructions and ruined everything. Sarah Ruhl's version (she wrote ''The Clean House,'' produced here in 2004) is told from Eurydice's point of view. Plot twists and splashy visual effects are promised. Maria Dizzia plays the title role. Les Waters directs.

THE MISTAKES MADELINE MADE (Oct. 27-Nov. 18). Mark Rucker directs Elizabeth Meriwether's comedy about a woman whose boss drives her insane and whose brother lives in her bathtub. Also, her love life isn't great.

BLACK SNOW (Dec. 1-23). Think Stanislavsky and the Method. This Keith Reddin play is an adaptation of Mikhail Bulgakov's comic novel about an author whose failed work is being turned into a play by the most prestigious theater company in Stalinist Russia. They change it a bit. Mr. Reddin's play was first produced at the Goodman Theater in Chicago in 1993. This production is directed by Evan Yionoulis, who did ''The People Next Door'' here last winter.

Westport Country Playhouse

THE ARCHBISHOP'S CEILING (Through Sept. 10). Gregory Mosher directs this polished and powerful production of Arthur Miller's 1980's drama about power, electronic eavesdropping and the responsibility of genius. The late-night encounter in an ornate European apartment brings to mind the Bush administration's current telephone-surveillance policies.

OLD WICKED SONGS (Oct. 19-Nov. 5). Vienna, 1986: The young American piano prodigy has musician's block. The aging European professor will try to help. The glitch is that the prodigy is Jewish and the professor is an anti-Semite. Jon Marans's two-character drama, accented by Robert Schumann's music, opened at the Jewish Repertory Theater in 1995 and went on to the Promenade Theater the next year. It was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. Loy Arcenas, the Broadway scenic designer, directs.

A CHRISTMAS CAROL (Nov. 29-Dec. 23). This is Westport's first production of Charles Dickens's classic (at least within recent memory), but it is not a new adaptation. Tazewell Thompson, the artistic director, did this version (his own) at the People's Light and Theater Company in Pennsylvania for three seasons. It includes two dozen or so carols from the Victorian period, like ''The Holly and the Ivy'' and ''O Tannenbaum.''

HEADLINE: Build First, Debate Later

 BODY:
A proposed new rail line between New Haven and Hartford is several years away, but the suggestion that the state would heavily subsidize the ticket prices is drawing objections from a few Fairfield County lawmakers. 
 Legislators protested after a state official said that the price of train tickets would, for a limited period, get a state subsidy of as much as 90 percent to coax drivers out of their cars and motivate them to travel by train. Commuters on the Metro-North Railroad, in contrast, get much less help from the state. Connecticut's Metro-North ticket prices pay about 70 percent of the cost of riding the rails.
There is plenty of time to examine the issue of subsidies, and the rail line to Hartford is still mostly on the drawing board. But it is easy for people who regularly ride Metro-North to forget that most of Connecticut does not have a regular system of mass transit at any price. The lack of public transportation has contributed to gridlock on the highways and a stagnant economy. 
 And while some officials argue about the cost of tickets for an in-state rail line that does not yet exist, Massachusetts is planning to extend its public rail line all the way to Westerly, R.I., to offer out-of-state commuters a fast, inexpensive way to get to Boston. That kind of bold planning has been lacking in Connecticut for many years.
 The important thing is to build the rail line. Debate the ticket prices later.

HEADLINE: Want to Be in Show Business? Here's a Start

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
CHARLES MOSES, a 24-year-old Brooklyn resident, says he has always been interested in a career in the entertainment industry. Until this spring, his only work in the business was as a teenage extra in an episode of ''Law & Order.'' ''I was just passing by, an angry person in a mob,'' he says of the role.
 Since May, however, he has had more frequent work in the industry. His on-screen time in this work has been even shorter than in his very brief ''Law & Order'' appearance -- in fact, it has been nil -- but his labors have been more rewarding, he said. They have also been more gratifying than his more substantial past jobs, which have included working as a clerical assistant in a library, a cashier at a Dunkin' Donuts and a cargo worker at an airport, he added. 
Mr. Moses is a production assistant in the filming of television programs and movies, an entry-level, nonunion job of miscellaneous chores that offers the possibility of moving into more skilled, better-paying and usually unionized production jobs, including camera operator, electrical or sound technician, scenic artist and wardrobe specialist. 
 He got his start as a production assistant by completing a training course for New York City residents that the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting began in January. Mr. Moses is one of 32 people who have successfully completed the free four-week course, which has been given three times so far. 
 A major goal of the course, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said, is to ''introduce greater diversity'' among the workers in the city's film and television production industry, which some critics say has too few women and members of minority groups, especially in the higher-paying jobs. The administration is also establishing a panel to recommend other steps for increasing local job and training opportunities.
 The production assistant program includes instruction on the job's numerous tasks, which include running errands, reminding actors of their appointments with the wardrobe and makeup units, and soothing residents who resent having their streets closed during filming.
 The course's full-day activities include classes taught by production professionals, visits to a studio or filming location and on-the-job training at Channel 25, the city-owned television station.
 Training for work on film production crews is also offered as part of college curriculums, as at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn; at technical and trade schools; and by nonprofit groups like the Brooklyn Young Filmmakers Center, whose classes in October and November will cover script writing and production assistant work. Information about these classes is available at (718) 935-0490. 
 All 32 people who have successfully completed the city's program have been placed by it in at least one job, and most have worked regularly as production assistants since graduating, said Katherine Oliver, commissioner of the film and theater office. 
 ''They are expected, trained and supported to find their own jobs as well,'' she said. Production assistant pay varies widely, up to $250 a day, she said, though most jobs last only from one day to several months. Intervals between jobs are not unusual. 
 Since May, Mr. Moses said, he has worked for two days on the filming of a commercial, earning about $200 a day; for three weekends on the filming of a short independent film, earning $100 a day; and for the last six weeks on the filming of a planned NBC television series, ''The Black Donnellys,'' earning $750 a week, and more when there is overtime. He expects this job to last until December.
 More than 450 people applied for the three cycles that have been concluded in the city program, and 36 were accepted. (Information on applying for future cycles -- the next two begin Sept. 11 and in February -- is available through the city's 311 telephone line or the ''employment'' link at www.nyc.gov/film. 
 Of the 32 who successfully completed the course, about half are women and 31 are ''people of color,'' though there are no racial or ethnic enrollment criteria, Ms. Oliver said.
 Tracy Anderson, program director at Brooklyn Workforce Innovations, a nonprofit group that runs the program for the city, said, ''We do a lot of outreach and recruitment in low-income, predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods, and among people unemployed or working part time or making little money,'' many of them members of minority groups.

HEADLINE: Pockets Half Empty, or Half Full 

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
JUST in time for Labor Day, the Census Bureau seemed to indicate that labor itself was no longer such a good way to get ahead.
 Incomes rose last year, thanks largely to higher Social Security payments and investment returns, the bureau said last week. But median earnings failed to keep pace with inflation for a second straight year. Even as the economy has continued to grow recently, some workers have accepted outright pay cuts, men have dropped out of the labor force, and debt has kept rising relative to income.
Yet by any measure, this remains a fabulously prosperous country. Three and a half million foreigners have applied for residency, employment authorizations or other immigration benefits in the eight months ended in May, a fair indication of the economy's continuing dynamism. Medical advances have kept many elderly people healthy and, whether by choice or need, working. Women have made gains in income. By wide margins, people say they live better than their parents. 
 To give some clarity to the blur of economic numbers released each month, five New York Times reporters each set out to find one statistic, often overlooked, that said something important about the economic health of the American worker. The results are on Page 12.
 What seems clear from the recent data is that the United States has fallen into a new period of wage stagnation -- a sequel to another such period lasting from the mid-1970's until the mid-1990's -- that has begun to darken the public mood. In a New York Times/CBS News poll done last month, more than two-thirds of respondents said they thought that ''things have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track'' in this country. People's expectations for the economy over the coming year are as downbeat as they were in the pessimistic days of 1982 or 1992, according to the University of Michigan's consumer surveys. 
 This could all change fairly quickly if the economy begins delivering solid pay gains, much as optimism swelled in the mid-90's just when wages seemed as if they might trail inflation forever. A fall in energy prices could also produce the equivalent of a pay increase. But if this doesn't happen, it is unclear what will.
 There is little indication that policy makers of either political party are close to a solution to the pay slump -- or even an attempt at one. In Jackson Hole, Wyo., nine days ago, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, gave a speech arguing that freer trade and new technologies had greatly lifted living standards over the course of history. But further progress ''should not be taken for granted,'' he added, in large part because unequal gains were creating political opposition to the economic changes. 
 Yet strikingly, in an address that spanned Martin Luther, the telegraph and Malaysian microchip laboratories, Mr. Bernanke did not suggest a single possible solution. These are not simple problems. 
 For all their anxiety, many workers aren't sure what should be done, either. Douglas E. Schoen, a Democratic pollster, conducted a survey this summer in which he found deep concerns over a ''crisis of affordability'' that includes health care, retirement, education and gasoline. Yet Mr. Schoen said he found little appetite for policies that would redistribute income as his party has advocated over the years. 
 ''Even after six years of Republican rule,'' he wrote in his summary, ''there is no sense whatsoever that the country should in any way move to the left.'' Instead, he said, people were looking for pro-growth policies that were neither traditionally Democratic nor Republican.
 Mr. Schoen usually works with centrist Democrats, including the Clintons, and liberals would surely argue that economic populism, packaged right, could be a winning strategy. Republicans, meanwhile, have said that Democrats are exaggerating the public's unhappiness and that there is no pay problem. President Bush and his allies have frequently, and accurately, pointed out that average incomes are rising at a nice clip. 
 But averages can be affected by big changes among a small group of people, which is exactly what seems to be happening with incomes, according to an array of government data. The census report, for instance, showed strong income growth last year only at the 95th percentile of the distribution, which covers families making $166,000 a year. Even at the 90th percentile, as well as the 50th and further down, according to the Labor Department, pay increases have trailed inflation over the last three years. 
 It's possible that Americans will simply decide that their current living standards are good enough, that further progress is not essential. But that would be a first.

HEADLINE: Here, Take Back Some of My Pay, It's Too Much

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
A number is missing. No one knows how many American workers have agreed to accept, however reluctantly, a cut in their wages or benefits or both in recent years.
 The government tracks unemployment, job creation, layoffs, hours worked, average hourly pay and various other aspects of employment. But it doesn't add up the number of people who have forfeited big chunks of their pay and benefits, and neither do unions or academic researchers. 
 That was true of layoffs until the early 1980's, when the Rust Belt experience, and the devastating loss of blue-collar factory jobs, became a political issue. Congress, in response, asked the Bureau of Labor Statistics to count the layoffs in national surveys. The tally: at least 30 million full-time workers have been laid off over more than two decades. 
 Keeping a job, but losing 15 or 20 percent of a salary and most of a pension, is a painful experience -- and certainly not good for consumer spending. Still, there has not been enough political pressure for an accurate count of those affected. That is partly because many workers and unions have agreed to the concessions to preserve jobs. 
 Is there a ballpark number? Piecing together union data shows that it is probably above two million people in this decade alone. But no one knows. The concessions, for example, are particularly noticeable now among pilots and flight attendants at troubled airlines. Unions representing these workers, however, do not keep a running tally, and the same is true for workers at tire factories, supermarkets and auto parts plants, to name just three areas going through the experience.
 ''None of our earnings surveys show these concessions,'' said Thomas L. Nardone, an assistant commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ''We just don't track that number.'' LOUIS UCHITELLE

HEADLINE: For Those on the Outside, The Urge to Be Here Remains

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
TO many beyond its borders, America remains the land of opportunity.
 From October through May, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services received 3.5 million applications from foreigners for employment authorizations, green cards and other immigrant benefits relating to residency or citizenship. Though down 9 percent from the same period a year ago in a further decline from the levels in 2001, before immigration rules were tightened, that is one application for every 100 Americans. 
Whatever you may think about the state of the American labor market or the impact of immigrants on it, there is no denying that the right to work and live in the United States remains highly coveted.
 Of those seeking entry, two groups dominate the numbers: low-skilled workers from Mexico and other Latin American countries and highly skilled professionals from India and China, said Richard B. Freeman, an economics professor at Harvard.
 For the first group, the American labor market offers a higher standard of living and many more job opportunities. Life is certainly difficult for the first ones across the border, but their children have a far better shot at the American dream.
 The second group, most of whom have at least a college degree, have different reasons for coming. They could get jobs in fast-growing economies back home, but they earn far more here and get to live in a fully developed, modern society.
 ''We can complain about our labor market because we are born in the U.S.,'' said Mr. Freeman, who is also director of labor studies programs at the National Bureau of Economic Research. ''But if you come from India or Mexico, you have totally different initial expectations.
 ''I just can't imagine when we will not be attractive to immigrants,'' he continued. ''We would really have to screw our country up and they would have to run their countries very well.'' VIKAS BAJAJ

HEADLINE: Productivity and the Paycheck

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''The Falling Paycheck'' (editorial, Aug. 28) points out that ''American employees have not shared in the wealth they've helped to create.''
 This is true at a time when membership in labor unions has declined and the government in power is favorably disposed to advancing the interests of large corporations at the expense of workers.
During the post-World War II period, what we saw was a corporate attitude that made benefits like pensions, health care, educational opportunities and career longevity available to employees; stronger labor unions; and a government that instituted one of the most successful attempts by any society to provide those who served their country with mortgage loans and educational and small-business opportunities, the G.I. Bill of Rights. 
 Perhaps these contrasts between then and now help explain the optimism of the 50's as compared with the pessimism of today that permeates much of our society.

John A. Viteritti
Southold, N.Y., Aug. 29, 2006

To the Editor:
 In ''The Falling Paycheck,'' the doom-and-gloom characterization of today's economy continues.
 It is true, as the editorial notes, that wage growth has been slower than expected in the current expansion, but the editorial doesn't acknowledge that strong wage gains have been realized in 2006 and are expected to continue. 
 In fact, reports are that wage growth has been one of the factors that have caused the Federal Reserve to continue its rate increases this year until the recent pause earlier this month. 
 Moreover, virtually every other economic indicator continues to be remarkably strong: 36 consecutive months of job growth, roughly 5.7 million new jobs created, 4.7 percent unemployment, robust gross domestic product growth, near-record-high homeownership, low interest rates and strong consumer spending.
 By ignoring all of these positive factors associated with the continuing economic expansion, The Times presents a skewed view of today's strong economy.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Real Wages Fail to Match a Rise in Productivity'' (front page, Aug. 28):
 If productivity is high yet real wages are low, then at long last trickle down is proved to be trickle nowhere. The first President Bush was right at first; it is voodoo economics. Why would rational producers pay workers any more than they must, even if more capital is available?
 The only silver lining is that this wage report might help ordinary hard-working yet Republican-voting Americans see that the ''compassion'' and ''morality'' they hear about is little more than a cover for avarice.

To the Editor:
 So, corporate profits are at a historic high as a percentage of gross domestic product, and worker productivity is up, but wages are at a historic low by the same measure. 
 According to the Treasury secretary, it's ''neither fair nor useful'' to blame any particular party (his) for this.
 But the G.O.P. has shown the opposite of any inclination to mitigate this generational trend. Instead, we're into our third decade of its discredited ''trickle-down'' rehash. 
 So while 99 percent of Americans are working harder for less so 1 percent can do better than ever, Republicans continue to throw tax breaks at corporations and the rich and tell the rest of us our only other option is unemployment.

A. D. Johnston
New York, Aug. 28, 2006

To the Editor:
 The theme of the article ''Real Wages Fail to Match a Rise in Productivity'' is that corporate profits are rising while wages are not. But the accompanying graph shows overall compensation is at or close to a record high.
 Isn't the real story that benefits (mainly health insurance) are rising, so real compensation is rising? It appears the pie is growing rapidly, and the share that workers get is rising also. A cynic might suspect class warfare in an election year.

Jeff Yass
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., Aug. 28, 2006

To the Editor:
 With wages falling and corporate profits rising since George W. Bush took office, it is time for wage earners -- most Americans -- to install a Congress in November more sensitive to the needs of ordinary people, including the increasing numbers of the poor.

HEADLINE: Who Is Killing Long Island Sound?

BYLINE: By Tom Andersen. 
Tom Andersen is the author of ''This Fine Piece of Water: An Environmental History of Long Island Sound.''

DATELINE: Pound Ridge, N.Y. 

 BODY:
EIGHT years ago, Connecticut, New York and federal officials vowed to work together to prevent Long Island Sound from turning into a vast dead zone incapable of supporting striped bass, flounder, porgies, scup and other fish. 
 They agreed that they would reduce the pollutants -- particularly nitrogen in treated sewage -- that cause oxygen levels to plummet in the western half of the Sound. (Healthy concentrations of oxygen are essential to a marine ecosystem and the creatures that live in it.) The goal was a 58.5 percent reduction, and Connecticut moved so aggressively on a well-financed plan to improve sewage plants that within a few years it was almost halfway toward its goal.
The result was that the Sound enjoyed a period of small but measurable water quality improvements. 
 In each of the last five summers, however, water quality in the Sound has been about as bad as it's ever been. Oxygen levels have fallen close to zero in more than 300 square miles, from roughly Bridgeport, Conn., and Long Island's Huntington Bay to City Island in the Bronx.
 Yet just when efforts to save the Sound should be increasing, the Connecticut Legislature is doing the opposite. It is backing off its cleanup commitment by slashing money for sewage plant improvements. This is particularly distressing not just because of the ecological implications but because Connecticut had been the leader in the cleanup, surpassing both New York State and New York City.
 After the 1998 cleanup agreement (and for several years before in anticipation of it), the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection worked with local communities, which own sewage plants in Connecticut that empty into the Sound, to plan for nitrogen reduction, and then helped to finance the sewage plant improvements. Connecticut's mechanism was the Clean Water Fund, through which it provided grants for up to 30 percent of the nitrogen removal costs and 2 percent loans to cover the rest. 
 From 1987 through 2002, Connecticut put an average of $47.9 million a year into the Clean Water Fund. But that changed starting in 2003, when the Connecticut Legislature began taking money out of the fund, including $18 million in 2003 and $60 million in 2004, and using it for other projects, like road building and transportation initiatives. The Department of Environmental Protection had little choice but to scale back its nitrogen reduction program drastically.
 By how much? In 2005, Connecticut treatment plants discharged 4,947 tons of nitrogen. For 2006, the Connecticut D.E.P. had planned to require a further 17 percent reduction, to 4,110 tons, thereby getting that much closer to the 58.5 percent goal. 
 Instead, the Connecticut D.E.P. cut back on grants and loans -- and on the size of the nitrogen reduction it will require. Rather than 17 percent, or 750 tons, it settled on a reduction of 1.1 percent, or just 55 tons for 2006.
 New York, on the other hand, has become the tortoise that might reach the nitrogen reduction goal of 58.5 percent first. Taken together, the treatment plants in New York that discharge into New York's part of the Sound have achieved a 19 percent cut in nitrogen discharges. And New York City, which has four big treatment plants that empty into the western end of the Sound, agreed earlier this year to follow a nitrogen reduction schedule mandated by state officials. In return, the city will get an extra three years, until 2017, to reach its 58.5 percent goal. 
 But with Connecticut's share of the Sound cleanup stalled, far too much nitrogen will continue to enter the water, where it will encourage the growth of the algae that make up most of the Sound's plankton. The algae will then die and decompose, consuming oxygen in the process. 
 It's worth recalling what low oxygen levels can mean. In 1987, virtually every harbor from New York City's Eastchester Bay in the west to Bridgeport, Conn., and Huntington farther east saw vast fish kills from late July through late August. Two years later there were fewer fish kills, but the near zero levels of oxygen had spread almost to New Haven.
 Those dire conditions led to the cleanup plan. And for a few years, oxygen levels improved. But in 2002, perhaps because of unusually warm and rainy weather, the area with the lowest oxygen levels began to grow, spreading across the waters of Westchester, Nassau and Fairfield Counties. And by last summer, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection found oxygen readings as low as 0.5 milligrams per liter off Greenwich, Conn. (In an estuary where 8 milligrams per liter is ideal, and 3.5 is the minimum for acceptable water quality, 0.5 signals an ecosystem in crisis.) But the conditions drew little attention -- so little, in fact, that the Connecticut General Assembly was able to continue ignoring the Clean Water Fund with impunity.
 Several environmental groups in Connecticut tried to persuade legislators to restore money for the program. But in the end they were rejected.
 This is a shame. Long Island Sound is both an irreplaceable ecological resource and an important economic resource. According to a study by a University of Connecticut economist, the Sound contributes $5.5 billion a year to New York's and Connecticut's economies. 
 For the ecological and economic values to be protected, Connecticut's sewage treatment plants need to be upgraded. And the only way to do that is for the Connecticut General Assembly to return to session and come to an agreement with the governor to restore the Clean Water Fund.

HEADLINE: Borrowers We Be 

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
WITH their raises often lower than the inflation rate, millions of Americans have embraced the same strategy to maintain their living standards -- borrowing and then borrowing some more. 
 As a result, debt payments now consume 19.4 percent of the income of the average American family, and 23 percent of the families in the bottom two-fifths of families by income devote at least 40 percent of their income to debt payments. With debt burdens so high, some economists fear a new wave of foreclosure and personal bankruptcies now that interest rates have climbed.
''Real median incomes have gone nowhere, and for lower-income households real incomes have been falling,'' said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. ''If they want to maintain a certain level of spending, they have to take on more debt.''
 Household debt rose to 132 percent of disposable income last year, partly because many Americans have pushed their credit card debt to the max and because many, including many high-income Americans, have piled on the mortgage debt. Last year, for the first time since the Depression, the personal savings rate for the nation fell below zero, meaning that Americans are spending more than they are earning (and are saving no money on a net basis). 
 ''There are really two types of households out there,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''High-income households have balance sheets about as good as I've ever seen, while lower-income households have balance sheets about as bad as I've ever seen them -- complete tatters. These households are on the financial edge, and if there's any slight disruption, like a car breaking down, it can be a real disaster for them financially.'' STEVEN GREENHOUSE

HEADLINE: A Deadline That's Less Than It Seems 

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
On June 1, world powers made Iran an offer they said Tehran shouldn't refuse: suspend uranium enrichment in ''weeks, not months'' or face economic sanctions. 
 That was three months ago. Iran hasn't suspended anything, despite the passage of an Aug. 31 United Nations Security Council deadline. The six countries that made the offer -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China -- are still debating what to do. And last week, the day after the deadline, European Union foreign ministers meeting in Finland called for more dialogue with Iran before any talk of sanctions. ''For the E.U., diplomacy remains the No. 1 way forward,'' the Finnish Foreign Minister, Erkki Tuomioja, said.
All of this activity, or lack of it, raises the question: When is a deadline not a deadline? 
 1. When a deal needs support from a bunch of different countries. Because the United States already has placed heavy sanctions on Iran since the hostage crisis in 1979, it doesn't have the leverage left to inflict much more pain by itself. Washington needs the people who actually do business with Iran -- primarily Russia and China -- to get on board. And neither of those countries are in any hurry to do so.
 2. When everyone is afraid that sanctions will hurt them as much as they'll hurt Iran. World powers are also dragging their feet because they know Iran could retaliate by cutting oil production, which could drive up the price of oil worldwide. 
 3. When few people think the sanctions will work anyway. That's the crux of the problem -- the sanctions that the United States and its European allies are trying to get the Russians and Chinese to support are pretty low-pressure, limited to things like travel bans and restrictions against dual-use exports. If Iran's ruling mullahs really believe that a nuclear program is their inalienable right, will they be cowed by a travel ban? To really hurt Tehran, diplomats would have to hit investment in Iran's energy sector. But that could bring about retaliation, in the form of Tehran cutting oil production, which could lead to No. 2.
 So the deadlines keep sliding by. Right now, Bush administration officials say they hope they can get the Security Council to vote for a first phase of sanctions in the next few weeks. Maybe by mid-September, when the General Assembly meets in New York. Or by the end of the General Assembly meetings in late September. O.K., definitely by October. 
 Or else. HELENE COOPER

PERSON: Bernard Jay Wohl 

HEADLINE: Bernard Wohl, 76, Advocate For Poor and Homeless, Dies

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Bernard J. Wohl, a relentless advocate for the poor, the homeless and the forgotten elderly of New York and for 26 years the leader of Goddard Riverside Community Center on the Upper West Side, one of the city's largest private social service agencies, died on Thursday at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. He was 76. 
 The cause was complications of a blood infection, said his daughter, Carla Wohl. 
Mr. Wohl, who lived near the center's headquarters at Columbus Avenue and 88th Street, was executive director from 1972 until his retirement in 1998. During his tenure, Goddard Riverside grew from a modest agency with a $600,000 budget into a $12 million organization with 150 staff workers, hundreds of volunteers, 550 housing units and dozens of aid, recreation and education programs. 
 In a city of great riches and progressive traditions where, nevertheless, such basic needs as food, shelter and help with addictions and mental illnesses seem endlessly unmet, Mr. Wohl was the man in the middle: seeking aid from foundations and city agencies, creating housing with onsite social services, sending kids to camp, fighting not-in-my-backyard lawsuits, negotiating with neighborhood leaders, confronting drug dealers, holding book fairs, even carving the Thanksgiving turkey for the homeless.
 ''Bernie Wohl stood for a very strong belief in social justice and social action, not only services and helping people, but also getting to the root causes of why people are poor and why there are differences among people in our society,'' said Stephan Russo, Mr. Wohl's successor at Goddard Riverside. ''His legacy is a vibrant, dynamic community organization.'' 
 Trained as a social worker, Mr. Wohl began a series of innovative programs for young, elderly and homeless people that have had a lasting impact on the Upper West Side and in Harlem, and some of which have been replicated elsewhere. In 1979, responding to a homeless crisis in the city, he created Project Reachout, in which mobile vans roamed the streets with teams trained to encourage homeless mentally ill people to accept assistance. 
 He also led drives for Goddard Riverside, often in the face of community opposition, to transform single-room-occupancy hotels with transient populations into hundreds of units of permanent housing with 24-hour services for mentally ill homeless people on the Upper West Side, and dozens of studio apartments for emotionally fragile and elderly people in Harlem. Many residents were able to leave city shelters. 
 In the 1970's and 80's, as the Upper West Side underwent extensive changes in an urban renewal that recast the cityscape and displaced thousands of residents, Mr. Wohl fought for housing for low-income people and helped to keep many residents in the community, Mr. Russo said. He also testified at City Council and state legislative hearings, appealing for funds for social services.
 In 1983, on Mr. Wohl's watch, Goddard Riverside completed the construction of Phelps House, a 168-unit apartment building for the low-income elderly that also houses the agency's offices and spaces for counseling, recreation and community outreach programs.
 The project drew considerable fire from opponents of additional low-income units in the neighborhood. But Mr. Russo noted that Mr. Wohl ''didn't shy away from conflict,'' and the result from Goddard Riverside's perspective was gratifying. ''Many of those who opposed it became some of our biggest supporters,'' Mr. Russo said.
 Among Mr. Wohl's many fund-raising efforts were annual book fairs, with up to 25,000 books a year donated by publishing houses he approached, and dinners at private homes with authors whose attendance he arranged, including Robert Caro, E. L. Doctorow, Calvin Trillin and Elie Wiesel.
 While Goddard Riverside for many years owned and operated two summer camps for children in the Catskills, rising operating costs and declining government support forced their sale in the 1990's. ''It killed me to do it,'' Mr. Wohl said of the closings. 
 Bernard Jay Wohl was born in Manhattan on Jan. 4, 1930, and attended Stuyvesant High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in psychology at Syracuse University in 1951 and a master's in social work at the University of Buffalo in 1953.
 After two years in the Army as a psychiatric social worker, he was associate director of the United Community Centers in Brooklyn from 1955 to 1961. He taught social work at Ohio State University from 1965 to 1969, and was executive director of a settlement house in Columbus, Ohio, from 1961 to 1972, when he joined Goddard Riverside. 
 After his retirement, Mr. Wohl, the recipient of many awards for his work, taught at the Hunter College Graduate School of Social Work in 1999 and 2000. In recent years, he lectured and wrote extensively on social work, urban poverty and programs for troubled youths.
 In addition to his daughter, of Los Angeles, Mr. Wohl is survived by his second wife, the former Mary Elizabeth Taylor, whom he married in 1995; his first wife, Doreen, of Manhattan; a son, Michael, of Boca Raton, Fla.; and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Upgrade the Canal? Many Panamanians Are Saying No

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: PANAMA 

 BODY:
Once the equivalent of a modern, multilane highway, the Panama Canal may be on the verge, say those who run it, of becoming something closer to an old, congested country road.
 The increasing number of ships hovering off shore awaiting a chance to cross the isthmus is just one sign of the 92-year-old canal's status as a bottleneck. On top of that, hundreds of modern superships are too wide to squeeze into the canal's aging locks at all.
 All this would seem to be evidence of the need to modernize the canal. But a government plan to do that, which Panamanians will vote on in a referendum in October, may be in danger of failing because of a host of considerations that say much about this country's difficult past and challenging present.
 The canal means everything to Panamanians, who view it as Saudis might view their oil or Kenyans their wildlife. It is what makes their tiny country stand out on the map and generates a good portion of its outside income. 
 For so long, though, the canal was controlled by someone else. Taking possession of it from the United States in 1999 was a source of enormous pride for Panama, especially since canal authorities subsequently dispelled fears that the withdrawal of American experts would turn it into a flop.
 Nonetheless, many Panamanians intend to vote against the expansion plan, which would construct new three-step locks on either end of the canal. They intend to ignore government cries that doing so could prompt shippers to seek alternate routes and could turn the canal into an outmoded ditch.
 ''I've heard all that, and I'm still voting no,'' said Tomas Drohan, who recently retired as chief engineer of the Panama Canal Authority and is a vocal critic of the expansion plan.
 Although Mr. Drohan recognizes the need for a bigger canal, he predicts the project will cost considerably more than the $5.2 billion the government estimates. He also says he is sure that the corruption that pervades the upper reaches of Panamanian society will find its way into this megaproject, which is almost as large as the country's annual $6.5 billion budget.
 Such concerns about Panama's decision makers are widespread here, prompting many to question the project, which would begin next year if approved. No one is certain just how strong the ''no'' movement is, but the outspokenness of the opposition has surprised those in government who had expected Panamanians to back their canal reflexively.
 ''This is supposedly for us, the next generation,'' said Razne Pette, 26, a student leader who opposes the project. ''And of course we don't want it to become out of date. But we know the politicians in this country, and we know they are drooling at the thought of such a big project.''
 President Martin Torrijos, whose government is pushing hard for a yes vote, scoffs at the notion that all politicians are corrupt. ''It's like if I said that all men cheat on women,'' he told reporters recently. ''Some of them do, but not all. Ah!''
 Looking back provides part of the reason for the skepticism. Dictators, including Mr. Torrijos's father, have ruled Panama for a good chunk of its history. And even the arrival of better governance, and a campaign by Mr. Torrijos to clamp down on corruption, has not wiped out the scandals or the doubts that Panamanians have about the country's wealthy ruling clique.
 Although Panama's economy has benefited significantly from canal spinoffs, like a thriving banking sector, about 40 percent of the population lives in poverty. For them, the canal is a source of pride but one they contend benefits them little.
 ''You can walk around and see all the big buildings here and think you're in Geneva,'' said Miguel Antonio Bernal, a law professor and advocate who is leading the opposition. ''But keep walking, and you're in Haiti.''
 Adding a third lane to the canal, which would speed up traffic, has been talked about in one form or another for decades. The United States even began excavation for such a project as early as the 1930's, although the advent of World War II ended that expansion.
 In the final years of American control of the canal, a joint study by the governments of the United States, Japan and Panama concluded that the canal would reach its maximum capacity in this century and that its banks needed to be widened. But the question of who would finance the effort was put off. 
 ''The case is so compelling for it,'' said Robert Pastor, director of the Center for North American Studies at American University.
 The latest effort, which would allow some of the world's largest vessels to navigate the canal with room to spare, is purely Panamanian. The government here hatched it and plans to finance it without the involvement of foreign governments.
 The Bush administration has largely remained neutral, portraying the plan as a decision that is up to Panamanians. But during a visit to Panama last fall, before the latest plan was unveiled, President Bush said, ''It's in our nation's interest that this canal be modernized.''
 The plan has won the support of the maritime industry, even though shipping companies would bear much of the cost through increased fees. Bank loans would make up the rest, canal authorities say, pointing out that the canal itself would not be put up for collateral.
 The government says the revenue the canal generates, which now exceeds $1 billion a year, would grow considerably with a new and improved canal. But just where that money would go remains a concern to many Panamanians.
 The Torrijos administration has proposed a national dialogue on how best to spend canal revenues, but many remain suspicious that his effort would begin only after the referendum is approved.
 ''This vote is holding the government's feet to the fire,'' said a Western diplomat monitoring the referendum, who declined to be identified because he did have his government's permission to speak on the topic. ''It's healthy to have the Panamanian people have a role in how the canal's funds will be used.''
 Panamanians have used past referendums to voice their discontent. But the effect of a no vote this time around remains a subject of fierce debate. Would it force the government to acknowledge the masses and begin spending canal revenue to improve education and health care, to name just a couple of areas in considerable need?
 Or would it send a message to the world that Panama is unstable and that alternate trade routes might be worth exploring?
 ''This project is not only for the rich,'' argued Alberto Aleman Zubieta, the administrator of the canal and the lead advocate of expanding it. ''This is for the benefit of this country. This is like our petroleum.''
 But after fervently defending the expansion project in an interview, Mr. Aleman turned philosophical and acknowledged that the ongoing debate was healthy. 
 ''What's beautiful about this is that whatever decision we make is being made by us,'' he said. ''This is about more than just building a bigger canal. We're talking about building our country.''


CORRECTION-DATE: September 5, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about a coming referendum on plans to modernize the Panama Canal misstated the reason a Western diplomat was quoted anonymously when he said that Panamanians were skeptical about a promise by the government to involve them in deciding how canal income would be used. He asked for anonymity because he did not have his government's permission to discuss the issue -- not because he did have permission.

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
A transcript of Calvin Sims interviewing Times Southeast Asia correspondent Wayne Arnold about Singapore, the shimmering island city-state located off the southern tip of Malaysia.
 Background: Singapore, which has four million people, is one of the most stable, economically successful countries in Asia. Singaporeans have one of the highest standards of living in the world. While Singapore is a democracy, it is also known for being socially and politically conservative, a nanny state, that famously banned chewing gum, and in 1994 caned an American teenager for committing vandalism. Drug trafficking is punishable by death in Singapore.
Recently, however, Singapore has taken some extraordinary steps to change its authoritarian image. The government has lifted restrictions on freedoms of speech and assembly. Entertainment laws have been revised to allow nightclubs and bars to stay open late. Casinos, once strictly forbidden, are now legal. The government has also ended bans on hiring gays and allowed television viewers to see a censored version of Sex and the City. Singapore is also emerging as a hotbed for stem cell research thanks to new liberal laws and government financing.
 Sims: Well, Wayne, youve been living in Singapore and reporting from there for almost a decade now. And Im wondering is Singapore really as rigid a place as its made out to be. 
 Arnold: I think it is rigid. But its not the kind of situation you might expect if you came straight from the States. I think a lot of people come here and expect to see brown-shirts patrolling the streets. Its not like that. The authoritarianism here is pretty subtle, and I think to most people invisible. Rules like the cane and that was the Michael Fay incident and that was years ago during the Clinton administration they sound forbidding. And I think thats the intention, that they serve as a deterrent. Courts here, they do dole out canings still, not just for vandalism, but its actually very rare to see them do it. 
 Still, its common to hear people complain that Singapore has these draconian rules for infractions that you and I probably think are trivial. Theres fines for littering, spitting, not flushing a public toilet, even parading around naked in your own apartment is illegal 
 Sims: Wow.
 Arnold: because of the crowded living conditions here. And the famous gum ban came about because of the mess it was purported to make on the subway. So all this authoritarianism is really just about trying to clean up what used to be a pretty unruly place. Singapore just celebrated its 41st anniversary of independence. And back then it was populated largely by poorer immigrant people and it was a fairly uncouth place by most accounts dirty and crime-ridden and hardly the squeaky clean city that it is today.
 Sims: And even today the government is involved in this effort to try to actually remake Singapores image. Whats driving that?
 Arnold: Well, one word I guess: China. Singapore used to be the worlds leader in high-tech manufacturing. It was, for instance, the worlds largest maker of disk drives. And over the years, rising wages and Chinas emergence as a center for low-wage manufacturing have sort of priced it out of the market. Its about 10 years now that Singapore has been trying to climb the value-added ladder and promote knowledge-based industries like software and biotech. Singapore realized that if it wanted to emulate Silicon Valley it would need to be more than just efficient, that it would have to be fun. So since then its been gradually lifting some restrictions and easing censorship and a lot of other rules, but its all come fairly gradually.
 Sims: Ive spent a little bit of time there and I always thought that there wasnt a whole lot to do aside from shopping. Has that changed?
 Arnold: I think most people come here as a launch pad to other places around the region. Singapore is very clean. And you can eat here without having to worry too much about getting food poisoning. Thats an attraction for people spending a long time around the region. But, yeah, you know, Singapores not exactly a place people spend a week or longer to visit. Its just one city. And there arent the temples you see in China or Japan and those sort of things.
 But [the] casino resorts that theyll build here next year and moving on to 2010, that will help and especially here in Asia where gambling is probably the most important leisure activity. I guess the question most people have is whether or not those highrollers are really going to want to come to Singapore when they want to let loose and gamble.
 But at the same time, like I said, Singapores low crime rate and its cleanliness are a major draw for tourists and for potential residents.
 Sims: What does Singapores former prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, think about this remake thats taking place there? Because he was probably singularly responsible for Singapores severe image.
 Arnold: He has spoken about this quite a bit publicly in the last couple of years. And its no secret that I think at first he was hesitant and his own biography speaks to this a little bit I think he originally didnt see a lot of need for this frivolity. Singapore was all about doing business and making sure things got done efficiently.
 Sims: Mm-hmm.
 Arnold: Now I think he admits that he may have erred on the side of severity, and he now agrees that as Singapore matures and it tries to attract new industries and become a major international city that Singapore will have to let its hair down.
 Sims: Now some of these reforms, too, are being driven by the new prime minister, whos Lees son, Lee Hsien Loong. Right?
 Arnold: Its not really clear that hes single-handedly behind all of this, but he has become sort of the kinder, friendlier face of the Singapore government. I think as a member of a younger generation of leaders and part of a new realization of how the global economy is affecting Singapore, he has led the charge. It sounds as though the government is single-handedly trying to loosen these restrictions and the public is all for it. In fact, it takes a little bit of a sell. Singapores conservative rules are actually kind of popular among mainstream voters, especially those older voters who remember what things were like back in the old days when Singapore was sort of an unsavory place. And for those kind of people its a little hard to convince them that all-night bars and topless reviews are somehow good for the economy.
 Sims: Well, another sort of best-kept secret of Singapore is that it has a vibrant sex industry as well. And nobody really talks about that. Does the government regulate it? Is it legal?
 Arnold: As you know, unlike in the States, prostitution is fairly widespread across Asia. Its just a question of degree and legality.
 Sims: Mm-hmm.
 Arnold: Singapore has a sometimes seemingly hypocritical policy on vice. Drugs, for example. Being at the crossroads of major trade routes, Singapore cant avoid having drugs passing through. I mean there are drugs in Singapore. Singapores answer is that if youre caught trafficking in drugs you get the death penalty, no questions asked. Prostitutions been part of the Singapore landscape since the British times. And when Singapore was starting out it was populated, sort of like Seattle during the logging era, by mostly men. There was a shortage of women. So prostitutes were actually imported from Japan back then.
 Sims: Mm-hmm.
 Arnold: The British answer to this, and I think this is where the law comes from, is that prostitution is legal but solicitation is not. And so what Singapore has done is kept the old British rule and added its own twist, which is to regulate prostitution. Which means that any prostitute here is required to carry an identification card that certifies theyve been checked out. And physicians here conduct inspections for H.I.V. and other sexually transmitted disease on a regular basis.
 Sims: Lets talk about democracy in Singapore. And Singapore has been criticized in the past for not allowing a sort of viable opposition there. And Lees Peoples Action Party has ruled this country since its independence in 65. Is there an opposition to speak of in Singapore?
 Arnold: There is an opposition. How viable it is depends on your definition. The opposition here doesnt have enough seats in Parliament to mount any serious challenge to policy. Some would argue that it really lacks the depth to run a country. But the opposition does exist and it does serve as a fairly potent outlet for Singaporeans who want to express dissatisfaction with the way things are going.
 Sims: Is there enough freedom there for the opposition to openly express itself? Because again theres been some criticism with all these lawsuits that ministers file against opposition parties, that if you say something against the government or say something against a government official, you can be subject to a lawsuit.
 Arnold: Thats a common criticism, that the government is a little too tough on what it calls defamation, but what people in other democratic countries would probably call the normal cut and thrust of campaign politics.
 Sims: Mm-hmm.
 Arnold: And even in the recent elections we saw the government crack down on one individual after catching him out in what they called a lie. They are overly sensitive in some cases to criticism. And they use these kind of lawsuits as a strategy, no question. But theyve not resorted to that tactic as much as in past years. I think that over time theyre developing a little bit more tolerance. And I think that we saw in the last election some opposition rallies that were surprisingly well-attended. So I think that theyre able to express their views. Whether they have complete freedom to do so is debatable. But there is some debate.
 Sims: What is the secret behind Singapores success as this sort of economic industrial powerhouse?
 Arnold: I would say that probably the most important thing is a ruthless pragmatism. The politics may seem ruthless from the point of view of the opposition, but it opens the way for the government to have the kind of long-range planning that has enabled it to steer the economy in the way it has over the years and bring prosperity and security to the country. Theyre very good at planning as a result, and so they dedicate a lot of time and effort to figuring out what industries they need to move into and what industries they need to move out of, and how to bring them here. 
 Obviously one of the side effects of this though is that if you have a society thats given up so much of its own freedom in favor of control, sort of a co-dependent relationship develops. I mean the people really do support and in many ways need that kind of direction. And the challenge now for the Singapore government is to try to coax the population away from that and display a little bit more of their own sort of creativity and entrepreneurship. And on the other hand the challenge is really: How do you get a government thats entire raison detre as government to stop governing quite so tightly?
 Sims: Is Singapore fairly free of corruption?
 Arnold: Yeah. It has one of the lowest corruption ratings in the world. And political scientists and observers of Singapore say that Singapores been very, very lucky in that when it gained independence it was governed by people who arent crooks. And thats something we cant say about so many different Asian nations.
 Sims: They also pay their administrators very well, dont they?
 Arnold: Yes. Thats something that theyve set as a great deterrent to corruption: If you pay your public officials very well they wont be tempted to take bribes. Im not sure how tempted Singaporean officials have been to take bribes, but I think the high salaries probably work. 
 I think another impact they have is that they help to draw some of the most talented individuals into government, I think thats the other idea, so that the smartest people in Singapore, the most capable dont just become businessmen or professionals, some of them actually do want to go into administration.
 Sims: Now the majority of Singaporeans are ethnic Chinese, but Singapore is still a pretty racially diverse country. Are there any racial problems there?
 Arnold: No, theres no unrest racially. There are complaints you hear pretty frequently of a glass ceiling. And obviously Singapore isnt devoid of some racial tension. But for a city as integrated as it is, race relations here are extremely smooth. And I think thats again due to some very smart policies that the government enacted early on after independence. Housing estates, for example, are required to be integrated to a certain extent so that you dont get pockets of neighborhoods that are dominated by one single race, and that encourages people to be around and relate and understand people of different races in the same nation.
 Sims: What do you like most about Singapore?
 Arnold: I think it depends on what youre doing here. I think for business people Singapore is a, perhaps all too ideal, base for doing business around Asia. Its extremely efficient. Things work here. And its very safe. And people who have families like it because its very easy to raise your children here. You dont have to worry about them getting mugged or kidnapped.
 Its also a very exotic place within certain limits. Its not as exotic say as Indonesia or Thailand, but it is an Asian city with a flavor of different ethnic cuisines and ethnic cultures. And so its a good introduction to Asia. And for those of us who are old hands in Asia, its a good place to be based to move around the region and continue to experience the diversity the region has to offer.
 Sims: Wayne, thank you so much for sharing your insights with us.
 Arnold: Thank you, Calvin.
 Sims: And thanks for listening. Im Calvin Sims of The New York Times. Well be back next week with another edition of World View.

HEADLINE: An Untapped Market: Immigrants

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
AFTER 12 years of increases, home ownership declined slightly last year in the United States as home prices kept many prospective buyers in the rental market. Of course, a softening market could lead to a rebound in ownership rates in the coming years, but another source of momentum could come from a different source: immigrants. 
 Even as immigration levels surged in the last several years, homeownership rates among Asian-Americans and Hispanics, who make up a majority of immigrants, continue to lag behind the rate of non-Hispanic white Americans, according to a recent report by Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies.
The ownership rate among all American households was 69.8 percent last year. The ownership rate among all minorities was just over 50 percent, compared with about 75 percent for non-Hispanic whites.
 But that is starting to change. According to the Harvard report, home ownership among both Hispanics and Asian-Americans jumped by nearly 10 percentage points from 1995 through last year, as both groups grow more affluent. 
 Despite that increased buying power, though, mortgage executives and advocates for minority groups said that recent immigrants found the practicalities of American mortgages and homeownership at odds with what they experienced in their countries of origin.
 Nicolas P. Retsinas, the director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard, said other nations have higher rates of ownership than the United States, but the economic factors of homeownership are vastly different.
 In Mexico or Argentina, ''you can own a home, but there's no market for buying and selling,'' he said. ''In many cases in Mexico, even though you own the home, you don't have title to the land, so you can't sell it.''
 Other countries also have different practices when it comes to mortgages. For instance, according to Asian Americans for Equality, an advocacy group in New York, in many Asian countries -- China, for instance -- the minimum down payment for a mortgage is typically more than 50 percent, so underwriting methods are different. 
 Mr. Retsinas said that American lenders have ''to find a better way to connect with these markets, because as interest rates go up, they're going to have to find a way to help people buy homes'' if they are going to make money, ''and the people who need homes are immigrants.''
 The biggest institutions in the lending industry are starting to do just that. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored companies that help finance most mortgages in the United States, have recently begun studying the new approaches to homeownership among immigrant populations.
 Fannie Mae, for example, is looking at ways to track the roughly $40 billion sent by Hispanic immigrants to relatives back home each year. By doing so, Fannie Mae hopes it can show lenders that the fiscal responsibility those payments demonstrate would extend to mortgage payments. 
 Harold Lewis, the senior vice president for community and multicultural lending, said Fannie Mae was also looking more closely at how Asian immigrants approach housing. He said they may pool their incomes to buy a house, perhaps because they are not aware that they can individually qualify for mortgages with a low down payment, or because they do not see the benefit of securing a mortgage with a smaller down payment.

HEADLINE: Tech and Retail Stocks Lead a Late-Week Rally 

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
Whipsawed all week by conflicting economic data, stocks finished with a flourish after the last statistics to be released -- the growth in nonfarm payrolls -- bolstered hopes that the economy might not be slowing as much as feared. 
 Consumer confidence registered its biggest one-month decline this year, as stubbornly high energy prices, a softening of the real estate market and worries about wages and jobs began to take a toll.
Tech stocks, including Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Amazon.com, led major indexes higher for the week as investors bet that the Federal Reserve would not resume raising interest rates anytime soon.
 Lifted by news of better-than-expected sales in August, Wal-Mart, Home Depot and other retailing stocks also jumped. Energy companies, particularly those with big refining operations, fell on news of ample inventories.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 180.10 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 11,464.15. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 15.92 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 1,311.01. The Nasdaq composite index rose 52.87 points, or 2.5 percent, to close at 2,193.16. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.72 percent from 4.78 percent the previous week. MARK A. STEIN

HEADLINE: Santiago, Chile

BYLINE: By IAN MOUNT

 BODY:

WHY GO NOW -- With the election this year of Michelle Bachelet as president of Chile (South America's only female head of state), a robust economy and a construction boom that has added some 28 miles of subway since 2004, Santiago feels like a city on a purposeful march. A free trade agreement that Chile signed with the United States in 2003 has further accelerated the Chilean capital's emergence as a global financial hub.
 But Santiago isn't all business. Although this city of nearly six million can't match the thrills of Rio de Janiero or Buenos Aires -- and suffers from thick smog that in winter can make it feel as though you're looking through a dirty beer mug -- it has recently expanded its cultural offerings. The new Centro Cultural Palacio La Moneda and the almost-renovated Museo de Arte Contemporaneo make the city worth more than a half-day stopover before hitting the Andean ski slopes or Chilean vineyards. 
While the 17-year dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet in the 70's and 80's left behind a conservative pall, the city is getting reacquainted with its more playful side. Once dingy neighborhoods like Bella Vista are turning into artsy enclaves. Chic hotels and restaurants are opening up. And the city's wealthy districts in the east have become a shoppers' paradise known as Gringolandia.

WHERE TO STAY -- Santiago has recently seen an upswing in luxury hotel brands, especially in the wealthier neighborhoods northeast of the city center. In Las Condes, the tube-shaped Hyatt Regency Santiago completed a $10 million renovation in December, and was rebranded the Grand Hyatt Santiago (Avenida Presidente Kennedy 4601; 56-2-950-1234; www.santiago.grand.hyatt.com). The 310 rooms, with either mountain, city or poolside views, now feature streamlined furniture, soft cream colors and flat-screen televisions. Double rooms start at $250.
 For modern elegance, check into the Ritz-Carlton, Santiago, the luxury chain's only hotel in South America, which opened in the upscale El Golf neighborhood in June 2003 (El Alcalde 15; 56-2-470-8500; www.ritzcarlton.com/hotels/santiago). The 205-room hotel features Regency-style rooms, a restaurant called Wine 365 (named for the number of Chilean wines on the menu) and a 15th-floor pool, spa and health club capped by a glass dome. Rooms start at $260 a night, not including extras like a bath butler. 
 For a more intimate retreat from the city's bustle, Hotel Orly (Pedro de Valdivia 027; 56-2-231-8947; www.orlyhotel.com) remains a favorite of business travelers and tourists alike. Situated on a quiet block near the Pedro de Valdivia subway stop, the hotel has 28 cozy rooms in a converted 1940's French-style mansion. The Cafetto cafe in the lobby is usually packed with business travelers and well-dressed locals. Double rooms are set at $87 in the low season. 

WHERE TO EAT -- Chile's economic prosperity has been matched by a new, upmarket restaurant scene. Amorio (Constitucion 181; 56-2-777-1454; www.amorio.cl) has been drawing the city's elite to the hip environs of Bella Vista, the restaurant and performing arts center, in part because its owners, Benjamin Vicuna and Gonzalo Valenzuela, are TV celebrities. Housed in a restored 1890 brick house, the restaurant has a playful Starck-esque vibe, with white leather banquettes, a flower-printed bar and dripping candelabras. Intriguing dishes have included tuna perfumed with mint and served over shrimp and avocado couscous (6,400 pesos, about $11.80 at 551 pesos to the dollar), and pumpkin potage with eggplant and goat cheese (3,900 pesos).
 Down the block is Etniko (Constitucion 172; 56-2-732-0119), a stylish sushi bar that shows off the abundant seafood of a country with 2,700 miles of coast. Popular with local hipsters, artists and young professionals, it serves some 40 varieties of sushi, including tuna from Easter Island (2,000 pesos). At night, the restaurant turns into a nightclub, with D.J.'s spinning house and electronica music in a striking outdoor patio. 
 For more seafood, head to the Mercado Central, Santiago's central fish market in the northern part of Centro. It is a popular place to ogle the day's catch, but aggressive restaurant barkers give its core area an irritating tourist-trap edge. Along the calmer perimeter, locals lunch at cramped, modest joints like Yiyi (Mercado Central local 105; 56-2-672-3636), where patrons jostle for local favorites like paila marina, a seafood stew that seems to include every kind of fish and shellfish the Pacific offers (2,000 pesos). 
 Vegetarians can dine out in style, too. El Huerto (Orrego Luca 54; 56-2-233-2690), in the affluent neighborhood of Providencia, offers innovative vegetarian fare, including a flavorful gazpacho chilled with avocado and cilantro ice cubes (4,100 pesos with salad). Inside, a Birkenstock boutique cements El Huerto's hippie credentials. 

WHAT TO DO DURING THE DAY -- To see how Santiago is integrating its colonial past with its commercial future, stroll along the Centro via Huerfanos, a retail pedestrian mall, until you reach the Plaza de Armas, a palm-lined and music-filled colonial square packed with office workers and tourists.
 Then turn south on Ahumada to check out one of Santiago's most beloved institutions: the cafe con piernas, or cafe with legs, a reference to the bombshell waitresses in miniskirts (or a lot less) and long braided ponytails. Some of these are seedy, but one of the more atmospheric and family-friendly is Cafe Haiti (Ahumada 140; 56-2-698-1284), where it costs only 500 pesos for a cup of espresso and the view. 
 The new Centro Cultural Palacio La Moneda (Plaza de la Ciudadania; 56-2-355-6500; www.ccplm.cl), under the presidential offices where Pinochet staged his 1973 coup, is a cement-and-glass cultural center designed by the Chilean architect Cristian Undurraga. Opened last January, the sunny underground space exhibits works by Chilean artists; photographs of Rodrigo Gomez Rovira, whose family was exiled to France during the Pinochet era, are on view now.
 For contemporary art, take the metro to Bellas Artes, where the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo (Ismael Valdes Vergara and Mosqueto; 56-2-977-1741; www.mac.uchile.cl; 600 pesos), is undergoing a $3 million expansion of the 1910 neo-Classical building to include a library, archive and a refurbished Belgian cupola, to replace one that was badly damaged in a 1969 fire.

WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT -- Santiago's night life shies away from mega dance clubs and leans toward restaurants and rowdy bars, many of which can be found in Bella Vista. But for a bit of culture, head to Off the Record (Antonia Lopez de Bello 0155; 56-2-777-7710; www.offtherecord.cl), a 1940's-style restaurant with black-and-white tiles and old theater seats that plays host to political skits, bolero concerts and dramatized ''psychopoetry'' readings. An espresso costs 700 pesos, and Chilean beer 1,200 pesos.
 During the Pinochet regime, clandestine bars avoided the glare of the police by opening on residential side streets. That tradition has continued -- albeit the bars are legal now -- and on weekend nights, the young adult crowd heads to a low-slung part of Providencia to drink pisco-laced cocktails at places like Noche Buena (General Salvo 125; 56-2-236-1616), where a pisco sour runs 2,500 pesos; or its more upscale neighbor, Xampanyet (General Salvo 115; 56-2-235-6179; www.xampanyet.cl), a bar that blends minimalist design with kitsch elements. 
 A few bars have also opened on Avenida Providencia, the area's main drag. Chilean yuppies pack the high-decibel Liguria (Avenida Providencia 1373; 56-2-235-7914; www.liguria.cl), a vast trattoria-style restaurant with red and white tablecloths, an impossibly long bar and vintage photos. 

WHERE TO SHOP -- Santiago's Fifth Avenue is the pedestrian-friendly Avenida Alonso de Cordova in the Vitacura neighborhood. There, amid international brands like Hermes and Starbucks, are local designers who sell clothing, jewelry and furniture.
 Nicanor Bravo (No. 2791; 56-9-9-334-8790) sells high-end women's clothes and accessories, including handmade leather purses that look like dragon scales (95,000 pesos). Across the avenue, Cotidiana (No. 4035; 56-2-206-5693) sells housewares and fabrics by Chilean, Italian, French and Spanish designers, including a silver tray with a droplet-shaped handle (120,000 pesos).
 Los Dominicos artisans market (Avenida Apoquindo 9085; 56-2-201-9749; www.pueblitolosdominicos.com), in an old Dominican estate in Las Condes, offers a huge selection of Chilean crafts and birds amid its 160 stalls. Among the vendors are Antiguedades Los Dominicos (Stall No. 60, 56-2-248-2438), which sells antique cowboy stirrups (estribos) for 28,000 to 95,000 pesos; and Taller Urbano (Stall No 27; 56-2-248-2456), which sells stylish but understated rings of silver and lapis lazuli, a veined blue gemstone that Chile is known for. Prices start at 25,000 pesos.

YOUR FIRST TIME OR YOUR 10TH -- Santiago has an eclectic mix of colonial and modern architecture -- and two mountains. To get a sense of the city's sweeping scale, and a panoramic view of the Andes, walk up Pedro de Valdivia Norte and hop aboard the Teleferico de Santiago (Avenida Pedro de Valdivia Norte and Avenida el Cerro, 56-2-737-6669; www.funicular.cl; 1,200 pesos round trip), a gondola that shuttles you over the lush Parque Metropolitano (www.parquemet.cl) to the top of the bigger mountain, Cerro San Cristobal. A popular place for Chileans to picnic and exercise, the mountaintop, dominated by a huge statue of the Virgin Mary, overlooks Santiago's sprawling streets and urban grind.

HOW TO GET THERE -- There are no nonstop flights to Santiago from New York; there are from Atlanta, Dallas and Miami. A recent Web search for round-trip flights in early October from New York found fares starting around $640.
 A visa is not required for American citizens, but visitors must fill out a ''tourist card'' (needed at Customs when you leave) and pay a ''reciprocity fee'' of $100.

HOW TO GET AROUND -- The main tourist neighborhoods, including Bella Vista, Providencia and El Golf, are navigable by foot. To hop among them, the city's black-and-yellow taxis are everywhere, and are easy to flag down except on weekends. Short trips rarely exceed 2,500 pesos.
 But most people take the Metro de Santiago subway (www.metrosantiago.cl), which is efficient and clean and stops near most landmarks. One-way fares start at 350 pesos.

HEADLINE: Lebanese Politicians, Scarce in War, Renew Bickering

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, Sept. 2 

 BODY:
The man widely viewed as the heir to the Lebanese democratic movement, Saad Hariri, stayed out of the country during the entire war between Hezbollah and Israel. His No. 2, Walid Jumblatt, holed up in his ancestral mountain palace. Gen. Michel Aoun, the maverick Maronite Catholic who sees himself as a future president of Lebanon, remained in his villa in the mountainous Christian heartland, and said little. 
 Meanwhile, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah of Hezbollah, despite being a target of the Israeli military, gave frequent speeches from deep inside a bunker. 
But now, two weeks into a shaky cease-fire between Hezbollah guerrillas and Israel, some of the big names of Lebanese politics are moving back onto the political stage. The result has been an open round of bitter political infighting and backbiting. Figures from various factions have attacked one another in newspapers and on talk shows.
 The most vociferous has been General Aoun, who called this week for the resignation of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and his cabinet. 
 The government is dominated by figures from the American-backed groups that banded together in what is known as the March 14 alliance, for the date of their huge protest rally after the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which helped force Syria to end 15 years of domination in Lebanese politics. 
 General Aoun, who has established a working relationship not only with Hezbollah but also with his former nemesis, Syria, also called for a ''government of national unity.'' 
 That idea, charged Marwan Hamadeh, the minister of telecommunications and a prominent Druse member of the March 14 group, ''is in fact a Syrian attempt to topple the government.''
 Mr. Siniora refused to resign, saying: ''Let these politicians rest. The government is staying, staying, staying.'' In almost the same breath, he claimed Arab nationalist credentials by vowing, ''Lebanon will be the last Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel.''
 General Aoun struck back, telling the daily As Safir that ''Siniora will pay the price of his stubbornness'' and accusing the prime minister of working with ''foreign countries'' against Lebanon's interests.
 ''This will happen very soon; he will not have time to pack his things because he will be forced to leave quickly,'' General Aoun said, adding that he had warned of ''dangerous repercussions'' if the government did not resign. 
 ''Now we will choose the appropriate time to achieve the desired change in our own way,'' he asserted, setting off another round of recriminations between the March 14 group and his supporters.
 Mr. Hariri, the son of the assassinated former prime minister, has been slower to try to reclaim his standing. He returned from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere as the cease-fire was being declared, and has made a few speeches. His deputy, Mr. Jumblatt, still in the mountains, held a news conference in which he was critical of Hezbollah and asked ''to whom will it offer its victory.'' 
 Anyone who wants to wrest the spotlight from Hezbollah and its leader, Sheik Nasrallah, faces an uphill battle, given the respect both won throughout the Islamic world for standing up to Israel's military might. 
 ''We are all in awe of Hezbollah,'' said Jamil Mroue, the publisher of the English-language Daily Star and a secular Shiite. 
 But like many Western-oriented Lebanese, he is troubled by Hezbollah's militant Islamicism, its ties to Iran and its willingness to maintain a virtual separate state, adding: ''At this stage I cannot look at the situation and say there is a glimmer of light.'' 
 On Saturday, one of Syria's most important allies here, Nabih Berri, the wily speaker of Parliament, moved to smooth the waters by calling for something everyone could agree on: protesting the continued Israeli air and sea blockade.
 Mr. Berri, a Shiite whose Amal movement is aligned with Hezbollah in Parliament, announced a round-the-clock sit-in in Parliament until the embargo was halted.
 Politicians from all factions dutifully reported to the Parliament building on a plaza in the beautifully restored downtown, its clock tower now decorated with gory pictures of children wounded in Israeli air raids. Many arrived in identical charcoal-gray Mercedes with smoked windows.
 Even Nayla Moawad, a Maronite Catholic and an outspoken March 14 figure in Parliament, had praise for Mr. Berri as she left the meeting, saying: ''He is behaving in a very responsible manner.''
 Nonetheless, Ms. Moawad, whose husband, Rene, was president for 17 days in 1989 before being assassinated, warned that ''these are very dangerous times,'' and noted that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had been ''very clear in his threats.''
 A cache of explosives had recently been discovered in the north, she said, and it could only be intended ''not to fight Israel, but for car bombs and political assassinations.''
 When the Lebanese talk politics, it is a quick descent into a Levantine labyrinth of old grudges, treasured grievances, remembered massacres and betrayals, and the hands of shadowy outside forces -- most of them probably true.
 The French were the mandate power here after World War I and, to make Lebanon more economically viable, attached the largely Shiite rural hinterlands of the Bekaa Valley and southern Lebanon to the mountains and coastal cities populated by Greek Orthodox, Maronites, Druse and Sunni Muslims.
 As Catholics, the French were particular patrons of the Maronites, stacking the political system, where power is allocated by sect, in their favor. But there has been no census since 1932, because it would threaten the political system.
 Shiites are now believed to number about 40 percent of the population, the largest single group. 
 Sheik Nasrallah appeared to be trying to ease fears that Hezbollah would try to seize more power in his two-hour television address last Sunday night, saying there would be no ''second round'' of fighting.
 Dr. Amal Saad-Ghorayeb, a professor at the Lebanese American University who has written extensively about Hezbollah, said the speech was directed primarily at Christians and Sunnis.
 ''It's a way to assuage their fears,'' she said. ''He adopted a modest tone. He was even apologetic, unheard of in Arab politics. He wants to downplay fears of Shiites running the country.''
 It is, she added, ''a very, very delicate situation.''

HEADLINE: If America Wanted to Talk, Iran Would

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
JUST imagine. President Bush phones up Iran's president, thanks him for his thoughtful letter, and asks to sit down and discuss social, political and economic challenges facing the two nations.
 Of course, the notion that President Bush would call President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad seems pure fantasy. At the moment, the United States is trying to punish Iran for refusing to give up uranium enrichment. But sanctions may fail, and military options seem bleak at best.
So what might happen if Washington suddenly decided, in a high-level public act, to follow Don Corleone's advice to keep one's friends close but one's enemies closer? Would reaching out to Iran, like agreeing to hold direct talks with Iran's president, do much to persuade Iran's leaders to give up their willingness to pursue a nuclear program at any cost? 
 Diplomats would say diplomacy doesn't often work that way -- that public posturing is almost never what brings peaceful resolution of deep antagonisms; quiet bargaining, far outside the public's eye, is. There are exceptions, of course, like Anwar Sadat's public challenge to Menachem Begin to invite him to Jerusalem to make peace in 1977. 
 In Iran's case, though, political analysts and Western diplomats here say, that kind of dramatic effort would probably fall flat, at least at first. 
 Iran's leaders are certain the West wants to remove them from power, and so their first response, many analysts here said, would be to charge that Washington was laying a trap. The second reaction would be to say that the change validated the hard-line approach toward the West -- that belligerence had worked, and that more intransigence would get more such results. So, at least in the short term, the public posturing and bluster would continue.
 But is Washington thinking only about the short term? 
 Many political analysts, Western diplomats and reform-minded people here say a gesture from Washington to Tehran, or more precisely a gesture that demonstrates some degree of respect and openness to Iran, might well be seen here as far more threatening to the leadership than the threat of economic or political sanctions. 
 ''Radicalism has always been supported and strengthened by the West,'' said Emad Baghi, a former cleric from a highly respected family who heads a human-rights organization here even as he retains good contacts with the judiciary. 
 In Iran, the term hard-liner is part of the political lexicon, less a pejorative title than a label along the lines of liberal or conservative. In that vein, many Iranians refer to President Bush and his administration as hard-liners. And the conventional thinking here is that hard-liners help hard-liners, with their hard-line policies.
 ''The forces who advocate integration of Iran into the international system are in the minority today,'' said a political analyst with a prominent research institute in Tehran who insisted on anonymity out of fear of punishment. Iranian officials have cracked down on those who criticize the government, and they have effectively silenced any debate over their nuclear program. 
 ''The leadership is opposed to international integration,'' the analyst said. ''They are afraid the purity of their system would be broken, lost.''
 It may be hard for Americans to appreciate the extent to which many Iranians, at least those living in Tehran, crave improved relations with America, and how generally positive the image of the United States, or at least of its people, is on this city's streets. 
 But those sentiments cannot be influential in changing Iranian society while the United States talks of regime change and threatens sanctions, many analysts and diplomats here argue. A European diplomat in Tehran said that many Iranian intellectuals were shocked, and felt undermined, when in 2002 President Bush lumped Iran with Iraq and North Korea in an ''axis of evil.''
 Today, more than at any time in many years, Iran's most powerful figures define themselves with the language of revolution. Former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani tried to build economic ties with foreign capitals and attract foreign investment. His successor, Mohammad Khatami, talked of a dialogue of civilizations and used the language of diplomacy. 
 President Ahmadinejad, in contrast, talks of returning to the values of the revolution. An engineer by training, he has nevertheless crafted a persona that seems to meld the combativeness of a cleric and the populism of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez.
 Many analysts and former government officials and diplomats here say that as self-styled protectors of the revolution, President Ahmadinejad and his inner circle benefit from the isolation that comes from the argument over nuclear proliferation. It would be hard to maintain that posture while ushering Iran into the World Trade Organization, for example, or into a trade agreement with the United States. 
 With that in mind, they see even the taste for American products here as a threat. ''All of my customers want the American brands,'' said Ahmed Zadeh, 68, an electronics dealer in central Tehran. ''Everyone is fond of American brands.''
 Such talk makes Iran's hard-liners cringe as they seek to portray the United States as the cause of all of Iran's troubles.
 ''Decadence,'' said President Ahmadinejad during a press conference last week, ''is the result of Western materialism. We have to some extent been contaminated.''
 This summer, the authorities have waged a campaign to stop Tehran's residents from watching satellite television. It is a Sisyphean task in a city of 20 million, where rooftops are littered with satellite dishes. (The dishes are illegal, but like almost anything else they can be bought on the black market.)
 The authorities are so eager to roll back, or hold back, the influence of American, European, Asian culture -- indeed any outside culture -- that they have sent busloads of police into apartment complexes to confiscate the dishes. For much of the summer this dish war consumed more front-page space in Iranian newspapers than the controversy over Iran's nuclear program.
 ''When the West threatens isolation, they welcome it,'' Mohsen Kadivar, a senior reform-minded cleric, said of the hard-liners. ''They cannot integrate. They feel if Iran integrated it would lose its Islamic identity.''
 And so when President Ahmadinejad sent a letter to President Bush last spring, was he really trying to spur a dialogue? 
 Or was this a faux invitation, aimed at eliciting a predictable response that would serve to further isolate Iran even as Iran's president seemed reasonable? And last week, when the president offered to debate Mr. Bush, was it genuine, or strategic sleight of hand? 
 Reading intentions is always risky, but what President Ahmadinejad got was clear. The letter was rejected, as was the debate.
 And so he went before a cheering crowd last week and declared: ''Those who evade the exchange of ideas on world issues cannot defend themselves logically.'' 
 So what would have happened if the White House had taken up the challenge and called Tehran's bluff -- responding, for example, with a carefully crafted yes? What would Tehran's leaders have told the crowd then?

HEADLINE: For Bush, Hope and Fear in Lessons of Midterms Past

BYLINE: By DAVID GREENBERG. 
David Greenberg teaches history and media studies at Rutgers. His books include ''Nixon's Shadow: The History of an Image'' and the forthcoming ''Calvin Coolidge.''

 BODY:
IT was 1946. President Harry S. Truman was having a bad year. Never able to fill the shoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt, he endured ridicule in the press for his rough manners and political blunders. There were new economic worries: 10 million returning servicemen seeking jobs and homes; shortages of meat, coffee and tires; some 4.5 million autoworkers, steelworkers and others on strike. Republicans began to charge Democrats with having coddled Communists. Truman's approval ratings barely cleared 30 percent.
 The year ended in a blowout at the polls. Republicans picked up 55 House and 13 Senate seats and took control of both houses. Richard M. Nixon and Joseph R. McCarthy suited up and headed for Washington. Senator J. William Fulbright, Democrat of Arkansas, urged Truman to name a Republican as Secretary of State and then resign, so the new appointee could become president (as succession rules then dictated). Truman scoffed, belittling the senator as ''Halfbright.'' Prospects for his liberal agenda were shattered, while bills like the Taft-Hartley Act, which weakened labor unions, came on the docket.
President Bush is having a bad year, too. And like Truman in 1946, he has cause to worry about the coming midterm elections. 
 The party occupying the White House almost always loses seats in midterms. One theory political scientists give to explain this tendency is called ''surge and decline.'' It notes that most presidents have coattails when they are elected, carrying the party's candidates into Congress. But in other years those legislators have to run without the presidential surge, and many lose.
 But the extent of a party's losses can vary. A different theory of voting behavior, which considers midterm elections to be a referendum on the president, helps explain why. Evidence suggests that when voters support the president -- especially his handling of the economy -- his party loses fewer seats than when they're unhappy. Some scholars have also noted that midterm turnout is highest among people who want to punish the president, which helps to account for his party's ill fortunes.
 Of course, not all midterms are created equal. Some occur in the aftermath of scandal. The 1974 elections, held just months after Richard Nixon resigned over Watergate, were a windfall for the Democrats, who gained 48 House and 4 Senate seats.
 Other times, the economy influences the outcome. Recessions exacerbated Republican losses in both 1958 and 1982.
 This year, there is no Watergate hovering over the White House, especially with the Jack Abramoff and Valerie Plame affairs having receded from the headlines. The economy is plodding along. 
 Yet other factors are at work that have played a role in midterms past. The war is going poorly. Voters are anxious about national security. One party dominates the government. And Mr. Bush is in his sixth year -- a particularly tough time for a president to maintain clout in the Senate because those he swept into office when he was first elected must now run without him.
 A review of key midterm contests when similar factors were at work offers the White House grounds for both encouragement and despair.

1942: How's the War Going?
 In 1942, Franklin D. Roosevelt was midway through his third term. His party dominated Congress. The military was fighting overseas. Some analysts, including the pollster George Gallup, foresaw a strong Democratic showing or, at worst, modest losses. Roosevelt toured the country and gave a rousing fireside chat to rally support for the war and his candidates. He even proposed that Gen. George C. Marshall invade North Africa before Election Day.
 But Marshall refused, and other military campaigns bogged down. At home, wartime rationing and regulations rankled voters. Democrats failed to turn out at the polls, while Roosevelt's critics showed up to voice their discontent. The Republicans cut deep into the once-large Democratic majorities, gaining 47 House and 10 Senate seats, the largest increases for the party since before the Depression. This year, the continued bad news from Iraq could portend a similar outcome. Mr. Bush's approval ratings are stuck below 40 percent, and a majority of the public opposes the Iraq war.

1950: A Climate of Fear
 Truman's victory in 1948 helped bring Congressional Democrats back to power. But by 1950 an anti-Communist mania gripped the country, with the Democrats as the prime targets, and Truman was unpopular again.
 Over a few months, Alger Hiss went to jail, Senator McCarthy claimed that Communists infested the State Department, and North Korea invaded South Korea. Running on the slogan ''Freedom Versus Socialism,'' the Republicans ousted the majority leader and two other Democratic Senate leaders. Two other Senate seats and 28 House seats were captured by Republicans, too, though the Democrats kept a slim hold on power in both chambers.
 This year Republicans are using similar arguments to imply that Democrats aren't ready to stand up to America's enemies. President Bush has begun a speaking tour underscoring the threat of terrorism. Vice President Dick Cheney has stepped up attacks on opponents of the Iraq war, suggesting that they are effectively appeasing Al Qaeda. Such charges can have an impact, even when a war is going poorly.

1966: Restraining One-Party Rule
 With Lyndon B. Johnson in the White House and Democrats running Congress, the Great Society was at high tide. The Democrats had passed a raft of liberal legislation on matters from civil rights to fighting poverty. An activist Supreme Court was encouraging a progressive agenda.
 But people were concluding that liberalism had gone too far. A backlash of working-class voters was brewing. Many turned against the Democrats for their stands on crime, busing, welfare and other racially infused issues. In the 1966 elections, Republican candidates campaigned against ''crime in the streets,'' denounced housing laws that would force integration, and spoke about recent riots in Watts and other urban neighborhoods.
 The Republicans gained 47 House and 3 Senate seats that fall, cutting into the Democratic majorities. Only 21 of 48 pro-Johnson freshmen elected in the president's 1964 landslide survived. ''It's going to be rough going for him around here,'' the House Minority leader, Gerald R. Ford, said in reference to Johnson. ''Congress will write the laws, not the executive branch.''
 Today, the Republicans hold the White House and Congress, and Mr. Bush's recent appointments have pushed the Supreme Court to the right. The president has asserted vast executive powers, assuming the authority to place wiretaps on citizens despite legal restrictions on doing so, for example. Democrats are the ones counting on the public to conclude that the ruling party has overreached.

1986: No More Coattails
 Ronald Reagan remained quite popular in 1986, with approval ratings around 65 percent. But the senators first elected with him in his 1980 landslide, who had given the Republicans control of the chamber that year and helped him push his agenda, now had to stand for re-election on their own.
 Mr. Reagan knew the value of holding the Senate. Visiting 22 states and traveling 24,000 miles, he raised $33 million for Republican candidates. Behind the scenes, his national security aide John Poindexter, seeking an ''October surprise'' to help the party, secured the release of an American hostage in Lebanon, partly through the secret arms sales to Iran that would later envelop the administration in scandal.
 But nothing could thwart what political scientists call the ''six-year itch'': the loss of Senate seats in a president's sixth year. In November 1986, six of the freshmen senators first elected with Mr. Reagan in 1980 were turned out of office. The Republicans lost two other senate seats as well, handing the chamber back to the Democrats.
 Mr. Bush did not bring in nearly as many senators when he was first elected in 2000 as Reagan did in 1980. But one of them, George Allen of Virginia, is struggling to hold onto his seat, as are the two-term veterans Mike DeWine of Ohio and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. However, the president is less popular than many of the senators up for election, suggesting they may be better off without him on the ballot.

Reversing the Curse
 In 1998 and 2002, the parties in the White House bucked the long-term trends. The drive to impeach Bill Clinton in 1998 reflected poorly on the House Republicans and boosted sympathy for the president. Democrats reversed the sixth-year curse for the first time since 1906, gaining five House seats and breaking even in the Senate.
 In 2002, the White House boxed Democrats into a corner by forcing them into an early vote on whether to let Mr. Bush invade Iraq. Tying the vote to the fight against terrorism, Republicans made their rivals seem to be either mere foot soldiers following a bold president, or weak-kneed obstructionists unwilling to fight evil. Republicans made small gains in both chambers.
 Other factors in recent times have also scrambled traditional expectations. Sophisticated methods of redistricting have made some Republican House seats safer. Invigorated Republican get-out-the-vote efforts have invalidated the old rule that high turnout helps the Democrats.
 The last three elections -- presidential and midterm -- have been polarizing, brutally fought, and extremely close. If there is one safe bet for 2006, it's that this fall's elections will be all of those things as well.

HEADLINE: OPIUM HARVEST AT RECORD LEVEL IN AFGHANISTAN

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Sept. 2 

 BODY:
Afghanistan's opium harvest this year has reached the highest levels ever recorded, showing an increase of almost 50 percent from last year, the executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Antonio Maria Costa, said Saturday in Kabul.
 He described the figures as ''alarming'' and ''very bad news'' for the Afghan government and international donors who have poured millions of dollars into programs to reduce the poppy crop since 2001.
He said the increase in cultivation was significantly fueled by the resurgence of Taliban rebels in the south, the country's prime opium growing region. As the insurgents have stepped up attacks, they have also encouraged and profited from the drug trade, promising protection to growers if they expanded their opium operations. 
 ''This year's harvest will be around 6,100 metric tons of opium -- a staggering 92 percent of total world supply. It exceeds global consumption by 30 percent,'' Mr. Costa said at a news briefing. 
 He said the harvest increased by 49 percent from the year before, and it drastically outpaced the previous record of 4,600 metric tons, set in 1999 while the Taliban governed the country. The area cultivated increased by 59 percent, with more than 400,000 acres planted with poppies in 2006 compared with less than 260,000 in 2005.
 ''It is indeed very bad, you can say it is out of control,'' Mr. Costa said Friday in an interview before the announcement.
 President Hamid Karzai expressed disappointment at the results in a statement issued on Saturday and urged the international community to expand its commitment to strengthen the Afghan police and law enforcement agencies.
 The Bush administration has made poppy eradication a major facet of its aid to Afghanistan, and it has criticized Mr. Karzai for not doing more to challenge warlords involved in opium production. 
 On Saturday, a State Department spokeswoman, Joanne Moore, had no immediate comment on the United Nations report, but she pointed to a fact sheet posted on the department's Web site that outlined efforts to support Afghanistan's counternarcotics campaign.
 The increase in cultivation was mainly a result of the strength of the insurgency in southern Afghanistan, which has left whole districts outside of government control, and the continuing impunity of everyone involved, from the farmers and traffickers to corrupt police and government officials, Mr. Costa said.
 Afghanistan is already the world's largest producer of opium, and 35 percent of its gross domestic product is estimated to come from the narcotics trade. 
 Most of the heroin made from Afghan poppies is sold in Europe and Asia, drug officials say. Most of the increase in poppy cultivation has occurred in five provinces in southern Afghanistan, in particular Helmand, Kandahar and Oruzgan, where security has sharply deteriorated this year because of Taliban attacks, Mr. Costa said.
 ''The southern part of Afghanistan was displaying the ominous hallmarks of incipient collapse, with large-scale drug cultivation and trafficking, insurgency and terrorism, crime and corruption,'' he said in a statement released by his office.
 ''We are seeing a very strong connection between the increase in the insurgency on the one hand and the increase in cultivation on the other hand,'' he explained in the interview.
 The Taliban had distributed leaflets at night, inviting farmers to increase their poppy cultivation in exchange for protection, Mr. Costa said. The rebels also profit from levies in return for protection of drug convoys passing through the border areas they controlled. 
 There were also signs of a pernicious strategy to encourage farmers to increase poppy cultivation in an effort to force a government reaction, which would then turn the population further against the government, Mr. Costa said.
 But he did not blame only the Taliban for the increase. He specifically accused the former governor of Helmand Province, Sher Muhammad Akhund, of encouraging farmers to grow more poppies in the months before he was removed from office. The result was an increase of 160 percent in that ''villain province'' from its harvest last year, he said, the highest rise in the country. 
 ''There is evidence of major pressure exerted by him in favor of cultivating opium,'' Mr. Costa said.
 In the news briefing on Saturday, Mr. Costa also criticized the government's action of removing the governor and giving him a position in the upper house of Parliament.
 ''I have been on record for asking the president for corrupt officials not to be moved around but to be removed, to be neutralized; if records can prove conviction, to be arrested and convicted. So far we do not have much evidence for that And we hope that more forceful initiatives will be taken exactly in that area,'' he said.
 One province in the north, Badakhshan, where there is no problem of an insurgency, also had a significant increase in poppy cultivation. 
 Mr. Costa attributed that mostly to the lack of government control and the presence of powerful warlords and corrupt local officials. A substantial drought also played a part, because no alternative crop could survive as the poppies did. 
 While the government had improved its performance at eradication of the poppy crop, it had failed to do enough to catch traffickers and corrupt officials, he said.
 The United Nations drugs office, which measures the eradication program, said about 38,000 acres of poppy fields were confirmed to have been destroyed, whereas only about 12,000 acres were confirmed destroyed last year. Government reporting on how much was eradicated was also less exaggerated, Mr. Costa said. In 2005, province governors had reported eradicating about 87,000 acres and the United Nations could only confirm 12,000 destroyed. In 2006, governors reported 57,000 acres destroyed, and the drug office confirmed 38,000, he said.
 The United Nations drugs office surveys cultivation in Afghanistan through satellite imagery and with teams on the ground, who have even worked in Taliban-controlled areas. Usually they travel undercover on motorbikes, and they interview farmers and traders in more than 2,000 villages across the country.
 International donors have put a lot of money into training judges and investigators and preparing high-security detention facilities for drug traffickers, and it was now time for the government to act, Mr. Costa said.
 ''I am pleading with the government to be much tougher,'' he said. A new high-security prison block would be inaugurated in a few weeks, he said. ''We have room for 100 people and I am asking the government to fill it within six months,'' he said.
 Afghanistan's minister for counternarcotics, Habibullah Qaderi, said at the news briefing that the news was a setback for his ministry and for the country. But he said the government's strategy to combat opium production would start to show results in the next three years.
 He said he hoped the government would be able to capture more high-level traffickers and corrupt officials. But he said it still lacked the capacity to investigate and catch the ''big fish.''
 Several hundred people have been arrested and convicted for drug offenses in recent months, but Mr. Qaderi admitted most were people who were caught carrying the drugs.
 One significant prosecution involved an Interior Ministry official, Lt. Col. Nadir Khan, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison two months ago for stealing 110 pounds of heroin that had been impounded by drug enforcement authorities and selling it, a Western counternarcotics official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

HEADLINE: Rove's Word Is No Longer G.O.P. Gospel

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2 

 BODY:
Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser, is struggling to steer the Republican Party to victory this fall at a time when he appears to have the least political authority since he came to Washington, party officials said.
 Mr. Rove remains a dominant adviser to President Bush, administration officials say. But outside the White House, as Mr. Bush's popularity has waned, and as questions have arisen among Republicans about the White House's political acumen, the party's candidates are going their own way in this difficult election season far more than they have in any other campaign Mr. Rove has overseen.
Some are disregarding Mr. Rove's advice, despite his reputation as the nation's premier strategist. They are criticizing Mr. Bush or his policies. They are avoiding public events with the president and Mr. Rove. 
 Influential conservative commentators have openly broken with the White House, calling into question the continued enthusiasm of evangelicals, economic conservatives and other groups that Mr. Rove has counted on to win elections. Some Republicans are ignoring Mr. Rove's efforts to hold the party together on issues like immigration and Iraq. 
 In a reflection of this difficult environment, the White House has decided to concentrate nearly all its resources on the critical fight to keep control of Congress, party officials said, largely stepping away from the governors' races, at least for now.
 In Michigan last week, Dick DeVos, a Republican candidate for governor and a longtime contributor to Mr. Bush, startled national Republican Party leaders with a searing attack on the president for failing to meet with the leaders of the Big Three automakers. ''We're being ignored here in Michigan by the White House, and it has got to stop,'' Mr. DeVos said.
 His communications director, John Truscott, said the attack was timed to coincide with Mr. Rove's visit to Michigan for a fund-raiser, in an effort to goad Mr. Bush into a response. Asked if the DeVos campaign was worried about angering Mr. Rove, Mr. Truscott said, ''That never even crossed our mind.''
 Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, who was chairman of the Congressional Republican campaign committee in 2002, said Mr. Rove and the White House seemed measurably less involved this year.
 ''It's been more of a bunker mentality, don't you think?'' Mr. Davis said. ''They have been good in terms of raising the money. The problem is, you have a president with a 38 percent approval rating, and it just changes the dynamics of what they can do.''
 This midterm election presents Mr. Rove with a particularly difficult challenge. Beyond testing his reputation for always finding a way to win, the outcome could determine the extent of Mr. Bush's influence for the rest of his presidency and shape the way he is perceived by history. Mr. Rove has warned associates that a Democratic takeover in Congress would mean an end to Mr. Bush's legislative hopes and invite two years of potentially crippling investigations into the administration. 
 The White House said that Mr. Rove would consider an interview for this article if it were conducted off the record, with the provision that quotations could be put on the record with White House approval, a condition it said was set for other interviews with Mr. Rove. The New York Times declined.
 The diminishment in Mr. Rove's influence reflects the fact that his power is to some extent a function of Mr. Bush's popularity. In some cases, Republican candidates have made a deliberate strategic decision that the way to win is to distance themselves from the White House. 
 But a central problem, Republicans said, is that Mr. Rove is seen as juggling two potentially conflicting agendas: protecting the president's legacy and taking steps to help Republican candidates win re-election.
 Mr. Rove enters the campaign season after a year of personal tumult. Until mid-June he faced the threat of indictment in the investigation into the leak of a C.I.A. officer's identity, and in April, he was stripped of some of his duties in the White House. Mr. Rove was moved from a West Wing corner suite to a smaller windowless office across the hall, a shift one friend said he found demoralizing. 
 Mr. Rove's associates said that throughout the leak investigation, he was coiled and withdrawn. They said his demeanor brightened the moment he learned he would not be indicted. Associates described him as displaying relentless optimism about an election that is filling Republicans with a sense of doom. 
 Mr. Rove determines the bulk of the president's schedule and is a crucial figure in determining what Mr. Bush should say this fall. He is the White House's main conduit to conservatives whose willingness to turn out at the polls could help determine the party's success.
 Mr. Rove has become a star fund-raiser for the Republican Party, raising $10,357,486 at 75 events in 29 states, according to the Republican National Committee. Mr. Rove runs regular White House meetings, typically at 6:30 a.m. in the White House mess, reviewing high-profile House and Senate races with the White House political director, Sara Taylor, and sometimes with Congressional leaders. He shares his view of the landscape with Mr. Bush in a daily 8:30 a.m. briefing. 
 Mr. Rove -- with Ken Mehlman, the Republican National Committee chairman, and Ms. Taylor, both of whom have assumed a higher profile than in past years -- has settled on a narrow strategy to try to minimize Congressional losses while tending to Mr. Bush's political strength. The White House will reprise the two T's of its successful campaign strategy since 2002: terrorism and turnout. 
 They have determined that control of Congress is likely to be settled in as few as six states and have decided to focus most of the party's resources there, said Republican officials who did not want to be identified discussing internal deliberations. Those states will likely include Connecticut, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington, though officials said the battle lines could shift in coming weeks.
 The White House is largely turning away from the 36 governors' races, although Mr. Rove and Mr. Bush will continue to help Republican candidates for governor raise money, party officials said. The decision has broad significance because building a foundation of Republican governors had been a main part of Mr. Rove's goal of creating a long-lasting Republican majority.
 The Republican National Committee expects to spend over $60 million, which would be a record, for the midterm elections. Officials say half of that would pay for get-out-the-vote operations in the targeted states. 
 In states where Mr. Bush's presence could be problematic, like Pennsylvania and Connecticut, the turnout operations give Mr. Rove a way to provide below-the-radar help.
 Mr. Mehlman, whom Mr. Rove assigned to master get-out-the-vote techniques years ago, has handed custom compact discs with lists of voters, along with information on their voting and consumer habits, to every state Republican chairman.
 One administration official said that Mr. Rove was also looking beyond Mr. Bush's term, to the creation of his library. And he is quietly making his influence felt in the 2008 presidential campaign. Most significantly, the White House has signaled to Bush supporters that they are free to work for Senator John McCain of Arizona, which could provide Mr. Rove a network of intelligence in 2008. Mr. Rove has made clear to associates that he is not supporting any candidate in that race. 
 Mr. Rove's associates said it was inevitable that his clout would diminish somewhat given the president's declining approval rating and the history of two-term presidents generally weakening by their sixth year in office. 
 ''Anytime you're in the position of being the prime mover, and you've got five people saying we should do it this way and five others saying we should do it that way, you're going to aggravate five people inevitably when you come down with a decision,'' said Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman. ''But Karl is willing to do that, and you're going to get your share of slings and arrows when you are.''
 Indeed, Democrats -- aware of Mr. Rove's reputation for pulling out all the stops when necessary and his ability to call on a shadow political machine of interest groups and donors to attack opponents -- said they remained worried about what kind of effort Mr. Rove might unleash in the closing weeks of the campaign. 
 But the limits of Mr. Rove's influence were made clear this year when he was unable to persuade the speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Allan G. Bense, to run in the Republican primary for Senate against Representative Katherine Harris, whom the party judged to be a weak candidate. Mr. Rove invited Mr. Bense for a sit-down at his vacation home in Rosemary Beach, Fla., as part of a long but failed effort to get him to challenge Ms. Harris for the nomination, said Towson Fraser, a spokesman for Mr. Bense. 
 And Mr. Rove's associates say he appreciates the need of candidates to distance themselves from the White House to win. But he was described as angered by candidates who he thought were going too far in criticizing Mr. Bush out of concern that attacks could further damage an already weakened president, they said.
 Mr. Rove meets in person only infrequently with the Republican heads of the Senate and House campaign committees, Senator Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina and Representative Thomas M. Reynolds of New York, though Mrs. Dole said he was always ready to jump on a plane to a fund-raiser at her request.
 Mr. Reynolds said the White House had been untiring in raising money and providing surrogates. But he made clear that when it came to the House races, he was running the show.
 ''I'm the one who put together what I think is our best effort to win a House majority in 2006,'' Mr. Reynolds said.
 In the Ohio Senate race, Mr. Rove has found himself in a back-and-forth with Senator Mike DeWine. Mr. DeWine has at times resisted Mr. Rove's counsel that he employ an unrelenting focus on terrorism, exhibiting what other Republicans described as ambivalence about a television commercial depicting the World Trade Center burning. 
 Candidates and strategists across the country say that they hear from Mr. Rove infrequently. 
 Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said he encountered Mr. Rove at a dinner at Vice President Dick Cheney's home here in late July. ''We chatted for a minute,'' Mr. Romney said. ''He was interested in how the governors' races were looking. But it was interest as a fellow Republican.''

HEADLINE: Caracas Mayor Lays Claim to Golf Links to House Poor

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Jens Erik Gould contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Sept. 2 

 BODY:
No place in this country symbolizes the resilience of Venezuela's moneyed elite more than the Caracas Country Club, a bastion of tropical luxury from the 1920's, conceived in part for foreign oilmen and designed by American landscape architects who invoked the feeling of a vast coffee plantation.
 So imagine the reactions in Caracas, a city choked by shantytowns and traffic congestion, when the mayor ordered the ''forced acquisition'' this week of the club's 18-hole golf course, and another exclusive course near the United States Embassy, to make way for homes for as many as 11,500 poor families.
 ''We've done studies that show that 20 families survive for a week on what's needed to maintain each square meter of grass on a golf course,'' said Juan Barreto, the mayor and a close ally of President Hugo Chavez. ''Their use is private and benefits certain sectors which are not the middle class or the poor.'' 
 This is not the first volley against private property rights. Mr. Chavez's government has tried for years to alleviate a severe housing shortage. Pro-Chavez politicians have put upscale districts of Caracas in their crosshairs, allowing squatters to occupy apartments in some residential buildings and considering measures that would expropriate apartments owned by landlords who control more than three properties. 
 Still, nothing touched a nerve in relation to property rights like Mr. Barreto's declaration, broadcast on state television. Even within Mr. Chavez's normally unified government, fissures erupted. Officials wanting to further radicalize Venezuela's socialist-inspired economic policies applauded the decision, while the vice president, Jose Vicente Rangel, derided it. 
 ''The federal government does not share the decision to forcefully acquire the golf courses of Valle Arriba and the Caracas Country Club,'' Mr. Rangel said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that the expropriations would be ''the exclusive responsibility'' of the municipal government for Caracas. 
 Teodoro Petkoff, an opposition politician and editor of the daily newspaper Tal Cual, alluded to the Bolsheviks in saying that Mr. Barreto, ''in his megalomaniacal delirium, must consider this comparable to the storming of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg in 1917.'' Mr. Barreto, meanwhile, said he would take the case to the country's Supreme Court. 
 Almost lost in the uproar was the housing crisis that led the mayor to rattle well-heeled Caraquenos in the first place. Official estimates suggest Venezuela needs 1.7 million new homes to meet low-income housing needs, even though 35,000 such units were built in the first half of the year. 
 The housing shortage has been decades in the making, created by mass migration to Caracas and other cities from the countryside and natural disasters, like mudslides and Hurricane Mitch in 1998, that left more than 400,000 people homeless and destroyed more than 60,000 homes. Rising prices for new homes, as Venezuela's economic growth has surged by 9 percent this year, have also put owning an apartment out of reach for many people. 
 Anemic efforts by private construction companies to build low-income housing and a lack of new homes to keep up with population growth in this country of 27 million people have worsened the problem.
 Earlier oil windfalls have encouraged the view that the government is almost exclusively responsible for solving housing deficits, according to Carlos Machado, who specializes in real estate and land issues at the Institute of Higher Administrative Studies, a business school here.
 That view has only been strengthened by what Mr. Chavez calls his Bolivarian Revolution, an ambitious program to lift the living standards of the poor financed by oil revenues that could exceed $50 billion this year. 
 But the problem has been a persistent headache for Mr. Chavez, who created the post of housing minister in 2004, and in July named his third: Ramon Carrizales. Mr. Chavez has publicly criticized housing officials for not adequately addressing the crisis, and recently began reaching out to foreign construction companies. 
 During Mr. Chavez's recent visit to China, Venezuela reached a $1.2 billion deal with the Chinese conglomerate Citic to build 20,000 homes over the next two years. 
 Construction companies from Brazil, Uruguay and Iran have similar deals with Venezuela's government, part of a broad effort to award contracts to non-American companies. 
 However, none of the deals are coming together quickly enough to produce the new homes needed in Caracas, a densely populated city of four million. Here, the housing shortage is most acute, and worries over how it will be dealt with have sent the real estate market spinning. 
 Landlords have flooded the market with apartments for sale, fearful of the measures, some in effect and others under consideration, that would allow more expropriations and bolster the rights of tenants and squatters. 
 Rentals are so scarce that rents have skyrocketed to as much as $7,000 a month for a three- or four-bedroom apartment near the two golf courses. ''The way people react is that you'll find that there's much less property available for lease or for rent, and more property available for sale,'' said George Kastner, executive director of Coldwell Banker in Venezuela. 
 Already, squatters occupy units in more than 140 buildings in Caracas, either illegally or with the approval of city officials. Mayor Barreto, who once pursued doctoral studies in sociology, has ordered more than a dozen takeovers of buildings, including a 96-unit residential complex in El Rosal, a district with soaring postmodern office towers and the Caracas stock exchange. 
 Mr. Barreto made apartments in the building available to families of firefighters who were homeless or had to commute from far-flung areas to Caracas to work. The firefighters now live in 46 of the building's one- and two-bedroom apartments. 
 ''This is simply our new reality,'' said Victor Marval Marcano, an official with Constructora Cohen, the company that owns the building, which is called Rosal Plaza. ''We've had cordial discussions with the mayor's office, and we're awaiting payment from the government for the units that have been taken over.'' 
 Payment for the golf courses, according to Carlos Escarra, a constitutional lawyer and top pro-Chavez legislator in the National Assembly, should be ''just and opportune.'' 
 ''If there's agreement on the amount of the payment, then it's over,'' Mr. Escarra told reporters. ''But if not, then this goes into a judicial phase.'' 
 If that occurs, the golf club takeovers may well bog down in Venezuela's byzantine bureaucracy and legal system. By week's end, the mayor's opponents seemed almost nonchalant. ''One has to laugh, because sincerely this is a country where everyone rules and no one obeys,'' Fernando Zozaya, president of the Caracas Country Club, said in an interview. 
 It would be too easy, perhaps, to accept such sentiment as a bookend to the dispute in a city where protesters gather daily at the government's housing bank in El Rosal to demand new homes. The protesters, who are occasionally dispersed by tear gas, expressed glee at the chance to become neighbors of Venezuela's elite. 
 ''Golf is a beautiful game that I've seen on television, but if that's where I belong, then so be it,'' Roberto Carlos Valdez, 41, a street vendor, said during a protest this week. ''All I want is a roof over my children.''

HEADLINE: Help for the Merchant in Navigating a Sea of Shopper Opinions

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
DEMOCRACY is coming to online shopping.
 Scores of Internet merchants have recently begun following Amazon's lead by posting customer reviews -- both flattering and flaming -- of products they sell, and directing shoppers to sources of the most highly rated items. For example, shoppers can now find frank assessments of everything from Rolling Stones concerts to computers on sites like TicketsNow.com and CompUSA.com, among many others, as well as portals like Pricerunner.com and, in the coming months, MSN.
The trend arises both from an increasing tolerance for candor among retailers and from the emergence of inexpensive technology to track and post customer opinions on individual Web sites. This promises to give customers a new way to shop. Perhaps more surprisingly, it has bolstered the sales of some early experimenters. 
 Take Petco, the pet supplies retailer. The company's Web division last year tested the service of a new technology company, Bazaarvoice, of Austin, Tex., which essentially polls retail customers (and also helps merchants screen reviews for inappropriate content as they are posted on the site).
 According to John Lazarchic, Petco's vice president for e-commerce, 30 days after the company placed links near products asking visitors to write a review, more than 1,000 products attracted comments. Petco then featured the highest-rated products in marketing e-mail messages. Those messages generated five times as many site visits as previous approaches.
 Earlier this year, the site devoted entire sections within each pet category to ''top rated'' products. Shoppers who browsed products that way purchased at a 35 percent higher rate than those who browsed assortments arranged in the traditional manner. And those who bought from the top-rated sections spent 40 percent more than those who did not.
 ''I think we're one of the first, if not the first, to create a primary shopping experience that's driven by the voice of other shoppers,'' Mr. Lazarchic said. ''It makes sense, though, because if you look at studies that are being done, consumers will trust the voice of another customer before they trust the retailer or manufacturer.''
 Indeed, according to a survey by Forrester Research, a technology consulting firm, 6 percent of customers say they believe marketers' advertising claims, and 62 percent say they feel there are too many ads in the media. Forrester also found that fewer than 10 percent of consumers said that television ads influenced their purchase decisions, while more than half said that the recommendations of friends and family changed their purchase plans. 
 ''It's pretty clear that people are trusting the words of other consumers more than what's broadcast on the airwaves,'' said Peter Kim, an analyst with Forrester.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Kim said, merchants have watched the ascendancy of Web logs. ''They see they have less and less control over their brand image, and are questioning whether they ever did have that control at all,'' he said. ''That's driven the openness toward having a greater dialogue about their products and services.''
 Retailers like Mr. Lazarchic and others say they have long known this about consumers, but have had no efficient way to collect customer reviews. ''This has been on our radar for the past four or five years, but the manpower required for it was always outside our capabilities,'' he said.
 Bazaarvoice solves that problem by soliciting, screening and analyzing reviews on the retailer's behalf, then feeding data from those reviews back to retailers so they can modify their sales methods. The service charges a minimum of $24,000 a year.
 Last week, Bazaarvoice began a new service, collecting reviews of specific products and distributing those reviews across portal sites like MSN and shopping comparison sites like Pricerunner.com, with MSN, Smarter.com and others to follow in the coming months. According to Brett Hurt, Bazaarvoice's chief executive, these sites will most likely show a snippet of each review, then provide a link to the retailer's Web site to read the rest. Should consumers click that link and ultimately buy, Bazaarvoice collects a fee of about 10 percent.
 Mr. Hurt would not say how many retailers now use his service, but in addition to Petco he cited Overstock.com, Golfsmith, HomeDepot.com, Sears.com and Macys.com, among others.
 Bazaarvoice's chief competitor, PowerReviews of Millbrae, Calif., has signed up retailers like the photo supplies site Adorama.com, AbtElectronics.com and others, but unlike Bazaarvoice it does not charge retailers for its service. Rather, the company is using the reviews to fill its own Web site, PowerReviews.com, which is to make its debut in about a month.
 Retailers can choose not to have their product reviews posted on PowerReviews.com and still post the reviews free on their own sites, but Andy Chen, the chief executive of PowerReviews, said most of them wanted the additional exposure. Should consumers click on the review on PowerReviews and be taken to the retailer's site, Mr. Chen's company will receive an as-yet-undetermined fee for each visitor or each sale generated.
 Mr. Chen said his site would compete with comparison shopping sites like Shopping.com and Shopzilla.com, as well as the shopping sections of portals like MSN. Most of those sites either already include customer reviews or are being approached by Bazaarvoice to include those reviews, but Mr. Chen says he believes his service will have more credibility than others because he accepts reviews from verified purchasers only.
 ''We're only working with established, reputable retailers so we don't have to worry about them posting fake reviews,'' Mr. Chen said.
 Sites like Shopping.com's Epinions have other methods to bolster the credibility of reviews, like popularity ratings for individual reviewers, but others, like Shopzilla, lack such features.
 Mr. Chen and other executives pointed out that retail sites tended to generate more product reviews than comparison sites and even sites like Epinions, where products like dog toys are barely represented. But that alone is not enough to entice Mr. Hurt, of Bazaarvoice, to try to compete with those sites.
 ''It's a very expensive business,'' Mr. Hurt said. ''There are about 50 shopping portals all competing with each other, and some of them had to raise over $80 million just to get to profitability. I'd rather be on all of the portals than try to build a new one.''

HEADLINE: Troops Cut Death, but Not Fear, in Baghdad Zone

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Reporting for this article was contributed by Khalid W. Hassan, Omar al-Neami, Ali Adeeb, Qais Mizher and Edward Wone.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 1 

 BODY:
Three weeks after American and Iraqi troops began searching, fortifying and patrolling Dora, one of Baghdad's bloodiest neighborhoods, the odor of death on the streets has eased. After 126 bodies surfaced in Dora in July, only 18 turned up in August, according to United States military figures. Killings, most often Sunni against Shiite or vice versa in this mixed neighborhood, dropped as well: 14 were reported last month, down from 73 in July.
 But in a country long on disappointment and short on hope, Dora represents only the embryo of progress. It was the first of several violent neighborhoods covered by a new Baghdad security plan -- which seeks to create walled-in sanctuaries where economic development can grow in an environment of safety -- and American and Iraqi officials are still struggling to make residents feel safe enough to let their children play in the streets.
The local progress is coming as death tolls across the country have been soaring, up more than 50 percent in recent months, according to the latest Pentagon assessment. And in Baghdad as a whole, the toll has been high, with the city's morgue reporting more than 334 people killed or found dead from Aug. 24 to the end of the month. 
 Most of those deaths occurred in areas without a reinforced military presence. Yet the challenge for American and Iraqi officials lies in spreading security to additional trouble spots without letting Dora slide back into lawlessness. American generals admit that lasting progress will be hard to achieve.
 ''The difficult part is going to be holding these areas with Iraqi security forces,'' the top United States commander, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., told reporters on Wednesday. ''And building the relationships between the Iraqi people in the neighborhood and their security forces so they can get on with their economic development.''
 American forces have frequently focused on violent areas of Iraq and then moved on -- in part because they lacked enough troops to hold the territory -- only to return when chaos ensued. In Tal Afar for example, a dusty agrarian city northwest of Baghdad, American troops were forced to reassert control in 2005 after a large military offensive a year earlier failed to yield a lasting peace. 
 In Dora, local leaders worry that violent gangs are just lying low, scouting for ways to circumvent the additional safeguards while attacking other neighborhoods or waiting for the Americans to leave. 
 ''The calm situation right now is temporary, and if the state does not continue to build trust with the people, the situation might explode,'' said Sattar al-Jabouri, 51, a Sunni sheik and member of Dora's municipal council. ''We know there are people who do not want this operation to succeed.''
 Mr. Jabouri emphasized that the American presence had made Dora safer. Like others in the area, he raved about being able to sleep again on his roof, away from the sweltering indoor heat. He said some of the families who had fled the violence seemed to be returning, and that the Iraqis and Americans who searched his home were respectful and seemed sincerely interested in improving the neighborhood. 
 Col. Michael Beech, the American commander overseeing Dora, said the second phase of the operation, now in effect, included cutting off all but a few access points, searching every car that entered Dora, and linking American soldiers with Iraqi police officers for joint patrols. Sections of the neighborhood have been assigned to the same squads so that residents and officers can become better acquainted. 
 The United States military has also allotted $5 million to Dora and the surrounding area, with much of the current outlay going to Iraqis who pick up trash.
 On a recent afternoon, the results were hard to miss. Piles of rancid garbage behind the market had been cleared, and workers elsewhere tossed more into trucks. Iraqi police cars and American humvees lined the streets. 
 Yet even as residents described the progress as encouraging, they said that life in Dora had not returned to normal. They trust neither neighbors nor the police. They still keep their children indoors. They still warn visitors to stay away. 
 On a block of the main shopping district on a recent morning, half the stores remained shuttered. Anmar al-Mayahi, 23, a Shiite shoe salesman who owns a store that is still closed, described Dora as a place where anxiety holds hope at arm's length.
 After two roadside bombs exploded recently in the neighborhood, on streets ringed by checkpoints, Mr. Mayahi worried that the additional security precautions were beginning to break down. 
 ''Where did they get their weapons?'' he asked. ''How did they get them into the neighborhood with all the extra protection?''
 ''If the Americans leave, it will go back to killing in the streets,'' he said. ''It will be civil war.'' 
 Mr. Mayahi said his pessimism stemmed from experience. Over the past year, several attacks at the market pushed panicked women into this store, crying for help. A few months ago, he said, two men waving pistols ran by and fired into the crowd of shoppers. The police pulled Mr. Mayahi in for questioning, and beat him after asserting, incorrectly, that he was a Sunni. He recalled their justification as being, ''All Sunnis are dogs.'' 
 He said he was thrown into a small, dank room with more than 100 people and a toilet in the center. ''One guy next to me said, 'I've been here for a year and a half and no one has let me leave,' '' Mr. Mayahi said. ''I started crying.''
 His father, a science teacher, managed to buy his son's freedom -- paying about $250 for his release. 
 Most people in Dora can recite similar tales of what amounts to sectarian cleansing. Abdul Rahman Hassan, 25, a Sunni baker who lives on a street just off the main thoroughfare, said he saw his Shiite neighbors threatened a few months ago and told to leave the neighborhood. 
 When one man's family did not move fast enough, ''They planted a bomb in front of his house,'' he said. ''His son was injured, and his daughter was killed.''
 Given such cases, it is no surprise that people here simply laugh when asked if they are still nervous after a few weeks of relative safety. ''Of course we're still nervous,'' Mr. Hassan explained. ''People are hidden, doing horrible things. We don't see them. We just see their actions.'' 
 Iraqi security forces -- who outnumbered Americans more than six to one during the initial week of the operation -- are also struggling with Dora's uncertainties. Even with killings so far down, roadside bombs are still common in the broader Rashid district, of which Dora is a part. In August, 81 bombs were found, 56 detonated and 7 caused casualties, the United States military said. A month earlier, the numbers were similar: 89 discovered, 66 detonated and 8 that were effective. 
 Iraqi officials enlisted a new national police brigade several months ago to manage the area after officers were accused of taking part in kidnappings and killings. But many of the new recruits have received little or no training. And with abandoned homes being filled by both legitimate returnees and squatters, differentiating friend from foe has become the challenge. 
 ''We have a huge problem now that we can't know who the terrorists are and who the real neighbors are,'' said Gen. Mahdi Sabeeh al-Gharawi, commander of the Second Division of the national police, which covers much of southern Baghdad. ''So many people fled from their homes and other families have come in.''
 For an immediate solution, he said, he started asking residents to fill out information cards so officers could verify that the people moving into the houses really owned them. 
 The broader hope is that the political process in Iraq will accelerate and create bonds across sects and persuade militias to disarm. General Casey and other American commanders have promised that the Baghdad security operation will last months, not weeks. They have pledged to tackle every neighborhood, including Sadr City, the stronghold of the Mahdi Army, a militia loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr. 
 The question is whether the American military has enough soldiers to expand even as it tries to sustain progress in the first neighborhoods secured. 
 The people of Dora say they can hardly bear the thought of being abandoned.

HEADLINE: Cost of Pensions Adds to Troubles Of Factory Town

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: LOCKPORT, N.Y. 

 BODY:
For two and a half years, Michael Tucker was mayor of this small city by day and an autoworker by night. 
 Then in May, he became one of the nearly 50,000 workers at General Motors or its former Delphi parts division to take buyouts, lured by the $33,000-a-year pension his company offered. That pension, and a smaller one he expects to collect from the state after his years as mayor, makes him a little unusual in a nation where more and more workers are not covered by such plans.
But now, as mayor of Lockport, Mr. Tucker, 49, is seeing the budget of this city north of Buffalo consumed by the kind of pension and retiree health care costs that helped push Delphi into bankruptcy. So he is preparing to do what his former employers, G.M. and Delphi, have already begun to do: ask the city's five unions for concessions, including limiting wage increases and cutting benefits, when labor contracts expire next year. 
 Cities across New York State are only now starting to grapple with the so-called legacy costs of pensions and retiree health care benefits, and the situation in Lockport -- with its rising property taxes and strained budget -- is emblematic of what other cities may face in the future. 
 Pension costs in New York City have quadrupled in the last five years, and they will soon consume 10 percent of the city's budget. In Buffalo, the state's second-largest city, pension costs have risen to $24 million, from $4 million, in the last five years, and the city is now overseen by a financial control board.
 ''It's going to be tough negotiations,'' Mr. Tucker said last month, as he stood in front of the giant Delphi radiator plant where he once worked and served as an officer in the United Auto Workers union. ''We're going to be looking for some concessions,'' he added. ''No question about it.''
 Lockport's pension costs for public workers have increased more than tenfold since 2000, to $1.6 million projected for this year, from $111,083. During the same period, the cost of providing medical coverage to city workers and retirees has risen 71 percent. Together, pension and health care costs have grown to 14.5 percent of the city's budget last year, up from 7.6 percent in 2000. 
 ''Those are the two biggies, and they cripple cities like ours,'' Mr. Tucker said.
 One big part of the problem is that the State Legislature has imposed new burdens on local government pensions around the state, just as it has in New York City, where the vibrant economy is better able to absorb such costs. But local governments have played their part in letting these costs rise.
 The Lockport city government has regularly made concessions in past contract talks with its five unions, agreeing at various points to reduce the number of years that police officers and firefighters must work before they can retire, to 20 years instead of 25, and then granting them additional benefits for extra years of work. Such enhancements, which typically do not show up on city balance sheets for years, are often used to wrest shorter-term savings from unions. 
 And as they are in the private sector, health care costs are soaring. City workers in Lockport do not pay monthly health insurance premiums, except for some new hires in their first two years of service, something that is increasingly rare in the private sector. But in Lockport, they had a model: General Motors, which was the city's largest employer until it spun off Delphi in 1999. Workers at the Big Three automakers were accustomed to such benefits for years, but have since seen them begin to be scaled back.
 ''I think the bar was set years and years and years ago by the U.A.W. and what they were able to negotiate,'' said Richard P. Mullaney, the city's clerk and budget director, who added that the mindset of labor talks with the auto supplier pervaded Lockport's negotiations with city unions. 
 ''The people who are sitting at the table negotiating contracts representing the city, the elected officials, many of them come from that area, many of them come from, not necessarily management, but they're rank and file workers that are serving on the Common Council,'' he added. ''And you listen to police officers, firefighters and other city workers, and they say, well this is the benefit that you have, we want something similar.''
 In what could be a preview of Lockport's toughening stance, Mr. Tucker's administration recently suspended medical benefits to two firefighters who had been injured on the job, an unprecedented step for the city as it tries to cope with the soaring cost of benefits. Mr. Tucker said that a determination had been made that the city was not bound to pay the medical benefits of the firefighters, who are still being paid.
 The move did not please the firefighters' union. 
 ''I love my job, I took pride in the community and everything else, but when something like this happens to you, you feel very unappreciated,'' said Daniel Foley, a former firefighter and paramedic who herniated three disks on the job in 2003 and had his benefits suspended in June. 
 ''When I got the letter, I felt like putting a 'For Sale' sign in front of my house and moving out of town,'' he said. ''This is the thanks I get?''
 For his part, Mr. Tucker said the city has to start grappling with costs it can no longer bear. 
 ''These are difficult choices,'' Mr. Tucker said. ''It's not fun when you take away somebody's health care. We don't make these decisions lightly, but it is because of the times.''
 Statewide, local governments faced pension costs in 2005 that were at their highest point, as a percentage of payroll, in two decades. One reason is that the collapse of the stock market in the early part of the decade -- and the impact that had on pension investments -- forced municipalities to contribute far more to the state's pension system than they did in the late 1990's. 
 The more recent recovery of the financial markets means that municipalities' payments will begin to decrease this year, though they remain at much higher levels than they have been used to.
 Another issue is the Legislature's moves to enhance benefits for various union workers in cities across the state, often after prodding by unions. Though the state pension fund assumes the majority of the costs, localities are also required to foot part of the bill. (New York City operates its own pension funds, separate from the state system.)
 In 2000 alone, the Legislature approved more than $2 billion in new costs for the state and municipalities outside New York City by granting retirees recurring annual cost-of-living adjustments, waiving contributions into the retirement system for thousands of workers who have 10 years or more of service, and increasing the pension formulas to allow workers to collect bigger checks upon retirement. 
 Since the State Constitution prohibits taking away pension benefits already granted to public workers, Mr. Tucker is looking to hold the line on salaries and for health care concessions, and he is also considering more innovative ways to trim the budget.
 ''We're looking to other cities, merging together to do water, merging together to do assessments, privatizing ambulance service, privatizing garbage service,'' he said. 
 Mr. Tucker's situation is not unusual in Lockport, where three of the city's six Council members formerly worked at the Delphi plant. If taking the buyout was a difficult choice for many of his Delphi co-workers, it was not for him.
 When he was working as mayor and autoworker, he was able to get a couple of hours of sleep in the mornings after his graveyard shift and maybe as much as three hours in the evenings if he could leave the Municipal Building by 5 p.m.
 ''I'm getting a little beat up after two and a half years, to be honest with you,'' he said shortly before taking the buyout. 
 A burly man with shaggy black hair and a mustache, Mr. Tucker has a calm manner that was evident during a recent Council meeting when black residents complained vociferously about a Fourth of July clash with the police.
 A Republican, he faces the same problems as other upstate mayors: an exodus of population, jobs and tax revenue. Lockport's population decreased by 9 percent in the 1990's, to about 22,000 today, while steel and paper plants have been shuttered. The workforce of Delphi, the city's largest employer, has shrunk to between 3,000 and 4,000 today, from more than 10,000 in the 1970's.
 The city has taken a number of cost-saving steps over the years, including significantly cutting its work force and consolidating its medical plans, and it has not relied on debt as heavily as other municipalities.
 But the costs of providing for the city's retirees are already increasingly consuming the city's budget. 
 A recent report from the state comptroller's office said that Lockport faced greater fiscal challenges than most other upstate cities. To offset the rising benefits costs, the city has raised its property tax rate to $15.27 per $1,000 of assessed property value this year, up from $12.89 in 2000. That brings the cost to a little over $3,000 for a $200,000 home. 
 To avoid raising taxes further, the city, which tends to run a slight deficit, has been depleting its reserves, giving it less cushion in the case of unforeseen calamities. 
 ''We're getting on shaky ground,'' said Mr. Mullaney, the city's budget director. 
 Last year, Moody's Investor Services cut the city's debt rating to Baa2, the second-lowest out of 10 investment grades. 
 ''The city's financial position has continued to weaken as management has drawn down reserves over the last three years to offset property tax increases,'' Moody's said. 
 And residents have grown alarmed at the increase in local taxes. This year, the city government faced a revolt when a new assessor unveiled a major increase in the assessed property values. Within a couple of months, the assessor had quit and his plan to increase assessments was scrapped, a story that was played out in articles in The Lockport Union-Sun & Journal. 
 As if all of that were not enough, Delphi is seeking the bankruptcy court's permission to cut wages steeply, which would be another blow to the city economy.
 Delphi's bankruptcy put the mayor in an awkward position: fellow autoworkers were dismayed by threatened wage cuts, but he was concerned about keeping Delphi's doors open.
 ''People's attitudes started changing,'' Mr. Tucker said. ''I was all over the media, I was like the poster boy, you know, and I had to be very careful what I said.''
 ''I certainly don't want to alienate the company, because I'm the mayor now and they're the county's biggest employer. I don't want to alienate them, I'm trying to help them, and I certainly don't want to alienate my union brothers and sisters, because I'm one of them as well. So it was difficult.''
 Phyllis Green, a 73-year-old Republican councilwoman who also once worked at the plant, said the city was facing a sobering era as it confronts a future with its main employer in bankruptcy and having to pay public retiree benefits crafted in more prosperous times. 
 ''You have to be realistic of what the times are,'' she said. ''When we had all the other companies, we could afford certain things.''
 ''Today, we can afford a very good Chevy Impala,'' she added. ''Can we afford a Cadillac anymore? No.'' 

Costly Promises
 This is the fourth article in a series examining actions of state and local governments that have left taxpayers with large unpaid bills for public employee pensions. The series focuses on ways in which pension funds have been shortchanged by government officials even as they have sought to enhance benefits for groups of politically influential workers.

HEADLINE: One Last Kiss From Agassi, And It's Over

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY; Liz Robbins contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
It hardly ended with a whimper, yet it ended just the same for Andre Agassi.
 In a 21-year tennis career that came to a close at the United States Open yesterday, Agassi produced many a memorable plot twist; he reshaped his image, physique, priorities and place in the game by force of personality and an often underrated will.
But in his hobbled state, slowed by back pain, he could not reshape the course of a third-round match against the qualifier Benjamin Becker of Germany, losing by 7-5, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-5.
 When the match finished -- with Becker holding serve at love with his 27th ace -- Agassi and his last opponent met at the net, then Agassi sat courtside and put a towel to his face. 
 He was already starting to cry, and there would be more tears as he eventually rose, walked back onto the court and stuck to tradition by blowing kisses to all four ends of the stadium. .
 Agassi returned to his chair, overcome by the moment. The sellout crowd of more than 23,000 at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Queens, which had not always had reason to cheer during the match, stayed on its feet for several minutes applauding.
 His wife, Steffi Graf, one of the sport's greatest women's champions, and their children, Jaden, 4, and Jaz, 2, were also standing and applauding.
 So was Becker. Agassi eventually rose again, blew four more kisses, then asked for the microphone from the CBS commentator Mary Joe Fernandez. He chose to give a speech instead of an interview, and his voice was breaking.
 ''The scoreboard said I lost today,'' Agassi told the crowd. ''But what the scoreboard doesn't say is what it is I have found. Over the last 21 years, I have found loyalty. You have pulled for me on the court and also in life.
 ''I found inspiration. You have willed me to succeed, sometimes even in my lowest moments. And I've found generosity. You have given me your shoulders to stand on to reach for my dreams, dreams I could never have reached without you. Over the last 21 years, I have found you, and I will take you and the memory of you with me for the rest of my life.''
 With that, Agassi handed back the microphone, grabbed his equipment and walked, pigeon-toed of course, off the court. He walked away from the game that was imposed on him by his father, Mike, when he was a child prodigy in Las Vegas. But the game eventually became something he lived for quite willingly.
 ''I am thankful for my father giving me this game,'' Agassi said later.
 He was not the best American player of his remarkable generation. Pete Sampras, who won 14 Grand Slam singles titles, was. Agassi won eight major titles, and lost to Sampras in four of their five meetings in major finals. But Agassi was unquestionably the biggest tennis star of his generation.
 ''I think in the last 20 years, he's been the most important person we've had in our sport,'' said Lindsay Davenport, seeded 10th in this tournament. ''I think Billie Jean King made huge inroads for obviously women, but Andre made our sport cool, popular with the younger crowd, exciting. He's beloved.''
 In his final seasons, he was also in frequent pain because of sciatica, which was caused by a degenerative back condition. Gil Reyes, Agassi's trainer, said the injury was linked to slippage in a vertebra.
 The condition curtailed Agassi's play this season and led to his announcement that he would retire after this tournament. He considered not playing after some disappointing results in hardcourt tournaments earlier this summer, but he ultimately stuck to his plan. And with the help of a cortisone injection in July and another one Tuesday, he played unexpectedly well.
 Still, after defeating Marcos Baghdatis in a thrilling second-round match that ended early Friday morning, Agassi collapsed in pain on his way out of the stadium. He lay on the sidewalk, putting a case containing a freshly minted DVD of the match under his head for a pillow.
 ''That was the worst I've ever been; I just credit the doctors that I was able to get out there today,'' said Agassi, who was administered anti-inflammatory injections on Friday, Saturday and again yesterday morning.
 Nonetheless, he was far from his best, and his movement, particularly his lateral movement, bore little resemblance to his crank-back-the-clock footwork against Baghdatis.
 ''My heart was telling me to go get him out there,'' Reyes said. ''He's hurting bad, and it hurts so bad to see him do it. But his heart was telling him: No. Finish. Finish it out. Leave it all, and when you leave, open up your arms and heart and take something with you that you will never forget.''
 Although Agassi was nearly always interesting during his two decades at the top, he was not always worthy of admiration. He once spat at a chair umpire at the United States Open. Over the years, he has made offensive jokes during news conferences and the occasional uncharitable comment about a lineswoman or an opponent, including Sampras.
 But he has been that rare athlete who has made a huge impact on and off the court. On the court, he was ranked No. 1 for 101 weeks and won 60 ATP Tour singles titles.
 In perhaps his most impressive achievement, he was the only man in the last 37 years to win all four Grand Slam singles titles: the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the United States Open.
 He is the only man to have won them on three different surfaces. When Don Budge, Fred Perry, Rod Laver and Roy Emerson managed it, three of the four Grand Slam events were on grass. Now, only Wimbledon is played on the game's original surface.
 Off the court, he has leveraged his celebrity for worthy causes, creating one of the most successful charitable foundations in sports and starting a charter school for underprivileged youth in Las Vegas, his home city.
 Above all, he has grown up in the public eye, which helps explain why there were also so many tears in the eyes of fans yesterday. A lot of those watching might once have had long hair and questionably colorful taste in clothes, too. A lot of those watching might have said things in their youth that they would not mind retracting.
 Asked what he would say to his 17-year-old self, Agassi answered without hesitating, ''I would say, I understand you a heck of a lot more than I want to be you.''
 Tennis players are on display, perhaps more than any other athletes. There are no teammates to blend in with, no helmets or masks to hide their emotions. And Agassi has shown his more than most; the highs included his 1992 Wimbledon title and his 1999 French Open title, and the lows included a drop to No. 141 in the rankings in 1997.
 The defeat to Becker, ranked 112th in the world, came after Agassi managed to add to his list of career highlights with his emotional victories over Andrei Pavel and Baghdatis. ''Those two matches were worth a difficult year,'' he said. ''I'm glad I did it.''
 Yesterday's match, which started shortly before noon, had a different vibe from the start. Postponed because of rain, as all of Saturday's matches had been, it was played in brilliant sunlight, and when it began, the cavernous stadium was only about half full.
 Becker's coach, Tarik Benhabiles, said of Agassi: ''It looked to me like he was about 40 percent of normal. But I admire him for going out there and trying.''
 Although Becker has a potent serve, he is not related in any other way to a fellow German, Boris Becker, a tennis star from the mid-1980's to mid-90's. Boris Becker won Wimbledon at 17; Benjamin Becker is playing in his first Open at age 25 after spending four years playing at Baylor University.
 But this Becker, who faces Andy Roddick next, will always have a place in the game, too, as the last man to play Agassi. ''It all seemed like a movie for me today,'' Becker told the crowd. ''Playing Andre, he was my idol growing up. I followed his whole career.''
 Now, he has ended that career, despite having to deal with cheers for his missed second serves and boos for some of his fine drop shots, and despite looking strangely sluggish for much of the fourth set. ''He was tightening up emotionally,'' Benhabiles said.
 Becker shook free of the moment to break Agassi's serve with three consecutive winners at 5-5 in the final set, then held his serve with ease.
 ''I've lost to B. Becker before,'' Agassi said much later, when his tears had dried and good humor ruled. ''I was proud to shake anybody's hand today.''

HEADLINE: Suozzi's Record, Beyond Basics Of Nassau's Fiscal Success

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Sept. 1 

 BODY:
As he pursues his uphill bid to deny Eliot Spitzer the Democratic nomination for governor, Thomas R. Suozzi has seized on a central theme: that he has management skills Mr. Spitzer does not. As proof, he cites a long record of accomplishment as Nassau County executive.
 ''I can do it, because I've done it'' is Mr. Suozzi's slogan, which he repeated seven times in his hourlong debate with Mr. Spitzer in July. It is Mr. Suozzi's shorthand for his claimed successes, including rescuing Nassau County from near-bankruptcy; leading a statewide campaign to curb Medicaid costs; and taking on the political status quo with his Fix Albany campaign.
 In fact, Mr. Suozzi has earned high marks from independent institutions for his signature achievement, the resuscitation of Nassau's finances. A review of his years in public office shows that he has begun a number of major programs -- though not all have come to fruition -- and has managed to reform a stubborn and malfunctioning county bureaucracy. 
 In 2005 he was named a ''public official of the year'' by Governing magazine, a national journal on state and local government. It praised him as ''the man who spearheaded Nassau County, New York's, remarkable turnaround from the brink of fiscal disaster.'' On Wall Street, Nassau's bond rating -- which had fallen to one notch above junk -- was restored to the A rank with 11 upgrades in two years, a more marked improvement than for any other government in the nation in that period, Mr. Suozzi says. 
 Nassau was a certified mess when Mr. Suozzi took over in 2002. Despite being one of the nation's richest and biggest suburbs, with a population of 1.3 million, it had been drowning in red ink since the 1990's, a result of mismanagement, corruption and a slowing economy. Eventually the state imposed a financial review board and granted a $105 million bailout and $382 million in debt financing help, which proved a lifesaver to Nassau and Mr. Suozzi.
 Elected on a reform platform, Mr. Suozzi initially raised the county portion of the property tax by 19 percent but also promised to freeze taxes after that. He has kept them steady the last three years, contrary to Mr. Spitzer's accusation during their debate that taxes had been ''repeatedly'' raised. Mr. Suozzi shrank the county work force by 1,200 jobs to less than 9,000, the lowest level in three decades, and wrung givebacks from the unions. He cut millions of dollars in spending, drastically reduced borrowing and debt, eliminated deficits and accumulated surpluses.
 Doubts about Nassau's continued recovery arose recently when the county comptroller, Howard S. Weitzman, warned that next year the county faces a $104 million structural deficit, meaning that recurring expenses are not matched by predictable sources of revenue, like taxes. Mr. Suozzi promised to close the gap in the approximately $2.4 billion budget without new taxes. By law, his 2007 budget proposal is due on Sept. 15, three days after his primary showdown with Mr. Spitzer.
 Mr. Spitzer's camp lost no time in needling Mr. Suozzi on the deficit forecast. A campaign spokeswoman, Christine Anderson, said: ''Given the looming deficits facing Nassau County, this report raises questions about a candidacy built on a slogan of 'I can do it because I've done it.' ''
 Beyond his fiscal record, Mr. Suozzi has also garnered praise for social services like his ''no wrong door'' program, which aims to provide comprehensive help by centralizing county agencies. Jack O'Connell, executive director of the nonprofit Health and Welfare Council of Long Island, said: ''I can't say enough good things about him. He has been unbelievably responsive, not only talking about, but acting on, what we can do for folks in need.''
 But the Suozzi administration has had its failures. One deputy county executive was forced out as investigators uncovered financial irregularities in his agencies, and he pleaded guilty to billing the county for personal expenses and to harassing a female subordinate. Another deputy quit when a politically connected assistant was charged with falsifying time slips. 
 In addition, Mr. Suozzi has been accused of heavy-handed fund-raising from county contractors. Disputing his claim of being a reformer, the Republican minority leader in the Nassau County Legislature, Peter J. Schmitt, called the administration ''ethically challenged.''
 Mr. Suozzi's grand visions often have plodding follow-through, said Edward Ward, a top aide to the Republican legislators. Much of Mr. Suozzi's plan to rebuild county offices is bogged down, and his proposal to renovate the Nassau Coliseum and develop a new Nassau ''hub'' there has gone slowly.
 Expanding his horizons statewide last year, Mr. Suozzi used his post as president of the New York State County Executives Association to demand a cap on the soaring Medicaid costs imposed on localities. The state eventually complied. Assailing state leaders in both major parties, he also formed the Fix Albany political action committee, endorsed by former New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch, to demand broader changes.
 Though relishing the role of outsider, Mr. Suozzi, a lawyer and an accountant, is a polished speaker and a charming campaigner who has politics in his genes. His father and uncle preceded him as Glen Cove mayor, and a cousin now holds that office. 
 Mr. Suozzi's own tenure in Glen Cove became a template for his career. He took over from a floundering Republican administration, imposed a one-time tax increase, froze taxes the remaining seven years, revitalized the ailing downtown and started the cleanup of its polluted waterfront.
 But Mr. Suozzi's success in fighting the political establishment is decidedly mixed.
 In the win column, he was elected to four consecutive terms as Glen Cove mayor, turning what had been a political swing city into a Democratic stronghold. Then he upset the former Democratic county chairman in a primary for the county executive nomination. He went on to beat the Nassau Republicans, who had reigned for decades as that party's strongest organization in the nation, in the general election and again in his re-election last year. 
 His coattails helped sweep Democrats into office as district attorney, comptroller and chairman of the board of assessors. As a show of force against his own party's state leaders, Mr. Suozzi hand-picked a challenger who defeated the incumbent in an Assembly primary in the district that includes Glen Cove.
 But in the loss column, Mr. Suozzi's Fix Albany call for the ouster of incumbents elsewhere around the state went largely unheeded. His own base on Long Island is crippled. He alienated Democratic leaders in neighboring Suffolk County when one of his deputies ran in the primary for county executive against the party favorite, Steve Levy, who won. 
 In Nassau, Mr. Suozzi failed to expand his party's precarious one-vote majority in the county legislature, which began this year in paralysis amid an embarrassing fight for presiding officer, causing personal and political rifts that have never fully mended and that jeopardize his future legislative proposals. 
 As Mr. Suozzi trails badly in the polls, many Nassau Democrats fear being frozen out in the expected Spitzer era in Albany. Now half the 10 Democratic Nassau County legislators -- including both sides of the leadership fight -- have abandoned Mr. Suozzi's sputtering bandwagon.
 ''Tom has done an outstanding job as county executive, but he has to continue doing that,'' said the legislature's presiding officer, Judith A. Jacobs. ''I was originally giving my support to him for governor, but it wasn't resonating with the people.'' She recently switched to Mr. Spitzer instead.

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and KATE ZERNIKE; Robin Toner reported from Washington for this article, and Kate Zernike from Indiana.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3 

 BODY:
After a year of political turmoil, Republicans enter the fall campaign with their control of the House in serious jeopardy, the possibility of major losses in the Senate, and a national mood so unsettled that districts once considered safely Republican are now competitive, analysts and strategists in both parties say.
 Sixty-five days before the election, the signs of Republican vulnerability are widespread.
 Indiana, which President Bush carried by 21 percentage points in 2004, now has three Republican House incumbents in fiercely contested races. Around the country, some of the most senior Republicans are facing their stiffest challenges in years, including Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Florida, the veteran Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee; Representative Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut, a state increasingly symbolic of this year's political unrest; and Representative Deborah Pryce of Ohio, the No. 4 Republican in the House. 
 Two independent political analysts have, in recent weeks, forecast a narrow Democratic takeover of the House, if current political conditions persist. Stuart Rothenberg, who had predicted Democratic gains of 8 to 12 seats in the House, now projects 15 to 20. Democrats need 15 to regain the majority. Charles Cook, the other analyst, said: ''If nothing changes, I think the House will turn. The key is, if nothing changes.''
 Republican leaders are determined to change things. Unlike the Democrats of 1994, caught off guard and astonished when they lost control of the Senate and the House that year, the Republicans have had ample warning of the gathering storm.
 ''I have been in all these tough races, and the ones in those tough races are doing what they have to do,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House majority leader, who spent all but two days of the August recess campaigning for fellow Republicans. ''It is a difficult environment. I can see us losing a seat or two. But I don't see us losing our majority at all.''
 Representative Rahm Emanuel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, countered, ''The Republicans are playing defense in over 40 races -- one-tenth of the House.'' 
 ''My biggest worry,'' Mr. Emanuel said, ''is getting overpowered from a financial perspective.''
 A turnover in the Senate, which would require the Democrats to pick up six seats, is considered a longer shot. Democrats' greatest hopes rest with Pennsylvania, Montana, Rhode Island, Ohio and Missouri; the sixth seat is more of a leap of faith. 
 It would require Democrats to carry a state like Tennessee, Arizona or Virginia, where Democratic hopes are buoyed as Senator George Allen, a Republican, deals with the fallout from his using a demeaning term for a young man of Indian descent at a rally last month. 
 Democrats must also beat back Republican challenges to Senate seats in Washington, New Jersey, Maryland and Minnesota.
 National polls show that key indicators -- presidential approval ratings, Congressional approval ratings, attitudes on the direction of the country -- reflect an electorate unhappy with the status quo and open to change. 
 ''It's the most difficult off-year cycle for the Republicans since 1982,'' said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma and former chief of staff to the Republican National Committee. ''Environmentally, it's about as good from the Democratic perspective as they could hope to have.''
 In the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, just 29 percent said the country was headed in the right direction, a measure of national pessimism that rivals the 26 percent who felt that way in October 1994. The war in Iraq, the price of gas and a sense of economic unease all play roles, analysts say. The mood is particularly sour in states like Indiana and Ohio, where it is stoked by local issues and the Republican governors' political difficulties.
 Representative Chris Chocola, easily re-elected two years ago from the district centered in South Bend, Ind., is battling a Democrat, Joe Donnelly, in a race so tight that several people offered Mr. Chocola their sympathies on the campaign trail this week. ''You doing O.K.?'' a bank executive asked at a groundbreaking for a small manufacturing company. Mr. Chocola replied, ''It's an exercise in democracy.''
 Mr. Chocola began advertising in March, rather than in May as he has in his three previous races. The attacks and counterattacks have been swift and nasty. In one recent round, the Chocola campaign charged that Mr. Donnelly, who owns a printing and rubber stamp company, had paid his property taxes late 15 times. ''Joe Donnelly wants to raise our taxes,'' the ad warned. ''Even worse, he's delinquent paying his own.''
 Mr. Donnelly's advertisement pointed out that the company Mr. Chocola once ran, which manufactures products for the agricultural industry, had itself missed a tax payment of $67 one year. ''But hypocrisy is normal in Washington,'' the ad said, concluding, ''It's time for a new congressman.'' 
 Outside groups are advertising heavily there, as well: trial lawyers and MoveOn.org against Mr. Chocola, the Chamber of Commerce in his favor.
 Even in such a climate, Republicans retain some formidable institutional advantages to help them hold on, Mr. Cole and others say. After 12 years in control of the House, Republicans have done much to fortify their incumbents, including having district lines so carefully drawn that even in a tumultuous year only about 40 House races are seriously competitive, compared with roughly 100 considered in play in 1994.
 Moreover, Republicans are counting on their vaunted get-out-the-vote campaign, which proved so effective in 2002 and 2004, to overcome what many concede is a less than enthusiastic conservative base. The Republicans are also expected to have a financial edge this fall, although the Democrats have worked hard to narrow it.
 The strategic imperative facing the Republicans, many analysts say, is clear: transform each competitive race from a national referendum on Mr. Bush and one-party Republican rule into a choice between two individuals -- and define the Democratic challengers as unacceptable.
 ''Democrats are trying to indict an entire class of people, who happen to be called Republican candidates for Congress,'' said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster handling dozens of House races. ''We have to bring individual indictments with different cases and different pieces of evidence.'' 
 Mr. Bolger added, ''If you like positive campaigns, you're going to be let down.''
 The question, analysts say, is whether the Republicans' race-by-race strategy can overcome what is shaping up, so far, as a classic midterm election driven by national issues. ''I don't really care what the national climate is,'' said Representative Tom Reynolds of New York, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. ''At the end of the day, House races are a choice between two people.''
 Democrats will be pushing hard to remind voters of the big picture, and their frustrations with it. In southeastern Indiana, Baron Hill, a Democrat who is trying to reclaim the Congressional seat he lost two years ago to Representative Mike Sodrel, held an event at a gas station where he pumped fuel at a 2004 price, $1.80, rather than $2.79. 
 ''People are angry,'' Mr. Hill said. ''They want to know why we're paying $3 a gallon and Congress is giving tax breaks to oilcompanies.'' 
 Another major variable is whether Republicans are able, as they were in 2002 and 2004, to make the national security issue work in their favor. Democratic strategists say they are determined -- this time -- to answer every suggestion that their party and their candidates are less committed to the national defense.
 ''The key on national security: every time they hit us, answer them back strongly and hard,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ''People are not happy with how George Bush conducted the war in Iraq, and they know we're not safer.''
 Over the next four weeks of Congress, beginning on Tuesday, both parties will try to frame the security debate.
 Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority whip, made his party's case on the CBS program ''Face the Nation'' on Sunday. ''We've liberated Afghanistan and Iraq, and by staying on offense we've protected America here at home,'' Mr. McConnell said, acknowledging that the struggle was ''a tough slog.'' But in terms of the ultimate goal of protecting the home front, he said, ''that policy has been a 100 percent success.''
 In the end, Democrats are acutely aware of how close they have come since 1994 to regaining power on Capitol Hill, and how often a majority (218 votes) slipped from their grasp, notably in 2000, when the Republicans held on with just 221 seats. Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, a veteran Republican strategist, said Democrats simply had trouble ''closing the deal.''
 Mr. Emanuel, discussing the widespread predictions that his party would win the House if the election were held today, said simply: ''It isn't today. That's the unfortunate part.''

HEADLINE: An Abolitionist Leads the Way In Unearthing Of Slaves' Past

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

DATELINE: EASTON, Md. 

 BODY:
Except for the archaeologists digging in a grove of trees, the old plantation on the Eastern Shore of Maryland appears to be much the same as it was when the abolitionist Frederick Douglass lived here as a slave child, some 180 years ago.
 The main house has lost none of its ''air of dignity and grandeur'' that Douglass remembered. The long drive from the gate runs through a broad lawn and is still paved with white pebbles that sparkle in the summer sun. The mind's eye pictures carriages arriving at the steps of the two-story Georgian house, with its fresh coat of pale yellow paint.
In the back, there are neat out-buildings that served as wash houses and henhouses, kitchens and stables. Beyond, there are formal gardens, an old greenhouse for growing exotic fruit and, not far away, the family cemetery. A single family, the Lloyds, has owned this land since the 1660's. While the cemetery is filling up, their property has diminished to 1,300 acres, still a substantial spread but down from the 42,000 acres they had owned in three states. 
 The Wye House plantation is a kind of time capsule of the economy and society that dominated much of the antebellum South. All that is missing is the reminder of the human cost that Douglass knew, rose up against and never forgot. 
 The slave quarters have vanished, on the whole a matter of no regret. But for the archaeologists digging on the grounds, the absence is lost history. They are among a steady number of scholars in the South engaged at ground level in reconstructing the culture of slavery in America.
 The search for buried remnants of the dwellings of the African-American slaves has brought archaeologists and their students to the plantation the last two summers, at the invitation of the Lloyd descendants. The project is directed by Mark P. Leone, an archaeology professor at the University of Maryland who has spent much of his career investigating material remains of the gentry and their slaves in Annapolis, Md.
 This was a rare opportunity, Dr. Leone said, to excavate a large Southern plantation that has been in the hands of the same family for more than 340 years. That may have helped preserve the buried history.
 ''We're unearthing historic and scientific treasure,'' Dr. Leone said, citing the discovery of three and possibly four sites of building foundations and a variety of humble household goods, including thimbles and buttons, spoons and eating knives, ceramics and leftover bones from meals the people ate.
 Standing under a tulip poplar at one of the excavation pits, Lisa Kraus said she was also digging into the largely unexamined Lloyd family journals, letters and ledgers at the Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore. She is a graduate student at the University of Texas, Austin, preparing a doctoral dissertation on the plantation's slave society.
 ''Very few Southern farms have this kind of knowledge at hand -- a Frederick Douglass or these archives,'' Ms. Kraus said. Nodding toward the estate house, she added, ''Or a Mrs. Tilghman.''
 Mary S. Tilghman, an 87-year-old widow, is the 11th-generation owner of the property. Her stories, passed down from early times, are ''a source of primary information'' for the project, Ms. Kraus said.
 Seated in the south parlor amid portraits of departed kin, Mrs. Tilghman said she and her older son and heir, Richard, fully approved of the excavations. 
 ''I am really fascinated by anything I can find out about the place,'' she said.
 Asked if it made her uncomfortable to think the project would call attention to the family's slaveholding past, Mrs. Tilghman replied, ''Slavery wasn't invented by colonial Americans, and we don't think it was good, but it was there.''
 The archaeologists started their research with a hand-drawn map from 1784 and the autobiographical writings of Douglass, the eloquent champion of freedom for slaves who was a presidential adviser to Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War.
 Douglass lived on the plantation as a boy of 7 and 8 in the 1820's, and the experience made a lasting impression. He wrote of the grinding poverty and hopelessness, the ''whippings and savage mutilation of slaves'' and the cruel overseer who was ''judge, jury, advocate and executioner.'' It was here, he said, that he first understood that he was a slave and what that meant.
 His vivid descriptions set the slave quarters on what was called the ''long green,'' which ran from near the main house down to the river. A two-story brick dwelling was surrounded by a community of huts, work sheds and a crowded, rough-hewn dormitory known as the ''long quarter.''
 The entire quarters disappeared more than a century ago, leaving all traces of the building ruins buried and overgrown with brush and trees. Ms. Kraus, whose previous experience included excavations of George Washington's distillery at Mount Vernon, in Virginia, said the archaeologists relied on the map and the Douglass writings to orient their excavations.
 One of their first test trenches uncovered foundation bricks, possibly remains of the two-story brick dwelling Douglass described. A huge poplar grows out of the building site, forcing student excavators to dig gingerly around and under the tree roots. They found household goods from the 18th and early 19th centuries.
 ''In slavery, the line between work and home life was very blurry,'' Ms. Kraus said. ''Some lived in their workshops, but this is just a dwelling. We can tell by the artifacts.''
 Steps away, archaeologists have exposed a line of bricks, probably the foundation for a wooden building from the 18th century. Buried in the sediment were pipe stems, broken window glass, some pieces of carriage equipment.
 ''We're not sure what to make of this site,'' Ms. Kraus said. ''Some sort of shop, perhaps.''
 Closer to the river, a crew of students supervised by Michael Gubisch, a recent Maryland anthropology graduate, was digging around a brick wall that had been recently exposed. This was presumably the carpentry shop marked on the map at about this spot. Some iron tools were found, and charcoal in the soil suggested that the shop met its end by fire.
 ''We are finding evidence of intensive occupation through this entire area,'' Ms. Kraus said.
 Archaeologists plan to return next summer for the project's final season, and Ms. Kraus is continuing her examination of the family records, which has its emotional moments.
 ''You read Douglass about someone being sick, about aunts and grandmothers and families,'' Ms. Kraus said. ''Then in the archives you read their names, and they are listed in the inventory along with hogs, cattle, horses, plows and other property.'' 
 Ms. Kraus said she had found Douglass to be a reliable witness. The one building still standing on a knoll at the edge of the slave quarters appears almost exactly as Douglass remembered it. This is the red cottage believed to be where the feared overseer lived and kept watch on the slave population of close to 1,000 in flush times.
 Douglass wrote of the overseer and the mornings when the horn called workers to the fields. ''Woe betides them who hear not this morning summons,'' he said, for the overseer used to stand by the door of the long quarter, armed with a hickory stick and ready to whip anyone lagging behind.
 While excavators worked the shallow pits, the still of the hot afternoon was broken by a noisy mowing machine driven by a caretaker. Machines have mostly replaced manual laborers, white or black.
 Mrs. Tilghman said African-Americans in nearby communities, some of them descendants of the plantation slaves, used to work the fields at planting and harvest. ''But that is a thing of the past,'' she said. ''Two men with machines, the big stuff, can do all the work.''
 Dr. Leone called attention to another change: the trees growing where the slaves had lived. 
 During slavery, Dr. Leone said, the quarter was cleared of all trees so that everything and everyone were always in clear view from the estate house, the overseer's cottage and the wharves.
 ''Lines of sight and the fear of being watched, coupled with violence, were the techniques of slave governance,'' he said.
 After Emancipation in 1863, many of the former slaves settled outside the plantation in the new villages of Unionville and Coppertown. The archaeologists said they had consulted their descendants in planning the project, asking what they would like to know about the place where their forebears lived in bondage. Ms. Kraus has described results of the excavations at periodic meetings at St. Stephens A.M.E. Church in Unionville.
 ''What have archaeology and history done for African-Americans? Not much,'' Ms. Kraus said. ''We are working in places like Unionville to get the people identifying with our research as a part of retrieving their lost history.''
 It was a history that motivated Douglass to fight for the end of slavery. After two years here, he was sent to work in Baltimore and eventually escaped to New York and freedom. He returned later to Wye House under more favorable circumstances.
 ''My grandfather remembered, as a young man, when Douglass came here after the war,'' Mrs. Tilghman said. ''They had drinks and food out on the porch, a fine time.''
 Even though the visit could not wipe the slate clean, it left Douglass with warmer thoughts of the old plantation. 
 ''To say that our reception was every way gratifying,'' he wrote, ''is but a feeble expression of the feeling.''

HEADLINE: Europe, Asia and Latin Markets Reach 3-Month Highs 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Shares in Europe, Asia and Latin America climbed to three-month highs as investors bet economies and earnings would keep growing even as interest rates rise.
 ''Expectations that further interest rate increases won't be aggressive and some economic data that point to a moderate, rather than an abrupt slowdown, are giving support to stocks,'' said Jordi Padilla, director of equities at Atlas Capital in Madrid, which manages about $1.2 billion.
Siemens, Europe's biggest engineering company, and Dentsu, Japan's largest advertising agency, paced gains by companies most reliant on economic expansion for profits. Rio Tinto Group led mining companies higher as copper rose in London. 
 The Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index, a measure for equities worldwide, added 0.6 percent, to 1,373.02. Markets in the United States and Canada were closed for Labor Day.
 The Dow Jones Stoxx600 Index in Europe added 0.4 percent, to 337.80, the highest since May 11. The OMX Stockholm 30 Index in Sweden gained the most in western Europe as Atlas Copco and Sandvik advanced.
 The IBEX 35 Index in Spain reached a level not seen since March 2000, and the Swiss Market Index climbed to a six-year high.
 The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index rallied 1.8 percent, to 131.66, closing at the highest since May 19. The Nikkei 225 average in Japan added 1.4 percent, to 16,358.07. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong ended at the highest in six years.
 The MSCI Latin America Index climbed 1.7 percent, to 2,539.53, its highest since May 16. The Bovespa in Brazil added 1 percent, to 37,693.35, on top of a 3 percent increase the previous session. The Bolsa in Mexico gained 0.9 percent.
 The MSCI World index is set for its sixth consecutive advance, the longest winning streak since April 21. Job growth in the United States picked up in August, while wage increases slowed, government reports showed last week.
 The data eased concern that the economic prospects would deteriorate after two years of rate increases by the Federal Reserve. The Fed kept the benchmark interest rate at 5.25 percent on Aug. 8 after 17 consecutive increases aimed at stemming inflation.
 The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan also left rates unchanged last month.
 ''We don't think a recession is just around the corner,'' said Simon King, who helps oversee $3.8 billion at Gartmore Investment Management in London. ''Large parts of the investment community are too bearish on the outlook for global stock markets.''
 Siemens, based in Munich, added 1.9 percent, to 67.96 euros ($87.27). Dentsu, based in Tokyo, advanced 3.3 percent, to 344,000 yen ($2,853.71).
 Atlas Copco, a maker of air compressors, rose 2.7 percent, to 193 kronor ($25.56). Sandvik, a maker of metal-cutting tools, climbed 2.8 percent, to 82 kronor ($11.28).
 Komatsu paced gains by Japanese equipment makers after a government report showed that companies in Japan, Asia's biggest economy, increased investment last quarter at the fastest pace in almost five years.
 Komatsu, a maker of earth-moving equipment, advanced 1.1 percent, to 2,230 yen ($19.05). Fanuc, a maker of factory robots, added 3.6 percent, to 9,760 yen ($83.39).
 The MSCI World Industrials Index rose 0.9 percent, the second-biggest gain among 10 industry groups. The measure, which tracks raw-materials producers, climbed the most, with a 1.2 percent advance.
 Rio Tinto, a mining company, gained 3.4 percent, to 2,775 pence ($440.21) in London. Another mining company, BHP Billiton, rose 2.8 percent to 1,035 pence ($86.25), also in London.
 Copper for three-month delivery climbed 0.8 percent on the London Metal Exchange on speculation that producers of wires and pipes in China, the world's largest consumer of the metal, would resume purchases to replenish falling stockpiles.
 KGHM Polska Miedz, which mines more copper in Europe than any other company, jumped 6.1 percent, to 113.9 zlotys ($36.86). The gain sent the WIG20 Index in Poland 3.9 percent higher, the biggest move among markets included in global benchmarks.
 The MSCI measure for emerging Europe, Middle East and Africa gained 1.6 percent, to 327.41. FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index in South Africa rose to a record.

HEADLINE: Cardiologists Question the Risks in Using Drug-Coated Stents

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain, Sept. 4 

 BODY:
The booming market for drug-coated stents is encountering questions from heart specialists about the devices' long-term safety.
 Controversy about the tiny, wire-mesh tubes used to prop open clogged arteries has been fueled by studies being discussed at the World Congress of Cardiology here, with suggestions that they carry a higher risk of potentially fatal blood clots than older, bare-metal stents. 
Drug-coated stents are now used in more than 90 percent of procedures in advanced economies like the United States and Switzerland. But some cardiologists say they will be more cautious about their use in the future.
 Dr. Gabriel Steg, of the Bichat-Claude Bernard hospital in Paris, said on Monday that ''it raises the flag of caution over the indiscriminate use of first-generation, drug-eluting stents and reminds us that we should stick with tested indications and not overextend this to any patient.'' 
 Dr. Steg was an author of a Swiss study underlining the risks of coated stents. He also heads the public relations committee of the European Society of Cardiology, one of the sponsors of the congress, which opened Saturday and runs through Wednesday.
 Dr. Christoph Kaiser of University Hospital in Basel, Switzerland, an early critic of the value of drug-coated stents, said new evidence from an 18-month patient follow-up program suggested that they might be worthwhile in just one of three cases.
 Dr. Steven Nissen, head of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, described the new findings as ''potentially explosive.'' He said that there was already a modest shift back to bare-metal stents in American hospitals and predicted that more doctors would take a conservative approach, awaiting definitive data.
 ''If there's a suspicion, why take the risk?'' Dr. Nissen said. ''If this is true, I would recommend more selective use of drug-eluting stents, and I would recommend consideration for longer-term use'' of blood-thinning agents.
 Other doctors said the issue would not necessarily change clinical practice right away, but most agreed on the need for large, long-term studies to establish the facts.
 Nearly six million patients worldwide have received coated, or drug-eluting, stents in recent years, and the market is estimated at more than $5 billion a year. Coated stents cost around three times as much as bare-metal ones.
 The market leaders are the Taxus stent made by Boston Scientific and Cypher from Johnson & Johnson.
 Johnson & Johnson, whose product fared worst in the Swiss analysis, said that its own database did not show any clear safety signals and that it submitted all its latest data to the Food and Drug Administration last week. The agency is now in a ''data-finding mode'' on the matter, said Denis Donohue, vice president for clinical and regulatory affairs at Johnson & Johnson's Cordis device unit.
 How the regulators will respond is unclear. But one change could be amended guidance on the use of blood-thinning drugs after coated stents are implanted.
 Drug-coated stents have gained in use because they prevent arterial scarring after implantation, which may cause arteries to narrow again.

HEADLINE: To Give Children an Edge, Au Pairs From China

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
In a conference room at a Holiday Inn last week in Connecticut, 167 young women from 22 countries received a tutorial in catering to the needs of the affluent American child. (Lesson 1: Turn off the television set.) 
 Many of the women were German. But two drew particular attention, Kunyi Li, 23, and Man Zhang, 24, among the first au pairs from China. 
Their services are in great demand, in part because so many Americans have adopted baby girls from China. Driving the need more aggressively is the desire among ambitious parents to ensure their children's worldliness, as such parents assume that China's expanding influence will make Mandarin the sophisticates' language decades hence. 
 ''Our clientele is middle and upper middle class,'' said William L. Gertz, chairman of the American Institute for Foreign Study, which oversees Au Pair in America. ''They see something really happening, and they don't want to be left behind.''
 The last two years have seen an astonishing increase in the number of American parents wishing to employ Mandarin-speaking nannies, difficult to find here and even harder to obtain from China. 
 Au Pair in America, the 20-year-old agency that sponsored the two young women in Connecticut, had received no requests for Chinese au pairs until 2004, said Ruth Ferry, the program director.
 Since then, it has had 1,400. 
 The agency said it expected to bring 200 more au pairs to this country before the end of 2007, and other companies in the business are beginning to recruit in China, all taking advantage of relaxed standards for cultural-exchange visas for Chinese. 
 Hongbin Yu, 23, of Harbin, north of Beijing, who like many other Chinese college students studying English gave herself an Anglophone name, Cecilia, was the first Chinese au pair to land in the United States.
 She arrived in March through Go Au Pair, one of the 11 such agencies sanctioned by the Office of Exchange Coordination and Designation at the State Department.
 Her employer is Joan Friend, a former president of a technology company in northern California who had been having her two children, Jim, 5, and Paris, 6, tutored in Mandarin for several years. 
 ''The tutors just played with them,'' Ms. Friend said from her house in Carmel Valley, Calif. ''They thought I was crazy because the children were so young.'' 
 After her son and daughter began to learn the sounds of Mandarin, Ms. Friend sought more intensive training and repeatedly asked Go Au Pair for a Mandarin speaker to live with the family. But visa problems and a lack of contacts in China left the agency unable to place anyone with her. 
 Ultimately, Ms. Friend found Ms. Yu on her own, through an acquaintance in China, and Go Au Pair handled the paperwork.
 ''I've never been to China,'' said Ms. Friend, a single mother who is retired. 
 She added that she considered China central to the future of global economics, saying, ''I think China will rule the banking world in my children's lifetime, and I want them to be able to participate in that if they want to.''
 Like Ms. Friend, Jean Lucas, who lives outside Tampa, Fla., had been frustrated in finding a Chinese au pair for her four children. She is now obtaining one through Au Pair in America who will arrive in a few weeks. 
 Ms. Lucas said her husband, Sky, a manager of a hedge fund, initiated the search because he did not want to raise culturally narcissistic, monolingual children. 
 ''My husband had been following China for some time,'' Ms. Lucas said, ''and he simply believes that it would be better for international relations if we all put some time and effort into learning Chinese. I'm not expecting this girl to come in and lecture. My children wouldn't put up with that. But I want them to have an introduction, and I want it to be fun.'' 
 Since she has been with the Friends, Ms. Yu, who studied English and tourism in college in China, has been reading to the children in Mandarin and teaching them to count. In turn, Ms. Friend, in addition to paying her expenses and a monthly stipend, has taken her on trips to Arizona, San Francisco and farther down the coast to Newport Beach.
 Begun in 1986, the State Department Au Pair program requires that young nannies work no more than 45 hours a week and return to their home countries after one year. Host families have to provide their charges with a window into the American experience. It is only in the last few years that au pairs have been actively recruited outside Western Europe.
 Among Chinese-Americans, it is difficult to come upon young women interested in child-care careers, nanny agency representatives say. 
 ''This is not a field they evolve into,'' Amy Hardison, founder of Nanny on the Net, said. ''We just have a very hard time finding Chinese nannies.''
 In China's new culturally progressive climate, biases against such domestic work prevail. Ms. Zhang, one of the au pairs who arrived last week and moved in with a family in New Hampshire, said her parents had initially disapproved of her decision, especially because she was then working in customer service for Continental Airlines in Beijing.
 ''There are prejudices about being a baby sitter,'' she remarked. ''They said: 'You have a great job coming out of college. Why would you want to go to America to take care of children?' '' 
 It is Ms. Zhang's hope to open a nursery school in China. And she would like to immerse herself more deeply in American culture, she said, beyond the knowledge she has acquired of it from watching ''Friends.''
 As for American cooking, she foresees it as a challenge.
 ''I don't hate it but I don't like it,'' she offered. ''I had pizza yesterday. It's better at home.''

HEADLINE: Sudan Gives African Union an Ultimatum

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: KEBKABIYA, Sudan, Sept. 4 

 BODY:
The Sudanese government delivered an ultimatum on Monday to the African Union force trying to monitor a shaky peace deal in Darfur, telling it to extend its mandate without handing off to the United Nations or pack up and leave by the end of the month. 
 Noureddine Mezni, spokesman for the African force in Sudan, said the Sudanese government had given the African Union one week to decide whether to accept a proposal to pay for its peacekeeping mission with money raised by the Arab League instead of turning over command to the United Nations. 
''They asked that we clarify our position,'' Mr. Mezni said. ''We have one week.''
 The move appeared intended to stymie a Security Council resolution, passed last week, calling for a United Nations peacekeeping force of more than 20,000 troops and police officers to take over from the beleaguered African Union force in Darfur. 
 Mustafa Osman Ismail, a top adviser to Sudan's president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, told reporters in Khartoum, ''Sudan will not accept those troops to be transformed into part of a U.N. force.'' 
 The demand that the African Union choose between leaving or accepting a continuation of its mission on Sudan's terms is the latest development in the showdown between Sudan and much of the rest of the world over the bloodshed that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and pushed more than 2.5 million from their homes in Darfur.
 The African force is poorly equipped, has a weak mandate to protect civilians and just 7,000 troops to cover an area the size of France. It is nearly out of money, and its backers, mostly the United States and the European Union, have refused to keep supporting it, preferring a United Nations force. The African Union has repeatedly said that it, too, wishes to turn over the reins to the United Nations. 
 But Sudan has firmly rejected the Security Council resolution, proposing instead using more than 10,000 of its own troops to pacify Darfur -- a plan many aid officials, diplomats and human rights workers say could lead to vast new killing and displacement. To keep the African Union force in place, it proposes using money donated by the Arab League. 
 But the commander of the African forces in Darfur, Gen. Collins Ihekire, said in an interview last week that accepting the money would leave the African Union hopelessly compromised. 
 ''It could become a kind of blackmail,'' General Ihekire said. ''The viability of the force would depend on the charity of Sudan and its friends.'' 
 Darfur has slid deeper into chaos in the past three months, as a peace agreement to end the conflict between the Arab-dominated central government and non-Arab rebels seeking greater autonomy and wealth for the region has faltered. 
 Only one rebel faction signed the agreement, and those who rejected it have formed a new alliance to fight those who did sign. The government, under the guise of enforcing the peace agreement, has begun a military campaign against rebel groups in Northern Darfur, massing thousands of troops in El Fasher, the provincial capital, to prepare for fresh attacks. 
 Attacks on aid workers have cut off hundreds of thousands of people from food, water, shelter and health care provided by relief agencies across Darfur, and government attacks could put still more people out of reach. The International Rescue Committee said Monday that a nurse at one of its clinics had been killed in a government attack. A dozen aid workers have been killed in Darfur since May, more than in the entire conflict up until then. 
 The African Union force is supposed to oversee the peace agreement, but its role has been thrown into confusion as rebel groups have refused to join the accord and have formed new alliances to fight the government and its allied Arab militias, known as the janjaweed. 
 Pressed by Sudan, the African Union expelled cease-fire monitors who were members of the rebel groups that did not sign from its bases, a move that many rebel leaders interpreted as evidence that the Union was biased against them. The government says it is bound only by the cease-fire in the new peace agreement, not an old cease-fire signed by all parties in 2004 in Chad. The rebels reject the peace agreement but say the old cease-fire is still in effect. 
 The result has been that there is essentially no cease-fire left to monitor. ''We don't have any cease-fire that all the parties agree on, so how can we monitor a cease-fire?'' General Ihekire said. 
 Here in Kebkabiya, a government-controlled town in Northern Darfur where fighting between rebels and Arab militias has convulsed repeatedly, morale was low among the African Union soldiers charged with keeping the peace. 
 ''We don't have freedom of movement,'' said one officer who has served in several peacekeeping missions. ''We are just stuck in the camp.'' He asked not to be identified by name because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. 
 ''I get paid $90 a day for doing nothing,'' he said. ''What is the point of us being here? We should save the African Union's money and just go back home.''

HEADLINE: It Was Fun While It Lasted

 BODY:
With economic signals flashing that the housing boom is over, speculation has now turned to how deep the slump will be and how long it will last, with predictions ranging from a smooth descent to a tooth-rattling plunge. Come what may, conventional wisdom holds that as long as you don't plan to sell your house any time soon, you'll be OK. The downturn is unlikely to wipe out all of your accumulated gains -- the thinking goes -- so you can cash in later. 
 Or can you?
The downturn in housing is overlapping with the retirement of the baby boom generation, which starts officially in 2008, when the first of 77 million boomers become eligible for Social Security. Most of them are homeowners, and many of them will presumably want to sell their homes, extracting some cash for retirement in the process. Theoretically, that implies a glut of houses for sale, which would surely mitigate an upturn in prices, and could drive them ever lower. The result would be less housing wealth for everyone and less to live on for those who had planned to retire on the house. 
 Still, no one can be sure what will happen. Economists agree that the retirement of the baby boom generation will influence housing prices, but differ over how powerful the effect will be. But one thing is reasonably certain. The question would not be such a burning one if Americans, especially those near retirement, had adequate savings to see them through. Even before the personal savings rate went negative last year, Americans were meager savers.
 The housing bust may be what it takes to reverse that. Even a shift from profligacy to thrift would not be entirely good news, however. For an economy based on consumption, the change to less free-spending ways could be excruciating. 
 The house party is over, but we don't yet know how bad the hangover is going to be.

HEADLINE: The Lost Children of Haiti 

 BODY:
Haiti, founded two centuries ago by ex-slaves who fought to regain their freedom, has again become a hub of human trafficking. 
 Today, tens of thousands of Haitian children live lives of modern-day bondage. Under the system known as ''restavek,'' a Creole word meaning ''stay with,'' these children work for wealthier families in exchange for education and shelter. They frequently end up cruelly overworked, physically or sexually abused, and without access to education. 
The most effective way to root out this deeply oppressive but deeply ingrained system would be to attack the conditions that sustain it -- chiefly, impoverished, environmentally unsustainable agriculture and a severe shortage of rural schools. 
 This is an area in which America can and should help. Washington has been quick to respond to political turmoil in Haiti, with its accompanying fears of uncontrollable refugee flows. But the frenzied flurries of international crisis management that follow typically leave no lasting results.
 A wiser, more promising alternative would be to help create long-term economic options by improving access to schools and creating sustainable agriculture. Meanwhile, the United States should work with nongovernmental organizations to battle the resigned acceptance by many Haitians of the restavek system. They could, for example, help local radio stations broadcast programs of open dialogue about how damaging the system is, and include restavek survivors or human-rights experts.
 The primary responsibility for eliminating the restavek system lies with the Haitian people and their government. After years of political crisis, there is a new democratically elected government. Eradicating the restavek system should be one of its top priorities, combining law enforcement efforts with attacks on the root social and economic causes. 
 The former slaves who won Haiti's freedom 200 years ago dreamed of something better for their children than restavek bondage. The time is overdue for helping those dreams become reality.

HEADLINE: White House on Hunt for a Medicare Chief

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4 

 BODY:
The White House began searching Monday for someone to run Medicare and Medicaid, in the expectation that the current chief, Dr. Mark B. McClellan, would soon resign. 
 The Dallas Morning News reported over the weekend that Dr. McClellan was set to leave. Administration officials did not dispute the report. But they said they were not ready to make a formal announcement because a departure date had not been set and no one had been chosen to supervise Medicare and Medicaid on even a temporary basis.
 Leslie V. Norwalk, the deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is an obvious candidate to serve as acting administrator, though other officials are also under consideration, said a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because a decision had not been made. 
 Assuming that Dr. McClellan leaves soon, it would come amid the midterm election campaigns, during which his handling of the new Medicare drug benefit has become an issue. It would also come during contract negotiations between Medicare and private health insurance companies that want to offer the drug benefit in 2007.
 President Bush and Republicans in Congress say the drug benefit has been a success, sharply reducing drug costs for millions of older Americans and the disabled. 
 More than 8 in 10 people who are enrolled in a Medicare drug plan say they are satisfied with it, although almost 2 in 10 say they have encountered major problems, according to a survey conducted in June by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research group.
 Democrats say the drug benefit got off to a rocky start in January and is still plagued by inexplicable problems, like Medicare's mistakenly refunding premiums to 230,000 beneficiaries in August. 
 Colleagues refer to Dr. McClellan as ''doctor-doctor'' because he is a medical doctor and has a Ph.D. in economics. They say he has also been valuable to the administration as a spokesman, rebutting criticism of its health policies. 
 Dr. McClellan did not fully heed warnings about problems in the first weeks of the new drug plan. At the time, tens of thousands of low-income Medicare beneficiaries were overcharged for prescription drugs, and some were turned away from pharmacies without getting their medications. In January and February, many states took emergency action to protect their citizens. 
 Since then, Dr. McClellan has said he is on a mission to ''find and fix any problems that beneficiaries may have'' with the drug benefit. 
 On Jan. 1, drug coverage for more than six million low-income people was switched to Medicare from Medicaid. Dr. McClellan had promised ''a seamless transition,'' but the change was chaotic, as predicted by state Medicaid officials and by the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress.
 Robert M. Hayes, president of the Medicare Rights Center, a counseling and advocacy group, said the transition was ''a dark moment'' in Dr. McClellan's tenure. 
 ''He was always on message,'' Mr. Hayes said. ''He said the new program was running fine when the roof was caving in. But I do respect him. He was responsive when we brought individual cases of hardship to his attention.''
 Dr. McClellan would leave a big piece of unfinished business. Congress reconvenes this week, and lawmakers are desperately seeking a way to avert a cut in Medicare payments to doctors, scheduled to take effect Jan. 1 under current law. 
 Dr. McClellan said recently that physician payments would be cut 5.1 percent in 2007, with similar cuts in later years, if Congress took no action. The cuts, he said, are required because spending on doctors' services has repeatedly exceeded annual goals set by a statutory formula. 
 The American Medical Association says such cuts would hurt beneficiaries because many doctors might be less willing to accept new Medicare patients. 
 Dr. McClellan has been cautious about discussing job plans with outsiders, partly because his predecessor, Thomas A. Scully, was criticized for negotiating jobs with potential employers while still running Medicare. Mr. Scully had received an ethics waiver, but the White House later told agencies they could not grant such waivers unless they consulted the president's lawyers.

HEADLINE: A Little Learning Is an Expensive Thing

BYLINE: By William M. Chace. 
William M. Chace, a former president of Emory and Wesleyan Universities, is the author of ''100 Semesters: My Adventures as Student, Professor and University President, and What I Learned Along the Way.''

DATELINE: Palo Alto, Calif. 

 BODY:
When I was a college president, I was never able to give incoming freshmen the honest talk I wanted to. But had I done so, here's what I would have said:
 HELLO to you first-year students. I'm Laudable's president. The next time we'll see each other is when you graduate.
Most likely, that won't be in four years, but in about 55 months. That's because a good many of you won't finish on time. And, because college presidents last only about six years and I've already been on campus for two, perhaps I won't even be here. 
 I know you're worried about money. I'm not telling you or your folks anything new when I say that Laudable looks expensive. The tuition increases here, just like those of our competitors, have outstripped the rate of increase in the consumer price index for years. This fall, tuition, room and board averages almost $32,000 at Laudable and other private colleges, and more than $15,000 at public ones. 
 But hold on. Most of you and your parents don't pay for everything yourselves. In public four-year institutions, some 4 in 10 undergraduates get financial aid. At private places like Laudable, more than 80 percent of you do. Just like the auto industry, we have a sticker price and we have the price people really pay. 
 And like car dealers, we force you to borrow money to help make up the difference. You will probably owe more than $20,000, on average, when you leave Laudable. Graduates of public institutions will owe, on average, more than $15,000. 
 How will many of you begin your adult lives? 
 In serious debt. 
 We certainly take a lot of your money. But we ship money back to you. How much? This year, Laudable will spend more than $41,000 to educate each of you. At public institutions, it will be more than $31,000 per student. Some schools have huge endowments that help them generate the money they need to educate you (Harvard has more than $26 billion to count on). But most schools are like Laudable: we need your tuition dollars. Bottom line: money in and money out.
 Laudable could be cheaper, but you wouldn't like it. You and your parents have made it clear that you want the best. That means more spacious and comfortable student residences (''dormitories,'' we used to call them), gyms with professional exercise equipment, better food of all kinds, more counselors to attend to your growing emotional needs, more high-tech classrooms and campuses that are spectacularly handsome. 
 Our competitors provide such things, so we do too. We compete for everything: faculty, students, research dollars and prestige. The more you want us to give to you, the more we will be asking you to give to us. We aim to please, and that will cost you. It's been a long time since scholarship and teaching were carried on in monastic surroundings.
 Laudable's surroundings, by the way, will remind you of where you came from. That's because your financial circumstances are pretty much the same as those of your classmates. More expensive schools have students from wealthier parents; less expensive schools draw students from families with fewer financial resources. More than half of the freshmen at selective colleges, public and private, come from the highest-earning quarter of households. Tell me the ZIP code and I'll tell you what kind of college a high-school graduate most likely attends. 
 After paying (and receiving) all this money, please finish up and get out. Colleges like Laudable are escalators; even if you stand still, they will move you upward toward greater economic opportunity. Once you leave us, you'll have a better chance for a good job and a way to pay off your debt and to give us more money when we call on you as alumni. 
 So don't flunk out; you've got too much invested in us, and we have too much invested in you.
 As for the way Laudable spends its money, I can assure you that your professors aren't overpaid. But I am. I take home more money at Laudable than anyone else (save some of the clinical physicians over at our hospital and several coaches). My pay is about five times greater than an average faculty member's. That's because I'm thought of as the chief executive of the university and chief executives get paid a lot in America. 
 But I know I'm not really a chief executive because I don't hold that kind of executive power. The professors here are Laudable's most important asset, and they, not I, are the ones who run the show (just ask Larry Summers). Laudable could save some money by paying me less.
 I welcome you all -- those of you who will heed my advice, and those who will waste their dollars and ours. Whatever, count yourself lucky. Now you know about the money. See you, maybe, in 55 months.

HEADLINE: Baseball Without Strikes? Talks Could Make It Happen

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
PROBABLY the biggest surprise in all of the years I have written about baseball was not the Red Sox' comeback against the Yankees in the 2004 postseason, or the Diamondbacks' victory over the Yankees in the ninth inning of Game 7 of the 2001 World Series, or the home run records of Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds and then the revelation that those records might have been chemically aided.
 No, the biggest surprise occurred off the field just before Labor Day in 2002, when appropriately enough, Major League Baseball and the players union reached agreement on a labor contract without engaging in a work stoppage. 
In the previous 30 years, eight sets of negotiations were punctuated by walkouts or lockouts. The players set a strike date in 2002, but hours before the designated time, they reached agreement with the owners, and the games went on.
 Four years later, the two sides are negotiating again for a new labor agreement, and I have promised myself I will not be surprised this time if they successfully conclude their talks without a strike or a lockout.
 Negotiators for the commissioner's office and the union have been meeting regularly since early in the season. You have not read much, if anything, about the talks because the negotiators aren't talking. They aren't talking, that is, to the news media. They decided that silence gave them their best shot at completing an agreement.
 Rob Manfred, baseball's chief labor executive, and Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, reiterated their silence over the weekend, declining to answer questions or to provide even bits of information.
 Despite their silence, we know they are not on the verge of reaching an agreement. But this time it would be surprising if there was any kind of labor stoppage. That is not to say they will have a deal by the end of the World Series or even by Dec. 19, the date the existing agreement expires.
 The atmosphere, however, is conducive for negotiations. The relationship between the two sides is better than ever, and the game's economics give the sides reason to continue living in peace. Attendance, revenue and the number of postseason contenders keep going up.
 With seemingly all of North America in contention for the National League wild card, as General Manager John Schuerholz of the Atlanta Braves has said, baseball cannot complain about competitive balance.
 Negotiators are scheduled to meet this week to discuss, among other topics, proposals on revenue sharing. This was the central issue of the 2002 negotiations; it didn't create a crisis then, and it doesn't figure to do so now. In fact, there may be greater disagreement among the clubs than between the clubs and the players.
 Some of the teams that pay into the revenue-sharing fund have complained that the recipients of the fund have become complacent with that status, doing little to try to increase their revenue. 
 Why should they work to increase their revenue, the thinking supposedly goes, when they would only be elevating their economic position to where they would have to pay money into the fund instead of receiving payments from it?
 Critics of the existing formula would like to see a system that rewards and penalizes teams depending on the growth or lack of growth of their revenue.
 There is also a struggle going on between middle-revenue and low-revenue clubs. The middle-revenue clubs emerged from the 2002 negotiations with a greater percentage of revenue-sharing proceeds than the low-revenue clubs, and the poorer teams want to regain some of the money they lost.
 The union, of course, has a stake in the revenue-sharing formula because that's the money that clubs have or don't have to pay players. If clubs put revenue-sharing money in their pockets, players don't benefit. 
 The Yankees aren't in the middle or the bottom groups, but they have their own interests to protect. Last year, they put $77 million into the revenue-sharing pot and paid another $34 million in luxury tax on their $213 million competitive-balance payroll. That comes to $324 million, a steep price to pay for playing baseball.
 The Yankees, their critics point out, don't have to spend that much money; all they have to do is lower their payroll. The Yankees, however, note that their revenue is as high as it is because of the team they have spent lavishly to put together.
 In addition, the union likes the way the Yankees spend because it forces other teams to spend more and influences the salaries that still other teams have to pay.
 Barring some totally unexpected development, the union and the clubs will reach an agreement that will include some tinkering with revenue sharing and the luxury tax. The agreement will also very likely eliminate draft-choice compensation for lost free agents.
 In 2002, the two sides had agreed to eliminate compensation in return for some changes in the annual June draft, but the agreement fell apart in the last-minute drafting of language. Four years later, they will presumably not leave the language to the last minute.
 The 2002 deal was surprising because it left a void for those of us who had become accustomed to writing about work stoppages. It's as if the entire season were played, and suddenly there was no World Series. 
 Not that I wanted to see baseball shut down (despite the view of Stan Kasten, then president of the Braves and now president of the Washington Nationals, that I rooted for ''the forces of instability''). But a strike was the next logical step, and I was prepared for it. Remarkably enough, though, I might have covered my last strike.

HEADLINE: Drug Piracy: A Wave of Counterfeit Medicines Washes Over Russia

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 4 

 BODY:
Time and again, Dr. Boris A. Merkeshkin pricked his patients' arms with a needle and injected a drug intended to ease cardiovascular ailments. He did it for six months earlier this year and his patients recovered smoothly. 
 They may not be so lucky next time. Dr. Merkeshkin, the chief physician at a large research hospital in Siberia, and his colleagues had unknowingly administered roughly 3,000 doses of fake Cavinton. The drug, made in its genuine form by Gedeon Richter of Hungary, is one of the more common counterfeit pharmaceuticals circulating in Russia, according to the police.
Dr. Merkeshkin said he was grateful that the substitute medicine was similar to the intended one and did no harm to the patients. ''If that were not the case, we would have a tragedy,'' he said.
 Russians, already adept at burning pirated DVD's, rolling their own Marlboro cigarettes and printing knockoff Nike T-shirts, have turned to the more delicate art of making fake prescription medicine. Counterfeit prescription drugs are proliferating in Russia, and in many other countries, according to industry experts and the Food and Drug Administration. 
 They say fake drugs are also being smuggled to Europe and the United States, the world's most lucrative prescription drug market, though so far in smaller amounts.
 So far, the biggest problem presented by the fake drugs is violation of intellectual property rights, cutting into the profits of pharmaceutical companies. There do not appear to have been major injuries from the drugs, many of which are similar in makeup to the drugs they mimic. 
 Drug counterfeiting is different from the production of low-cost medicines. Some developing countries, as part of a principled stance in a broader public health debate, will allow their manufacturers to make certain generic medicines, for example, for AIDS patients, without paying license holders. 
 Counterfeiters, in contrast, operate illegally for profit, and the contents of the fake drugs can be different from the originals. 
 The variety of fakes range from crude mixtures of glue, chalk and sugar to nearly exact chemical replicas of complex pharmaceuticals, like Lipitor by Pfizer or the anti-impotence pill Viagra, both of which have been the targets of anticounterfeiting prosecutions.
 Counterfeiters operate in India, China and elsewhere. Russia's underground prescription medicine market is distinguished for being at the forefront of a new trend of exceedingly high-quality fakes. 
 Indeed, private investigators from Pfizer surveying the Russian market found fakes that were, by the company's own admission, of exceptional quality. 
 ''The counterfeits we got in the survey were the finest counterfeits I've ever seen,'' John Theriault, vice president for global security at Pfizer and a former F.B.I. agent, said in a telephone interview. ''The stuff we saw in the Russian market wasn't made in a garage. We don't know where it was made.''
 If they are good enough, doctors and patients there may not suspect or notice they are using fakes any more than their Russian counterparts. 
 ''If the product looks like American product, how do you know where it came from?'' he said. In a statement to Congress in July, the F.D.A.'s associate commissioner for policy and planning, Randall W. Lutter, said the quantity of counterfeit prescription drugs intercepted by customs officials suggest that such smuggling is on the rise. Agents opened 58 cases in the United States in 2004, up from 30 the previous year. 
 Statistics on fake drugs are hard to come by. ''The sophistication and precision of some counterfeit copies of legitimate drugs make a reliable estimate of the number of counterfeits impossible,'' Mr. Lutter said, according to a transcript. 
 The Coalition for Intellectual Property Rights, an independent group, surveyed the Russian market in 2003 and found that 12 percent of pharmaceuticals were counterfeited, though local industry groups say the number is lower, perhaps as little as a fraction of 1 percent. 
 Typically, pharmaceutical trade associations, which represent companies with reputations and sales that could suffer if information on counterfeit products became public, offer lower estimates. The World Health Organization has estimated that counterfeiting pharmaceuticals, on a global basis, is a $32 billion business.
 Inside Russia, the high quality of the counterfeit drugs has blunted any sense of outrage or urgency by authorities to make arrests, according to two industry groups in Moscow. 
 ''There's a perception around here that if nobody's harmed, what is the problem?'' said Sergei A. Boboshko, executive director of the Association of International Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers, an industry group in Moscow representing 46 large drug companies.
 The industry is more worried about publicity over counterfeiting, fearing that sales will fall if customers are alarmed by the prevalence of counterfeited medicine. 
 Companies do not usually disclose their discoveries of counterfeit versions of their pills, according to Cinthya K. Ramirez, a policy analyst at the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, a group based in Geneva. 
 ''You can imagine the impact that it could have,'' Ms. Ramirez said. ''People would be scared and they won't take their medicine, and would be ill. The question of information is very sensitive.''
 Industry groups like Mr. Boboshko's and other authorities are also at odds over how to enforce the law; the Russian government has played up several high-profile raids on backyard medicine shops as talks continue about Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization. Mr. Boboshko says the raids are merely window dressing because industrial scale producers continue to operate almost openly. 
 Last fall, the Moscow police department's 18-man economic crime squad broke down the door of a rented warehouse. They found a cat and a dog -- along with eight illegal immigrants from Moldova who were mixing chalk and wheat flour into aspirin, Fillip A. Zolotnitsky, a spokesman for the economic crime division, said in a telephone interview.
 ''The walls were covered with mold. It was a standard abandoned room,'' Mr. Zolotnitsky said. The raid netted five million tablets packaged as aspirin. The suspects are awaiting trial. If they are convicted they could be sentenced to 10 years in prison. Meanwhile, Roszdravnadzor, the Russian equivalent of the F.D.A., recently published on its Web site penalties for licensed manufacturers who violate patents, including possible suspension of their license or a fine. 
 The best counterfeits are made at legitimate plants, which might run an extra night shift to make fakes, according to Mr. Boboshko. Detectives tracing the trail of the Cavinton that turned up in Dr. Merkeshkin's hospital were led to a Moscow warehouse registered to Tatyana Bryntsalova, the wife of Vladimir A. Bryntsalov, a pharmaceutical magnate who ran as a dark horse candidate for president of Russia in 2004, according to police records. 
 Calls to Mr. Bryntsalov's company, Ferein, were not returned. In the Russian media, he has denied wrongdoing. His company operates licensed factories that produce 10 percent of Russia's legitimate pharmaceuticals. 
 The growing proliferation of fake drug supplies around the world has led the F.D.A. to consider an expensive new radio tagging system for tracking prescription medicine in the United States. The system, now in a trial phase, is considered the most significant change in drug packaging since tamper-proofing was developed in the 1980's. 
 In a laboratory off Moscow's traffic-clogged Leninsky Avenue, Leonid A. Mikhalitsyn, a physicist, stands at the industry's front line against fakes. He is a spectrograph operator for the German scientific instrument maker Bruker and works in an ultramodern, glass-enclosed office. The spectrograph somewhat resembles a desktop PC with a round, pill-size scanner built into the top. It costs about $80,000 and is the gold standard for spotting counterfeit medicine.
 On a recent morning, Mr. Mikhalitsyn was testing Biseptol, the Russian trade name for a Polish-made antibiotic marketed in the United States as Bactrim. Mr. Mikhalitsyn said that the fake Biseptol was nearly impossible for a doctor or patient to tell from the real one and would work just as well. Bactrim is used to treat children's ear infections and urinary tract infections, according to Jose F. Flores, an American internist at the SOS clinic in Moscow. While the counterfeit drug would not put patient's health at risk, he said, it could put a drug maker's profit at risk and undermine the incentive for research and development spending.
 On a Formica counter in Mr. Mikhalitsyn's lab lay a Ziploc bag of tiny ampoules, along with stamps and labels certifying quality. The bags contained fake Cavinton found at the Moscow warehouse, from the same batch shipped to Mr. Merkeshkin's hospital. 
 After three minutes of examination, Mr. Mikhalitsyn had his answer. 
 ''It's a fake,'' he said, pointing to a red graph on his monitor depicting the chemical makeup of the pill. The computer screen displayed the readout from a genuine pill. The two lines nearly overlapped, which meant the chemicals were close to identical, Mr. Mikhalitsyn said. 
 ''They are either short one ingredient or have added an additional ingredient,'' he said. ''It's really no different from the original.''

HEADLINE: Judge Sets Aside Airbus Request to Disqualify Boeing Lawyers

BYLINE: Dow Jones/AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4 

 BODY:
A District of Columbia Superior Court judge has shelved efforts by Airbus to disqualify lawyers for the Boeing Company from working on a contentious trade dispute.
 Airbus had filed a complaint against Boeing's use of the law firm of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr for work related to a dispute with the World Trade Organization. The complaint said Boeing would have an unfair advantage because Wilmer Hale employed a former United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and a former internal lawyer for Airbus, Marco C. E. J. Bronckers, who is now a partner in Wilmer Hale's office in Brussels. 
Boeing and Airbus are involved in a long-running trade dispute over civil aircraft subsidies, currently the subject of W.T.O. cases filed by the United States and the European Union. Litigation is under way and could reach a conclusion late next year if the two sides do not negotiate a settlement by then.
 The United States wants Europe to stop giving subsidized development loans as launch aid to Airbus. Europe has countered that the United States should acknowledge and curtail tax breaks, research contracts and other government aid to Boeing.
 But Judge Leonard Braman threw out half of the Airbus complaint at an Aug. 17 hearing. He put the other half on hold, pending developments in World Trade Organization litigation.
 At the hearing, Judge Braman dismissed the complaint against Ms. Barshefsky. He said Airbus did not have standing to complain about her involvement with Boeing because the court was not handling any other aspect of the trade battle.
 With respect to Mr. Bronckers, the judge said he could not consider the complaint unless the W.T.O. ruled on whether it would consider pre-1992 aid in the trade battle. Mr. Bronckers stopped working for Airbus before the United States and Europe reached a 1992 agreement on civil aircraft subsidies that was in force until the latest round of trade litigation began.
 If the W.T.O. case is limited to post-1992 government aid, Judge Braman said, those limits should also apply to questions about legal counsel.
 Boeing and Wilmer Hale declined to comment on the judge's decision.
 Airbus said it was considering its options.

HEADLINE: Full Ownership by the Yankees Could Be Just What a Minor-League Team Needs

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN and CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
It's a long way from Hollywood to Staten Island, but the owners of the New York Yankees are trying to make the stretch.
 The Yankees, who own a minority share of their minor-league affiliate on Staten Island, are buying out the majority owners, with plans to turn management of the financially underperforming franchise over to a company run by Peter Guber, the veteran Hollywood producer, according to city officials and baseball executives.
 Mr. Guber, who produced the films ''Rain Man'' and ''Batman,'' is the chairman of Mandalay Entertainment Group, which makes movies and owns five minor-league ball clubs. Mandalay's team in Dayton, Ohio, has sold out every home game it has played, a record that appeals to the Yankees' owners and city officials, who have been disappointed with attendance at the $70 million Staten Island stadium the Giuliani administration built. 
 ''The Staten Island Yankees have been a bit of a disappointment in terms of economic impact,'' said Michael E. McMahon, a city councilman from Staten Island. ''The great investment that the city made in that project has not had the return in dollars or community connection.'' 
 Mr. McMahon said he was pleased that the Yankees were buying out the 51 percent stake held by the Getzler family, which moved the team from Watertown, N.Y., to the city in 1999. He said he hoped that under ''a more professional management team,'' the Staten Island club could be as successful as the Brooklyn Cyclones, a New York Mets affiliate that draws much bigger crowds to a city-owned stadium in Coney Island.
 The Cyclones and the Yankees are among 14 teams in the New York-Penn League. Though the Staten Island Yankees have won three league championships and have the best record this season, they have drawn only about 3,500 fans per game, less than half of the standing-room-only audience of 7,900 at the typical Cyclones game. 
 A spokesman for Mandalay in Los Angeles, Kevin Mortesen, declined to comment on the company's pending involvement with the Yankees. He referred a reporter to a statement from the New York Yankees that said the purchase of the Getzlers' interest in the minor-league club ''has gone to contract, but has not yet closed,'' and that the Yankees would be ''using an experienced operator to run the Staten Island team.''
 Mandalay Sports Entertainment owns affiliates of major league teams in Dayton; Las Vegas; Frisco, Tex.; Erie, Pa.; and Hagerstown, Md. The company does not operate any teams that it does not own, but its executives have said that they want to acquire more teams.
 Terms of the pending sale have not been made available, so it could not be determined whether Mandalay would have an ownership interest in the club after the transaction. Neither Stanley Getzler, the principal owner of the Staten Island Yankees, nor his son Joshua, who is the chief operating officer, responded to repeated requests for comment.
 The city's Economic Development Corporation must approve the sale, said Andrew Brent, a spokesman for the agency. He said the purchase by the Yankees would not receive the necessary approval from the development corporation until the Staten Island Yankees pay what they owe the city. That total is now almost $1.3 million, which covers utilities and other services, according to the development corporation.
 The team's owners lease the 6,500-seat stadium in St. George, which is known as the Richmond County Bank Ballpark, from the city. But the team has not been paying rent because its reported attendance has been too low. 
 The lease calls for the team to pay base rent of $100,000 when season attendance reaches 125,000, according to an April audit by the city comptroller's office.
 The Yankees returned to Staten Island on Saturday for their last six games of the regular season. Depending on the attendance at their remaining games, they could be successful enough to owe rent and add to the debt they would have to pay the city to complete the sale.
 Mr. McMahon said he spoke to Randy Levine, the president of the New York Yankees, at a City Council hearing on the new stadium the Yankees are building in the Bronx. 
 Mr. Levine made a commitment that the Yankees would be more involved with the Staten Island franchise after the purchase, he said.
 ''He said they would work to make the Staten Island Yankees more successful and a better neighbor,'' Mr. McMahon said.

HEADLINE: Domestic Security Since 9/11 Is Barely Better, Schumer Says

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Domestic security remains mediocre at best, and in some ways has barely improved, since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Senator Charles E. Schumer said yesterday.
 Over all, Mr. Schumer gave efforts to make the nation safer from attack a grade of C-, about the same as the marks he assigned in similar exercises in 2002, 2003 and 2004. Of the 12 areas he examined in a report, he said a few remained particularly bad: security for mass transit, shipping ports and chemical plants; the use of devices that can detect explosives and other weapons; and grants to law enforcement authorities and firefighters. 
''A promise was made to the American people that after 9/11, every step would be taken,'' Mr. Schumer said, standing near the rim of the enormous pit at the World Trade Center site. ''Unfortunately, too much of that promise remains unfulfilled.''
 Russ Knocke, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said, ''We have, ultimately, finite resources'' that are used to focus on the most serious threats. For instance, he said, ''if we were to inspect every container that comes into our country, ports would shut down.''
 He called the senator's report ''half-baked,'' saying that ''it seems to rely upon the premise that government can prevent all threats for all people for all time.''
 Mr. Schumer said that raising the defense against terrorism to acceptable levels would probably mean doubling the department's budget, now about $32 billion a year. The federal government has spent $300 billion on the war in Iraq, he said, so ''$30 billion on homeland security doesn't seem like a lot to ask.''
 As the fifth anniversary of the attacks approached, Senator Schumer asserted that the Bush administration and Congressional leaders have still not shown the will to spend enough, and that the Department of Homeland Security has been poorly run and has reneged on commitments, partly as a result of lack of money.
 Most of the material in Mr. Schumer's 14-page report is not new; it was culled from sources like the 9/11 Commission, the Rand Corporation, the Council on Foreign Relations and various government agencies. But of the dozens of specifics it cites, many -- like the lack of tamperproof seals on shipping containers, or background checks of truck drivers - admitted to the ports -- have received little attention.
 Mr. Schumer gave his highest grades to nuclear plant security, B+, and aviation security, B-. He said airline safety had improved significantly, citing changes like secure cockpit doors, more marshals on flights and upgraded passenger and baggage screening.
 But he separated that category from efforts to develop and deploy machinery that can find weapons by peering into baggage or detect minute traces of dangerous chemicals or germs -- for which he said the government had earned an F.
 He gave another failing grade to mass transit security -- a particular concern to metropolitan New York -- saying that the government spends $9 per passenger on airline security but only 1 cent per mass transit rider.

HEADLINE: 40 Bodies, Many Blindfolded, Are Found in Baghdad; 1980's Execution Site Is Also Uncovered

BYLINE: By PAUL von ZIELBAUER

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 4 

 BODY:
The bodies of 40 people, including 25 who had been blindfolded and shot at close range, were found Monday in Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official said. A mass grave containing 18 bodies of people who were apparently executed in the 1980's was also discovered in Kirkuk, in the north. 
 American military officials announced Monday that four soldiers and two marines had died since Sunday. All but one of the deaths were caused by enemy fire. Two British soldiers were also killed Monday, in a roadside explosion in Basra. 
Senior Iraqi government officials also announced a plan to take over formal operational command of the Iraqi Army from the United States next week. The transfer has been held up for several weeks by disagreements among representatives of each government over the wording of the relationship between the armies, a spokesman for Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki said. 
 The Iraqi government also said two of its most senior officials would travel to Iran on Tuesday, a visit that raises the possibility that Mr. Maliki could visit the country, a powerful and predominantly Shiite eastern neighbor. 
 The two officials, Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih and the national security adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, are to discuss ways to enhance economic ties and resolve political problems, including border security, said Mr. Maliki's spokesman, Ali al-Dabbagh.
 Violence continued to plague Iraq on Monday. 
 Of the 40 bodies found in the capital, 25 were from the western half of the city, apparently shot after having been tortured, the Interior Ministry official said. The other 15 bodies, found in scattered areas, were probably victims of random drive-by shootings, the official said. 
 In Jurf Al Sakhar, about 20 miles southwest of Baghdad, soldiers from an Iraqi Army regiment killed 14 men suspected of plotting to attack Shiite pilgrims traveling through the town on the way to Karbala, Mr. Maliki's office said in a statement on Monday. The men had fired on the soldiers during a security sweep in the town, the statement said. 
 ''They were able with God's help to kill 14 terrorists and arrest 22 people,'' the statement said. One soldier was killed in the gunfire. 
 In a news conference on Monday, Muhammad al-Askary, the Defense Ministry spokesman, said Sunni insurgents had started renting apartments and storefronts in Baghdad and packing them with explosives. 
 ''The insurgents used new ways like renting apartments and shops to booby-trap them by remote control,'' he said. Iraqi security officials, he added, have warned shop owners and real estate agents to screen potential tenants more carefully.
 A soldier from the First Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division, was killed a few minutes past midnight on Monday when his convoy was struck by an roadside bomb north of Baghdad, the military said. A soldier from the 15th Sustainment Brigade also died early Monday of noncombat injuries near Taji, north of Baghdad, the military said. The military said it was investigating that death. 
 Two British soldiers were killed Monday and two wounded when their patrol came under attack near Basra, a spokesman for the British military said. 
 On Sunday, two marines assigned to Regimental Combat Team 5 died in fighting in Anbar Province, the military said, and a soldier from the Third Stryker Brigade Combat Team, Second Infantry Division, died after his vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb near Mosul. Another soldier from the Third Heavy Brigade Combat Team, Fourth Infantry Division, was killed by a roadside bomb near Baquba.
 Near Kirkuk, the mass grave was found in Tarkalan, 20 miles west of the city, near a former Iraqi Army base, said Brig. Yadgar Abdullah of the Kirkuk police. Eighteen bodies were exhumed, he said, including women and children, apparently Kurds, judging from their clothing 
 Near Karbala, a group of armed men kidnapped four men close to an influential Shiite cleric, Mahmud al-Hassani, a spokesman in his office said. The four men -- Abu Dia al-Musawi, one of Mr. Hassani's top aides, and his spokesman, Asaad al-Khakani, along with two brothers of Mr. Musawi -- were taken from their homes around 7 p.m., the spokesman said.
 Mr. Hassani, a strongly anti-Iranian cleric, controls a local militia that clashed last month with police forces in Karbala that are controlled by a pro-Iranian Shiite political party.

HEADLINE: Forsaking Politics, Bush Has Low-Key Labor Day 

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: PINEY POINT, Md., Sept. 4 

 BODY:
In the nearly six years of his presidency, President Bush has used Labor Day for maximum political effect, showing up at picnics to address carpenters in Pennsylvania and highway construction workers in Ohio, often with local Republican leaders in tow. 
 But two months ahead of a midterm election in which Mr. Bush's party is in danger of losing control of the House, in part because of his low approval ratings, there were no candidates with him on Monday as he appeared briefly at a Seafarers International Union facility here on the edge of the Chesapeake Bay.
 In fact, there was not even a picnic -- just a small invited audience, which Mr. Bush addressed for 11 minutes. 
 Mr. Bush drew from some past speeches to make the case for job training, though he announced no new initiatives. He dwelled chiefly on the need to find alternative sources of energy, saying it is the key to economic growth.
 ''The problem,'' he said, ''is we get oil from some parts of the world and they simply don't like us. And so the more dependent we are on that type of energy, the less likely it will be that we are able to compete, and so people have good, high-paying jobs.''
 Unlike at some of the previous events -- like a 2003 Labor Day speech in Richfield, Ohio, where he announced the creation of a ''manufacturing czar'' within the Commerce Department -- Mr. Bush did not use his appearance on Monday to discuss the erosion of manufacturing jobs.
 He announced the manufacturing czar position in a year in which 700,000 jobs had been eliminated. Since that announcement, which came as the country's trade gap was approaching $500 billion, Mr. Bush has rarely spoken about the czar. Last year, the United States imported $766 billion more in goods than it exported. The nation's last trade surplus was in 1975. 
 Even some of Mr. Bush's Republican allies in Congress, who a decade ago called for eliminating the Commerce Department, have said they doubt that anyone in such a post as manufacturing czar could staunch a phenomenon as economically complex as the movement of manufacturing jobs elsewhere.
 Asked at the event here whether Mr. Bush's appointment had made a significant difference, Karl Rove, the president's chief political strategist, said, ''Yes and no.'' Mr. Rove said the Commerce Department was now focused on opening markets abroad, which creates jobs. 
 ''It has to be part of a package,'' he said.
 While Mr. Bush did not dwell on the continuing erosion of manufacturing jobs, he noted Monday that the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent, down from 4.8 percent. ''That's a good sign for somebody looking for a job,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Gap Called a Threat to Global Growth

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
Large economic imbalances caused in part by America's trade deficit with China and other countries are threatening prospects for continued global growth, the head of the international agency that monitors the world's economy warned on Tuesday. 
 In a speech and in a session with reporters, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Rodrigo de Rato, said the global picture looked favorable because of the surging economies of China and Japan, the recovery in Japan and Europe, and growth in poor countries in Africa.
But he cited ''the risk of a disorderly adjustment of global economic imbalances'' as one challenge that policy makers must address to sustain growth. ''There are more clouds on the horizon than there were a year ago,'' Mr. de Rato said in a speech at the Brookings Institution.
 Mr. de Rato also took note of action by the fund's directors to increase the influence of China, Mexico, South Korea and Turkey, and to embark on a process that would increase the representation of other expanding countries over the next two years.
 He said that about a third of the 184 countries belonging to the I.M.F. were underrepresented because the board continued to distribute voting shares according to outdated methods. An increased say for many developing countries, and also for the poorest countries, he said, was needed to enhance its legitimacy.
 ''If it is to retain its legitimacy and maintain its effectiveness,'' he said, ''and be a useful vehicle for promoting international cooperation, all of the fund's members must be confident that they have a fair share in its decision making and that their voice will be heard.''
 Mr. de Rato's warning about imbalances, one of many from financial experts in recent months, is to be taken up at the annual meeting of the directors of the I.M.F. and the World Bank this month in Singapore.
 The Bush administration has said that while it is concerned about trade and current-account balances, there is no cause for alarm because countries will continue to lend the United States money to finance its deficits.
 But many economists warn that the United States cannot sustain its current $800 billion annual trade deficit, which has led to trillions of dollars in dollar-denominated reserves being held by China and other Asian countries, and by Saudi Arabia and the other major oil producers.
 Mr. de Rato, while carefully avoiding any criticism of American policies, appeared to put himself in the column of the worriers.
 Some economists warn that such large reserves give the countries that possess them undue leverage over the United States, and that they could lead to a sell-off of dollars that would send the value of the currency skidding. That possibility, in turn, might force the United States to raise interest rates, choking off future economic recovery.
 In addition, the gigantic reserves held by American trading partners are producing demands for protectionist action in Congress. 
 The administration has rebuffed such measures, but it has also called on the fund to more aggressively monitor the actions that countries take to influence the levels of their currency. The administration has won support from the fund for giving more of a voice over policy to China and other developing countries.

HEADLINE: Report Estimates the Costs Of a Stock Options Scandal

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
A new study estimates that the stock options backdating scandal may cost shareholders hundreds of millions of dollars. The study was released on the eve of two Senate committee hearings that plan to examine the scope of the widening investigation into improper options practices.
 Three researchers at the University of Michigan estimated that backdating stock options between 2000 and 2004 helped sweeten the average executive's pay by more than 1.25 percent, or about $600,000. But the fallout from the recent options investigations has caused those executives' companies to fall in market value by an average of 8 percent, or $500 million each. 
''For about $600,000 a year to the executives, shareholders are being put at risk to the tune of $500 million,'' the study concludes.
 The working paper, expected be made public later this week and to be published in The Michigan Law Review next year, appears to be the first to put dollar figures on the costs and benefits of backdating. It analyzed thousands of stock option grants at 48 companies that announced they were under investigation as of the end of June, and measured the maximum gains for those executives if their options were backdated over a 90-day period as well as the drop in value at those 48 companies in the 10 days before and after news of a backdating inquiry was released. 
 ''From a shareholder's perspective, it's not just the extra compensation the executives got, it's not just the extra taxes they have to pay,'' said H. Nejat Seyhun, a University of Michigan finance professor who is one of the study's co-authors. ''There may be additional payouts for class-action lawsuits as well as worrying about the quality of the top management.''
 As an economic analysis, the study assumed that investors' calculations of those risks, not irrational panic, was responsible for the substantial stock market declines. The researchers also assumed that the stock prices of those 48 companies would not recover.
 The study comes as the stock option scandal continues to widen. More than 100 companies, from Silicon Valley start-ups to prominent brands like Apple Computer are now either under investigation by the federal government or conducting their own internal reviews. Dozens of companies are working to restate earnings or are preparing for new tax bills, and in at least two cases, executives are facing criminal charges.
 On Wednesday, members of the Senate Banking Committee and the Senate Finance Committee will be briefed on the scandal's latest developments by top government officials and corporate governance experts in dueling sessions this morning on Capitol Hill. No company executives are scheduled to testify.
 With just a few weeks until midterm elections, no new legislation is expected to emerge from the hearings. But the sessions could set the stage for Congress to revisit the hot-button issue of executive pay during the next term, policy makers and governance watchdogs say.
 ''This isn't as tangible to people as Enron's thievery was -- it's much more esoteric,'' said Gregory P. Taxin, the chief executive of Glass, Lewis & Company, a proxy advisory firm. But if options backdating ''is found to have occurred at hundreds of public companies to the tune of billions in illicit gains, Congress is going to see this as a populist issue.'' 
 With close Congressional races ahead, the Senate panels have been set up in a way that allows lawmakers to score points with voters for closely monitoring executive pay. But they were not set up to investigate what, if anything, has gone wrong. No executives at companies involved in the backdating scandal were asked to testify. Nor was the Business Roundtable invited, despite being an influential chief executive lobbying arm. 
 ''What you will see is a very clear message to the regulators to get cracking and enforce the law,'' said Damon A. Silvers, associate general counsel of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
 Still, others added that the scandal may open the door for Congress to tackle broader issues related to executive pay, like golden parachutes. But Congress's track record on the issue has been spotty at best, with lawmakers reluctant to interfere with private sector pay levels and unintended consequences overshadowing the benefits of past efforts at reform. 
 On Wednesday, the Senate Banking committee will be briefed on the options scandal by Christopher C. Cox, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Erik Lie, the University of Iowa finance professor whose statistical research is widely credited with identifying the improper grant practices. 
 The Senate Finance Committee, meanwhile, will discuss both the backdating scandal and a broad range of topics related to executive pay. Paul J. McNulty, the deputy United States attorney general; Linda Cutler Thomsen, the S.E.C.'s director of enforcement; and Mark W. Everson, the Internal Revenue commissioner, will testify about their agencies' recent investigations.

HEADLINE: In Connecticut, an Office Hub Resurges

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Aug. 30 

 BODY:
Lower Fairfield County's office market has long revolved around this corporate center, a coastal city of roughly 117,000 situated less than an hour from New York City. Yet as the economy lagged, starting several years ago, the city's dominance was diluted by the loss of a number of companies to locales farther up the I-95 corridor, where the lower cost of living is easier on employees. 
 But this year, a more vigorous office market throughout the area is signaling Stamford's resurgence as a major center for financial services. The heart of the activity is downtown, where UBS Warburg's American headquarters will soon be joined by a 500,000-square-foot building to be occupied by the Royal Bank of Scotland and a subsidiary, RBS Greenwich Capital. 
The presence in Stamford of two of the world's largest banks has an enormous symbolic impact, said Robert Caruso, managing director of the Westchester-Fairfield office of CB Richard Ellis, the big commercial real estate services company. ''These are two of the most respected financial services firms in the world saying, 'I want to grow my business in Fairfield County,' '' Mr. Caruso said. 
 The market in Midtown Manhattan, where prices have been rising steadily and there is a shortage of vacant office space, is adding to the momentum, as firms look to expand consider suburban locations.
 Demand is also spilling over from Greenwich, where the proliferation of hedge funds and private equity firms has driven rents so high that ''they have really turned it into a submarket of Manhattan,'' said Judd McArthur, vice president of Cresa Partners, a corporate real estate advisory firm. ''For them, it's about where I want to put my office, not how much the rent is,'' he said.
 In Stamford, where office vacancies topped 20 percent a year ago, the rate now averages about 13 to 14 percent. Average asking rents in the central business district are up more than $6 a square foot since 2004, to $34.75 a square foot, according to data supplied by CB Richard Ellis. Owners of ultramodern Class A buildings that are closest to the city's mass transit center report asking rents in the mid-$40's to upper $50's.
 For Fairfield County as a whole, office vacancy rates have reached a five-year low of 15.6 percent, with leasing activity for the first half of the year totaling 1.6 million square feet, roughly the same as last year, according to a Cushman & Wakefield analysis. 
 The total square footage leased in Greenwich this year has actually dropped, but this reflects the lack of available space. In the central business district, where space is ''almost nonexistent,'' average asking rents were up 14 percent over last year, to more than $70 a square foot, for the first half of the year, according to Mr. Caruso. 
 The market's intensity is vividly illustrated in the pending sale of Pickwick Plaza, one of Greenwich's most high-profile office properties. A four-building complex, Pickwick Plaza is under contract to an undisclosed buyer for $230 million, or nearly $1,000 a square foot, according to Scott Landis of the Landis Group, a principal partner in the property along with Broadway Real Estate Partners of New York. The sale price is exactly twice what the partnership paid in June 2002 for the property, which is fully leased; rents are approaching $90 a square foot. 
 Mr. Landis said he had been talking with several large Manhattan firms about leasing at 400 Atlantic Street, his 15-story office building a block from Stamford's transit center. Built as the world headquarters for Champion International, the 500,000-square-foot building has undergone about $15 million worth of renovations and enhancements since the Landis Group purchased the property in 2001.
 About 75,000 square feet of space is available now, and Mr. Landis said a total of 300,000 square feet would become available within two years, which would represent the largest block of Class A space on the Stamford market. ''I've seen more activity coming out of Manhattan in the last year than I've seen in the last seven or eight years in the market,'' Mr. Landis said. 
 In the last year, 10 companies have relocated part or all of their offices from Manhattan or Greenwich to two Stamford office buildings owned by W&M Properties, according to Jeffrey H. Newman, W&M's executive vice president. The Bank of Ireland, for instance, leased more than 22,000 square feet for its wholesale financial services and global markets groups at First Stamford Place, an 810,000-square-foot office park a block from the city's mass transit center. These offices moved from Greenwich. 
 Morgan & Finnegan, an intellectual property law firm with headquarters at 3 World Financial Center, leased 3,000 square feet at First Stamford Place this year after deciding that it needed an outlying office to service its Connecticut clients better, said Andrew M. Riddles, a partner in the Stamford office. The firm focused on Stamford ''as the corporate center of Fairfield County,'' he said. 
 Rents at First Stamford Place are in the upper $40's a square foot, while rents at W&M's Metro Center, a 280,000-square-foot property at the transit center, are in the upper $50's, Mr. Newman said. The company plans to expand its stake in the market with the development of an additional 345,000 square feet of office space on a five-acre site next to Metro Center. ''We feel there's a market for a multitenanted high-performance property,'' Mr. Newman said. 
 Climbing rents and fewer concessions in the central Stamford and Greenwich markets are making space in outlying areas of Stamford and in Norwalk more attractive. ''That out-of-downtown product is now aggressively being leased,'' said Jim Fagan, senior managing director at Cushman & Wakefield. 
 The Merritt 7 Corporate Park, a six-building complex in Norwalk with 1.4 million square feet, is 96 percent leased, with asking rents of $34.50 a square foot, according to JoAnn Brennan-McGrath, the director of leasing. ''We're seeing more firms with offices in New York City or Stamford or Greenwich opening offices farther out to cut costs and commute time for employees,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Home Prices Fall in Nearly One-Fourth of Metropolitan Regions

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Prices of traditional single-family dwellings fell in 87 of the nation's 379 major metropolitan areas from the first quarter to the second, the government reported yesterday, as the overall value of homes leveled off across the country. 
 On a quarterly basis, prices were lower in Boston, Sacramento, Pittsburgh and much of the Midwest, where the loss of manufacturing jobs has hit the housing market hard.
Nationally, prices increased 1.2 percent in the quarter, the weakest gain in almost seven years, leaving them 10 percent higher than a year earlier, according to an index of home purchase and refinances produced by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight from mortgage data supplied by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 By comparison, prices rose 2.2 percent in the first quarter and 3.7 percent in the second quarter of 2005.
 The latest data indicates that slowing home sales and the rising number of properties for sale is forcing more sellers to reduce prices in many locations across the country.
 Price declines are spreading to more parts of the country. The 89 areas affected in the second quarter compares to 66 metropolitan areas where prices fell in the first three months of the year. In the fourth quarter last year, only 29 areas reported such declines.
 Prices were lower in five states -- Michigan, Massachusetts, Maine, Ohio and Indiana -- though the declines were less than 1 percent. Just one state, Iowa, had a price decline in the first quarter and none did in the fourth quarter last year.
 ''The slower sales get, and given where inventory is, it is going to require sellers to cut prices in certain markets,'' said Celia Chen, director of housing economics at Moody's Economy.com.
 Ms. Chen noted that the index showed that prices were still rising in much of California, Arizona and Florida, states that experienced some of the biggest rises during the recent boom. But that may be in part a result of the fact that the government's home price measure does not include homes with mortgages greater than $417,000. 
 By comparison, data from the National Association of Realtors showed that the national median home price for existing homes, the price at which half sold for more and half for less, increased 0.9 percent in June from the same month a year ago. That measure, however, is not adjusted for changes in the quality and size of homes sold from one year to the next, which the government index does take account of. 
 In recent years, the boom in home prices has helped increase spending by allowing consumers to take out home equity loans and larger mortgages with cash out. 
 But home equity borrowing has slowed in recent months and mortgage applications are down about 20 percent from a year ago.

HEADLINE: The Greening of Downtown Atlanta

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
Snaking through this city named after a railroad is a ring of mostly unused track, a kind of citywide gutter that for decades has divided neighborhoods and attracted only kudzu and trash. But lately parcels of land on either side of this forgotten alley have skyrocketed in value. 
 That is because the city and a host of nonprofit groups have begun what urban planners say is a singularly ambitious municipal undertaking, transforming the railroad right-of-way into a 22-mile loop for hikers and bikers; a mass transit route; and a green corridor that strings together many of the city's parks and serves as a framework for new ones.
In a city choked by its dependence on cars, the Beltline, as it is called, will provide a sanctuary, weaving its way over and under city streets, between decrepit loading docks and behind leafy backyards. It will link with the city's existing transit lines, but unlike many projects in the Atlanta area it is not aimed primarily at commuters or suburbanites. Within a two- to four-mile radius from downtown, the corridor links the city's old, historic neighborhoods, skirting attractions like the Carter Center and the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site. 
 ''This will change the character of life in Atlanta 25 years from now,'' said Alexander Garvin, the urban planner who was a crucial figure in the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and New York's bid for the Olympics, and who did a study of potential park enhancements along the Beltline. Already the city has spent $40 million to acquire one of the parcels of land he identified: a stunning 137-acre quarry that will be, when additional land is added, the city's largest park.
 The $2.8 billion Beltline began life humbly, as a thesis project for Ryan Gravel, a graduate student in architecture and urban planning at the Georgia Institute of Technology. That was seven years ago.
 But it has taken on a life of its own, exhibiting a rare power to capture the imagination of diverse interest groups, from cyclists to powerful developers, and to flatten opposition. It overcomes the traditional competition between trails and transit, for example, by combining the two.
 ''It's very important that cities and communities go for a big vision,'' Peter Calthorpe, an urban planner based in San Francisco, said in a telephone interview. ''Cities need these bold moves and elements to make them exciting places to live. It's exactly the kind of thing that will differentiate a city from the suburbs. Suburbs are the sum of a lot of little ideas.''
 In 2001 Mr. Gravel, sensing a window of opportunity, began circulating the Beltline proposal. At the time city leaders were beginning to talk about how to expand the focus of transportation planning from the time-honored problem of moving commuters to include projects that would serve in-town Atlanta residents. Huge development projects like Atlantic Station, a dense new neighborhood on the site of a former steel mill near downtown, were on the horizon. New construction -- condos, rentals, ''loftominiums'' -- was untrammeled.
 A City Councilwoman, Cathy Woolard, who became the council's president in 2002, seized on the Beltline idea, which has also been pitched as an economic development engine that will create 30,000 jobs and 28,000 housing units, along with restaurants, shops and cultural sites. But perhaps more to the point, the Beltline provides a tool to organize and control development around a public amenity.
 ''The neighborhoods just loved it instantly,'' said Mr. Gravel, now the senior project manager for the Beltline team at the city's Bureau of Planning. ''It's a pretty exciting city to be in when you can live in a house with a yard a couple of blocks from a much larger building with shopping and access to transit.''
 Yet the many feasibility studies that have been done read like a litany of impossibilities. The loop, consisting of four different rail lines, does not link up smoothly. Different sections of the right-of-way are owned by different entities. Federal money for transit projects is scarce. Some parts of the track are still in use; at one point, near the historic Oakland Cemetery, there is a major transfer yard where containers are moved from trains to trucks.
 Last October Mayor Shirley Franklin urged community leaders to take a ''leap of faith.'' She has a history of such exhortations: more recently, she persuaded businesses and wealthy donors to spend $32 million to save the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s papers from auction and keep them in the city.
 ''Here's our dilemma,'' she said in October, according to a news report at the time. ''Despite the sense of unreadiness, the opportunity to create the Beltline will slip away if we don't act now.''
 She was right: the timing of the Beltline is so perfect as to be almost late. Atlanta the city, as opposed to Atlanta the metropolitan blob, is growing in population for the first time in decades, and growing fast. In the next decade it is expected to increase to nearly 650,000 residents from just under 500,000. More Atlantans now live in multifamily buildings than in single-family homes.
 That shift increases the importance of public space. And Atlanta lags far behind other major cities in land devoted to parks; it has 3.8 percent, compared with 18.9 percent in New York, 10 percent in Los Angeles and 8 percent in Chicago.
 In some ways the Beltline has been its own enemy. The proposal has increased property values along the route, making parkland acquisition more expensive. The Trust for Public Land, which tries to help slow-moving governments in just these circumstances, is itself scrambling to buy the lots identified in Mr. Garvin's report. It has spent $22 million so far on land it intends eventually to sell to the city. 
 A developer, Wayne Mason, has already bought the northeast quadrant of the Beltline, saying he intends to donate the right-of-way to the city. But the two sides have argued over issues like just how wide that right-of way needs to be. Another developer, Charles Brewer, who has expressed opposition to the transit component of the Beltline, has left only a two-lane street where the Beltline was projected to run; the Trust for Public Land bought the property behind his to accommodate a detour.
 The city grasps the need to act quickly. Last year Ms. Franklin and the Beltline's advocates won the fight to approve a special tax district that will funnel money into the project. The first tangible results, to be completed in the next five years, will be two sections of trail; the transit component will be the costliest and take the longest.
 ''Never in my professional life,'' Mr. Garvin said, ''did I come up with a set of proposals and find that a year later they'd been adopted by the local government and that 18 months later they were buying property.''

HEADLINE: Heading to the Shore

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
Who among us hasnt fantasized about owning a home on the beach waking up and having coffee on a deck overlooking the ocean, strolling along the shoreline at sunset, falling asleep to the sound of the waves? 
 Well, no doubt some people shudder at the thought of bare feet leaving a trail of sand on the hardwood floor, or prefer a placid pool to the unpredictable surf. But for those who find inner peace just gazing out at the vast horizon, nothing says yes, youve gotten away from it all quite like a home on the beach.
Or rather, near the beach. The fact is, most popular coastal destinations have a limited supply of housing that would keep your cordless phone in range from the confines of your beach towel. Such beachfront properties generally require multimillion-dollar mortgages to go along with the million-dollar view. If that level of investment isnt in your budget, you may have to settle for a short walk to the ocean. But you should still be able to hear the surf and smell the sea. 
 Here are some factors to think about if you are shopping for a place along the coast, as well as some destinations to consider if you dont already have your heart set on a particular stretch of sand.

Location, Location, Location:

What Can You Afford?
Beach communities tend to attract loyal followings: Northeasterners who make the pilgrimage to Nantucket every summer; Midwesterners who flock to Florida when the snow falls; New Yorkers who head east to Long Island. To some degree, people want to stake a claim wherever they first built a sandcastle or caught a wave.
 Still, with home prices along the coast experiencing double-digit growth in recent years, less familiar destinations are gaining in allure. For instance, Chris Kangas and his partner, who live in Brooklyn, first started looking in Ocean Grove, N.J., six years ago, but a real estate agent sent them to nearby Asbury Park, a town that had its heyday in the early 1900s, started a long decline in the 1960s and has only recently experienced a rebirth.
 Mr. Kangas and his partner took a gamble in 2000 when they and another friend bought a two-family house. They renovated and later sold that to buy another fixer-upper, which they still own.
 We bought our first house for $155,000 and a year and a half later we sold it for $275,000, and now its worth over half a million, so the market just zoomed straight up, Mr. Kangas said.
 But that did mean riding out a transitional period: at first, almost all of the buildings on the main street were boarded; eventually a commercial district was born, with the coffee shops, stores and restaurants that city dwellers like to frequent even when they are at the beach. 
 If you are not willing to take a risk on a destination poised for a turnaround, options do exist in the better-established areas. Lance Berman of Manhattan first looked along the Jersey shore but shifted his focus to the Hamptons when he realized that, cost notwithstanding, it was where he really wanted to be.
 He is in the process of buying a three-bedroom cottage in the Northwest Woods neighborhood of East Hampton, after looking at about 10 houses over three weekends. I was very surprised; theres a lot of entry-level stuff you can get in the Hamptons, Mr. Berman said, referring to homes in the $550,000-to-$700,000 range, which are typically a bit farther from town and the beach. 
 According to Diane Saatchi, a senior vice president with the Corcoran Group in East Hampton, homes on the lower end of that price range generally need a fair amount of work, on elements like floors, baths and kitchens. She said the median price for a house in the Hamptons (including Montauk) was around $800,000.
 She also said that prices in the region had increased about 10 percent annually over the past 15 years, bolstered by increasing demand and not enough inventory, but that the trend had recently started to change. This year it seems as if we have an increase in inventory that is outpacing the increase in price and demand, she said, ascribing the new listings to concerns about rising interest rates and a general sense of instability in the world.
 As for what it would take to buy a home thats literally on the ocean, she pointed out that only 6 percent of the residential properties in the area are on the water, and that oceanfront homes can command anywhere from $6 million to $40 million.
 But she also said, Once you get away from being right on the water and you have to travel to the beach, it shouldnt really matter that much if youre getting in the car for five minutes or nine minutes.

Your Motivation: Relax, Rent or Retire?
Mr. Berman said one of the main reasons he decided to go with the Hamptons was the security of knowing he would be able to rent the house out, regardless of the real estate market or the economy. If youre going to buy in a beachfront community, he said, its important that its in a good rental market, especially if youre stretching yourself. And the Hamptons is year-round as well.
 Rick Drumm (outerbanker.com), an agent with Re/Max Ocean Realty in Nags Head, N.C., said that was an important consideration for many buyers in the Outer Banks, which has few hotels and a robust rental market. But with home prices appreciating more than 20 percent annually in recent years, he said rental rates have not been keeping pace, so buyers rent out their houses more to offset their expenses rather than generate income.
 According to Mr. Drumm, prices in the region have started to level off this year, appreciating about 12 percent so far in 2006, with an average selling price of $518,000. Homes are also staying on the market longer: about 147 days. He specializes in the upper part of the Outer Banks, from the northern towns of Duck and Corolla, quieter communities with newer housing, to Nags Head in the central more developed part of the Outer Banks. (Farther south is Cape Hatteras, a top surfing spot on the East Coast, and Ocracoke Island, known for its remote beaches.)
 In general, Mr. Drumm said, the Outer Banks attracts a younger, more active population than Florida, partly because the closest airport (in Norfolk, Va.) is an hour and a half away and getting to the hospital can also involve a long drive. Another factor is that there are fewer condominiums in the region; the real estate market in the Outer Banks is dominated by single-family homes. 

The House Itself: Mansion, Shack, Cottage or Condo
The kind of housing you want is another factor in the decision. That means really thinking about how much upkeep you want to be responsible for, especially if you are buying a second home far from the place you spend most of your time.
 Kelly Eaton and her husband, both professors in Lincoln, Neb., decided to buy a condo when they were looking for a second home in southern California. They wanted a place where they could spend school vacations near Los Angeles for a dose of urban culture, close proximity to the beach and short drives to visit family.
 I looked for about five years to find the right place, Ms. Eaton said. I considered everything from a condo in West Hollywood up to Pismo Beach. Ultimately, they bought a condominium in a 200-unit building in Port Hueneme, which she described as probably the cheapest little enclave on the West Coast, about 50 miles north of Santa Monica and 40 miles south of Santa Barbara. (Its the only deep-water port between Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay, so the shipping industry and a nearby naval base give the area a more working-class flavor than most beach towns.)
 One advantage of buying a condominium in a big building: We wanted to be literally right on the ocean, which we are, Ms. Eaton said. But another motivation was avoiding some of the headaches than can crop up with a house, which can be difficult to deal with when you are several states away. Such issues can spoil the reason most people buy a second home: to enjoy a vacation. When we get out here, Ms. Eaton said, we just want to think and read and relax. We dont want to do maintenance.
 Christine Cook is just the opposite. She bought a one-acre property in the Ditch Plains neighborhood of Montauk, N.Y. (known for its surfing beach), with plans to gut the interior of the tiny one-bedroom cottage nestled among the bramble at the back of the lot. She and her husband had so much fun ripping out kitchen cabinets and installing hardwood flooring (with some help from a contractor) that they next turned their attention to the three-bedroom ranch house on the front of the property, where they put in a new kitchen, bathroom and floor.
 The renovations allowed them to charge more for the bigger house, which they rent out in the summer.
 They were all set to enjoy the secluded back cottage when someone bought the vacant lot adjacent to theirs which they had been told was protected wetlands and built a large house with a swimming pool. 
 When you buy and they tell you no one can ever build next door, you have to take that with a grain of salt, Ms. Cook advised, pointing out that anyone who buys in a community of smaller cottages should be prepared to see it change, as McMansions replace the quaint, if somewhat dilapidated, shacks that used to dominate many coastal towns. No one really builds a cottage anymore, she said. People are building suburban-style homes.

The Local Community: Your Neighbors and the Town
Speaking of neighbors, they are another factor you should take into account.
 Each beach community is known for attracting a certain crowd: families flock to places like Ocean City, N.J., or Myrtle Beach, S.C.; surfers head to the north shore of Oahu, or to Malibu and Montauk; the stylish set looks to South Beach; retirees winter in posh destinations like Palm Beach or Naples, Fla.
 But these stereotypes do not necessarily capture the variations you may find within a community (not all the celebrities who retreat to Malibu take a surfboard). For instance, Fire Island has a reputation as a gay summer resort, but although some parts of the island like the Pines very much live up to this billing, others are much more diverse. Moreover, the entire personality of Fire Island (and many other beach destinations) changes after Labor Day, when the summer renters go home.
 For that reason, James Schwartz, executive editor of Coastal Living magazine (coastalliving.com), recommends visiting sites under consideration at different times of the year. For people who dont like dramatic rises and falls in population, some coastal communities can be very challenging, he said, adding that renting a house will immerse you in the local lifestyle more than staying in a hotel or resort. Youre not going to know what its like living someplace you cant buy baking soda until youve tried it, he pointed out.
 George and Shirley Spaniel, retirees from Michigan, didnt follow that advice when they bought a house on Amelia Island, Fla., in 1989, but they did research the community to make sure it offered the activities and lifestyle they were looking for. They liked Amelia Islands proximity to cultural activities in Jacksonville, where Ms. Spaniel said they had season tickets to everything that has a season, but the island also has its own historic business district, with good shopping and restaurants and even a hospital. (And it is just an hours drive to the Mayo Clinic and other health care facilities in Jacksonville.)
 Another factor was being in a community that attracted a mixed age range, and was not dominated by spring break revelers or retirees. Especially if youre retiring young, you want to be around people of all ages, not just the silver foxes, Ms. Spaniel noted.
 But one change they did not foresee was the opening of a Ritz-Carlton Hotel, which has brought more tourists and more development. I have mixed feelings about the growth, she said. But thats probably happening everywhere, especially with the real estate housing boom that were just now coming down off of. 

The Beach: Crowds, Sand and Sports
Of course, if you are buying a house to be near the beach, it is important to investigate just where youll be able to stake your umbrella, not to mention how tough it is to park your car nearby, what stretches of beach might not be suitable for swimming and how many people youll be fighting for towel space in peak season.
 Stephen Leatherman, director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at Florida International University (ihrc.fiu.edu), studies issues like water quality and erosion and has issued an annual list of the top beaches in the nation since 1991. Nicknamed Dr. Beach (drbeach.org), he has also written a book called Americas Best Beaches, which gives a great overview of various coastal communities (Midwesterners might take issue with the exclusion of beaches along the Great Lakes).
 One of his main areas of research is the health of the beaches from year to year. Almost 9 percent of our sandy beaches are eroding, Dr. Leatherman said, advising home buyers to check with local and state coastal management authorities and environmental groups to find out whether erosion is an issue, and what types of beach replenishment programs might be in the works. 
 This is especially important if you are lucky enough to afford a home that truly is on the beach. If youre talking about beachfront houses, he said, the view can be too good. He recalled an ad for a house in South Bethany Beach, Del., that said fishing was possible right from the deck.
 I guess if theyre advertising it that way, Dr. Leatherman mused, theyre trying to turn a problem into a feature.
 But if you know erosion is a problem in the area, he offers this tip: Buy the second row and someday youll have beachfront property.
 Other issues he suggested looking into: any recent problems with water pollution, the location of public access points, whether rip currents are frequent along the part of the coast where you plan to swim and, of course, whether storm surges are a possibility.

The Weather: Highs, Lows and Stormy Woes
Anyone who has been stuck indoors playing Scrabble while the beach towels got soaked on the clothesline knows that rain falls at the beach, too, and wool sweaters arent unusual some nights in July.
 So before you make a down payment on the basis of a glorious week of clear skies, do some research into Mother Natures relationship with your beloved beach town. With Weather.coms Vacation Planner tool, you can enter a destination to see the average (and record) high and low temperatures each month of the year, as well as the average monthly rainfall. Travel guidebooks are another good source of historical weather data.
 For instance, in Marthas Vineyard, the record low for June was just 38 degrees (in 1958), but a year later the record high for October was a balmy 88 degrees. And for anyone who hasnt discovered firsthand that Hawaii gets a lot of rain during the winter, heres a heads up: Kauai typically receives more rain than Maui or Oahu, but throughout Hawaii, winter can be wet, so its not necessarily a sunny refuge for West coast residents hoping to escape the rainy months at home.
 In general, the weather in coastal areas tends to be more variable than it is farther inland, and the past couple of years have put hurricane season on everyones radar. But just because Florida and the Gulf Coast have borne the brunt of recent hurricanes does not mean residents of the Eastern Seaboard can let their hurricane shutters get buried in the garage. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (noaa.gov), over a typical three-year period, five hurricanes hit the nations coast somewhere between Texas and Maine, although there have certainly been some atypical years lately, and some areas are more at risk than others.
 Hurricanes hit Cape Hatteras because its sticking out, but they dont really hit the upper part of the Outer Banks, Dr. Leatherman said. Virginias never had a hurricane hit it directly, and in Maryland and New Jersey its very rare. 
 If you are buying a house along the coast, you will probably have to buy flood insurance, which is offered through the federal governments National Flood Insurance Program (floodsmart.gov), not private companies (which cover wind damage from storms). You can find out more about hurricane coverage and flood insurance through the Insurance Information Institute (iii.org), which offers a homebuyers checklist as well as hurricane preparedness advice.
 If youre thinking of buying a second home, we would highly suggest that you look at insurance costs before you make any decisions, said Jeanne Salvatore, a spokeswoman for the organization. You also want to find out if theres going to be a specific deductible for hurricanes, which could be anywhere from 2 to 5 percent.
 A final piece of advice: once you move into the beach house you have worked so hard to buy, make sure you actually spend time by the ocean. Ms. Cook admitted that her ongoing renovation projects have kept her and her husband away from the beach for weeks at a time, and Ms. Spaniel acknowledged a similar challenge. If youre not living right on the beach, you dont use it as often as you think you might, she said. We have to kind of schedule it, say, This morning were going down to the beach with our chairs.

HEADLINE: At Home on the Slopes

BYLINE: By WENDY KNIGHT

 BODY:
Ski towns like Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Telluride, Colo., have long held a powerful allure for hard-core skiers and weekend warriors drawn to steep terrain and challenging runs. The phenomenal growth of sports like snowboarding and snowshoeing has fueled the appeal of mountain living. 
 Sipping a pint of ale around a fire after a day of making fresh tracks on powdered slopes is heaven to skiers. And if that fire happens to be crackling from a two-story stone fireplace in your great room filled with family and friends and sprawling views of the peaks, all the better.
It takes just a little planning to make it happen. To make ski weekends more enjoyable, many second-home owners visit their mountain dwellings early in the season to open up the house or have property managers do so. Vehicles left at mountain homes will need snow tires. At a minimum, a shovel, emergency flares, water and chains should be stowed in the trunk. Gutters, furnaces, wood stoves, chimneys and wells should all be checked to ensure they are functioning properly, and propane and oil tanks need to be filled. Firewood is usually acquired during the late summer or early fall. Cases of wine are inventoried, skis tuned and sweaters dry-cleaned. Then the winter is all about the mountain. 
 But the snow-capped peaks and glacial streams also attract a new breed: the nonskier. Plenty of people simply enjoy the pine-scented air and relative solitude of the mountains. In a nod to this growing market, ski resorts are investing millions in spas, boutiques, restaurants and other amenities. 
 By far their heaviest investments, however, are in residential properties, leading some to conclude that real estate has usurped recreation as the ski industrys primary interest. 

RECREATION

In Winter
Aspen/Snowmass in Colorado has the steepest vertical drop in the state, and Whistler Blackcomb in British Columbia the longest continuous run on the continent. Vertical drop. Continuous run. Skiable terrain. Average snowfall a year. These are the statistics bandied about in ski towns, with opinions about the best fierce and firm. However rancorous or playful, these debates reveal the towns paramount philosophy: Get on the mountain and have fun.
 Beyond downhill skiing, buyers are attracted to other cold-weather adventures, from the silly (snowbikes) and lazy (Sno-Limos) to the energetic (Nordic skiing) and extreme (Airboarding). Snowshoeing has become increasingly popular in recent years, as have ice climbing and ski mountaineering, albeit within a narrower group of skilled athletes. In the White Mountains near Jackson, N.H., is some of the best ice climbing in the east, while Tuckerman Ravine and the Presidential Range are legendary for ski mountaineering. 

In Summer
While a good share of people looking to buy a home in the mountains are skiers or snowboarders, many ski towns, like Jackson Hole, originated as summer destinations. Many second-home owners and tourists gravitate to the mountains in the warmer months for biking, hiking, white-water kayaking, rafting and fly-fishing. Most ski resorts have invested significantly in mountain biking trails or spas to appeal to summer visitors.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

As evidenced by the manicured women at Ralph Lauren or the blackjack players at Lake Tahoe, not everyone living in a ski town actually skis. Plenty of people would rather duck out for an hour of shopping or spa treatments than take another run. Fortunately for these folks, most mountain towns offer many off-piste adventures.
 Aspen has a cooking school and Jackson Hole a nature museum. At Whistler, a popular attraction is the zip line, an elevated steel cable for gliding across the timbers, while fly-fishing reigns at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, less than an hour from Big Sky, Mont. 

Arts and Culture
Mountain towns are often magnets for artists and writers who establish galleries, art schools and bookstores, all of which provide artistic and intellectual outlets for second-home owners. Writing workshops and artist retreats bring in outside talent and help to fuel a year-round arts community.
 Performance arts flourish in the mountains as well. The Aspen Music Festival and School holds year-round performances, including opera productions and symphonies. The school offers extensive programs in conducting and instrumental music. Telluride holds a world-renowned bluegrass festival, while Jackson Hole has the Grand Teton Music Festival. Even smaller towns have active arts communities. Jackson, N.H., home of the White Mountain Art School, puts on the White Mountain Fine Arts and Music Festival. 

Volunteering
In many mountain towns, second-home owners have long generational ties to the area and spend entire summers or other considerable chunks of time there. They are often quite active in civic and charitable organizations that protect wildlife corridors, clean up rivers, preserve open space or otherwise focus on environmental issues. Fund-raising for local hospitals, libraries and other town services is also taken up by many part-time residents.
 Teton County, for example, which includes Jackson Hole, has the highest per capita giving in the country. In a single day last year, Jackson Hole managed to raise $7 million for local charities during the Old Bills Fun Run, which is held in September each year. 

THINGS TO CONSIDER

Air Travel
Ski towns often attract second-home owners and visitors who live several hundred miles away, necessitating air travel. Because year-round populations of 10,000 or less cannot sustain sizable jet service to multiple cities, direct flights are often limited to regional hubs, and connecting flights are common. The topography and smaller planes often make for nausea-inducing flights. And the very things that attract buyers to the mountains remote towns in deep valleys surrounded by white-capped peaks can also keep them away.
 Youve got to make an effort to get here, said Tara Young, an agent with BJ Adams & Company in Aspen, a four-hour drive from Denver over several mountain passes. Big Sky is 45 minutes south of Bozeman, which offers direct service to only Seattle, Salt Lake City and Minneapolis-St. Paul.

Weather and Climate
Second-home owners fleeing hotter climates relish the relatively cool, dry atmosphere of the mountains, but high peaks attract dramatic weather, including thunderstorms, blizzards, ice storms and avalanches. While heavy snowfall and gusty winds may be nirvana for powder hounds, they can make for treacherous travel. The wide, flat valleys that snake through the mountains act as wind tunnels, channeling snow and ice onto the highways. It is not uncommon for highways or steep passes in the Rockies, the Cascades and other mountain regions to close during winter storms, thwarting plans for a ski getaway.
 Mountains experience dramatic fluctuations in precipitation and in temperature, with hot days and cool nights, so residents must dress accordingly. That means plenty of layers. 
 We wear thin layers with zippers everywhere so we can constantly regulate our body temperatures, said Michael Saftler, a real estate agent in Telluride, which sits at 8,750 feet. 
 The sun is more intense at higher altitudes, so sun exposure is a significant consideration in mountain towns. Frequent application of sunscreen, good eye protection and appropriate headwear are necessities. More important, the air gets considerably thinner with elevation, making breathing a challenge even for healthy adults. Those with respiratory or cardiovascular illness need to be especially careful. 

Wildlife
To meet the growing demand for housing, developers are building farther into the mountains, encroaching on wildlife habitat. While many Western states have tried to protect wildlife corridors, especially for grizzly bears and mountain lions, interactions between humans and large animals are unavoidable. A family of white-tailed deer eating your tomato plants may be annoying, but watching your Chihuahua get carried off by a mountain lion will elicit an entirely different emotional response.

Property Management
Mountain homes require special maintenance in the winter, as snow and ice can damage roofs, rip out trees, shut down power and freeze pipes. Most ski towns have a well-established infrastructure for home maintenance, with professional landscapers and property managers abundant. Alarm systems that detect when the temperature of a house has dropped sharply are de rigueur in many second-home communities like Jackson Hole and Park City, Utah.

MOUNTAIN AND SKI TOWNS

Markets for second homes in the mountains are concentrated in the Rocky Mountain States, the Pacific Northwest, California and New England. Below is a list of some towns that appeal to second-home buyers based on real estate, ski terrain and conditions, nonskiing activities, housing availability and price, and natural beauty.

Aspen, Colo.
With its designer stores (Ralph Lauren and Prada), hip hotel lounges (the Little Nell) and celebrity homeowners (Kevin Costner and Jack Nicholson), Aspen radiates with glamour and nightlife. But at 7,900 feet, Aspen is still a real mountain town with a thriving arts community, old brick buildings and a Wild West charm.
 Home prices in Aspen, a turn-of-the-century mining town, can border on the stratospheric. In July, Tommy Mottola, the recording industry executive, paid $47 million for a 12,000-square-foot house on 949 acres at the base of Mount Sopris, 30 miles northwest of Aspen. Prince Bandar bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia recently listed his 56,000-square-foot mansion for $135 million. Fifty-eight properties are currently listed for $10 million or more. With these prices, the $5 million average cost of a home in Aspen seems reasonable. 
 Many houses priced below $5 million are functional obsolete, said Carol Ann Jacobson, managing broker at Carol Ann Jacobson Realty, meaning they are too outdated to appeal to buyers who want luxury turnkey homes. 
 Tara Young, a broker with BJ Adams & Company, added, Inventory is at an all-time low with no lack of buyers. Quite often these are younger people with technology or finance backgrounds, the kind of buyers who are purchasing the new 2-to-15-acre parcels in Double Bar X Ranch for $4.5 million to $7.5 million. 
 The new development, abutting Maroon Creek and a golf course, is one of the few areas permitting larger house construction (7,500 to 10,000 square feet) since laws limiting size have been enacted. With the billionaires pushing out the millionaires, adjacent towns like Basalt, 17 miles northwest of Aspen, are attracting a young, hip clientele, who are buying properties in the $1-million-to-$3-million range. 

Bend, Ore.
Bend sits at 3,700 feet on the east side of the Cascades with a mix of high desert and alpine terrain climate, making it possible to hit the slopes in the morning (Mount Bachelor is 18 miles from town) and mountain bike after lunch. The hybrid climate attracts year-round lovers of the outdoors from major West Coast cities like San Francisco and Portland who mountain bike, rock climb, ski or golf.
 Bend is the iPod of lifestyle real estate, said Rob Mitchell, 42, a semi-retired outdoor industry executive who owns property in Bend and is exploring sustainable development projects in the area. The growth has been ridiculous in the last six years. 
 Mr. Mitchell estimates that the one-third-acre lot he bought seven years ago on the west side of Bend has increased in value tenfold. 
 The market has leveled out a bit, said Terry Skjersaa, a broker with Duke Warner Realty. Its definitely transitioned into a buyers market. 
 At $360,000, the median price of a house in Bend is a bargain compared with those in other mountain communities. Most people seeking a second home in Bend are looking at properties in the range of $400,000 to $525,000. A three-bedroom house with gardens, a cedar deck and detailed woodwork is listed for $424,900. 
 In recent years, there has been an emphasis on developing communities where commercial space, homes and open space coexist. The Arts and Crafts style has been a dominant theme in home design, though log houses seem to be favored in new golf developments like the 640-acre Pronghorn, where homes range from $400,000 to $1.8 million and fractional ownerships in villas begin at $140,000. With its long season, Bend has become a golf mecca, now with more than 20 courses in the area, including the side-by-side Jack Nicklaus Signature and Tom Fazio Championship courses at Pronghorn. 

Big Sky, Mont.
Situated at 7,500 feet and sandwiched between the Madison and Gallatin mountain ranges, hundreds of miles from a major city, Big Sky is about as remote as youll find in a mountain town. The area was developed as a ski resort relatively late, in the 1970s, and remains decidedly rural compared with other Rocky Mountain ski towns.
 Big Sky appeals to people searching for the next big thing, said Rich Hohne, a spokesman for the Moonlight Basin Resort. Selling itself as the last best place, the area has historically attracted second-home owners from the Upper Midwest and the Southeast, but more and more were selling to people from New York and the Northeast, Mr. Hohne said. 
 Housing is concentrated at the two alpine resorts Big Sky Resort and Moonlight Basin and in the town of Big Sky, known locally as Meadow Village, eight miles from the resorts. Formerly timber company land, Moonlight Basin has sought to preserve open space and protect wildlife corridors. Building sites in the 20-acre parcels in the Ulerys Lake and Timber Range developments are limited to two acres. In Cowboy Heaven, a development near the Moonlight Lodge Twenty, 2,200-square-foot houses on 1-to2-acre lots sell for $1.25 million to $1.5 million. Significantly larger parcels (160 acres and up) are available at the Ranches at the Reserve for $6 million to $11 million. 
 Yellowstone National Park has world-class fly-fishing on the Gallatin River (where scenes from A River Runs Through It were shot) and the Madison River, and there is stellar hiking in the Spanish Peaks. The full-time population of Big Sky hovers around 1,500, so certain amenities can be scarce. While you will find more than two dozen builders, there is one medical clinic and one dentist in town. The nearest hospital is 45 miles north, in Bozeman, where you will also find the regional airport, a university and plenty of shopping. 

Jackson, N.H.
One enters Jackson by crossing over a one-lane covered bridge and into a different era. Amid the clapboard buildings sits a 19th-century schoolhouse that still functions as a school. People stroll around the village green, and drivers in cars wave even to strangers. People congregate in a handful of pubs after a day in the woods.
 Charming attributes aside, people are drawn to the region for outdoor recreation. Jackson sits in a deep bowl in the Mount Washington Valley, surrounded by national forest. There are four alpine resorts within a 10-mile radius of town. Crawford Notch, Cathedral Ledges and the wind-swept Mount Washington, popular with mountaineers and climbers, are within a 30-minute drive from town. The area may be best known for its Nordic skiing; 100 miles of trails snake through town and the surrounding hillsides. 
 Younger outdoor types and active couples in their 50s and 60s buy homes in Jackson and neighboring North Conway as eventual retirement properties. There is a mix of 1970s A-frames, slope-side condos and newer houses with equally variable prices. Two-bedroom condos in town at the Eagle Mountain House are in the $30,000 range, while a three-bedroom ski-in-ski-out condo at Mountainside on Attitash lists for $669,000. A new three-bedroom trail-side home with mountain views and a gurgling brook is $1.25 million.

Jackson Hole, Wyo.
With the majestic Teton mountain range looming to the north and the Snake River weaving through town, it is not surprising that Jackson Hole is a haven for hard-core skiers and other adventure seekers. Beyond the flip-flops and trail-running shoes zipping around town, youll find plenty of cowboy boots and driving loafers, and the occasional stiletto heel. After all, this is a town that holds the Grand Teton Music Festival and weekly rodeos in the summer.
 Historically a haven for East Coast financial and media types, Jackson Hole has been luring in second-home owners from across the country in the last decade, most recently from Texas, Florida and Atlanta. 
 Ninety-seven percent of the land in Teton County is publicly owned, pushing up property prices. The average price for a one-acre lot in Jackson is $1 million. The median price of a home in Teton County has risen to $800,000, though that has not deterred buyers. 
 Its a busy market, said Charlie Ross, a broker with Sothebys International Realty. 
 Most second-home owners are interested in 5-to-35-acre parcels with water, trees and views, Mr. Ross said, adding, Youll pay a premium for Grand Tetons views. 
 Old cattle ranches are being developed with significant open space and conservation easements. One such development is the Bar B Bar Ranch, where 35-acre lots are selling for $5 million to $15 million. Homeowners are building 6,000-to-8,000-square-foot custom homes, many using materials from old barns and railroad yards to create a vintage aesthetic. Second-home owners priced out of these developments are beginning to look in neighborhoods populated by locals, Mr. Ross said. A quarter-acre lot in Stilson Ranch sells for $400,000 to $500,000. 

Park City, Utah
While the Sundance Film Festival brings in the Prada-wearing stars, it is the powder that lures the ski addicts to Park City. Surrounded by the Wasatch Mountains 36 miles from Salt Lake City, Park City offers three resorts besides Park City, they include Deer Valley and the Canyons and acres of backcountry skiing. Studded with red brick and clapboard buildings, the citys historic Main Street is filled with shops, galleries and restaurants.
 The 2002 Olympics helped turn on our faucet, said Chris Robertson, regional manager with Prudential Utah Real Estate. Weve seen phenomenal growth since then. 
 Total real estate sales volume has more than tripled since 2002, with the average sale price of a home increasing to $714,281 from $352,714 in 2002. 
 The slope-side resort development occurring in mountain communities across North America is showing up in Park City as well. Slated to open in December 2008, the St. Regis Resort and Residences at Deer Creek will have 67 hotel condos and 26 private houses, ranging from a 1,300-square-foot two-bedroom to a four-bedroom that costs $5 million. A two-bedroom condo at the St. Regis is listed for $2.2 million. 

Telluride, Colo.
Telluride is a 19th-century gold and silver mining town in the southwest corner of Colorado. Zoning laws have preserved the historic brick buildings and Victorian houses that line Main Street. Wedged in a box canyon surrounded by the San Juan Mountains at the end of a state highway, Telluride is clearly remote, but not isolated.
 The towns annual international film festival attracts a cosmopolitan crowd, who are discovering Tellurides allure and returning to buy homes. Coming from Mexico, France, South Africa and Australia, these buyers have a lot of experience around the world and have decided Telluride is the place they want to invest, said Mr. Saftler of Telluride Premier Properties.
 He said todays vacation buyers in Telluride are looking to get into the market at a lower level, although that level has risen to $625,000, compared with $425,000 two years ago. Second-home owners seem to be in two camps: those looking at properties priced around $625,000 and $650,000, and those willing to spend $6 million or more. The $1-to-$6-million market has flattened, Mr. Saftler said. There are some good buys right now in the $1.5-to-$2.5-million range. 
 A two-bedroom, two-bathroom condo in town with 1,000 square feet is $1 million. Buyers willing to look 35 to 45 minutes outside Telluride, in places like Norwood, can find 1,200-to-1,400-square-foot homes with two bedrooms for $240,000 to $260,000. 

Truckee, Calif.
An old railroad town, Truckee sits near the north shore of Lake Tahoe within striking distance of seven ski resorts, including Squaw Valley and Northstar-at-Tahoe. Tucked into the west side of the Sierra Nevada, the areas fabled snow (snowfall averages 450 inches) pulls in serious skiers. Yet summer is equally popular in the Sierra, with hiking, white-water kayaking and tubing on the Truckee River favorite pursuits.
 Eighty percent of home buyers in Truckee live elsewhere year-round. The majority of them come from the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento, 100 miles to the west, making it a relatively easy drive on Interstate 80. There is a small airport near town that is seeing more private planes and a larger airport in Reno, Nev., 40 miles west. 
 Prices have softened a little, said Nancy Davis, a partner with Davis Yoder Realty Group. This is the first time in eight years we have a nice selection of properties. 
 Those include 2,000-square-foot houses in the new Tahoe Donner subdivision that start at $700,000. The subdivision has a championship golf course, an outdoor pool and other amenities but has preserved open space for hiking trails and wilderness areas. 
 The region is in the throes of a major expansion. Tahoe Mountain Resort, a luxury four-season resort at the base of the expanded Northstar-at-Tahoe, will have mountainside and golf course residences and condos starting at $550,000. 

Warren/Waitsfield, Vt.
Buttressed by forested mountains, Warren lies along the Mad River in Vermont, in the Mad River Valley, an hour from Burlington, the states population center. You will find an antique store, a general store, an inn and municipal buildings in the historic village of Warren, which has not changed much in 200 years. Ski and snowboard shops, casual restaurants and pubs, and a handful of galleries exist in the adjacent hamlets of Waitsfield and Fayston, but skiing reigns here.
 Were on the mountain at 7:30 on a powder day, said Chris Hayes, a technology sales executive from Manhattan who bought a three-bedroom condo in 2005 at Sugarbush, the areas dominant resort. Mad River Glen is the other, a local favorite, with the countrys only operating single-chair lift and no artificial snow. 
 At $150,000, Mr. Hayess condo was a bargain, though he acknowledged it needed a lot of work.
 Theres virtually nothing habitable under $200,000, said Bill Elliott, an agent with Sugarbush Real Estate (which is not affiliated with the resort). As with many mountain towns, land to be developed is in short supply, but there is plenty of new building in the area, at the $25 million, multiyear construction of Lincoln Peak Village at Sugarbush. 
 Theres been no new development near the mountain in 25 years, said Wendy Brauer, a sales executive with the resorts real estate division. The first phase of the residential project is Claybrook, 61 luxury condos and houses set to open in December 2006. The units are being sold as whole or fractional ownership, a trend at many ski resorts across the country. Three-, four- and five-bedroom units at Claybrook were snapped up at $900,000 to $1.4 million for whole ownerships, Ms. Brauer said. Seventy percent of the units sold to date have been fractional ownerships, an economical and practical option for people who dont have 13 weeks of vacation, she said. 

Whistler, British Columbia
Set in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Whistler is known for its expert terrain and stunning landscape. The Whistler Blackcomb Ski Resort recently opened 400 acres of terrain on the mountains west side. With more than 90 restaurants and bars, there is plenty of nightlife once you are off the mountain.
 The market peaked in 2002 during the Olympic bidding, when the weak Canadian dollar stimulated substantial American investment, said Shauna OCallaghan, an agent with Whistler Real Estate. But prices have come down, she said, with Hong Kong buyers particularly strong right now. A large number of second-home buyers in Whistler are from Vancouver, other parts of British Columbia and Washington State. 
 As with many ski towns, Whistler buyers are predominantly second-home owners who are making lifestyle purchases and want ski-in-ski-out properties in luxury buildings. A three-bedroom condo in a prime mountainside location starts at $750,000, and a 1,000-square-foot hotel condo can be found for $600,000 to $700,000. A three-bedroom log house with a two-story river-rock fireplace is listed at $3.2 million. One of the newest developments at the base of the lodge is the Four Seasons Private Residences, with underground parking and an outdoor pool. A furnished 1,500-square-foot unit with two bedrooms, two bathrooms and two fireplaces sells for just under $2.1 million.

The vibrancy of city living culture, shopping and the finest restaurants appeals to a broad spectrum of second-home buyers, including aging boomers looking for a getaway and globetrotting jet setters beefing up their portfolios. 
 Many of those buying in metropolitan areas may already have a second home or even a third, but their collections are simply not complete without a pied-a-terre in an energetic urban locale. According to the National Association of Realtors, 40 percent of all home sales in 2005 were second homes. And a third of those were in urban areas.
While many American cities offer that type of living and urban amenities, the hottest (and some would argue most prestigious) markets are found in Manhattan, Miami, Las Vegas and San Francisco.
 The typical buyer in these cities may be a wealthy executive who counts a city condo as one of many secondary homes that he cycles through over the course of the year, or a baby boomer in her 40s or 50s. 
 These individuals or couples are still working and consequently have the money to invest in an additional home. Still other buyers are simply empty nesters who may have had a larger house in the suburbs and now want a smaller place in a more central location that they can escape to or lend to their adult children.
 Why Are They Buying?
 Urban buyers are definitely aware of the investment potential of a prime city location (like the Strip in Las Vegas or a building overlooking Central Park in Manhattan), but that is not the only reason they want to own there. 
 Doug McCafferty, 51, a commercial real estate broker in Southern California who recently bought in the Residences at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, is interested in both investment and personal use. I buy in places that I enjoy and in places that other people will pay me to use, Mr. McCafferty said. He also owns houses in Hawaii and Palm Springs, Calif., but the urban energy of Las Vegas appealed to him. Im not really a gambler, he said, but I like the excitement of the city. I like the entertainment, the dining and all the amenities it offers.
 That is a familiar refrain among buyers. Fine food, arts, theater, shopping and sporting events are top reasons they are attracted to cities, as is the ease with which luxury condominiums and condo-hotels make those activities accessible. An apartment in a plush metropolitan building, for example, often comes with concierge service that can rustle up tickets to hot shows and reservations to crowded restaurants. 
 We live in a small town in North Carolina, said Dan Lackey, who just bought fractional ownership of a unit at the Ritz-Carlton in San Francisco. So were starved for the culture, shopping and excitement of a big city.
 From Broadway in Manhattan to the annual Art Basel exhibition in Miami to the concerts in Las Vegas and the restaurants in San Francisco, metropolitan areas simply offer more to do and see than do secluded vacation spots or rural country homes. In some of those cities, the weather is an additional draw. I think the next generation looking for second homes, while they want comfort, also want something dynamic, said Marian Davis, who lives in Manhattan and owns an additional home in Miami Beach. Theyre going to be doers.
 Manhattan
 For the moneyed, sophisticated breed known as home collectors, Manhattan is often the first destination to add to a portfolio. 
 If I had to use one word to describe New York, its buzz, said Dolly Lenz, vice chairman of Prudential Douglas Elliman. Its everything: its the Financial District, the art, the museums, Lincoln Center, the ballet, the theater district, unbelievable restaurants.
 People drawn to all of this run the gamut empty nesters and family-oriented business folk, young Wall Street types and international buyers who like the strength of the euro. And they expect a certain level of luxury: a high level.
 Whats old is new again, said Linda Stillwell, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group. The first apartment buildings in New York were hotel-type residences, and this is what is luring people back into New York again. 
 The Plaza, 50 Gramercy North at the Gramercy Hotel, and the Residences at the Mandarin Hotel in the Time Warner Center are condominium-hotel projects that are hugely popular because they offer all the conveniences of the upscale hotels they are connected to while giving residents the privacy of their own apartments. A resident can pick up the phone and say Im coming in, can you have my room ready, can you stock my refrigerator, can you get me theater tickets? Ms. Stillwell said. When they arrive, the citys best is at their fingertips. Cant get a reservation at Per Se? Residents at the Mandarin Hotel can have it delivered as room service. 
 Even buildings that are not attached to hotels offer high-end luxuries. 55 Wall Street inducts residents into the private Cipriani Club, where they have access to their own library, barber shop, movie theater and billiards room. And of course they can dine at the 24-hour Cipriani restaurant that anchors the building. Spas, 24-hour concierge service and fitness centers are often expected to be part of the package in Manhattan. The amenities are not really amenities anymore, said Howard Lorber, chairman of Prudential Douglas Elliman. Youre not going to buy a place if it doesnt have a gym. Youre not going to buy a new condo if it doesnt have a good concierge who can take care of stuff for you.
 The other consideration when surveying Manhattan real estate is location. The park is our draw in New York City, said Elizabeth Lee Sample, a senior vice president of Brown Harris Stevens. People really want a park view. Such vistas are expensive. Apartments at the Mandarin sold at $2 million for a one-bedroom and $45 million for a penthouse. 
 The downtown neighborhoods of SoHo and Tribeca, which for years were major draws for a younger clientele, are now becoming increasingly popular across the board. High-end developments like 101 Warren, 40 Mercer and 40 Bond, an Ian Schrager project, are attracting such buyers to the area. The Financial District is also seeing a new spark, as retailers like Tiffany and Hermes move into the neighborhood to capitalize on the equally high-end clientele moving into 55 Wall Street, 20 Pine and Downtown, a building at 15 Broad by Philippe Starck. 
 Miami
 The Miami area sees its fair share of Americans, particularly from Northeast cities, but the Latin influences and bilingualism also make it a comfortable home for businesspeople and families from South and Central America. And the absence of state income tax is an incentive for many buyers. 
 Were very urban people, said Marlene Green, an image consultant from Chicago, who with her husband owns a second home on Aqua Allison Island, a new development in Miami Beach. If you want to play golf, which I do a little, you can, and if you want to go to the modern art museum you can. And if you just want to go to Lincoln Road and people-watch, you can.
 First among Miamis important selling points for those buying a second, or in many cases a third, home is its combination of weather and location. Buyers want to be in an urban environment and be in a vacation place also, said Nelson Gonzalez, an agent with Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell. They want to be close to the beach and ocean but dont want to be bored like in Palm Beach and Boca Raton. 
 Second is the thriving nightlife and cultural scene. The clubs, restaurants and glamorous appeal of South Beach mean there is always something to do. The outdoor complex of Lincoln Road allows visitors to stroll, people-watch, eat and even catch a movie or a musical performance. Whats more, the city offers a steady calendar of high-caliber events: Art Deco Weekend in January, the South Beach Wine and Food Festival in February, the Nasdaq-100 Open tennis tournament in March and Art Basel Miami Beach in December. The new Miami Performing Arts Center will only add to the citys cultural draw.
 The hottest properties, including Il Villaggio, the Continuum, the Setai and the upcoming W South Beach, offer their residents amenities like in-room spa treatments at the Setai and the Ws Whatever/Whenever service, which will fly in bagels from New York. Private planned communities like Fisher Island in Biscayne Bay and the Canyon Ranch complex in Miami Beach (opening in spring 2007) are also prime destinations with opulent extras. Aqua has a mango grove and its own gourmet market, and Fisher Island has a polo field, 18 tennis courts and a golf course.
 Marian Davis and her husband, David Parker, whose primary residence is in Manhattan, chose Miami for their third home (they also have a place in Corpus Christi, Tex.) because Mr. Parker has business ties there. But they were not initially looking at an urban location. Ms. Davis craved a home with a backyard and barbecue so she could invite friends over the way she did when she lived in California. Thats something you cant do in Manhattan, she said. So we looked at a lot of homes. But the thing is that when youre not there, to have a single-family home, you dont have infrastructure or services. 
 She and her husband also researched retirement communities, but, she determined, thats not their style. I dont want to be in a retirement community, said Ms. Davis, who is in her mid-40s. They feel more staid; its an older clientele. Theres not a dynamic part of it. 
 Mr. Parker and Ms. Davis paid in the seven figures for their water-view condo, which is not unusual. At Il Villaggio, units start at $850,000 and can reach $8 million or $10 million for a penthouse, while the Setai is asking $739,000 to $7 million. Properties at Canyon Ranch are listed at $1 million to $5 million.
 Las Vegas
 Las Vegas is experiencing a boom in real estate, population and culture (the first two doubtless assisted by the absence of state income tax).
 Baby boomers, foreign investors and corporations are all among the investors there, particularly in the new condominium high-rises. But second-home buyers come predominantly from the West Coast because of the easy commute. Were only an hour-and-a-half flight away versus other parts of the country, said David Martin, 51, who lives in Redwood City, Calif., and owns a unit in the MGM Grand. Something like Miami is just too far away.
 And although the city used to be known only for gambling, the influx of high-end home buyers has helped fuel a need for more sophisticated diversions.
 If you like entertainment, its the entertainment capital of the world. If you like gaming, it doesnt get much better than Las Vegas, said Bruce Weiner, president and chief operating officer of Turnberry Ltd., which owns three complexes in the city. If you like shopping, its world-class shopping. Dining every celebrity chef from America and other parts of the world has opened up restaurants here. And theres about 35 major golf courses.
 While some buyers are still opting for the private communities of luxury single-family homes that are found throughout the Las Vegas area, it is the high-rise condo and hotel-condo explosion that is making news. Dozens have been proposed, but for now only a few are actually open.
 Park Towers and Turnberry Place were early entrants. Turnberry, a few blocks off the Strip, opened in 1999, and its overseeing company has since added the Residences at MGM Grand and Turnberry Towers. The company says the average age buying into Turnberry Place in 1999 was 62; today at Turnberry Towers, the average buyers are in their 40s, it says. 
 Of the new breed of luxury high-rises on the Strip, the Panorama Towers and Sky Las Vegas (with opening dates of October and December, respectively) will be the first to open, while incoming condo-hotels include the Cosmopolitan, the W Las Vegas, Trump International Tower and the Residences at MGM Grand (the only one now open). 
 All the units at Turnberry Place have Italian marble Jacuzzis. Panorama Towers will have a screening room and a regulation racquetball court. Sky Las Vegas will have a billiards room, a dog run and professional putting greens. Spas, fitness centers and round-the-clock concierge service are givens.
 In general, prices begin around $600,000 and can reach more than $9 million. The numbers increase with properties closer to the Strip. Its like the ocean in California, said Beth Naef, owner of Prime Realty. The more view of the Strip you have, the more value you have in your real estate.
 For others, though, a Strip view does not make up for the more relaxed atmosphere of a gated neighborhood community, which offers privacy and space while still providing a quick link to activities. 
 Peter and Pia Aigner of Glen Cove, Long Island, bought a home in the gated development of Los Prados Country Club, 12 miles off the Strip. Drawn by the regions warm weather and its proximity to several national parks, the Aigners also take advantage of plenty of restaurants and shows in the city. Its much easier to get a ticket to see a major performance in Vegas than it is in New York, and its cheaper, Mr. Aigner said. Weve stopped going to shows in New York. We see them all in Vegas.
 San Francisco
 We joke that its somewhere between adult camp and assisted living, said Lynn Sedway, 64, a real estate and urban economist who owns in the Four Seasons condo-hotel in San Francisco, as well as in the Napa Valley. The advantages include the downtown location and the fact that we can walk to theater and to restaurants. As empty nesters, she and her husband wanted a small place that could provide them with amenities to make their lives simpler. This way there is somebody waiting for us and there is somebody who can take our luggage upstairs, Ms. Sedway said. We feel total security, and its very well managed.
 Largely from the West Coast, and attracted to the weather and a more relaxed version of city living, San Franciscos second-home buyers want the luxury and culture of a city but not the frenetic pace.
 Bay Area folks tend to like to have that urban living experience and are amenable to it, but were not New Yorkers, said Rob Levy, a partner with McGuire Real Estate. Fortunately for them, a slew of developments are making that lifestyle accessible. The area south of Market Street, or SoMa, is where the new condominium and condo-hotel projects are sprouting. Theyre close to transportation and on flat ground, Mr. Levy said. And the weather is good there because of the microclimates; its much less foggy.
 The two main groups moving into the city are people from the Bay Area and investors, who can be local or from overseas (primarily from Asia). Diana Nelson, a broker for Millennium Partners, which developed the Four Seasons Residences, said 80 percent of its buyers were from the Bay Area, and for half of them, this was their second, third or fourth home. Ms. Nelson sees people like lawyers and venture capitalists, but also younger families involved with Silicon Valley. 
 Peter McCaffrey, a 42-year-old caterer who lives with his family in Napa Valley, spends five or six months out of the year in San Francisco for business. The city was at the top of his familys list when they started the search process. We were looking for a second home in a lot of cities, but with me being a chef, Mr. McCaffrey said, Im a foodaholic, and I think its the food capital of the United States. He is also a fan of the citys varied arts offerings, which he plans to share with his young children when they move into their condo in the Ritz-Carlton Club and Residences; it is scheduled to open in late 2007 but is already nearly sold out.
 In the past few years, the center of the city has shifted from the traditionally desirable Pacific Heights, Russian Hill and Presidio Heights neighborhoods to the area south of Market Street. Three condo-hotels are the notable residences in that region: the St. Regis, the Four Seasons and an incoming Ritz-Carlton. Units in all three start at over $1 million, and they all offer prime location and amenities. For example, in addition to having in-room spa treatments and butlers to help with unpacking groceries or purchasing a gift for a party, the St. Regis is within short walking distance to notable restaurants, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Yerba Buena Gardens and, in 2008, the Contemporary Jewish Museum designed by Daniel Libeskind.
 In another area of town, by the Embarcadero district, is the Infinity, due to open in 2008. Located near the Ferry Building with its gourmet food, wine shops and farmers market the Infinity is a block from the waterfront and, accordingly, offers impressive views. And while it is not attached to a hotel, it does have similar luxury amenities, including a screening room, a huge fitness center and 24-hour concierge service. Prices range from $600,000 to more than $3 million.
 Other Cities to Watch
 Second-home buyers are not limited to these cities. Dolly Lenz of Prudential Douglas Elliman in Manhattan has already sold several condos in the Trump International Hotel and Tower, scheduled to open in 2008. Honolulu is also on buyers radars. 
 Mr. McCafferty from the Las Vegas MGM Grand is looking into the Waikiki Beach area (where, coincidentally, Donald Trump is building another condo-hotel). And Atlanta, Seattle and Phoenix are other urban areas attracting buyers.

HEADLINE: Jankovic Beats the Rain And No. 4 Dementieva 

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
Jelena Jankovic did a double take when she looked up at the television in the players' lounge at 2 p.m. yesterday and saw herself beating Elena Dementieva. Again. ''Rain delay,'' Jankovic said with her signature giggle to her assembled friends and family. 
 Jankovic's 6-2, 6-1 quarterfinal romp at Arthur Ashe Stadium was even better the second time around for her and her mother, Snezana. Jankovic, seeded 19th, broke Dementieva's weak slice serve in every game and upset the fourth-seeded Dementieva, a 2004 Open finalist, with powerful ground strokes. 
Not only was Jankovic, an effervescent 21-year-old Serb, the first player to reach the semifinals of the United States Open, but she was also the only player to beat the rain, which turned out to be the toughest opponent of the day. She will face the winner of the match between Lindsay Davenport and Justine Henin-Hardenne.
 Because Jankovic's match lasted two minutes more than an hour, the day session was officially complete. But rain caused the cancellation of the night session, bringing the total of canceled sessions to six and sending players scrambling in uncertainty again.
 Each canceled session could cost the United States Tennis Association $2 million in gate, food and merchandise revenue, said a U.S.T.A. official who requested anonymity because financial information is not publicly released.
 ''The only thing that is tough is that whoever ends up winning it could play many matches in a short amount of time,'' James Blake said.
 Blake had been scheduled to play Tomas Berdych in the day's third match at Ashe Stadium. Marat Safin, playing the second match at Ashe, was up a break and serving at 2-1 in the first set against 14th-seeded Tommy Haas when the rain came.
 ''The weather in Wimbledon over the last few years has been better than the last years here at the Open,'' Blake said. ''Maybe it's about time we get a roof here.''
 Arlen Kantarian, the chief executive of the United States Tennis Association, said during Saturday's rainout that two feasibility studies done since Ashe Stadium opened in 1997 determined that it would cost $80 million to $100 million to cover it.
 ''That is not at this point the best expenditure of our money,'' Kantarian said. But the U.S.T.A. has not yet ruled out covering Armstrong Stadium and the grandstand court, he said, with costs estimated at $30 million to $40 million.
 The weather seemed to come at an opportune time for the 19-year-old Andy Murray, who was down by two sets to one to the No. 7 Nikolay Davydenko at Armstrong. But the 17th-seeded Murray did not see the delay helping him regroup.
 ''I'd rather be up two sets to one than down two sets to one,'' he said in frustration. 
 Jankovic seemed to have no cares in the world as she practiced the Pop-A-Shot game in the lounge for a few hours, waiting to see whether her doubles match would be played.
 Her happiness represented an about face from five months earlier, when she nearly quit tennis in the middle of a losing streak. 
 ''I think some things are meant to happen,'' Jankovic said, ''and maybe if I didn't lose 10 matches in a row, maybe I wouldn't be in the semifinals here.''
 It would seem Jankovic took a typical path for a European player, leaving to train at age 12 at Nick Bollettieri's academy in Bradenton, Fla. But as her outgoing personality shows, she is anything but typical. 
 At Bollettieri's, she trained with Maria Sharapova, who left Russia at a similar age, as well as Tatiana Golovin of France. 
 She became a junior champion in 2001 and, along the way, learned to speak breezy English. Jankovic, who is the middle child between two brothers, talked of a possible nationality conflict at Wimbledon. Her father, Veselin, is from Montenegro, and her mother is from Serbia. Montenegro voted for independence from Serbia this May. 
 ''I am Serbian, that's where I belong, that's how I feel,'' she said yesterday. 
 Snezana, who has traveled on and off with her daughter the last nine years, described the family as apolitical and extremely close. 
 ''We laugh and enjoy,'' said Snezana, a platinum blond, who said her name means Snow White in Serbian. ''We need to stay here 10 more years in this circus of tennis. Look around, it's very rare to see some players laughing, enjoying.
 ''Some of them, they reach their dream, they become somebody, they do what they had in their mind and they are not happy. What do you need to do to be happy? This is, for me, always a question.''
 She tried to boost her daughter's spirits this past spring, while helping her with her college studies. There, in the middle of her losing streak, Jankovic was studying political economics and statistics. ''Can you imagine?'' Jankovic said. ''All these tough subjects and I am losing.'' 
 She had considered returning to Belgrade to become a full-time student, until she snapped her slide at the Italian Open in Rome. She is in her second year of college and will take her exams when she returns. 
 ''I don't want to be a typical tennis player who knows how to hit the forehand and a backhand,'' she said. ''I think this career is quite short and I think there is life after tennis, as well, and I need to look after my future.''

HEADLINE: Nuclear Deja Vu: Now It's Iran That Does or Doesn't Intend to Make Nuclear Weapons

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD; David E. Sanger reported from Washington for this article, and William J. Broad from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
As the Bush administration presses the world's other major powers to speed ahead with sanctions against Iran, a fascinating puzzle of conflicting evidence, contained in the latest findings by international inspectors, is fueling the debate on whether to confront Tehran over its nuclear activities. 
 Ever since the International Atomic Energy Agency issued a report last Thursday, American officials have insisted that it sealed their case. Iran, they argue, has refused the United Nations Security Council's demand that it cease enriching uranium. 
''In the end, that's all that matters,'' R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, said last week. ''They have defied the Council.''
 The report surprised experts with its revelation of tantalizing new evidence. The inspectors said they had found traces of highly enriched uranium, which can fuel atomic bombs. So far, the Iranians have not explained how it got there, adding to suspicions in the United States and Europe that the inspectors are being shown only part of Iran's program and that some covert facilities have been hidden.
 But the same report also noted that Tehran had made little progress in setting up new equipment at its main nuclear site, at Natanz, to enrich uranium. In the last few days diplomats from the European Union and Russia have cited that finding to bolster the case that there is no urgency and no crisis -- and that the Bush administration should back off. 
 Taken together, those two views put the Bush administration and the United Nations into a situation parallel to where they were on Iraq four years ago this month, in the period leading up to the war there. 
 In September 2002, Mr. Bush addressed the United Nations, demanding that Saddam Hussein allow international inspectors into Iraq. European and Russian officials have cited that example repeatedly in recent weeks to make the case that imposing sanctions would inevitably lead to Iranian defiance, and from defiance to confrontation.
 Over the weekend, Secretary General Kofi Annan appeared to endorse that view. 
 ''I do not believe sanctions are the solution to everything,'' Mr. Annan told the French newspaper Le Monde on his way to Iran. ''There are times when a little patience is more effective. I think that is a quality we should exercise more often.'' 
 Iran, he said, could prove that its program was benign ''by giving the U.N. inspectors access to all its facilities.''
 Mr. Bush himself once acknowledged, at a news conference last December, that intelligence failures surrounding the issue of whether Iraq possessed unconventional weapons made it difficult for him to press a credible public case against Iran. Now, outside experts say, he is beginning to pay the price.
 Graham Allison, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, has argued that the seemingly contradictory evidence reported by the atomic energy agency may simply indicate that Iran's overt nuclear program is less advanced than its covert efforts to master the fundamentals of nuclear weaponry.
 ''That's not only plausible, but likely,'' he said in an interview on Monday. ''A prudent American approach should include the possibility that the negotiations about the overt track are essentially a conjurer's distraction to keep us focused on the hand that's moving while the other one is putting the rabbit into the hat.''
 Uranium enriched to low levels can fuel nuclear reactors, which Iran claims as its goal. But skilled engineers can fashion highly enriched uranium into nuclear weapons, which the United States asserts is Tehran's real objective.
 The race to understand Iran's true intentions intensified in January, when Iran cut the locks and seals that had been placed on its uranium enrichment plants after inspections and restarted its effort to make atomic fuel. By April it announced that it had used a string of 164 centrifuges at its sprawling Natanz plant to enrich uranium on an industrial scale, boasting that the achievement meant that it had joined ''the nuclear club.''
 At the time, Western atomic experts predicted that Tehran would soon succeed in setting up and operating two more cascades, or strings of centrifuges, each consisting of 164 machines. They expected Iran to do so in May and June, respectively, bringing it much closer to mastering the fundamental technologies of making bomb fuel.
 Instead, progress slowed significantly this summer. According to atomic inspectors, Iran completed neither of the two additional cascades and simply did more enrichment tests with the first one.
 David Albright and Jacqueline Shire of the Institute for Science and International Security, a research group in Washington that tracks the Iranian program, concluded in a recent report that ''Iran may be either delaying deliberately the pace of its work while diplomatic efforts are under way, or is experiencing technical problems.''
 While some European diplomats hail the delays as a reason for a lack of urgency, others say Tehran is intentionally stalling to lessen the odds of international condemnation and to further divide allies seeking atomic curbs and sanctions.
 In contrast to the image of Iran's nuclear backwardness, the atomic energy agency's report presented stark evidence of strides toward enrichment.
 It said the inspectors had found new traces of highly enriched uranium at an Iranian facility -- the third such episode in three years. In the earlier cases the agency concluded that at least some of the traces had come from contaminated equipment that Iran had obtained from Pakistan.
 But in this instance the nuclear ''fingerprints'' of the particles did not match those of the other samples, an official familiar with the inspections said, raising questions about the particles' origin.
 In three years of inspections, the agency has discovered more than a dozen circumstantial clues suggesting that Iran harbors hidden nuclear ambitions. 
 Among the most important was President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's boast that the country was researching a new generation of advanced centrifuges for uranium enrichment. Inspectors have never seen those centrifuges.

HEADLINE: In Africa, a More Business-Friendly Approach 

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Africa moved up from last place to the middle of the pack among world regions in carrying out changes that make it easier to start and run a business, according to a World Bank report released Tuesday. 
 Tanzania and Ghana catapulted this year into the ranks of the top 10 reformers. Rwanda and Nigeria made it into the top 20.
And 26 other African countries took modest steps to ease business regulations ''by the stroke of a minister's pen,'' the report noted. 
 Africa, the world's poorest region, currently has the highest tax rates and some of its most convoluted and antiquated business regulations. In every African country, most businesses operate underground, beyond the reach of regulators and tax collectors.
 Authors of the report, ''Doing Business,'' by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation, the bank's private sector arm, say they hope simplifying and easing the rules of the capitalist game will entice more businesses above ground. 
 A team of 30 researchers found that African countries had made many incremental changes. 
 ''The most surprising thing for me was to see the pickup of reform in Africa,'' said Simeon Djankov, a World Bank economist who four years ago developed the rankings on the ease of doing business. ''Something has happened this year. At least two-thirds of Africa's countries have at least one positive reform.'' 
 Tanzania computerized its business and tax registries and reduced delays in customs inspections and the courts. 
 Ghana has cut the corporate tax rate to 25 percent, from 32.5 percent, and made it easier to export goods.
 Rwanda scrapped a law adopted during Belgian colonial rule that had given one official a monopoly on notarizing documents for the entire country. 
 Ivory Coast slashed the time to register property to a month from more than a year by eliminating a requirement that the urban minister give his consent. 
 Wealthy donors like the World Bank, the United States and Britain, which focus on spurring economic growth and job creation, are putting heavier emphasis on such changes in deciding where to provide aid. 
 The Millennium Challenge Account, President Bush's aid program, explicitly uses the bank report's measure of days to start a business as one criterion for deciding who qualifies for large grants.
 Economists outside the bank say the wealth of statistical information and rankings are useful to countries seeking to improve their investment climates.
 But they also caution that scoring well in the rankings is no guarantee of economic growth and no substitute for a broader economic strategy. 
 ''It's just one piece of the puzzle,'' said William Easterly, a former bank economist who is now an economist at New York University.
 Dani Rodrik, a Harvard economist, said the report focused on steps that got government out of the way -- like cutting taxes and regulations -- but he said that countries often needed governments that encouraged industries through subsidies, preferential tax policies or special economic zones.
 ''What's assumed is that if government provides the right environment for property rights, contract enforcement and low taxes these economies will take off, but in actual fact, economic development requires a government more actively involved with the private sector,'' he said.
 Mr. Djankov, an author of the report, agreed that there were things a government could do that might be more important to economic development than the factors in the report. For example, he said, building a port might make be significant but it could also cost billions of dollars and take years to complete, unlike the changes in the report. ''These reforms are very cheap and easy to do for a government,'' he said.
 The bank's ''Doing Business'' report ranked 175 countries by the number of days it takes to start a business and on other indicators that measure contract enforcement, investor protections, corporate taxation levels and the flexibility businesses have to hire and fire workers.
 The nations the bank named as the top 10 reformers were, from the best, Georgia, Romania, Mexico, China, Peru, France, Croatia, Guatemala, Ghana and Tanzania. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and wealthy Western nations were the leading regions, followed by Africa. This year, South Asia brought up the rear.

HEADLINE: FORD BRINGS IN OUTSIDER TO HELP RUN THE COMPANY

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Leslie Wayne contributed reporting from New York for this article and Nick Bunkley from Detroit.

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Sept. 5 

 BODY:
William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of the founder of the Ford Motor Company, brought in an outsider Tuesday to help run the company, in a tacit acknowledgment that he needs a new approach in his efforts to turn around the struggling automaker.
 Mr. Ford took the highly unusual step, for Detroit, of turning to an executive with no experience in the auto industry. He gave up the titles of chief executive and president to Alan R. Mulally, a top executive of Boeing; Mr. Ford remains chairman.
Mr. Ford, 49, said he planned to remain the public face of the company -- he has been the star in Ford's ads for years -- but give Mr. Mulally responsibility for solving Ford's many problems, including falling sales, slumping profits and the loss of market share to its Asian rivals.
 Although his family's name is on the building, Mr. Ford's prominent role at the company has been something of an anomaly in recent decades. He took over as chief executive in 2001, after a 22-year stretch in which the company was run by non-family members after his uncle, Henry Ford II, stepped down. 
 Mr. Ford has stressed his family heritage in many conversations, and has been visibly distressed about its troubles. The Ford family's holdings have lost more than half their value this decade as the company shares have slumped. 
 Since becoming chairman in 1998, Mr. Ford has steadily increased his grip on the company, adding titles. But in July, he told the company's board that he wanted to bring in an outside chief, he said in an interview. 
 Mr. Ford said of Mr. Mulally: ''Our team needs a steady hand from somebody who's been through turnarounds and knows what it takes and can say, 'You're on the right path, stick with it, it's going to work,' or 'This isn't the way to go, let's refocus and go somewhere else.' ''
 Ford has already begun closing 14 plants and cutting 30,000 jobs under a turnaround plan called the Way Forward. Even so, Ford executives are preparing an expanded blueprint of the restructuring program, set to be unveiled later this month, which may call for more job cuts, plant closings and reductions in spending.
 Mr. Mulally's hiring ''is another admission that the challenges the company faces are much tougher than initially envisioned,'' said Craig Hutson, a senior investment grade analyst at Gimme Credit, an independent research service.
 Although auto companies frequently hire executives from each other, the complexity of the industry has made it resistant to outsiders, especially at the most senior level. An exception came last year, when the Fiat of Italy hired Sergio Marchionne, a lawyer, as chief executive.
 Ford's move comes as General Motors has been under pressure from its biggest shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian, to move faster on its restructuring. 
 Mr. Kerkorian has pointed to Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive at both Nissan and Renault, as an example of the kind of manager G.M. needs. Mr. Ghosn built his reputation on his swift turnaround at Nissan, where he upended many longstanding practices. G.M.'s board has steadfastly supported its chief, Rick Wagoner.
 Mr. Mulally's hiring fits with Mr. Ford's vow that Ford will dispense with tradition to move faster.
 Indeed, Ford has no time to waste: In July, Toyota passed Ford for the first time to rank as the nation's second-biggest auto company, behind G.M., although Ford regained that position last month.
 Mr. Ford, frustrated with the slow pace of change at his company, took on the additional responsibilities, though not the title, of chief operating officer in July.
 That same month, he said in an interview, he began a search of candidates inside and outside the industry that led him to Mr. Mulally.
 The matchmaker for Mr. Ford and Mr. Mulally was Richard Gephardt, the former House majority leader and now an adviser to Mr. Ford. His former district near St. Louis was the site of a truck plant that Ford recently closed, while Mr. Gephardt helped Boeing reach the 2005 settlement that ended the strike by 18,000 members of the machinists' union.
 Mr. Mulally, 61, said he was eager to try a new industry after 37 years at Boeing. ''I can't wait to become a car guy,'' he said.
 He said he was drawn by the opportunity to work with Mr. Ford, the heritage of the auto company and the opportunity to help a struggling American icon. Mr. Gephardt, in fact, used that argument to help talk Mr. Mulally into considering the job, Mr. Ford said. ''He told him, you have to do this for America,'' Mr. Ford said.
 For his part, Mr. Ford said his approach during Mr. Mulally's tenure as chief executive would be ''markedly different'' from the days when Jacques A. Nasser held that position, 1999 to 2001. The two men were said to have clashed over Mr. Nasser's efforts to invigorate Ford's corporate culture, like changing the criteria for employee job evaluations.
 Mr. Ford said Tuesday that he called Ron Gettelfinger, the president of the United Automobile Workers union, to tell him he had hired Mr. Mulally, only to learn Mr. Gettelfinger already knew him. Mr. Mulally said he planned to call Mr. Gettelfinger on Wednesday.
 Though Mr. Mulally has never worked in Detroit, there are parallels between the industries. They both deal with shrinking yet still-powerful labor unions, as Mr. Mulally learned this decade when Boeing was struck by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. 
 They share long lead times: three to four years to develop a new car, and even longer for new airplanes to be developed, tested and certified. In both industries, companies place billion-dollar bets on new products, only to risk seeing customer demand wither when oil prices rise and the economy stumbles. They also require vast engineering expertise, and rely on numerous suppliers.
 Mr. Mulally needs no refresher course on Ford, whose ideas he used as he overhauled Boeing's commercial airplane division.
 In particular, he studied the development of the Ford Taurus, a car designed in the mid-1980's to compete with offerings by Toyota and Honda. 
 In addition, Mr. Mulally is a student of the Toyota production system, which emphasizes the elimination of waste, continuous improvement and involving workers in fixing problems on the assembly line. 
 Mr. Mulally applied those lessons as he streamlined Boeing, cutting product lines from 14 to 4.
 Still, Mr. Mulally had risen as far as he was bound to at Boeing. He was passed over twice this decade for the chief executive's job, which most recently went to another outsider, W. James McNerney Jr., who joined Boeing from 3M.
 Boeing named Scott Carson, 60, as Mr. Mulally's successor. Mr. Carson had been in charge of the airplane division's sales operations.
 Analysts said Mr. Mulally's departure seemed logical. ''Alan is clearly an ambitious guy and Ford is a big job,'' said Cai Von Rumohr, an aerospace analyst at Cowen & Company. ''It is not surprising that he would want one more challenge.''
 Still, Douglas M. Steenland, the chief executive at Northwest Airlines, said Mr. Mulally, who until now has driven a Lexus LX 430 luxury sedan, would need time to get up to speed on his new company.
 But he added: ''Executive skills are transferable. Sometimes it helps to have a background in other businesses when you come into a new one.''
 Another airline executive, Herbert D. Kelleher Jr., the chairman and co-founder of Southwest Airlines, said Mr. Mulally's initial task would be ''winning the hearts and minds of the people at Ford.''
 That could be a challenge at acompany that has been riddled with executive departures during this decade. While Mr. Mulally is only the ninth chief executive in Ford's 103-year history, the company's senior and middle ranks have been marred by numerous defections since the departure of Mr. Nasser, whom Mr. Ford fired as chief executive in 2001.
 Mr. Mulally said he did not plan to bring executives with him to Ford, but would rely on those already in place. Moreover, he said would not make any adjustments to the expanded Way Forward plan that Ford will lay out in a few weeks; he said he had been briefed on the plan.
 Mr. Ford said he did not think morale would be hurt by Mr. Mulally's arrival. Indeed, there were no logical successors to Mr. Ford inside the auto company, and the man mentioned most often to succeed him has been Mr. Ghosn. But Mr. Ghosn turned down Mr. Ford's entreaties at least twice and is now engaged in talks with General Motors.

Meeting With President
 WASHINGTON, Sept. 5 (Reuters) -- President Bush will hold a twice-postponed summit meeting with executives of the three automakers after the November election on fuel-saving technology and other issues, the White House said. Two previously scheduled meetings with Ford, the General Motors Corporation, and the Chrysler Group, the North American unit of DaimlerChrysler were canceled.

HEADLINE: Bush Chooses Transportation Nominee

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
President Bush said Tuesday that he would nominate Mary Peters, a strong advocate of bringing private companies into the construction and operation of highways, to be the next transportation secretary. 
 Ms. Peters, a former head of the Arizona Transportation Department, served in Mr. Bush's first term as head of the Federal Highway Administration, then worked as an executive at a transportation engineering firm, HDR. If confirmed, which is likely, she would succeed Norman Y. Mineta, who announced in June that he would be resigning after five and a half years on the job.
Appearing with Mr. Bush at the White House, Ms. Peters said the nation's transportation infrastructure was getting old.
 ''We are experiencing increasing congestion on our nation's highways, railways, airports and seaports,'' she said. ''And we're robbing our nation of productivity and our citizens of quality time with their families.''
 Ms. Peters is a member of an advisory board created by the Reason Foundation, a conservative research and policy group. Robert Poole, the foundation's director of transportation, said Ms. Peters had been ''outspoken'' in advocating public-private partnerships for new roads, and getting away from the traditional model of using gasoline taxes. Revenue from those taxes has not kept up with the inflation in building costs, Mr. Poole said. 
 As federal highway administrator, Ms. Peters helped push through a highway authorization bill that allows public highways to be turned over to private companies for maintenance and toll collection. She has also advocated time-of-day pricing at tollbooths and construction of roads by private firms.
 After the announcement, various people and transportation groups offered statements of praise, although several experts said they could not recall Ms. Peters's having taken a major public position on any transportation field outside highways.
 Jim May, president of the Air Transport Association, the trade group of the big airlines, said that Ms. Peters's position on highways represented an endorsement of user fees, and that he favored a user-fee structure for financing the air traffic control system, rather than the ticket tax now in place.

HEADLINE: Iranian Leader Wants Purge Of Liberals From Universities

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called Tuesday for a purge of liberal and secular professors from Iranian universities, the IRNA news agency reported. 
 ''Today, students have the right to strongly criticize their president for the continued presence of liberal and secular professors in the country's universities,'' he told a group of young conservatives on National Youth Day, according to the news agency.
Mr. Ahmadinejad said the work to replace secular professors had started, but ''bringing change is very difficult.'' 
 ''Our educational system has been affected by 150 years of secular thought and has raised thousands of people who hold Ph.D.'s,'' he said. ''Changing this system is not easy and we have to do it together.''
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's comments appeared to be part of a continuing crackdown on social and political freedoms that began with his election last year. 
 As part of the crackdown, about 110,000 illegal satellite dishes have been confiscated in the past five months, one senior official, Ahmad Roozbehani, was quoted in the news media as saying. Opposition channels that broadcast mostly out of the United States have a large audience in Iran. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's call to rid the universities of secular professors is reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution of 1980 to 1987, the period after the 1979 Islamic Revolution when many liberal or Western professors were fired or forced to conform to the revolutionary line. The Supreme Cultural Revolution Council, which was set up during that time and oversaw the purges, is now headed by Mr. Ahmadinejad. 
 His speech on Tuesday came amid increasing international pressure on Iran to stop enriching uranium. Iran has insisted on its right to enrich uranium and has said that it will face sanctions but that it will not give up its nuclear program. 
 Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, is expected to meet Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, in Vienna on Wednesday, the ISNA news agency reported. 
 Some Iranians believe that Mr. Ahmadinejad's hard line at home is an attempt to divert attention from his failure to deliver on campaign pledges.
 ''He promised to improve the economy and bring about more equality, but he has not been able to realize any of those pledges,'' said Abbas Abdi, a political analyst in Tehran. 
 ''He has failed to solve the economic problem and Iran's nuclear case, and now he does not want people to accuse him of lying,'' Mr. Abdi said. ''He is bringing up other issues now to distract people from those failures.'' 
 In an interview on state television during his campaign more than a year ago, Mr. Ahmadinejad said his opponents were wrong to accuse of him of radicalism. He said that cracking down on social freedoms was not on his agenda and that he wanted only to bring about ''social justice.'' 
 Last month, however, a government spokesman, Gholamhossein Elham, appealed in a letter to the judiciary for a clampdown on the local news media, which he said ''spread lies'' against Mr. Ahmadinejad's government, newspapers reported. 
 In his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Ahmadinejad said that university leaders had a tendency to introduce politics into academic affairs in the past and that his government had been trying to change that. 
 The president's appointment of a cleric to head Tehran University, the first since the 1979 revolution, sparked protests on campus. This summer, about 10 humanities professors who had criticized the government were sent into retirement.

HEADLINE: Intel to Cut Work Force By 10,500

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF and LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 5 

 BODY:
Intel, the world's largest chip maker, moved Tuesday to revamp its business as it seeks to reverse a slide in its market share and its profit. The two-year effort will reduce its work force by 10 percent and cut $5 billion in costs. 
 Intel insisted that the spending reductions would not affect major projects now planned to build next-generation factories. ''These actions, while difficult, are essential to Intel becoming a more agile and efficient company, not just for this year or the next, but for years to come,'' Paul S. Otellini, Intel's president and chief executive, said in a statement. 
Analysts see Intel's measures as essential to regaining market share from its main rival, Advanced Micro Devices. As a leaner organization, they say, Intel can react more quickly to a changing market.
 But its shares declined in extended trading as Wall Street digested the news that the job reductions were not as large as many had expected. Intel said it would cut 10,500 jobs through attrition, the sale of businesses and layoffs. 
 Some analysts had expected twice that number and perhaps the sale of some less-profitable business, like flash memory, said Cody Acree, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus. 
 Intel, which until recently employed 102,500 workers, finds itself in the predicament of having to shed workers and sharply cut capital spending during a relative boom time for chip demand. 
 According to iSuppli, a market research firm in El Segundo, Calif., Intel's share of the worldwide chip market shrank to 11.4 percent in the second quarter, from 13.2 percent in the first quarter. It was Intel's smallest market share in four years. 
 In particular, Intel has continued to lose share to A.M.D. in the market for the microprocessors used in consumer and corporate computing markets. 
 In the second quarter of this year, A.M.D.'s share rose to 22 percent, from 16 percent a year earlier, according to Mercury Research, a technology market research company in Scottsdale, Ariz., while Intel declined to 73 percent, from 82 percent. 
 A turnaround at Intel is likely to take at least another year, Mr. Acree said. ''What we haven't seen is traction from Intel's new products,'' he said. ''That's going to take time. But we expect Intel will gain back market share.'' 
 The company said Tuesday that its plan would save $2 billion in costs and operating expenses in 2007 and $3 billion the following year. It also said it would aim to avoid $1 billion in capital expenditures by more efficient use of its plants. The reduction of 10,500 jobs is to be achieved by mid-2007.
 In regular trading, before the layoffs were announced, shares of Intel rose 11 cents, to $19.99, but they fell after hours to $19.73.
 Intel's profit in the second quarter fell 57 percent, to $885 million, or 15 cents a share. Last quarter's sales also continued to disappoint Wall Street, falling 13 percent, to $8.01 billion. 
 Profits at both Intel and A.M.D. also suffered from fierce price competition between the companies. An inventory glut at Intel grew in the second quarter in part because the price war caused customers to wait for even further price cuts. 
 Intel's stumble at a time when an ever larger portion of the world's economy is driven by the microprocessor stems largely from a series of strategic missteps over the last decade, analysts say. 
 One crucial error was made more than a decade ago. It was rooted in Intel's attempt to divide the computing industry into two markets, one for x86 chips, where it faced fierce price competition, and one for a new processor design known as the Itanium that it created in conjunction with Hewlett-Packard. The company thought it could dominate the desktop and portable PC industry by outmanufacturing its processor chip rivals, while creating a high-end corporate computing market that it could rule with the Itanium.
 The strategy failed in part because of the rise of Internet-style computing, which has led to an explosion of cheap server computers that run e-mail and Web sites and are based largely on x86 chips, and because of Microsoft's decision to make the x86 standard the focus of its new operating system, Vista.
 ''This is the ultimate repercussion of Intel's customers not buying the Itanium,'' said Mark Stahlman, a technology strategist at Gartner Invest, a Wall Street-oriented computer industry research service.
 Further compounding Intel's woes have been other disappointing initiatives in markets for communications and consumer-oriented computing. This year it sold its communications processor group to Marvell, and its Viiv consumer microprocessor strategy, introduced with fanfare at this year's Consumer Electronics Show, has not yet shown great promise.

HEADLINE: Shares Retreat as Labor Costs Rekindle Inflation Fears 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks suffered their biggest loss since July after the government said second-quarter labor costs climbed, reviving concern that the Federal Reserve would limit growth by raising interest rates to curb inflation.
 ''Today's data puts fuel on the inflation fire,'' said David Rolfe, who helps manage $575 million at Wedgewood Partners in St. Louis. ''The market is grappling with how fast do we decelerate and what that means for corporate earnings.''
Intel, the semiconductor maker, led declines after proposing fewer job cuts than some analysts had forecast. Exxon Mobil and other energy stocks fell as crude oil sank to a five-month low. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 12.99, or 1 percent, to 1,300.26, the biggest drop since July 13. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 63.08, or 0.6 percent, to 11,406.20. The Nasdaq composite index fell 37.86, or 1.7 percent, to 2,167.84, its largest decline since July 20.
 Labor expenses rose at a revised 4.9 percent annual rate last quarter, exceeding economists' estimates, according to a government report on productivity.
 The increase ran counter to figures published three weeks ago showing that wholesale prices rose less than economists forecast in August and that consumer prices were in line with estimates. The S.& P. 500 had gained 2.2 percent since the producer-price report was released, through yesterday.
 Intel lost 68 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $19.31 for the steepest drop in the Dow average. The company plans to eliminate 10,500 jobs. The slide pushed down semiconductor shares 3.3 percent for the top decline among 24 groups in the S.& P. 500.
 Hewlett-Packard tumbled 62 cents, to $35.84, on the disclosure of an inquiry by the California attorney general after company investigators disguised their identity while trying to determine which directors leaked confidential information to the news media.
 Exxon tumbled $1.30, or 1.9 percent, to $67.18 for the second-biggest drop in the Dow average. Oil for October delivery fell 1.6 percent, to $67.50 a barrel, in New York, the lowest close since April 7.
 Energy shares tumbled 3 percent. The refining companies Sunoco and Valero Energy retreated after Citigroup downgraded their shares to hold from buy, citing weakening profit margins. Sunoco fell $3.98, to $67.24; Valero slid $2.73, to $53.02.
 The government also said that productivity rose at an annual rate of 1.6 percent after a 4.3 percent pace in the previous quarter. The data heightened concern that corporate profits might be restrained.
 Other reports yesterday said growth in consumer spending slowed in most areas of the country while an expansion in the service industry accelerated last month.
 The Institute for Supply Management's index of nonmanufacturing businesses including banks, builders and retailers increased to 57.0 last month, from 54.8 in July, more than economists had expected. Readings above 50 point to growth.
 The Fed's report on economic conditions in each of its 12 districts indicated that consumer spending rose slowly in most of the country, and that inflationary pressures abated.
 General Motors rose 73 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $31.17 for the biggest gain in the Dow average. G.M. said it would extend warranties to 100,000 miles on 2007 cars and trucks to win buyers lost to Toyota and other competitors.
 Ford Motor gained 16 cents, to $8.55. The company named a Boeing executive, Alan R. Mulally, to replace William Clay Ford Jr. as chief executive. Citigroup upgraded the shares to hold from sell. Boeing fell 92 cents, to $74.44.
 The price of benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell 4/32, to close at 101 20/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose 0.01 percent, to 4.79 percent.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:



 (000 omitted in dollar figures)	 	Price	99.627	High Rate	4.790	Coupon Yield	4.875	Low Rate	4.750	Median Rate	4.770	Total applied for	$36,943,225	Accepted	$16,015,785	Noncompetitive	$442,715

HEADLINE: China Is Big Trouble for the U.S. Balance of Trade, Right? Well, Not So Fast

BYLINE: By Tyler Cowen. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University. He is co-author of a blog at www.marginalrevolution.com. He can be reached at tcowen@gmu.edu.

 BODY:
CONTRARY to popular opinion, China may be good for our trade balance. American consumers seem determined to spend money, and Chinese businessmen have made the bill cheaper. 
 It is not the case that China is simply draining the United States of money. Most of the growth in Chinese exports to the United States has come from switching manufacturing and assembly from other, more expensive, Asian countries. In 1985, China, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea accounted for 52.3 percent of America's trade deficit. By 2005, this percentage had fallen to 40.9 percent, in part because of cost savings from buying Chinese.
From 1986 to 1988, Taiwan and South Korea accounted for 60 percent of American footwear imports; China was only 2 percent. By 2001, market positions had reversed; China produced about 60 percent of the total and Taiwan and South Korea about 2 percent. Toys and sporting goods show similar gains by the Chinese, again driven by lower prices. (For these and related figures, see ''China's Embrace of Globalization'' by Lee Branstetter, professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, and Nicholas R. Lardy, senior research associate at the Institute for International Economics, at http://www.nber.org/papers/w12373.) 
 American policy makers are nonetheless concerned about cheap Chinese imports. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. will visit China this month, in part to pressure the Chinese to allow their currency, the yuan or renminbi, to rise in value on world markets. C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Center for International Economics, has been calling for a revaluation of the yuan for years, in the hope that a more valuable currency will make Chinese exports more expensive. 
 The belief is that if the dollar has less value in China, Americans will spend less on Chinese products to offset the prices they pay per item. But even if the numbers work out so that the flow of dollars to China diminishes, American consumers will pay higher prices and see fewer goods from China. Yuan revaluation is unlikely to benefit the United States, even if it does lower its trade deficit. 
 The trade effects of a revaluation of the yuan are unlikely to be large, in part because many Chinese exporters specialize in assembly. China sends out money buying components like semiconductors and turns them into finished goods, thereby running a trade deficit with East Asia. A new and higher value for the yuan would largely be a wash for these activities. With a stronger currency, China would have a harder time selling its electronic goods, but this would be offset by its greater purchasing power over the semiconductors. It would not do much damage to the Chinese competitive position.
 The Chinese keep the yuan low, relative to the dollar, by buying up United States Treasury securities; as of early 2006, the Chinese central bank held up to $470 billion in Treasury securities. This huge accumulation of relatively low-yielding assets is the investment strategy of risk-averse bureaucrats, but it may bring longer-term benefits. Those assets can someday be sold or otherwise transferred to underdiversified Chinese financial institutions. The accumulation gives the Chinese a stake in American prosperity and signals that the Chinese are committed to long-term participation in the global economy. On the American side, the Treasury market is more liquid and the budget deficit can be financed at lower cost. 
 The yuan should not, as matters stand, float freely with free capital movements. Large quantities of Chinese savings, currently restricted to the domestic currency, would probably flee the country, worsening the serious solvency problems at Chinese banks. The Chinese must first clean up their banking system before they can have free capital markets. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, a market-determined value for the yuan might well be lower than today's exchange rate, not higher.
 To the United States, the primary gains from yuan revaluation would come from the increased spending by Chinese consumers on American exports. But the Chinese are, and should be, extremely cautious. In addition to saving about 50 percent of their incomes, they are spending most of the rest on local basics, like food, cheap cars or education. Health care is a probable growth sector. China is still a poor country, and its potential to drive American export success is modest for the foreseeable future.
 Revaluation advocates claim that the Chinese need a stronger currency to prevent their economy from ''overheating.'' China may indeed not be stable. But it is unlikely that the United States government can successfully micromanage another country of 1.3 billion people into a soft landing. Chinese economic data is very poor and Americans do not have a good record in advising transition economies. The Chinese recipe for economic growth, which encouraged exports, seems to be working, although it ran counter to efforts by American economists and policy makers to promote the privatization of state-owned companies.
 The climb of the Chinese economy out of Communism and into prosperity has brought the world, and the United States, a free lunch. Consumer goods of many kinds are cheaper and the Chinese are likely to generate many scientific and technical innovations. Steering the value of the Chinese currency -- from Washington -- is unlikely to increase those gains. The United States should not be spending its international political capital on yuan revaluation, which is at best a nonevent.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Canada: Interest Rate Is Held Steady

BYLINE: REUTERS

 BODY:
The Bank of Canada left interest rates unchanged, saying the economy remained on track despite slower growth and the increased risk posed by a downturn in the United States housing market. The central bank left its key overnight rate at 4.25 percent for the second consecutive time after raising rates seven times between September 2005 and May of this year. Markets had widely expected the bank to hold rates steady. In a statement, the bank was not as dovish as had been expected, leaving analysts less sure about its next moves.

HEADLINE: Labor Costs Shake a Pillar Of Fed Policy

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
As inflation edged higher this year, many economists -- including those at the Federal Reserve -- pointed to higher productivity and stable labor costs as signs that prices were not likely to rise unchecked. 
 But a new Labor Department report suggested yesterday that the threat of higher inflation had not diminished and that it might take more monetary restraint to hold prices down. The report found unit labor costs -- which take into account changes in productivity and hourly wages -- increased much more sharply in the first half of the year than the government first calculated.
 ''These data should raise more questions about whether a moderation in economic growth would lead to slowing inflationary pressures,'' said Dean Maki, an economist with Barclays Capital. ''Wage pressures and unit labor cost pressures are rising. Those are factors that have been cited by the Fed as relatively benign pieces of the inflation backdrop. And that is no longer the case.'' 
 The new labor cost numbers raise the prospect that the Fed could face both slower growth and higher prices, creating a quandary over whether to risk even further economic weakness to contain inflation.
 Indeed, the Fed's own survey of regional economic activity, known as the beige book, suggested that growth was slowing in many parts of the country even as wage pressures were building.
 In its report, the Labor Department said that second-quarter nonfarm unit labor costs increased 4.9 percent compared with the first quarter. It first reported the increase at 4.2 percent. 
 The rise was even steeper in the first quarter. The department said first-quarter unit labor costs rose 9 percent, compared with the 2.5 percent rise that was first reported. That was the largest quarter-over-quarter rise since 2000. But much of that jump may be due to fatter bonuses and options payouts, factors that are not likely to recur this year. 
 At the same time, productivity slowed. It rose only 1.6 percent in the second quarter, compared with a 4.3 percent rise in the first quarter.
 Last month, for the first time in two years, a meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee did not bring a rise in the central bank's overnight lending rate. In a statement explaining its decision, the Fed committee said it believed inflation pressures were ''likely to moderate over time.''
 But now, said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist with Global Insight, the new data could force the Fed to push through another rate increase at its Sept. 20 meeting. 
 ''Can the Fed sit on the sidelines and do nothing while telling the markets it's being patient?'' he said. ''The dilemma that the Fed is facing is that for the next 6 to 12 months, core inflation is likely to creep up.''
 Many economists, however, predicted that the Fed would not be alarmed enough by the latest data to resume raising borrowing costs. 
 ''We don't expect the Fed will feel pressure to raise rates, even after this data,'' Mr. Maki said. ''It does appear they're inclined to wait a while and gather more data on whether inflation pressures are moderating.''
 Interest rate futures, an indication of what investors think the Fed's future monetary policy decisions will be, were unchanged yesterday. Investors are still betting that the central bank will hold rates steady this month and again in October.
 The rise in unit labor costs in the second quarter could add to pressures for businesses to raise prices for consumers. 
 With unemployment at relatively low levels -- 4.7 percent in August -- economists said higher labor costs were likely. A team of economists from Goldman Sachs wrote in a report yesterday that such high unit labor costs were not surprising, considering ''the unemployment rate is in the vicinity of what most economists regard as full employment.''
 The Fed's beige book found that in many sections of the country, employers reported having to pay their employees more, particularly for jobs that require special skills. Labor shortages were also noted.
 The region-by-region survey noted that wage pressures were increasing in the Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas districts. The Kansas City and Dallas districts reported ''fairly widespread labor shortages,'' the report said, while other districts noted shortages in particular sectors, like truck drivers near Cleveland and engineers near Chicago.
 On the whole, the beige book painted a picture of a slowing economy, punctuated by less robust consumer spending, a weakening housing market and high energy prices.
 Just a few months ago, the Federal Reserve used words like ''solid'' and ''strong'' to describe activity it now says is largely ''steady'' but ''slow.''

HEADLINE: A Theater Group Offers Hope at Ground Zero

BYLINE: By ROB KENDT

 BODY:
For arts organizations, progress at the World Trade Center site has so far resembled a Beckett play: waiting and disappointment, followed by more waiting and disappointment. Opposition from victims' relatives and political fighting have meant that none of the dreamed-of cultural projects has broken ground. And now that the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has been disbanded, arts groups are more worried than ever that the planned performing arts center and $7 million worth of federal arts grants will remain on paper. 
 So the official reopening on Sept. 22 of 3-Legged Dog's performance space in the area known as the Liberty Zone is a bit like the opening of a general store in a frontier town: some concrete evidence of progress. 
''I have a lot of faith in 3-Legged Dog; it's the wave of the future,'' said Tom Healy, president of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council. Mr. Healy cited the company as much for its aesthetic daring as for its nontraditional business model. ''When you're talking about rebuilding downtown for the 21st century, the idea of an organization that is pushing boundaries of new media is really compelling,'' he said.
 An experimental multimedia and theater company, 3-Legged Dog was located at Fiterman Hall, next to 7 World Trade Center, before the 9/11 attack destroyed its space. Today the spot reflects the area's uneven development: Fiterman (part of Borough of Manhattan Community College) is still shrouded in black netting and deserted, while in the lobby of the rebuilt 7 World Trade Center the artist Jenny Holzer has installed a text-scrawling video memorial, 65 feet wide and 14 feet high.
 ''On Sept. 11 in the afternoon everybody who was working with the company at that time came over to my place at 24th Street, and we decided to continue doing what we were doing to the best of our ability despite the attack,'' Kevin Cunningham, the executive director of 3-Legged Dog, recalled.
 The result is the new 3LD Art and Technology Center, a 12,500-square-foot warren of theaters and offices. The architect Thomas Lesser designed the $4.8 million center to fit within a concrete parking garage on Greenwich Street, near ground zero. Visitors to Mr. Cunningham's small street-front office have an unusual sense of place; you can feel the passage of cars from the garage overhead, while the office's full-length window makes you almost feel as if you were sitting on the sidewalk.
 For the Sept. 22 opening, 3-Legged Dog has planned a gala with performances by a number of the city's best-known avant-garde companies, including Radiohole and Collapsable Giraffe. 
 Mr. Cunningham said that after 9/11 he began working to find a new home. In 2002 Denham Wolf, a real estate company specializing in nonprofit deals, found the Greenwich Street space. A $225,000 development loan from the Elizabeth Steinway Chapin fund, administered by the Alliance of Resident Theaters, allowed 3-Legged Dog to hire what Mr. Cunningham calls ''a really nasty junkyard-dog lawyer,'' who helped the company secure a 20-year lease from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the garage owner, and hire an architect. 
 City Councilman Alan Jay Gerson, who represents District 1 in Lower Manhattan, also helped get $500,000 worth of free electronic and lighting equipment through the Department of Cultural Affairs.
 Before 9/11 the company had largely financed its nonprofit art-making with a for-profit company that developed multimedia performance software; its clients included the Wooster Group and NEC Technologies. But after the attack investors in the software venture pulled out. To pay for the new center the company has been busily fund-raising.
 ''The experimental arts in New York are in dire jeopardy right now,'' Mr. Cunningham said. The only other new cultural organization nearby (though not in the Liberty Zone itself) is Dance New Amsterdam's expansive city-renovated space on Lower Broadway.
 "What's alarming is that if the experimental tradition dies in New York, where it's been rampant since the 20's, we're going to lose our identity even more than we already have,'' Mr. Cunningham said. ''I'm not talking about the Disneyfication of Times Square. I'm talking about a core thing that brings new brains to the city.'' 
 He added: ''We can't do anything about the atrocious funding situation in this country, but we can do something about the basic cost structure of production. We can address the cost issues with smart business thinking, basically.''
 So 3-Legged Dog rents out space to other groups, operating a bit like a cooperative. The rental fee includes the use of video and lighting equipment, as well as training sessions on how to use it and round-the-clock access to the space. 
 The New Georges company, for example, produced Sheila Callaghan's ''Dead City,'' an updated Joycean fantasy, at the center in June (before its official opening); in August, the Here Arts Center's American Living Room arts festival was held there while its own space in the South Village was being renovated.
 ''I think 3LD exemplifies a trend we see with Here and P.S. 122,'' said Mary Harpster, the deputy director of the Alliance for Resident Theaters. ''They're all somewhat curated, have a resource space and have a point of view, and they're not only doing their own work but supporting other emerging companies.''
 Mr. Healy of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council went further, seeing 3-Legged Dog as opening a window of cultural opportunity for Lower Manhattan. 
 ''If as a city we thought about investing public dollars in a corridor of new explorations, incubators of new cultural activity, that's a far wider investment than the $50 million that's supposedly been put aside for a major concert hall,'' he said. ''What 3LD represents is a more organic way of making the arts part of rebuilding downtown.''

HEADLINE: Blaze Devastates Wilderness Area Prized for Beauty

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

DATELINE: McLEOD, Mont., Sept. 6 

 BODY:
The Boulder Valley, which bumps up against the wilderness north of Yellowstone National Park, is a quiet corner with an unusual mix of residents. They include celebrities, the merely wealthy, ranchers and others drawn to a place of quiet beauty.
 But nature has gone from serene to tempestuous of late. A fire that was detected on Aug. 22, started by lightning at Derby Mountain, has burned more than 185,000 acres. 
 In the last two days, the blaze has turned this valley where ''The Horse Whisperer'' was filmed, into a raging caldron with flames sweeping through huge stands of trees and thick banks of smoke turning daytime into twilight and the sun into a glowing red ball.
 Montana is in an extended drought, fire officials say, and it is as dry as when fires swept through Yellowstone in 1988. The state is also battling a shortage of fire crews and equipment because so many fires are burning across the West. 
 ''We're going as quick as we can, but people are fatigued,'' said Wally Bennett, the firefighting director. Though officials said the Derby fire was 45 percent contained, it jumped the first of two bulldozer lines on Wednesday in some places along the Boulder River. The lines had been hastily scraped around ranch houses and outbuildings, and the second line held, officials said. 
 Firefighters spent Tuesday night dousing houses to protect them and setting backfires.
 A lack of wind has prevented a firestorm like one that erupted last week, but the forecast included a red-flag warning for high winds. 
 Winds up to 60 miles an hour spread the fire rapidly east of here last week, near Absarokee, where it destroyed 26 houses.
 ''I'll never forget the sound when the fire came,'' said Janis Maclean, a waitress at the Grand Hotel in Big Timber who has a house near Bridger Creek. ''It sounded like the roar of jet engines.''
 Ms. Maclean's house was spared, but it sits in a tiny island of green surrounded by burned forest as far as the eye can see.
 ''We did a little dance when the fire missed us,'' she said. ''But things have really changed.''
 The fire is devastating to a region whose chief economic asset is its scenic beauty. 
 Things have been tough at the McLeod Resort, which offers cabins and parking for campers near the post office and the lone store in town. 
 ''We were full a couple of days ago,'' a resort owner, Courtney Rue, said from the back of his pickup cradling a beer and watching helicopters drop water on the flames. ''But everybody cleared out Sunday when the fire blew up.''
 Keith and Marie Engle, who own the cattle ranch where ''The Horse Whisperer'' was filmed, said they were staying put despite an official evacuation order. 
 ''There's no way we could leave and leave our livestock and buildings behind,'' Ms. Engle said. ''We have a big irrigating gun, and we're watering down our buildings, and I think we're in pretty good shape.''
 Ranchers whose grazing land burned had heavy losses.
 ''Short term, it will be tough,'' said Sonny Todd, a real estate agent and rancher who lost 1,800 acres of range to the fire. ''We've lost all our grass for one year.'' 
 Ranchers without grass may have to sell cattle, Mr. Todd said, though rangeland typically recovers after a year. 
 His real estate business will take a hit, he said, adding: ''I had half a dozen ranch listings burned out. So they're on hold. The immediate effect will be that they probably cut the land value in half.'' 
 Land has recently sold for $5,000 to $25,000 an acre.
 Martin Flanagan, who ranches with his father near Big Timber, said the fire forced his family to move cattle to a swamp. Mr. Flanagan said he worried about how the destruction of so much grass would affect elk and deer herds. 
 ''It's going to be a tough winter for some of those critters,'' he said.
 Mr. Todd sounded optimistic. ''Maybe I sound too much like a Realtor,'' he said. ''But you'd be surprised how things come back. In five years, it's a nonimpact.''
 The first order of business, though, is to put out the fire.

HEADLINE: Opening Up the Club

 BODY:
Any move that makes the International Monetary Fund -- and for that matter other major global institutions -- look less like an old boys' club is a good move. So the I.M.F.'s executive board began doing the right thing last week when it decided to give China, South Korea, Turkey and Mexico slightly larger voting shares -- and promised them even more say to come. 
 A reapportionment is essential for bolstering the fund's credibility. And it is long overdue. China represents about 15 percent of the world's gross domestic product but has only a 2.9 percent voting share at the fund, which will grow to 3.7 percent. (Belgium, with less than 1 percent of the global economy, has a 2.1 percent share.)
 All of this may sound pretty arcane until one considers the fragile state of the world economy. There is a clear need for a credible global institution to provide not only cash and bitter medicine to the poor and crisis-ridden, but also direction and frank criticism to richer countries whose problems could wreak global havoc if not addressed. 
 The Bush administration, which championed the changes, is hoping that if China gains more of a stake in the global system it will have an incentive to behave more responsibly: allowing the yuan to strengthen against the dollar and reining in its export binge. China needs a more flexible currency, both for the sake of smooth trade relations -- the system is pretty tetchy these days -- and to gain more control over its economy. As long as China keeps the yuan artificially low, other Asian countries, eager to sell their own cheap exports, will too. 
 But the advice can't stop there. The fund needs to take a closer look at who's buying all those cheap goods and borrowing all that excess cash from China. China may be the enabler. But the United States needs to reduce its enormous trade deficit and its enormous budget deficit, to protect its economy and for the sake of global stability. 
 Some clear and urgent words on that from the fund should also be welcomed -- although we fear the White House will prove less interested.

HEADLINE: Shiites Push Laws to Define How to Divide Iraqi Regions 

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.; Khalid W. Hassan and Abdul Razzaq al-Saiedi contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 6 

 BODY:
Shiite lawmakers are pushing ahead with legislation that would provide a mechanism to carve Iraq into largely autonomous regions, angering some Sunni Arab lawmakers who say Shiites should first follow through on a promise to allow Parliament to re-examine the issue of federalism.
 Allowing Shiite-dominated provinces in southern Iraq the means to form their own semiautonomous regions has been a top priority of Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, leader of the powerful Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, a Shiite political party. 
 Federalism provisions in the new Constitution, approved by voters last fall, allow such regions to be formed. Sunnis had been reluctant to support the charter, fearing those provisions would leave the country's oil wealth in the hands of Shiites in the south and Kurds in the north. 
 To win Sunnis over, Shiite representatives changed the charter so Parliament could later decide whether to narrow those provisions.
 Now, lawmakers from Mr. Hakim's party are backing legislation that would define the process for breaking the country into autonomous regions. 
 Shiite representatives say the proposal would not set that process in motion, and say they are merely trying to meet a constitutional deadline for defining it.
 But some Sunni leaders say the Shiites should first allow debate on amending the Constitution. The new proposal ''is an obstacle to the national reconciliation,'' said Dhafir al-Ani, a member of the Sunni bloc in Parliament. ''This draft could be presented after amending the Constitution.''
 Saleh Mutlak, an outspoken Sunni lawmaker, said Shiite lawmakers should instead focus on the country's fragile economy and security. ''These people should take care of these things, not federalism,'' he said. ''The government is disintegrating and there is no other power except the militias.''
 Mr. Hakim has previously said he has no intention of changing the main federalism provisions. Nevertheless, Ridha Jawad Taki, a senior member of Mr. Hakim's party, insisted that Shiites were still open to debating the provisions. It may be one or two years before anyone starts the actual process of forming an autonomous region, Mr. Taki said in an interview.
 ''Right now, we are making a mechanism and procedure for the Iraqi people in the provinces to make use of this right in the Constitution,'' he said.
 Other Shiite parties in Parliament say they favor a slower path toward federal territories. Nasir al-Saadi, a member of the bloc loyal to the radical cleric Moktada al-Sadr, said he did not object to a mechanism for carving the country into regions. But he said that it would be a long time before the country was ready to do that and that it should not happen until the ''occupation'' had ended.
 ''This isn't the time to implement federalism,'' he said.
 Hassan al-Shimiri, a member of Fadhila, another Shiite party, was also cautious. Within the dominant Shiite governing coalition, he said, ''there are many blocs that still have reservations about the activation of federalism.''
 Some lawmakers worry that there is a limited amount of time to bring Sunni Arab, Shiite and Kurdish politicians together. The speaker of Parliament, Mahmoud Mashhadani, an outspoken and controversial Sunni Arab, warned lawmakers on Wednesday that Iraq's sectarian factions might have only a few months to do so.
 ''Let's start talking the same language,'' Mr. Mashhadani told lawmakers, according to Reuters. ''We have three to four months to reconcile with each other. If the country doesn't survive this, it will go under.''
 Lawmakers also approved a measure on Wednesday that would allow private companies to import gasoline into Iraq, a proposal intended to ease perpetual fuel shortages.
 Sectarian executions and other violence continued Wednesday. News agencies reported that as many as 60 Iraqis were killed or found dead throughout the country. Such tallies, however, have proven to greatly understate death tolls. 
 Iraqi officials also announced that 27 ''terrorists'' had been executed in Baghdad for crimes of rape and murder.
 On Wednesday the chief American military spokesman in Iraq, Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, said that now that last-minute ''technical'' details had been hammered out, the prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, would assume control of the Iraqi armed forces on Thursday.
 ''Tomorrow is gigantic,'' General Caldwell said. ''It's the one event that puts the prime minister directly in the operational control of his military forces.''
 However, initially that control will be limited. In addition to Iraq's nascent air and naval forces, Mr. Maliki will be assuming control of only one Iraqi Army division on Thursday, General Caldwell said. Control of other divisions will be handed over at a rate of perhaps two per month, he said.
 General Caldwell also disclosed that Hamid Juma Faris Jouri al-Saeedi, whose arrest had been hailed by Iraqi officials as the capture of the No. 2 leader of Al Qaeda's branch in Iraq, was actually detained on June 19. The announcement was delayed so Iraqi and American forces could take advantage of information Mr. Saeedi disclosed to interrogators, he said.
 Questions also remain about Mr. Saeedi's exact role in Al Qaeda. American officials have played down Iraqi assertions that he was the second-ranking official in the terrorist group.
 American officials say Mr. Saeedi supervised the insurgent who led the bombing of the Askariya shrine in Samarra on Feb. 22, an attack that set off a spasm of sectarian killings that continue to this day. 
 But it remains unclear what role Mr. Saeedi played in that attack, and American officials have not said whether Mr. Saeedi ordered or planned the bombing.

HEADLINE: Report Finds U.S. Students Lagging in Finishing College

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
The United States, long the world leader in higher education, has fallen behind other nations in its college enrollment and completion rates, as the affordability of American colleges and universities has declined, according to a new report. 
 The study, from the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, found that although the United States still leads the world in the proportion of 35- to 64-year-olds with college degrees, it ranks seventh among developed nations for 25- to 34-year-olds. On rates of college completion, the United States is in the lower half of developed nations.
''Completion is the Achilles' heel of American higher education,'' said Patrick M. Callan, president of the center, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization based in San Jose, Calif., and Washington. 
 One particular area of concern, Mr. Callan said, is that younger Americans -- the most diverse generation in the nation's history -- are lagging educationally, compared with the baby boom generation. 
 ''The strength of America is in the population that's closest to retirement, while the strength of many countries against whom we compare ourselves is in their younger population,'' he said. ''Perhaps for the first time in our history, the next generation will be less educated.'' 
 Over all, the report said, while other nations have significantly improved and expanded their higher education systems, the United States' higher education performance has stalled since the early 1990's. 
 At the same time, for most American families, college is becoming increasingly unaffordable. While federal Pell grants for low-income students covered 70 percent of the cost of a year at a four-year public university in the 1990's, Mr. Callan said, that has dropped to less than half. 
 ''It's going backwards,'' he said. ''Tuition is going up faster than family income, faster than inflation, faster even than health care.'' 
 The report, which grades the states on how well they compare with the state with the best record, gives 43 states, including New York and Connecticut, an F for affordability. New Jersey got a D. 
 On average, a year at a public four-year university costs 31 percent of a family's income, the report said. But that figure hides the enormous difference between families in the bottom 20 percent of income, for which it would be 73 percent of annual income, and those in the top 20 percent, for which it would amount to only 9 percent. 
 The report, ''Measuring Up 2006: The National Report Card on Higher Education,'' paints a picture of an income-stratified society, with a huge educational gap between low- and high-income young adults. In 12 states, the proportion of 18- to 24-year-olds from high-income families who are enrolled in college is at least twice as great as those from low-income families; in five states, the high-income students are at least three times as likely to be in college.
 In New York, 33 percent of young adults from families with the lowest fifth of incomes are in college, compared with 55 percent of those from the richest families, close to the national average. The figures for Connecticut are 16.1 percent from the bottom fifth and 57.9 percent from the top fifth. New Jersey's figures are 19.6 percent from the bottom fifth and 51.0 percent from the top. 
 Ethnic differences in college enrollment also persist, with four states having twice the percentage of white students in college as nonwhite students. The secretary of education, Margaret Spellings, plans to announce her own ideas for making higher education ''affordable, accessible and consumer friendly for all Americans'' after the Commission on the Future of Higher Education that she created last fall delivers its final recommendations this month. 
 ''In order to remain a leader in the global economy, our nation must adapt its higher education system to prepare Americans for the jobs of today and tomorrow,'' Ms. Spellings said yesterday. 
 The report is the fourth in the center's series of assessments of national and state performance, which it produces every two years. This is the first report to include international comparisons. 
 On the state level, New York rated an A- on both students' preparation and the proportion who complete their degrees. New Jersey got an A on preparation and a B on completion, Connecticut an A- on preparation and a B on completion. 
 The likelihood of a ninth grader in New York enrolling in college four years later has dropped to 37 percent, three percentage points below the national average, from 45 percent in the early 1990's. That is one of the steepest declines in the nation, and one the center attributed to a falling high school graduation rate in the state. 
 Even accounting for New York's Tuition Assistance Program for low-income students, the center found, attending a public two- or four-year college would cost low- and lower-middle-income students nearly half of their family's annual income.
 ''New York has one of the best financial aid programs in the country, but also one of the largest low-income populations that the program doesn't reach,'' Mr. Callan said. 
 Officials at the State University of New York, the City University of New York and the State Education Department took issue with the center's methodology and said New York's public universities were more affordable than portrayed. 
 The report ''badly miscalculates New York's TAP program and inaccurately portrays higher education in New York as unaffordable,'' said John R. Ryan, the SUNY chancellor. ''Nothing could be further from the truth.'' 
 The vice chancellor at CUNY, Jay Hershenson, said that, among other things, the report sharply understated the average amount of aid to undergraduates who receive state aid and failed to take into account more than a quarter-million students in nondegree programs that lead to college.

HEADLINE: The Populist Myths on Income Inequality

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
There are two schools of thought on income inequality. Members of the first school -- populist politicians and a few economists -- say the key issue is economic power. 
 The haves exercise more power over the have-nots. As a result, corporate profits soar, while wages stagnate. Money-drenched politicians push through shareholder-friendly trade deals that outsource American jobs while job insecurity skyrockets. C.E.O.'s get absurd salaries while the 99 percent of earners enjoy few benefits from productivity gains. Unions are weakened while manufacturing wages tumble and the middle class suffers.
 In short, populists argue, the market is broken. The rules are rigged. The reigning ideology in Washington must be upended. Unions must be revived. Globalization needs to be reorganized. 
 The problem with this narrative is that it doesn't really fit the facts. First, workers over all are not getting a smaller slice of the pie. Wages and benefits have made up roughly the same share of G.D.P. for 50 years. Second, offshore outsourcing is not decimating employment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, outsourcing is responsible for 1.9 percent of layoffs, and the efficiencies it produces create more jobs at better wages than the ones destroyed.
 Third, jobs are not more insecure. Workers are just as likely to hold a job for 20 years as they were in 1969. Fourth, workers are not stuck in dead-end jobs. Social mobility is roughly where it was a generation ago.
 Fifth, declining unionization has not been the driving force behind inequality. David Card of the University of California, Berkeley, has estimated that de-unionization explains between 10 and 20 percent of the rise in inequality, and that effect was probably strongest decades ago. These days the working class is not falling behind the middle or upper-middle class. Instead, the big rise in inequality is within the office parks, among people who were never unionized. Middle managers are falling behind top executives.
 The populists, who usually live in university towns, paint a portrait of unrelieved misery that badly distorts reality. It's true that middle-class wages are lagging, but as Stephen Rose points out in The American Prospect, over the past 25 years the share of working-age adults in households making over $100,000 has risen by 13 percent while the share of households making less than $75,000 has dropped by 14 percent -- after adjusting for inflation. The median household income of people in their prime working years (25-59) is $63,000. More than half of Americans have no credit card debt, and half of those who do owe less than $2,200. 
 Workers continue to see their wages rise as they age. The typical male worker with some college but no degree has seen his income rise from $34,000 in 2000 to about $40,000 today.
 Members of the second and much more persuasive school of thought on inequality say the key issue is skills. Lawrence Katz, formerly of the Clinton administration, now of Harvard, puts it this way: Across many nations, the market increasingly rewards people with high social and customer-service skills.
 A contractor who can work with customers, design kitchens and organize jobs may earn five times as much as one of his workers who has identical cabinetry skills. An office worker who is creative, charismatic and really good in fast-changing interactive settings now gets paid much more than a disciplined middle manager who excels at routine tasks. 
 Katz describes a polarized economy. Wages are rising in the bottom quartile for workers who provide personal services. The middle is lagging. The real rewards are going to the top 10 percent, especially to those relative few who have the skills to transform organizations from the top. 
 In other words, the market isn't broken; the meritocracy is working almost too well. It's rewarding people based on individual talents. Higher education pays off because it provides technical knowledge and because it screens out people who are not organized, self-motivated and socially adept. But even among people with identical education levels, inequality is widening as the economy favors certain abilities.
 In short, government policy is not driving inequality and wage stagnation. But government hasn't done much to effectively address the problem either, even though per-capita education spending has more than quadrupled since 1950. What's needed is not a populist revolt, which would make everything worse, but a second generation of human capital policies, designed for people as they actually are, to help them get the intangible skills the economy rewards.
 What would a set of second-generation human capital policies look like? I'll come back to that in a few days.

HEADLINE: Long History of Vote Fraud Lingers in the Mexican Psyche

BYLINE: By James C. McKinley Jr.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 6 

 BODY:
Felipe Calderon was named the next president of Mexico on Tuesday by a tribunal that confirmed that the vote was basically free and fair. Yet a significant slice of the voting public still believes that the election was marred by fraud and that the country's electoral institutions are corrupt.
 To some extent that is because his leftist rival, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has waged a fiery campaign to persuade his supporters that his narrow loss on July 2 was part of a broad conspiracy between President Vicente Fox and business leaders to deny him victory. 
But why do between a quarter and a third of voters, according to recent opinion polls, agree with him? 
 One reason is history. After decades of one-party rule sustained by fraudulent elections, many Mexicans still deeply distrust their institutions and courts. But it is also because Mexicans have a very different notion of electoral fraud than voters in the United States, a notion that goes beyond stuffing ballot boxes.
 That is not to say that there was no hint of conventional fraud. 
 Mr. Lopez Obrador pointed out that more than half of the tally sheets from the nation's 130,000 election precincts contained errors in arithmetic, a sign of widespread incompetence among poll workers or of extra ballots magically appearing in some boxes and disappearing from others.
 The seven-member electoral tribunal rejected that argument, chalking up the irregularities to human error, which they said had affected all parties, and so could not be fraud. They also denied the left's request for a full recount based on the errors. 
 But the Mexican conception of fraud is strikingly expansive, compared with United States traditions, and by those lights the cries of fraud become more plausible.
 For instance, most of Mr. Lopez Obrador's supporters complain bitterly about the ''intervention'' of President Fox in the election. They talk about ''a state election'' and the ''imposition'' of the candidate from Mr. Fox's conservative party, Felipe Calderon, whom the electoral tribunal finally proclaimed president-elect on Tuesday.
 There is no doubt that Mr. Fox used his position as president and his official tours to campaign vigorously against Mr. Lopez Obrador. Though he never mentioned the leftist candidate by name, he used code words for him, railing against populism, demagogy and false messiahs. 
 The president also warned against ''changing riders'' in midstream and said that government handouts to the poor, a centerpiece of the leftist's campaign, would bankrupt future Mexicans. Meanwhile, the Fox administration spent extravagantly on public service messages praising the government's achievements.
 Such use of the bully pulpit may seem tame in the United States, but in Mexico it is against the law for a president or any elected official to use public resources to campaign for his party's candidate. The law is rooted in history. For seven decades before Mr. Fox's election in 2000, Mexico was ruled by one party, with the sitting president choosing his successor and spreading government largesse to make sure he was elected.
 The election law does not explicitly forbid a president to express support for a candidate, but the magistrates said in their ruling on Tuesday that Mr. Fox had come dangerously close to putting the election's validity in doubt.
 Worse in many leftist's minds were the actions of various business leaders. Toward the end of the campaign, the largest business association, as well as some big companies, spent more than $19 million on advertisements aimed at undermining Mr. Lopez Obrador, who promised to raise taxes on the rich and on business. 
 The advertisements never mentioned candidates by name. But some of them said, for instance, that Mexico did not need a dictator like Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, to whom Mr. Lopez Obrador is often compared by his enemies. Others noted that Mexico's economy had been stable for 10 years and said that ''betting on change'' could bring back the days of economic crisis. 
 The judges called the ads ''black propaganda.'' 
 United States voters are used to these ''soft money'' campaigns and take them in stride. But here, once again, such spending is illegal under the election law and is plausibly considered to be fraud by many of Mr. Lopez Obrador's supporters. The magistrates agreed, saying the business leaders had broken the law. But they said the impact was too slight to warrant annulling the election. 
 Beyond those big arguments are a host of smaller ones that have sewn doubt among the faithful in the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution.
 The magistrates' decision not to see the errors on tally sheets as evidence of fraud has fed suspicions that the court cannot be trusted, a theory that Mr. Lopez Obrador reiterates in every speech and which is fortified by the country's long history of corrupt judges, though no proof has been presented. 
 Mr. Lopez Obrador's followers also have no confidence in the Federal Electoral Institute, which organized the election. In October 2003, when congressional leaders were making deals to appoint new members to the institute's governing board, Mr. Lopez Obrador's party was shut out. Since then the leftists have regarded just about every decision the electoral institute makes with suspicion.
 In the end, the court ruling may have put Mr. Calderon in the president's office, but it has not dispelled feelings among Mr. Lopez Obrador's supporters that they were robbed. ''What more proof do you need?'' said one Lopez Obrador supporter, Enrique Ramirez, after the ruling. ''At his rallies, Andres Manuel has given us the proof of fraud, and we believe him, or at least I do.''
 Mr. Lopez Obrador is now calling for a ''national convention'' this month to mount a civil disobedience campaign to ''re-found the republic'' and reform ''institutions that don't deserve any respect.'' 
 How far the movement can go and whether it can remain peaceful remains to be seen and may depend on how deep the suspicions of fraud, as seen in Mexico, run. 
 What is sure is that Mr. Lopez Obrador has defined himself for many voters as the candidate who lost the election, not through his own errors but because the entire apparatus of the state was against him. That is an old tune in Mexico, one that many know the words to.

HEADLINE: Ford and G.M. Talk of Quality As They Try to Court Buyers

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 6 

 BODY:
After years of trying to court customers with ever-larger discounts, General Motors and the Ford Motor Company are now vying to prove that each is more willing to stand behind the vehicles it builds. 
 They also hope to persuade consumers who started buying Toyotas and Hondas out of frustration that the quality problems that have plagued American vehicles have been fixed.
G.M. said on Wednesday that it would extend warranty coverage of the engine and transmission on all 2007 vehicles to five years or 100,000 miles, whichever occurs first. Most vehicles previously came with a powertrain warranty of three years or 36,000 miles, which is the industry standard.
 The move allows G.M. to boast that it offers ''the best coverage of any full-line automaker,'' two months after Ford extended warranties on its vehicles and claimed that distinction. Both automakers took a cue from Hyundai, the South Korean automaker whose reputation for poor quality nearly drove it out of the American market before it introduced a 10-year, 100,000-mile warranty in 1998. Hyundai's annual sales have more than quadrupled since. 
 ''Some people don't put us on their consideration list because of their perception of some historical problems,'' G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, said on Wednesday outside the company's headquarters.
 Mr. Wagoner said G.M. had significantly reduced the amount it spent repairing vehicles and decided to lengthen warranties as part of a strategy to enhance the value of its vehicles. 
 Although Ford and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler indicated that they had no plans to match G.M.'s offering, analysts said that warranties had emerged as the latest way for Detroit's automakers to try to set themselves apart.
 ''This is a method of providing an additional benefit to the consumer without using incentives,'' said Tom Libby, senior director of industry analysis at J. D. Power and Associates, which surveys consumers on vehicle quality.
 But whether car shoppers will respond to longer warranties is unclear. Warranties usually appear low on the list of reasons consumers buy a vehicle, according to J. D. Power data.
 At the same, Wall Street often dislikes longer warranties because they expose automakers to more risk.
 ''It's a dangerous game to play'' unless repair costs are truly under control, said David E. Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''This is an area that you can get into a lot of trouble.''
 Ford, which covers powertrain repairs for up to five years or 60,000 miles on most vehicles and six years or 70,000 miles on Lincoln models, said dealers liked the change. The protection, like G.M.'s, can be transferred if the vehicle is sold.
 ''It's been a very good closing tool on the showroom floor,'' said a Ford spokesman, Jim Cain. ''Over time, we expect that it's going to have a very significant impact on purchase consideration.''
 But it could also have the opposite effect on some potential customers.
 Some automakers, particularly those who have honed reputations for building high-quality vehicles, view longer warranties as ''a sign of weakness,'' Mr. Libby said. ''The consumer starts to wonder, 'Is there a reason I need this?' ''

HEADLINE: Just Days to Go From 0 to 60 at Ford

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting from Detroit for this article.

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Sept. 6 

 BODY:
The day after he was named the Ford Motor Company's new chief executive, Alan R. Mulally walked onto a stage with his boss, William Clay Ford Jr., before hundreds of applauding Ford employees, with thousands more watching via the company's Web site and closed-circuit television.
 Once the clapping died down, the questions, many of them pointed, began. Even though Mr. Mulally will not start until Oct. 1, the interrogation suggested that his honeymoon with employees at the struggling automaker could be short.
They wanted to know about Mr. Mulally's relationships with unions at Boeing, his former company, said people who attended the meeting. Others asked how he tried to motivate Boeing's workers while making deep cuts, and whom he might bring in from the outside to help devise the company's strategy. 
 At that, Mr. Mulally responded: ''It's us. It's the team. It's the leaders.''
 After 37 years at Boeing, Mr. Mulally, 61, now is among the leaders at Ford, where he must quickly get up to speed during one of the company's most severe financial crises. As soon as next week, Ford will unveil the next steps in its aggressive turnaround plan, called the Way Forward, that could include more job cuts, plant closings and revamping steps.
 So in short order, Mr. Mulally, who has never worked in the auto industry, must develop the fingertip feel of ''a car guy.'' He has to recharge employees who have seen an American icon humbled by relentless competition, and overhaul its factories to become more lean and flexible by building different models on the same assembly line. 
 Perhaps most important, he must establish a relationship with his new boss, Mr. Ford, who has served as chief executive for the last five years, as well as with the larger Ford family. There are two family members on the board and three others besides Mr. Ford in company jobs. 
 They are eager to see results -- Ford shares have lost half their value since the company's 100th anniversary in 2003.
 Mr. Mulally said this week that he was eager to get started. His first task is ''bonding with the team and getting deeply involved in the business environment and the strategy and the plan to prosper,'' Mr. Mulally said in an interview.
 ''There's nothing more fun than the first business plan review and the first product strategy meeting,'' he added.
 Although Mr. Mulally came close to spending his entire career at one company, he does appear to have a taste for new challenges -- like the 10 days he spent at Southwest Airlines in 1981 to research a thesis he was writing about the airline for a Sloan Fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 Mr. Mulally, then 36, loaded baggage, handled reservations, even went to flight attendant training classes, barely able to catch his breath.
 The endurance test paid dividends, however. He cemented his relationship with Southwest's co-founder, Herbert D. Kelleher Jr., whose airline has since spent billions of dollars on Boeing 737's, the only plane it flies. 
 The boot camp showed that Mr. Mulally ''had the potential to become the business leader we have seen him become,'' said Mr. Kelleher, who added that he still calls Mr. Mulally ''my intern.''
 But Mr. Mulally already understood aviation. He faces a sharp learning curve at Ford and must get his arms around an industry that turns out products at a much faster pace and has many more competitors than Boeing faced. 
 His experience at Boeing has prepared him for some of his challenges at Ford, but not all.
 Mr. Mulally said he respected unions even if he could not guarantee the pay, benefits and numbers of jobs that were once a given. ''You never go after the union as an institution,'' he said. ''My approach is to respect them and together lay out a business plan that involves all the constituents.''
 But with the deep job cuts at Boeing, Mr. Mulally clashed with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. ''He definitely has his work cut out for him with labor relations,'' said Scott Hamilton, managing director of the Leeham Company, an aviation analysis firm. 
 The conflict peaked last year when Boeing was struck by 18,000 Machinists union members, a standoff that was settled with help from Richard A. Gephardt, the former House majority leader.
 The best way to win over union workers at Ford, of course, is to get the company growing. And that will require hot new products that sell without incentives.
 Mr. Mulally appears eager to join the ranks of car guys in Detroit. 
 ''Automobiles are neat; they're exciting,'' he said. ''We need them as part of our lives and to get a chance to do this with the Ford company is very, very exciting to me.''
 It may take him some time to fully remove his Boeing hat. During Tuesday's news conference, he talked about his interest in helping Ford ''continue making the best airplanes.'' He then corrected himself to say ''the best cars in the world.''
 One lesson he learned at Boeing was the value of making big bets on live-or-die products. The prime example is the new 787 jet, nicknamed the Dreamliner, into which Boeing poured billions of dollars in development and marketing. Scheduled to begin flying in two years, the 787 is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than the plane it replaced, the 757. 
 Despite industry skepticism, fueled by two earlier Boeing miscues with new products, the Dreamliner has become a hit, winning more than 400 orders so far. That was a relief to Mr. Mulally, after Boeing failed to find customers for a high-speed jet called the Sonic Cruiser and a stretch version of the 747 jumbo jet. 
 Mr. Mulally's best results at Boeing can be found on its factory floors. ''He really knows production,'' Mr. Kelleher said. ''He believes in continuous improvement, every hour of every day.''
 On Wednesday, Mr. Mulally, who holds engineering degrees from the University of Kansas, told Ford employees about Boeing's efforts to reduce its factory space to 31 million square feet, from 71 million square feet. 
 That action came as Boeing streamlined and modernized the processes it used to produce its aircraft, eliminating thousands of jobs and cutting $1 billion from the inventory it kept on hand. 
 Many of its ideas were borrowed from Toyota as well as Ford; Mr. Mulally studied the development team that created the Taurus family sedan in the 1980's.
 ''Just take a look at what he's done with job reduction, outsourcing, inventory control and lean manufacturing, and that's what you're going to see happen at Ford,'' Mr. Hamilton said.
 Mr. Mulally will find ample opportunity inside Ford's factories. Despite the industry's shift to flexible plants that can build more than one type of vehicle, far too many of Ford's plants produce the same product, such as the F-series pickup, which is built in five factories.
 That was not a problem when pickup sales were rising, but their decline this year in the face of high gas prices forced Ford to cut production by 21 percent during the final three months of the 2006 model year, its biggest reduction since the early 1980's.
 Mr. Ford, who announced the cuts last month, said this week that Mr. Mulally's manufacturing acumen was a crucial reason he was offered the job. By doing so, Mr. Ford gave up two of his titles and retreated to the chairman's position, which he has held since 1998.
 But, Mr. Ford emphasized Tuesday, ''I'm still going to be around.'' And that means that along with managing his new company, Mr. Mulally will have to learn to manage Mr. Ford.
 Company insiders say Mr. Ford views the relationship as owner and manager, akin to a sports team such as his family's Detroit Lions, where neither can be successful without the other.
 Ford has other owners, too, specifically the Ford family, which controls Ford through a special class of stock available only to family members. 
 Through the years, relations between Ford and its company managers have ranged from cordial to contentious. One chief executive, Alexander J. Trotman, resisted efforts by Mr. Ford for a greater role in company affairs, derisively dubbing him ''Prince William.''
 But family ownership was also a factor at Boeing. Members of the McDonnell family, founders of McDonnell-Douglas, which merged with Boeing in 1997, own nearly 11 million shares, or 1.36 percent of the company, making them Boeing's largest individual holders.
 Mr. Mulally's relationship with the Ford family hinges on their realization that ''their way is not working, and they have to have something different,'' Mr. Hamilton said.
 Mr. Mulally, for his part, said he was excited about working at a place where the fates of a family and a company were intertwined. ''I would never have thought of this but the minute I met Bill, I understood what he wanted to do,'' he said this week. ''Part of it is timing and luck.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo and Green Rivalry Sharpens in Final Debate 

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The Democratic candidates for attorney general met in their final joint appearance yesterday in a debate that highlighted the intensifying tension between the two leading candidates, Mark Green and Andrew M. Cuomo.
 In the debate, sponsored by the New York City Bar Association, Mr. Cuomo struck back forcefully amid Mr. Green's attacks on Mr. Cuomo's record as secretary of housing and urban development in the Clinton administration and his ethical conduct after leaving that cabinet post.
It also represented the new competitive dynamic of the primary campaign, since it was the first with just Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Green and Sean Patrick Maloney, a former aide to President Bill Clinton. On Tuesday, another candidate, Charlie King, a former chairman of the New York County Democratic Party, dropped out of the race, but he will remain on the Sept. 12 primary ballot. 
 In the debate, Mr. Green harshly criticized Mr. Cuomo, saying he ''sued a slumlord and went to work for that slumlord and earned $1.2 million in two years and got $800,000 in campaign contributions from him.''
 Mr. Green, a former New York City public advocate, was referring to an article published in The Village Voice yesterday. It reported that Mr. Cuomo, while housing secretary, pursued legal action against a businessman, Andrew L. Farkas, who later settled the case with federal officials in an agreement signed by Mr. Cuomo's counsel. Years later, Mr. Cuomo went to work for Mr. Farkas's new company, earning $1.2 million over two years. Mr. Farkas and his associates have also contributed $800,000 to Mr. Cuomo's campaign.
 ''I'm not here making personal attacks but programmatic criticism,'' Mr. Green said.
 Mr. Cuomo did not address the substance of Mr. Green's criticism, nor the Voice article. But he responded by calling his rival a master of negative campaigning. ''My opponent has been running for office for many, many, many years,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''And the one consistent thing is that he will go down in the history books for the most negative campaigns.''
 In the closing days of a campaign in which Mr. Cuomo has raised more money and received a larger share of political and labor endorsements, Mr. Green has sought to get traction with a series of attacks aimed at his opponent. He has also touted his endorsement by The New York Times editorial page. (And in a twist, Mr. Cuomo has also used a snippet from that endorsement that is critical of Mr. Green in his own campaign ad.) 
 At a press conference after the debate at the bar association's Midtown headquarters, Mr. Green said he felt there was still ample time to reverse any advantage Mr. Cuomo might hold. ''He has had every advantage except the one that counts: The best record,'' Mr. Green said, standing with several prominent lawyers who had endorsed him.
 Yesterday's debate was the last in which Mr. Cuomo has agreed to participate. He declined invitations for three televised debates in the weeks leading up to the election.
 Supporters of Mr. Green suggested that Mr. Cuomo did not want to risk the possibility of a poor performance in front of larger television audiences.
 However, Mr. Cuomo said that he has taken part in dozens of appearances with the other candidates and that he has found other methods of getting his message to voters to be more effective.
 While Mr. Cuomo was having his ethics questioned by his opponent, he did get one high-level endorsement yesterday, when the Rev. Al Sharpton endorsed him. Mr. Sharpton often tangled with Mr. Cuomo's father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
 In an interview yesterday, Mr. Sharpton said that his endorsement was based on the ''need to unite and be prepared for November,'' explaining that Democrats expected a vigorous race between their nominee and the Republican candidate, Jeanine F. Pirro.
 ''Andrew Cuomo and I have not always been on the same page,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''But we've always been on the same book when it came to civil rights and economic issues. I felt that he was the best option at this point for those of us who want to see an attorney general's office that was aggressive in dealing with the issues of civil rights and the environment.''
 Mr. Sharpton said he will be campaigning alongside Mr. Cuomo at churches in Brooklyn and Harlem this weekend.
 When asked why he had not endorsed Mr. Green, Mr. Sharpton said that he harbored some displeasure with Mr. Green's campaign tactic of criticizing Mr. Cuomo's record on a nearly daily basis.
 It was also clear that there remained lingering bitterness from the 2001 mayoral race, when Mr. Green ran for mayor. Shortly before the Democratic primary runoff between Mr. Green and Fernando Ferrer, operatives of the Green campaign sought to rally white voters in Brooklyn by insinuating that Mr. Ferrer was beholden to Mr. Sharpton, in part by distributing fliers with demeaning caricatures of Mr. Sharpton.
 ''What bothers me is that I think he engages in the politics of desperation that sets in during the last days of his campaigns,'' Mr. Sharpton said yesterday. ''He tries to win by using crash-and-burn tactics. It only leads to Republican conservative victories. We can't have a repeat of 2001, because it will come back to haunt us.''

Broadway

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)

* 'SEVEN GUITARS' (2:45). Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)

'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

Spectacles

'ABSINTHE' Think Cirque du Soleil as channeled through ''Rocky Horror'' and painted by George Grosz. Part cabaret, part circus, ''Absinthe'' aims for a kind of seedy decadence that's mingled with the simple, aw-shucks wonder of knife-jugglers, sword-swallowers and a man creating constructions out of soap bubbles. It's the main event at the Spiegeltent, a vintage European tradition visiting South Street Seaport this summer (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette)

'REVEREND BILLY AND THE CHURCH OF STOP-SHOPPING' Reverend Billy (a k a the performance artist Bill Talen) struts and preaches his way across the Spiegeltent stage accompanied by a choir and a fine seven-piece band. Radical political theater has rarely been more thoughtful or fun (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (George Hunka)

Long-Running Shows

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). 2005 New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)

'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'CREATION: A CLOWN SHOW' Lucas Caleb Rooney is a cross between Red Skelton and Will Ferrell in this sweet, funny, poignant, mostly one-man show about the biblical story of earth's first seven days (1:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Gates)

'HENRIK IBSEN + JON FOSSE: NORWAY MEETS NEW YORK' Ibsen's late-19th-century ''Rosmersholm'' and Fosse's contemporary ''deathvariations'' both deal with suicide, among other life dramas. The Ibsen has problems, but the Fosse is often stunning and fiercely poetic (2:00 and 1:15). At the 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Gates)

* 'KIKI AND HERB: ALIVE ON BROADWAY' This transcendental lounge act -- made up of Kiki (Justin Bond), a molting songbird for all seasons, and Herb (Kenny Mellman), her happily suffering shadow and accompanist -- has the heat and dazzle of great balls of fire. Vital, funny and surprisingly affecting (2:00). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

'MR. DOOLEY'S AMERICA' Martin J. Dooley, the wisest fictional pub owner in 1890's Chicago, brings his old newspaper columns back to life with funny, surprisingly timely issues-of-the-day commentary in this likable two-man play (1:40). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737; closing on Sunday. (Gates)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'ACCEPTED' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A clever slacker and his oddball crew invent a phony college in this passable example of that oxymoronic genre, the Hollywood comedy about sticking it to the man. (Nathan Lee)

'THE ANT BULLY' (PG, 90 minutes) A young boy goes to live among the ants, who talk remarkably like Academy Award-winning actors. (A. O. Scott)

'BARNYARD' (PG, 88 minutes) The barnyard animals in this crude 3-D animation walk, talk and party down like human beings. Way too often the male ''cows,'' as the film calls them, also flash their udders. (Manohla Dargis)

'BEERFEST' (R, 110 minutes) In ''Beerfest,'' a gaseous celebration of binge drinking and family honor, the five comedians known collectively as Broken Lizard head for Munich and an underground beer-guzzling contest. Best viewed while sloshed, the movie is idiotic, tasteless and irrepressibly good-natured: in other words, a frat-house classic. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, ''Boynton Beach Club'' is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Stephen Holden)

'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt-putt-putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)

'The Celestine Prophecy' (PG, 100 minutes) A delectable fusion of New Age babble and luridly bad filmmaking based on the best-selling book by James Redfield. (Dargis)

'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)

'CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WOMEN' (No rating, 84 minutes) Two old flames meet, years after parting, and have a short fling. An arch, banal conceit, of some interest for Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter's performances and the split-screen gimmick that keeps them apart even in their intimate moments. (Scott)

'CRANK' (R, 83 minutes) A poisoned hit man rampages in Los Angeles, doling revenge on his nemesis and misanthropy on all. Basically a broken-down retread of ''Speed,'' with Jason Stratham as the bus. (Lee)

'CROSSOVER' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Bling is bad, and friends are good in this story of temptation, rivalry and cheerleaders, set in the world of Detroit street basketball. (Lee)

* 'THE DESCENT' (R, 99 minutes) A total horror freakout from the British writer and director Neil Marshall about six women on a caving expedition who meet their fears and some scary monsters, too. (Dargis)

'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)

* 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis)

* 'Gabrielle' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chereau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haut-bourgeois Parisian marriage, around 1912. (Dargis)

* 'Half Nelson' (R, 107 minutes) In their beautiful bummer about the relationship between a white teacher (Ryan Gosling) and a black student (Shareeka Epps), the gifted young director Ryan Fleck and his writing partner, Anna Boden, offer a lament for the radical fires of the 1960's and a suggestion for life and politics after the new left. (Dargis)

* 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)

'HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS' (PG, 98 minutes) The worms go in, the worms go out, but mostly the worms go into the frying pan in Bob Dolman's engaging and yucky adaptation of the Thomas Rockwell book. (Dargis)

* 'HOUSE OF SAND' (R, 115 minutes, in Portuguese) Beautifully shot in a sandy, remote corner of northern Brazil, this film tells the story of three generations of women, all of them played by Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres, mother and daughter in real life and two of the national treasures of Brazilian cinema. (Scott)

'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) Andre Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a Andre 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis)

* 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden)

* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott)

'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. While Disney piles on the uplift, the director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis)

* 'LASSIE' (PG, 100 minutes) Everything old is new again in the 11th film about the beloved pooch with the I.Q. of a grad student and the instincts of a boomerang. Blissfully restored to the period and location of Eric Knight's original novel -- pre-World War Britain -- the movie balances humor and pathos with old-fashioned charm and not a trace of satire. Progressive adults may balk at the film's ultimate capitulation to the power of patronage, but tykes will just be happy that Lassie has come home once more to the multiplex where she belongs. (Catsoulis)

'LADY IN THE WATER' (PG-13, 108 minutes) In this watchable folly, Paul Giamatti plays a building manager who encounters a menagerie of otherworldly creatures, most important Bryce Dallas Howard's water nymph. The writer and director M. Night Shyamalan wants us to believe, mostly in the myth of his own genius. (Dargis)

'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Lee)

* 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)

'MATERIAL GIRLS' (PG, 97 minutes) The real-life sisters Hilary and Haylie Duff star in this incompetent spin on the poor-little-rich-girl story from, alas, Martha Coolidge. (Dargis)

* 'MIAMI VICE' (R, 133 minutes) This updating of the 1980's television series cost more than the annual budget of the real-life Miami Police Department, making it the most expensive experimental art film ever made. (Scott)

* 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. Three intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott)

'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' (PG-13, 151 minutes) Although there are memorable bits and pieces, this is a movie with no particular interest in coherence, economy or feeling. (Scott)

'PRINCESAS' (No rating, 109 minutes, in Spanish) This maudlin melodrama about prostitutes in Madrid is not, alas, the new film by Pedro Almodovar, but a dilution of his manner by the writer-director Fernando Leon de Aranoa. (Lee)

'Pulse' (PG-13, 87 minutes) Evil technology menaces idiotic teenagers in this cynical remake of a Japanese horror film. (Lee)

'QUEENS' (No rating, 107 minutes, in Spanish) A dithering but generous Spanish farce, ''Queens'' follows the forthcoming nuptials of three gay couples by focusing on their overbearing mothers. While the sons dance, bicker and fret over antiques, the mamas express their discomfort with the wedding plans by seducing inappropriate men. Despite obvious nods to Pedro Almodovar, ''Queens'' is notable only for its unadulterated worship of middle-aged women. (Catsoulis)

'THE QUIET' (R, 96 minutes) Neither ambitious enough to take seriously nor sleazy enough to enjoy, Jamie Babbit's good-girl, bad-girl face-off flirts with the trappings of exploitation cinema without going all the way. (Dargis)

* 'QUINCEANERA' (R, 90 minutes) This portrait of a Mexican-American family living in a Latino neighborhood of Los Angeles is as smart and warm-hearted an exploration of an upwardly mobile immigrant culture as American independent cinema has produced. (Holden)

'RIDING ALONE FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES' (PG, 108 minutes, in Mandarin) Zhang Yimou takes a pause between marital-arts extravaganzas with this simple, affecting melodrama about a mournful Japanese patriarch on an odyssey through rural China. (Lee)

'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)

* 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)

'SNAKES ON A PLANE' (R, 105 minutes) Snakes + plane + Samuel L. Jackson. David R. Ellis provides the fine B-movie-style direction, while Mr. Jackson supplies the cool and his trademark 13-letter epithet. (Dargis)

'STEP UP' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Ever since Kevin Bacon's rebellious hips ignited a small-town uproar in ''Footloose,'' the modern high school romance has placed a premium on rhythm. In ''Step Up'' a rough Baltimore kid (Channing Tatum), armed only with a killer smile and hip-hop moves, falls for a classically trained dancer (Jenna Dewan). Bland but likable, the movie fashions social equality from big musical numbers. If ballet and hip-hop can coexist, it asks, why can't we all be friends? (Catsoulis)

'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)

'MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND' (PG-13, 110 minutes) A shaky comedy from the director Ivan Reitman, in which ''Fatal Attraction'' meets ''Wonder Woman,'' by way of Uma Thurman, Luke Wilson and some sexist she-devil cliches, some funny, others not. (Dargis)

'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)

'TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Fast, fun and silly, with Will Ferrell as a Nascar driver, Sacha Baron Cohen as his nemesis, and a new course record for product placements per gallon. (Scott)

'13 Tzameti' (No rating, 90 minutes) The flashy black-and-white directorial debut of the Georgian filmmaker Gela Babluani is a sadistic, arty thriller that suggests a French New Wave film infected by a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism. (Holden)

'TRUST THE MAN' (R, 101 minutes) A strained, flatulent relationship comedy about two couples, from the writer and director Bart Freundlich. With Julianne Moore, David Duchovny, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Billy Crudup. (Dargis)

* 'ANDY WARHOL: A DOCUMENTARY FILM' (No rating, 4 hours with an intermission) Ric Burns's absorbing four-hour critical biography of this seminal Pop artist is devoted to the proposition that Warhol was the greatest artist of the second half of the 20th century, as Picasso was in the first. It makes a mostly persuasive, highly entertaining case for that claim. (Holden)

* 'WORLD TRADE CENTER' (PG-13, 129 minutes) From Oliver Stone, a return to the emotions of 9/11. Powerful and almost unbearably moving. (Scott)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

BAND OF HORSES (Sunday and Monday) With shimmering guitars that build from teardrops to epic heights and wraithlike, death-obsessed vocals (''At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral''), this Seattle band's songs both soar and sulk. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $17 in advance, $18 at the door. (Ben Sisario)

BEAUSOLEIL (Monday) Michael Doucet's band, Beausoleil, is the Cajun revival incarnate, determined both to preserve and extend bayou traditions. Mr. Doucet learned the scratch and drone of his fiddle style from the masters of Cajun and Creole music, and he's equally at home playing an old-fashioned two-step or rowdy swamp rock. At 7:30 p.m., with a free dance lesson at 6:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597, letszydeco.com; $25. (Jon Pareles)

JEFF BECK (Tuesday) The British Invasion guitar god, who may or may not have been satirized as Nigel Tufnel in the film ''This Is Spinal Tap,'' is on an unexpected but not unwelcome solo tour. At 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $45 and $75. (Sisario)

BORIS; PEARLS AND BRASS (Monday and Tuesday) And on a certain beer-buzzed day (whose ordinal number is forgotten), Deep Purple, the James Gang and Black Sabbath created fuzzy, head-nodding biker metal, and it was good. Many begats later, Pearls and Brass, a trio from Nazareth, Pa., is worshiping studiously at their altar, while Boris, a three-piece from Japan, warps and refracts the same influences in ways that can amplify their power or just make them really noisy and repetitious. Monday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; Tuesday at 9 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario)

BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Thursday) Electronica, a live rhythm section and a wildly cosmopolitan spirit meet a charismatic and unpredictable singer, Sabina Sciubba, in the Brazilian Girls. The music dips into reggae, samba, funk and house, never staying in one place for long. At 10 p.m., Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $30. (Pareles)

BROOKLYN COUNTRY MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) Though it may be stretching things a bit to call a one-night club gig a festival, this third annual event has a strong lineup of local honky-tonkers, among them Greg Garing, a stalwart of the New York country scene; the Demolition String Band, from Hoboken, N.J., which does a bluegrass version of Madonna's ''Like a Prayer''; and the Defibulators, who also know how to pick with a wink in songs like ''Armageddon Boogie.'' Others on the bill include Uncle Leon and the Alibis, the Wissler Family, Sweet William, Alex Battles's Whisky Rebellion, Kara Suzanne and the Gojo Hearts and the Lonesome Prairie Dogs. Beginning at 4 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, (718) 230-0236, brooklyncountrymusic.com or spsounds.com; $10. (Sisario)

* CAT POWER AND THE MEMPHIS RHYTHM BAND (Sunday) For her most recent album, ''The Greatest'' (Matador), Chan Marshall, the superbly rueful singer known as Cat Power, recorded in Memphis with a group of veteran soul players. The strutting rhythms, tender guitars and happy horns give her an expressive new vocabulary of sorrows, loves and joys; she hasn't sounded so inspired in years. At 6:30 and 10:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $27.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario)

GEORGE CLINTON AND THE P-FUNK ALL-STARS (Sunday) George Clinton's long-running band has become an American institution, using funk to subvert and outflank any Puritan reflexes. As P-Funk's leisurely jams amble from bubbling-mud funk to slow-grinding blues-rock to bits of doo-wop, jazz and hip-hop, the music is tight and loose at the same time. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $37.50 in advance, $42 at the door. (Pareles)

COMETS ON FIRE (Tonight) Serving as a reminder that psychedelic rock was as much about testosterone-flooded blues jams as about tangerine trees and marmalade skies, Comets on Fire, from Santa Cruz, Calif., reaches back to the loud legacy of Blue Cheer. With Soldiers of Fortune and Blues Control. At 11, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $14. (Sisario)

DEATH VESSEL (Monday) As Death Vessel, Joel Thibodeau, a transplant to Brooklyn from the low-fi scene in Providence, R.I., sings bittersweet, bluegrass-inspired elegies in a hauntingly high, almost feminine voice. With Dilly Dilly and Fence Kitchen. At 9 p.m., Pete's Candy Store, 709 Lorimer Street, between Frost and Richardson Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-3770, petescandystore.com; free. (Sisario)

DEVOTCHKA (Tonight and tomorrow night) DeVotchKa, from Denver, is the most musically versatile band of the Gypsy-punk trendlet of the last few years. It does its share of wild fiddling and rug-cutting, but also plays moody, carefully textured ballads that can recall the Tindersticks. At midnight, Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $20. (Sisario)

* DR. OCTAGON, MR. LIF, BEANS (Tomorrow and Sunday) Kool Keith was already one of the most eccentric figures in rap when he unveiled his Dr. Octagon project a decade ago. But with one brilliantly bizarre album he instantly trumped all as the most clever and twisted mind in the game, his non sequiturs revealing both raunchiness and a kind of innocence. Kool Keith recently released ''The Return of Dr. Octagon'' (OCD); it's no classic, but a good excuse for him to revisit the character. Also on the bill are two of underground rap's best: Mr. Lif, a politically minded M.C. from Boston, and Beans, formerly of New York's Antipop Consortium. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Sunday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $22 in advance, $24 at the door. (Sisario)

GOV'T MULE, WOLFMOTHER (Tomorrow) The last concert at McCarren Park Pool this season features Gov't Mule, the Southern-rock-meets-Led-Zeppelin band led by the Allman Brothers guitarist Warren Haynes; and Wolfmother, an Australian group whose retro wayback machine stops at screamy mid-60's garage rock and then forwards a few years to the proto-metal bacchanals of Black Sabbath. Also on the bill is Two Gallants. At 4 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171; $38.50 in advance, $45 at the door. (Sisario)

PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK MUSIC (Today and tomorrow) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Mr. Green offers an extensive rock curriculum at his school in Philadelphia, teaching youngsters the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. The students have made frequent visits to CBGB, and today and tomorrow afternoon show off their mastery of the works of Van Halen. 5 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; $10. (Sisario)

JOE LALLY (Tuesday) Mr. Lally's smooth and beautifully muscular bass lines steadied the sound of Fugazi, the alt-rock granddaddies from Washington, D.C. His first solo album, recorded while Fugazi is on hiatus, is due next month. With Antelope. At 8 p.m., Tap Bar, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $8. (Sisario)

* MASTODON (Tonight) Until Mastodon released ''Leviathan'' two years ago, the world lacked an extreme metal album based on Melville's ''Moby-Dick''; thankfully, it's an extraordinary piece of work, dense and exhilarating and fully attentive to every slashing sonic detail, as is the band's new album, ''Blood Mountain'' (Warner Brothers), to be released on Tuesday. With Converge, from Salem, Mass., and the Bronx, from Los Angeles. At 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $17. (Sisario)

ASHA PUTHLI (Wednesday) A trailblazing Indian singer who has performed with everybody from Ornette Coleman to Ashford and Simpson, Ms. Puthli makes a rare appearance: this summer she played New York for the first time in 25 years in an abbreviated set at Central Park SummerStage. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario)

RADIO BIRDMAN (Tonight) In the mid-70's, Radio Birdman kick-started the Australian punk scene with a brawny, speedy style drawn from Detroit groups like the MC5 and the Stooges. (Not a coincidence: one of Radio Birdman's guitarists, Deniz Tek, grew up in Ann Arbor, Mich.) Thirty years after its first record, the band makes its New York debut. With the Rogers Sisters and Easy Action. At 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $25. (Sisario)

ROGUE WAVE (Wednesday) Harking back to the weepy and grandiose shoe-gazer bands of the late 80's and early 90's, like My Bloody Valentine, Rogue Wave, from Oakland, Calif., paints dreamily noisy washes with distorted guitars and maudlin pillow talk (''You can never publish my love''). With Jason Collett. At 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $15. (Sisario)

SHAKIRA, WYCLEF JEAN (Tonight) Their flirty duet ''Hips Don't Lie'' was one of the biggest hits of the summer, perhaps because its odd stabs at political commentary (''Why the C.I.A. wanna watch us?/ Colombians and Haitians/ I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction,'' Mr. Jean raps) are no match for its old-fashioned, steamy body language (''I'm on tonight/ My hips don't lie/ And I am starting to feel you, boy,'' Shakira replies). At 8, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $19.50 to $129.50. (Sisario)

MARTA TOPFEROVA (Tuesday) A Czech singer whose heart is in Latin American music, Ms. Topferova dips into styles from across the Caribbean and South America -- Cuban son, Venezuelan joropo, Puerto Rican bomba -- plays the small Caribbean guitar called a cuatro and sings with an elegant longing in her voice. At 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Pareles)

* M. WARD, OAKLEY HALL (Thursday) On his mesmerizing new album, ''Post-War'' (Merge), M. Ward mingles political indignation, however oblique (''He was a good man and now he's gone,'' goes ''Requiem,'' about a fallen soldier), with a languid, surrealistic melancholy. Oakley Hall, from Brooklyn, mutates patient country-folk into dense, psychedelic drones. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Sisario)

ROGER WATERS (Tuesday and Wednesday) It's been two months since the death of Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd's first leader and an inventor of psychedelic rock, as well as one of the most famous casualties of its lifestyle. Now Mr. Waters, billing himself as ''the creative genius of Pink Floyd,'' is touring with a live version of ''The Dark Side of the Moon,'' the band's epochal 1973 concept album about insanity. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; sold out. (Sisario)

THE WHO (Wednesday) Down to just Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey (with hired guns), the Who has made an ambitious play by recording its first new album in 24 years, to be released next month. But the real surprise is just how good it is; based on ''Wire & Glass,'' the teaser EP released in Britain this summer, it is a throwback to the expansive, rock-opera brilliance of ''Quadrophenia.'' With Peeping Tom. At 8 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $58.50 to $258.50. (Sisario)

WIDESPREAD PANIC (Thursday) Widespread Panic, from Georgia, leans toward the Southern-rock side of the Allman Brothers-Grateful Dead axis, but like any good jam band, it's flexible and then some. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $50. (Pareles)

WORLD PARTY (Tomorrow) For a few albums as World Party in the 1980's and 90's, Karl Wallinger borrowed worshipfully and unapologetically from the holy texts of 60's rock -- Beatles, Stones, Dylan, Beach Boys -- prefiguring the now-omnipresent retro-rock trend. He recently returned after a long recovery from a debilitating aneurysm, and has rejiggered his last album, ''Dumbing Up'' (Seaview), for rerelease. With Gina Villalobos. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)

THE BAD PLUS/JASON MORAN AND THE BANDWAGON (Tuesday through Thursday) Two trios, both plumbing the territory between melodic abstraction and gut-level groove, both featuring an erudite pianist and both involving a turbulent and unconventional drummer. This may turn out to be the most thought-provoking double bill to come under a mainstream banner this fall. (Through Sept. 17.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

JOEL HARRISON PRESENTS VOX AMERICANA (Monday) Mr. Harrison is a guitarist whose singing and songwriting lean on American folk traditions. Here he performs an hourlong suite called ''Vox Americana,'' in seven parts; it's an intercontinental saga for a chamber ensemble including David Binney on saxophones, Todd Reynolds on violin and electronics and Dan Weiss on drums and tabla.

LOUIS HAYES'S CANNONBALL ADDERLEY LEGACY BAND (Tonight and tomorrow night) Julian (Cannonball) Adderley was an alto saxophonist who balanced bebop's harmonic precision with home-grown grit and soul. This crisp tribute band, led by his former drummer Louis Hayes, features the worthy Vincent Herring on alto saxophone.

CHARLIE HUNTER TRIO (Through Sunday) Charlie Hunter is a guitarist with a natural affinity for groove, as he has demonstrated with a handful of sturdy bands over the last decade or so.

J. E./EXPERIMENT FEATURING BILAL (Tonight) Like the Robert Glasper Experiment, which features the piano playing of Mr. Glasper and the drumming of Chris Dave, the Jabane Ensemble (J. E.) draws liberally from R&B, gospel, hip-hop and electronic music.

JEWELS AND BINOCULARS (Tomorrow) This collective trio exclusively interprets songs by Bob Dylan, a mission it has upheld on two well-received albums, with a third on the way. Michael Moore plays clarinet and saxophones, Lindsey Horner plays bass, and Michael Vatcher plays percussion. It's unclear whether their set list will include any songs from Mr. Dylan's new Columbia album, ''Modern Times.''

DAVID LIEBMAN 60TH-BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Liebman, an incantatory saxophonist and flutist working in the post-Coltrane idiom, leads four separate bands next week.

At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; members, $12. (Chinen)

TONY MALABY TUBA TRIO (Wednesday) Tony Malaby, a versatile and increasingly prominent tenor saxophonist, convenes an exploratory trio with Marcus Rojas on tuba and John Hollenbeck on drums and percussion; the name of the trio is appropriate, given the central role that Mr. Rojas assumes. At 8 and 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)

* PAUL MOTIAN, JOE LOVANO, BILL FRISELL (Through Thursday) Mr. Motian, a drummer and composer, sets a tone for this blue-chip trio that's shadowy, slippery and as open-ended as a koan; his longtime partners are Joe Lovano on tenor and soprano saxophones and Bill Frisell on guitar. There's no better place to see them than at the Village Vanguard, where they've fruitfully recorded. (Through Sept. 17.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

TED NASH AND STILL EVOLVED (Tonight) A few years ago Mr. Nash, a tenor and soprano saxophonist involved with both the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra and the Jazz Composers Collective, released a strong quintet album called ''Still Evolved'' (Palmetto). He revisits some of that music here in a pared-down format, accompanied only by the pianist Frank Kimbrough and the bassist Rufus Reid. At 7 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, Ext. 344, rmanyc.org; $20. (Chinen)

JAMIE SAFT TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Saft is a keyboardist given to mystery and abstraction, but he's not averse to nestling into a groove. He interprets the music of Bob Dylan here, in a trio with the bassist Greg Cohen and the drummer Ben Perowsky. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

ANGELICA SANCHEZ (Tomorrow) In her piano playing as well as in her compositions, Ms. Sanchez seeks out the lyrical heartbeat within any avant-garde storm.

JOHN SCOFIELD REAL JAZZ TRIO (Through Sunday) The guitarist John Scofield has extensive history with the bassist Steve Swallow and the drummer Bill Stewart, and they recently made a superb album at the Note, ''EnRoute'' (Verve). You suspect that the name being applied to the trio here wasn't Mr. Scofield's idea -- would he describe his funkier projects as ''fake jazz''? -- but in any case, the music will be jazz, and powerfully real. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

* SOUND OF THE SORCERER: THE MUSIC OF HERMETO PASCOAL (Tomorrow) The influence of the visionary Brazilian composer Hermeto Pascoal has traveled far and wide, and this evening it will animate two different ensembles. The first is a chamber group led by the Brazilian pianist and flutist Jovino Santos Neto, featuring Paquito D'Rivera on clarinet and Mike Marshall on mandolin; the second is a big band led by the percussionist Bobby Sanabria that will give some of Mr. Pascoal's music its United States premiere. At 8:30 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $35. (Chinen)

LUCIANA SOUZA: BRAZILIAN DUOS (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Souza, a vocalist raised in Sao Paolo, has made some of her most beguiling music in this format, joined by a lone acoustic guitar. Romero Lubambo, the guitarist, is more than an accompanist: providing intricate counterpoint and rhythmic undertow, he is Ms. Souza's equal. (Through Sept. 17.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard , 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25. (Chinen)

WILLIAMSBURG JAZZ FESTIVAL (Sunday through Thursday) This grass-roots affair, which briefly floods a small swatch of Brooklyn with modern jazz, kicks off late Sunday night with a no-cover jam session (at Rose, 345 Grand Street, between Havemeyer and Marcy Streets), and continues through next week. One of its highlights is a program featuring bands led by the tenor saxophonist Seamus Blake and the bassist Chris Tarry, among others (Thursday at Galapagos, 70 North Sixth Street). (Through Sept. 16.) Times and locations vary; for a full schedule, visit fullcircledrumming.com/wjazzfestival. (Chinen)

MIGUEL ZENON AND THE RHYTHM COLLECTIVE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Zenon, a serious-minded young alto saxophonist from Puerto Rico, leads an aptly named ensemble of musicians with a similar cultural heritage: Aldemar Valentin on electric bass, Reynaldo deJesus on hand percussion and Tony Escapa on drums. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; members, $12. (Chinen)

* JOHN ZORN AND THE BOOK OF ANGELS (Sunday) The Oy!Hoo Festival -- also known as the New York Jewish Music and Heritage Festival -- kicks off with this kaleidoscopic tour through ''The Book of Angels,'' a body of 300 works composed by John Zorn during an apparently feverish three-month span. Mr. Zorn will play alto saxophone in Masada, his original avant-garde klezmer quartet, and with Electric Masada, his eight-piece improvising chamber group. And he will conduct both the Masada String Trio and the Kol Nidre String Orchestra, an ensemble named after the sacred Jewish prayer. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, oyhoo.com; $25 to $118. (Chinen)

 Opera

* 'LA BOHEME' AND 'CARMEN' (Tonight through Sunday) If promoters and presenters of classical music need proof that the steep cost of tickets discourages people, especially younger ones, from attending, they should stop by Lincoln Center for the New York City Opera's ''Opera-for-All'' programs. This weekend the series, introduced at the beginning of last season, offers the company's productions of Puccini's ''Boheme'' and Bizet's ''Carmen'' priced at $25 a seat, for any seat in the house. Tickets are sold on a first-come-first-served basis. Last year, the company reports, 71 percent of the audiences for ''Opera-for-All'' events had never been to the City Opera before. The productions tend to feature young, eager and attractive singers in stagings that emphasize opera as a vivid form of theater. Rinat Shaham sings the title role in ''Carmen'' (tomorrow night at 8); James Robinson's updated production of ''La Boheme'' features Shu-Ying Li as Mimi and James Valenti in his company debut as Rodolfo (tonight at 8 and Sunday at 1:30 p.m.). New York State Theater, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com. (Anthony Tommasini)

* 'SEMELE' (Wednesday) In the last 15 years the New York City Opera has become a haven for Handel. This season the company presents the New York stage premiere of ''Semele,'' a work the composer conceived and presented as a dramatic oratorio, though in the 20th century it was effectively staged. The City Opera's new production is by the director Stephen Lawless. The brilliant coloratura soprano Elizabeth Futral sings the title role. The charismatic mezzo-soprano Vivica Genaux, who has performed at the Metropolitan Opera and other major international companies, sings Juno. The impressive cast also includes Constance Hauman and Sanford Sylvan. Anthony Walker conducts. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $125. (Tommasini)

Classical Music

BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Monday, and Thursday) The weekend on Brooklyn's favorite floating concert hall begins with the second of two performances by the fine pianists Ursula Oppens and Jerome Lowenthal in an entertaining program of Mozart and variations on Wagner; it continues with a performance by the Shanghai String Quartet: works by Turina and Zhou Long, and string quartets by Barber and Ravel. On Thursday the pianist Maya Hartman gives a solo recital, playing Berger and Griffes, Mozart and Schumann. There is also a special 9/11 memorial concert on Monday (see box). Tonight, tomorrow, Monday and Thursday nights at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $30 for 65+; $20 for students; Monday's concert is free. (Anne Midgette)

ANDREA BOCELLI (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Bocelli occupies a small, glamorous and highly profitable space between grand opera and public entertainment. His personality and slight tenor voice have won him a big following, as witnessed by four sold-out concerts at Avery Fisher Hall, the last two of which are tonight and tomorrow night. Asher Fisch conducts the New York Philharmonic in this program of operatic favorites. At 8, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org. (Bernard Holland)

CONCERTANTE (Sunday) This young chamber group plays Boccherini's G minor String Quintet and Lowell Lieberman's ''One Plus Five.'' Later Anton Nel is the pianist in Elgar's estimable A minor Quintet. At 3 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, ekcc.org; $20. (Holland)

ETHEL (Tuesday) Funky and genre-defying, Ethel is the rock band of string quartets -- the term ''classical'' hardly applies to its brand of eclectic, hip music. The ensemble is celebrating the release of its second CD, ''Light'' (Canteloupe Records), with a concert featuring a mix of so-called EthelFaves (top requests from previous concerts) and new music; the CD includes compositions by Don Byron, Pamela Z, Mary Ellen Childs, Marcelo Zarvos, you name it. Audiences may not know exactly what hit them, but they usually like it. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Midgette)

HERMINE HASELBOCK (Tonight) This young Austrian singer and the pianist Istvan Bonyhadi bring late Romantic and early 20th-century Vienna to the Austrian Cultural Forum's tiny performing space. Songs are by Berg, Schoenberg, Franz Schreker and Zemlinsky. At 8, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, Ext. 222, acfny.org; free, but tickets are required. (Holland)

JENNY LIN (Tuesday) A smart musician, in the best sense of both words, Ms. Lin is forging a fine career exactly on her own terms, which include a strong commitment to contemporary and less-known music. Her canny program for the Austrian Cultural Forum's ''Mostly Modern'' festival balances Austrian and American composers, modern and contemporary: two 20th-century classics, Barber and Berg; two strong women, Ruth Crawford Seeger and Olga Neuwirth; and two young contemporary composers, Randy Nordschow and Johannes Maria Staud. At 8 p.m., 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, Ext. 222, acfny.org; free, but tickets are required. (Midgette)

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) After its preseason programs with the crossover sensation Andrea Bocelli, the Philharmonic under its music director Lorin Maazel opens its formal season on Wednesday. True to tradition, this gala offers familiar fare, Beethoven's ''Egmont'' Overture and ''Eroica'' Symphony. Mozart's joyous Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra in E flat, which does not turn up as often as it might, is the one novelty. The soloists in the concerto will be Emanuel Ax and Yefim Bronfman, who besides being excellent pianists, are also friends and New York neighbors. The music director, Lorin Maazel, conducts. Starting on Thursday night in the first subscription series program of the season, Mr. Maazel and his players offer more intriguing fare, with the American premiere of Hans Werner Henze's ''Sebastian im Traum''; Ravel's sultry ''Rapsodie Espagnole''; Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' Suite; and Bruch's most popular work, the Violin Concerto in G minor, with Itzhak Perlman as soloist. (There are three more performances of Thursday's program through Sept. 19.) At 7:30, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $85 tickets remaining on Wednesday, sold out on Thursday. (Tommasini)

Dance

Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.

THE BROOKLYN ADULT RECORDER CHOIR (Thursday) The name of this group turns out to be literal description rather than whimsy: a self-described ''ad-hoc group'' of some 60 performers trying to recapture the joys of those painful recorder lessons at school during ''In the Closet, Again, Again.'' The choreographer Beth Gill and the composer Chris Peck thought this up. From 7 to 10 p.m., the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $15, or pay what you will for Queens residents.(Roslyn Sulcas)

* DANCENOW/NYC (Tonight though Sunday and Thursday) The 12th season of this varied showcase, at Dance Theater Workshop through tomorrow and at Joe's Pub at the Public Theater from Thursday through next Saturday. Each program offers a plethora of dancers, most of them young and upwardly mobile. The complete schedule is at dancenownyc.org. Tonight at 7:30 ($20); tomorrow at 2 ($15), 5 (free), and 7:30 p.m. ($20), Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or dtw.org. Thursday at 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com or joespub.org; $20. (John Rockwell)

DANSCORES BY OFELIA LORET DE MOLA (Thursday) Although ''Aktun Spukil'' sounds like one of the crew on the Starship Enterprise, it is, according to Mexican lore, the name of a group of caves in which the Maya took shelter during battles. The work by the choreographer Ofelia Loret de Mola is the only dance offering in the Celebrate Mexico Now festival. . At 8 p.m. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 431-9233; $15, students $12. (Sulcas)

* EVENING STARS (Tonight and Sunday) The big late-summer free dance sampler in New York, presented by the River to River Festival with the Joyce Theater and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, offers a heavy-hitting triple bill tonight of Trisha Brown, Ashleigh Leite and Stephen Petronio, with a salsa chaser on Sunday: an amateur contest at 4 p.m. followed by a professional show at 7:30 that includes the contest winner. Battery Park, rivertoriver.com.(Rockwell)

NOEMI LAFRANCE (Wednesday and Thursday) Apparently Ms. LaFrance, a tireless artistic explorer of public space, is a glutton for punishment. Having moved bureaucratic mountains last year to stage ''Agora'' in the enormous (and empty) McCarren Park pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she now has a sequel, ''Agora II,'' which incorporates a number of guest companies and is described in the publicity materials as ''a choreographic game for one thousand bodies.'' Good luck to them all. At 8 p.m., McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street between Driggs and Bayard Streets, (718) 388-6309 or sensproduction.org; $20 and $30. (Sulcas)

LIVE ARTS FESTIVAL AND PHILLY FRINGE (Today through Thursday) Dance and performance art by 16 choreographers and companies will be presented this week in theaters in and around Center City Philadelphia, among them Kate Watson-Wallace; the Jo Stromgren Kompani; BalletX in dances by Jorma Elo and Matthew Neenan; Reggie Wilson; and Jeb Kreager. For information about the festival, which runs through Sept. 16: (215) 413-1318 or livearts-fringe.org; $10, $15 and $20, depending on the event, with some shows free. (Jennifer Dunning)

JEREMY NELSON (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Nelson will continue his investigation into physical turbulence in his new ''Mean Piece,'' a work for six dancers with sets and costumes by Luis Lara Malvacias. (Through Sept. 16.) At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $12. (Dunning)

New Ballet Choreographers (Wednesday) Ashley Bouder, Maria Kowrowski and Wendy Whelan are among the wonderful group of dancers from the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater Studio Company who will dance in this enticing program of new ballets to live music by the Masada String Trio. The choreographers are the City Ballet soloists Edwaard Liang and Tom Gold, and the former Ballet Theater dancer Brian Reeder. Mr. Gold is the wild card here -- the other two have budding reputations as promising ballet choreographers -- but he is in very good company. At 7 p.m., Miller Theater at Columbia University, 116th Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $35, Columbia students $7, non-Columbia students and Guggenheim Museum members, $21. (Sulcas)

At 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500 or 92Y.org; $10.(Dunning)

PENNSYLVANIA BALLET: TRIBUTE TO BARBARA WEISBERGER (Tomorrow) Not only will the program celebrate the 80th birthday of Ms. Weisberger, founder of the company and a feisty longtime voice for classical ballet in America, but it promises to be a nostalgic look back at the history of this important American troupe and of American ballet itself. The tribute will also raise money for a scholarship fund for young dancers. From 5 to 8 p.m., Philadelphia Art Alliance, 251 South 18th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 551-7000 ext. 1209 or www.paballet.org; $80 and $150. (Dunning)

ELKE RINDFLEISCH (Thursday) In Ms. Rindfleisch's new ''Damage,'' six dancers will struggle through a spreading inner disturbance to rock music by Chris Woltmann, performed live, through Sept. 16 and from Sept. 21 to 23. They end up nowhere, the choreographer says, or in places of unexpected tenderness in a set that fills the performance space with small alternative spaces. At 8 p.m., Wallabout Studio, 50 Taaffe Place, between Flushing and Park Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (917) 251-4561 or rindfleischdance.com; $15. (Dunning)

TEA Dance Company (Thursday) Sahar Javedani and Ella Ben-Aharon, the troupe's resident choreographers, will present their new ''Garden,'' which probes the notion of the pre-apple Eden as a metaphor for the personal acquisition of knowledge. At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street at Second Avenue, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+.(Dunning)

At 7:30 p.m., Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 752-3015 or japansociety.org; $28. (Dunning)

Art

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

 Museums

* American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)

BARD GRADUATE CENTER: ' LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE,' through Oct. 15. Aquamanilia sounds like the latest perfume or sorbet, but actually refers to the small, cunningly figurative medieval vessels used for ritual hand washing. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper-alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, aquamanilia are now having their first exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show has been drawn mostly from the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and overseen by the head of the museum's medieval department and its object conservator in collaboration with Bard graduate students. But don't worry about dryness. The aquamanile's triple function as totem, prestige object and pitcher lends it an undeniable energy. (The serpents are handles.) The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art; a versatile repertory of incised details and patterns; and a continuing, rarely resolved struggle between form and function. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Smith)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,' through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedeker's guides, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. And Church's oil sketches alone are worth the price of admission: exquisite, plainspoken Emersonian love poems to New York and New England. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 or ndm.si.edu. (Michael Kimmelman)

* Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Dec. 31. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Egypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, daheshmuseum.org. (Smith)

Dia:Beacon: 'Agnes Martin: A Field of Vision: Paintings from the 1980's,' through March. Dia:Beacon, a bulwark of Minimalism on the banks of the Hudson River north of Manhattan, has three permanent galleries devoted to the artist Agnes Martin. Over the last two years they have been used for a retrospective of her paintings, installed in decade-long increments. The fourth installment is now in place. If Martin's spare, lucid compositions of drawn lines and painted bands feel different from much of the art around them here, that is because she was not a Minimalist. In fact, she called herself an Abstract Expressionist, and she was adamant on this point. The 18 paintings here confirm her conviction, in a show as deep, light-glinting, restless and purposeful as the river flowing nearby.

* Frick Collection : 'Jean-Etienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Cotter)

Guild Hall Museum: 'Elizabeth Peyton,' through Oct. 22. Most of the 43 works in this exhibition portray beautiful people, some famous, some less so. Most immediately engaging is the tension between the painterly abstraction and the human subject matter. Images are realized in drippy swatches, squiggly lines and feathery dabs, and colors range from incandescent reds and oranges to pale lavenders and grays to dark velvety browns, blacks and purples. Yet for all that expressionistic action, likenesses are exacting. People like Nicole Kidman and Queen Elizabeth are rendered with seemingly effortless precision. A kind of erotic yearning animates how Ms. Peyton sees her subjects and how she makes her pictures. To paint, her works imply, is to be in love: to be in love with certain people and with painting itself. 158 Main Street, East Hampton, N.Y., (631) 324-0806. (Ken Johnson)

SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery. (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)

Katonah Museum of Art: 'Andromeda Hotel, the Art of Joseph Cornell,' through Sept. 17. Although Cornell never left the United States, he translated his dreams of faraway places into delicate, sometimes overly precious works that have a sense of longing. In this show the white-painted, weathered interior of a box titled ''Grand Hotel -- Hotel Taglioni'' (1954) contains incongruous elements of collage, among them an old ad for a French bakery topped by a color cutout of the ballerina Marie Taglioni, an object of the artist's adoration. Even simpler, but equally dreamy, is another weathered box, ''Hotel de l'Etoile'' (1950), which holds only a long, vertical image of a deep blue sky rife with thousands of tiny pinpoints of light. One of the show's most striking images is a surreal photograph of Cornell by Lee Miller in which he is seen gazing upward, entranced, his shoulder adorned with a miniature sailboat (around 1935). Route 22 at Jay Street, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-9555, katonahmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)

Morgan Library & Museum: CELEBRATING REMBRANDT: ETCHINGS FROM THE MORGAN, through Oct. 1. On the occasion of the opening of its newly rethought home, the Morgan Library has mounted a show of 50 of its greatest Rembrandt etchings. The selection demonstrates the range of the master's subjects (from the heights of biblical tragedy to the casually erotic) and also his amazingly expressive technique. It serves as reminder that Rembrandt's prints represent genius of the plainest, most accessible sort: sustaining classics that encompass the earthy and the exalted and offer fresh meanings with each encounter. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, www.themorgan.org. (Smith)

* MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog & DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)

NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer, through Sept. 18. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: Had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman)

* New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Cotter)

Wadsworth Atheneum: 'American Splendor: Hudson RiverSchool Masterworks From the Wadsworth Atheneum,' through Dec. 31. Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt,, a leading painter of the American West, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, www.wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)

Galleries: Uptown

* Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

* GALERIE DANIEL BUCHHOLZ AT METRO PICTURES This well-known Cologne gallery presents a surprisingly sweeping view of current art that includes Americans and Europeans and, despite its Conceptual slant, an impressive range of mediums and sensibilities. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)

HANS RICHTER (1888-1976), DADA; ART AND ANTI-ART This daunting yet partial survey is clogged with late paintings and reliefs that are for the most part elegant pastiches of Constructivism, Cubism and Abstract Expressionism. But it should be seen for the four short films from the 1920's, in which Richter's formalist and Dada sides balance beautifully, with elegantly Surrealist results. This is especially the case in the luminous ''Ghosts Before Breakfast,'' from 1927, which explores most of film's structural possibilities and segues briskly between abstraction and Hollywood narrative, while three skittering bowler hats provide continuity. Maya Stendhal Gallery, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, mayastendhalgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)

Other Galleries

'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Francoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, flcart.org through Oct. 16. (Johnson)

Last Chance

* Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings' This exhibition gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday.(Cotter)

* Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan' Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA' This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Kimmelman)

* JAMES J. WILLIAMS III: 'BY REQUEST, MY EPITAPH' Despite debts to artists like Jack Pierson, Karen Kilimnik, Richard Prince and Nan Goldin, this Haversham-ish environment and solo debut exude a promising fusion of modesty and narcissism. Its deep teal walls display scores of Polaroids, drawings, collages, notebooks and thrift-shop-worthy paintings, along with many of the artist's well-worn belongings. An illusion of stylish, if impoverished, full disclosure results. Self-conscious bohemianism teeters between nostalgia and irony, and art emerges as an incessant if nonchalant activity at the center of an eked-out existence. Envoy, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7524, envoygallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

HEADLINE: New York City Ad Firms Agree To Hire More Black Managers 

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL and STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Finding that just 2 percent of the upper echelon of the advertising industry is black, New York City officials said yesterday that they had reached agreements with several of the nation's biggest ad firms forcing them to bring more black managers into this crucial sector of the city's economy.
 The city's Human Rights Commission found that hiring of black workers had barely improved since an inquiry found similar problems 40 years ago. Of 8,000 employees working for 16 agencies the commission examined, Patricia L. Gatling, chairwoman of the commission, said about 22 percent make more than $100,000 a year, and only 2.5 percent of those are black. 
Faced with the findings, nearly a dozen agencies, including those owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies and the WPP Group, have promised to set numerical goals for increasing black representation on their creative and managerial staffs and to report on their progress each year.
 Under the agreements, the agencies have agreed to submit to three years of monitoring by the city, under which the companies will report hiring, promotion and retention figures to the commission each year. If they do not meet their goals, they will hire an outside consultant to help them do so, among other measures. 
 At the same time the companies have agreed to set up diversity boards and to link progress on the issue to their managers' compensation.
 The commission has the authority to fine companies up to $250,000 or to sue them, but officials said that they believed the threat of pressure from agency clients like Pepsi and Citigroup was a more effective stick in bringing corporate leaders to the negotiating table.
 ''In a city where African-Americans make up one-quarter of the population, with billions of dollars in purchase power, the lack of representation in the advertising industry is completely unacceptable,'' Ms. Gatling said at a meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington yesterday. ''There are plenty of secretaries and clerks, but very few African-Americans have risen much higher.'' 
 A former advertising executive first brought the problem to the attention of the commission, which decided to focus on black workers as officials discovered that they were more severely underrepresented than other groups, Ms. Gatling said.
 The city's ad industry has long had a huge economic and symbolic role in New York, accounting for 46,000 jobs in the city. The industry is a crucial part of the media nexus -- from TV networks to glossy magazines to Web design firms -- that help make New York City the nation's business capital. And the industry's failure to hire and promote minorities has put it at odds with its clients as they try to reach an increasingly polyglot consumer marketplace.
 By signing the agreements, which also require that agencies establish recruiting and internship programs through universities with large minority student populations, the agency executives can avoid the embarrassing prospect of testifying at public hearings scheduled for Sept. 25, at the start of the industry's annual gathering, Advertising Week. So far, of the 16 agencies subpoenaed to testify by the commission, only the agencies of the Omnicom Group have declined to work on an agreement, officials said.
 The commission's analysis, which looked at salary levels as well as job titles, indicated that although the major ad firms have black workers, they are largely absent from the most senior or creative levels. Of 476 employees at DDB's New York office, commission officials said, 51 are black. But of 159 employees making $100,000 or more, only 2 are black. Neither is among the 29 employees earning $200,000 to $300,000 or the 22 employees earning more than $300,000.
 A similar pattern exists across the industry, commission officials said. At BBDO, of 1,077 New York office employees, 104 are black. In the group making $100,000 or more, 6 employees are black; among the 140 who earn $100,000 to $200,000, there are only 5. Not one of the 89 employees who earn $200,000 to $300,000 is black, and among the 59 earning above $300,000, there is but one black employee.
 At Merkley & Partners, 10 of 207 employees are black. None earn more than $100,000.
 Through the years, the advertising industry has tried to make efforts to increase the diversity of its work force, in many instances spurred by agency clients: marketers want the staff members of the agencies to reflect the increasing diversity of the American consumer, so they can better aim their pitches at a multicultural shopper.
 One senior executive at a top agency said there had been previous investigations by the commission or its predecessors in 1968 and 1978, which led to reports being issued but nothing more. He spoke only when granted anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the agreement before it was formally announced.
 ''This represents a concrete step in the right direction,'' the senior executive said, because until now ''no agreement has ever been signed by any agency on this issue.'' Whatever efforts have been made before have been voluntary and informal, the senior executive said.
 ''The industry generally has recruiting issues,'' the senior executive said, adding: ''Let's be honest. Minorities are targeted broadly by everyone: Wall Street, Fortune 100 companies. Your top minority students have lots of opportunities outside advertising.''
 Interpublic, which owns agencies like Draft and Gotham, said the decision by four of its agencies to sign agreements with the city commission demonstrated how the firms ''will continue to make achieving an increasingly diverse work force and transparency on this issue major corporate priorities,'' said Philippe Krakowsky, an executive vice president at Interpublic.
 One company not party to the deal is Omnicom, which owns agencies like BBDO, DDB and Merkley. But Omnicom says it is pursuing its own strategy for diversifying its work force, making an arrangement with the City Council that does not involve setting specific hiring goals. 
 The company has promised to spend, for instance, at least $2.35 million to finance a diversity development program that will include an institute at Medgar Evers College from which the company will hire graduates. And it has pledged to recruit at historically black colleges around the country. The City Council has agreed to put up matching funds of $1 million for the institute.

HEADLINE: For Pods of Whales, Celebrity Status and Now a Lawsuit

BYLINE: By JESSICA KOWAL

DATELINE: FRIDAY HARBOR, Wash. 

 BODY:
''We saw your baby!''
 A crewman on a fishing boat shouted across open water to Kenneth C. Balcomb III, a zoologist whose work has helped turn killer whales into Puget Sound celebrities.
Mr. Balcomb has plied these waters for three decades on a mission to identify every killer whale, or orca, by the gray ''saddle patch'' behind its black dorsal fin. Half a million photographs later, the tribulations and triumphs of the three local orca pods, or families, that he follows are major news in the Pacific Northwest.
 When a newborn orca was missing for a few days in mid-August, local newspapers put it on the front page and television reporters in Seattle went up in helicopters to cover it. 
 ''People used to say, 'What good are they?' '' said Mr. Balcomb, 65, who started the low-budget Center for Whale Research on San Juan Island, 80 miles north of Seattle. ''Now they want to relate to the whales they've seen.''
 The public affection Mr. Balcomb and others have stirred up for these 10,000-pound creatures, the largest members of the dolphin family, has pushed the federal government to pay closer attention to their health, federal officials say. Last year, southern resident killer whales -- the 90 current members of J, K and L pods -- were added to the endangered species list. 
 By November, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service, an arm of the Department of Commerce, plans to establish boundaries for the ''critical habitat'' the three pods need to survive: 2,500 square miles in Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca that also constitute one of the nation's busiest waterways for commercial shipping.
 Once that map is completed, federal agencies will be required to consider the killer whales' well-being before approving projects or policies that would affect these waters wherever they are deeper than 20 feet. Thus, most areas close to the shoreline would not be affected, the fisheries service said. 
 Orca protection, though, has brewed its own legal battle in a region familiar with debates about endangered salmon and the northern spotted owl. Washington's homebuilders and farmers, assisted by a conservative legal foundation, have sued the federal government to strip the killer whales of their endangered status.
 Lawyers for these groups say the government should not distinguish orcas in Puget Sound from a healthy global population numbering in the tens of thousands. The state's Farm Bureau and Building Industry Association warn, in particular, that local governments might react to federal protection of the orcas by locking up land near streams or along the coast to improve water quality for the orcas and for salmon, their main food source. 
 ''Radical environmentalists'' are using killer whale protection to block otherwise legal economic activity, said Russell C. Brooks, a lawyer at the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is handling the case for the plaintiffs. 
 ''It all comes back to limiting development, limiting land use, limiting whatever, from people that probably want to run the nation's economic policy out of a tree house,'' Mr. Brooks said.
 At the Center for Whale Research, which is actually Mr. Balcomb's split-level home on the west coast of this island, there is an orca skull on a coffee table in the living room. From the kitchen window, Mr. Balcomb can scan the Haro Strait with high-powered binoculars. His son, Kelley Balcomb-Bartok, 43, receives orca updates every half-hour from spotters in Canada who work for the whale-watching industry. 
 A windowless room downstairs holds much of Mr. Balcomb's research: the vast archive of photographs and wall posters detailing each pod's matrilineal family tree. Females typically give birth every five years until age 40 and can live into their 90's. Males rarely live beyond 50. 
 Resident killer whales like those in Puget Sound behave differently from two other types, called transient and offshore orcas, that roam the oceans. The residents have tight family relationships, especially between mother and calf, and communicate in dialects understood by their relatives. They return to the same waters every year and mainly eat Chinook salmon. Transient whales eat seals, sea lions and other marine mammals.
 Puget Sound's killer whale population has increased in the past few decades, which the Pacific Legal Foundation has said is proof that local orcas are not headed toward extinction. 
 But Mr. Balcomb said the population had still not recovered since the late 1960's and early 1970's, when as many as 47 southern resident whales were captured and sent to public aquariums and water shows. And NOAA scientists say disease or a manmade disaster like an oil spill could send the population into rapid decline.
 ''If we lost them, it's not likely that they would be replaceable with just another killer whale,'' said Bob Lohn, regional administrator for the Fisheries Service.
 It has been a federal crime since 1972 to kill orcas and other marine mammals, but the federal government is a recent convert to broader orca protection. In 2001, the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit conservation group, asked the Fisheries Service to list the whales in the J, K and L pods as endangered. 
 The agency said then -- as the farmers and homebuilders argue now -- that federal law viewed them as members of a global species. After a lawsuit, a federal judge ordered the agency to reconsider, and NOAA added the animals to the endangered list in November 2005.
 The agency will pay Mr. Balcomb's center about $100,000 this year, in part to track the whales' winter travels, Mr. Lohn said. This will double the center's annual budget. Most of the rest of the budget comes from the Earthwatch Institute, which charges people $2,500 to spend 11 days photographing and identifying whales for Mr. Balcomb. 
 Outside Mr. Balcomb's house is an old school bus that he is painting to resemble a killer whale. It used to be decorated with the words ''Free Corky'' and ''Free Lolita,'' a reference to the two remaining Pacific Northwest killer whales that live in captivity in aquariums in, respectively, San Diego and Miami. 
 As Mr. Balcomb and others work on behalf of the larger orca population, they also imagine what it would be like to reunite Corky and Lolita with their pods one day.

HEADLINE: Rise of Municipal Preparedness Comes With No Few Headaches 

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
The echoes of Sept. 11, 2001, clatter through American life with continuing, tangible effect. 
 In many smaller towns and cities, shiny new fire trucks are the civic antidote to uncertainty -- and the practical need to spend what the Department of Homeland Security dishes out. Other things Americans carry from that day are tiny and poignant, like Rick Edmond's flashlight, always on hand against a return of the darkness that he remembers in the corridors of the Pentagon.
Ideas have been amplified and altered by time, war and ideology into things never known or thought about. What does that head scarf say about where your loyalties lie? Who walks with the dead from Iraq and Afghanistan and tells the stories of what they believed in life and why they died? 
 Some echoes define a country at five years in ways many Americans have stopped even thinking about, because they are just life now. Here are five people in five cities -- all of them uncertain in different ways about where they have come to, but resolved to some action or declaration on the nation's road forward.

 The Fire Department in Colorado Springs is called out hundreds of times a year to deal with things like oil spills on the Interstate, gas pipeline leaks or the odd chemical residue left over from illegal drug labs.
 And since this summer the hazardous-materials team has responded to those calls by tooling out in a shiny new vehicle paid for by taxpayers around the country through a grant from the Department of Homeland Security.
 In cities and towns across the United States, five years of fighting terrorism has come closest to home in the form of modern emergency preparedness -- or, critics would suggest, old-fashioned political pork.
 Sloppy management has also been a big issue. The State of Colorado, one of those under greatest scrutiny, had to return $1.5 million to the federal government this year after a state audit found that the money had been improperly allocated. The inspector general's office at the Homeland Security Department opened a subsequent audit this summer.
 Bret Waters, director of the Office of Emergency Management in Colorado Springs, said he certainly would not defend every decision made in the spending of more than $154 million that has flowed into the state for domestic security since 2003. But echoing local officials in many other parts of the country, he makes no apologies for the fact that acquisitions like new haz-mat and communications trucks allow his city of 370,000 to be better equipped to handle the routine misfortunes of urban life.
 In this age of sleeper cells and other hidden threats, Mr. Waters said, his job is to prepare Colorado Springs for the risks that are not routine. And the best way to do that, he said, is to bolster every element in the city's disaster plan, get the best equipment and then put that equipment in the field to practice with day after day.
 ''If you don't use your equipment, if you wait until a terrorist event happens, you won't know how to use it,'' he said. ''If I set pieces of equipment in closets until there's a terrorism attack in the city of Colorado Springs, I think we'd be foolhardy.''
 Still, Mr. Waters, a trim California native who arrived in Colorado Springs a year ago to oversee emergency planning and operations there, said politics had colored the process. Denver in particular, by far the state's leading population center, throws around too much of its influence, he said, and so lands even more antiterrorism money than is warranted by its status as a possible large-city target.
 ''The obvious risks are obvious to everybody,'' he said. ''You have to protect the Golden Gate Bridge, you have the ports, whatever. The less obvious it is, the more challenge.''
 In addition, Colorado Springs has to share the money it gets -- about $9.3 million in federal domestic security grants since 2003 -- with a surrounding five-county region the size of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined.
 But an even bigger wrinkle, Mr. Waters said, is that the definitions of risk have continued to evolve since the Sept. 11 attacks, especially in the year after Hurricane Katrina. Guidelines for federal grant applications since the hurricane have specifically encouraged consideration of risks broader than terrorism, he said, including natural disaster. That makes local decisions even harder to make, because the what-if menu grows all the time.
 The neighbors are a complication as well. Colorado Springs has numerous military installations in its backyard, including Fort Carson, Peterson Air Force Base, the United States Air Force Academy and headquarters of the North American Aerospace Defense Command.
 The city has prospered from those associations. Thousands of military people who were once stationed in the area have stayed on in retirement, contributing to its economy and its conservative, stiff-spined character.
 But whether the military bases increase or reduce the burden of possible terrorism is a different matter. On one hand, even if they add to risk, they have their own security budgets to deal with it. Yet they cannot guarantee protection of the city, Mr. Waters said. 
 And neither the state nor the federal government has imposed any objective standards for determining how the pieces should fit together. 
 ''It's more like, 'Locals, figure it out,' '' he said. ''Some have done better than others.'' KIRK JOHNSON

HEADLINE: Departure of a Pragmatist

 BODY:
Mark McClellan, a physician and health economist, announced his resignation this week as head of the agency that oversees Medicare and Medicaid. He will be missed. As a pragmatic expert embedded in a fiercely ideological administration, he brought uncommon intelligence, good humor and dispassionate judgment to politically charged issues. 
 True, there were blemishes on his record. As head of the Food and Drug Administration from late 2002 to early 2004, he oversaw the agency's first postponement of a decision on whether to make the controversial morning-after contraceptive available without a prescription. This led to a prolonged effort by the administration to placate religious conservatives by keeping the pills restricted despite overwhelming evidence that they are safe.
Then, as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services since March 2004, he failed to anticipate the administrative glitches that marred the beginnings of the new Medicare prescription drug program. Tens of thousands of people were initially overcharged or unable to obtain essential medicines quickly. But Dr. McClellan stepped in to solve the problems and seems mostly to have succeeded. A June poll showed that 80 percent of those enrolled in a Medicare drug plan said they were satisfied with it.
 Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress prohibited Medicare from using its huge purchasing power to negotiate low drug prices with the manufacturers. But Dr. McClellan still worked to change Medicare from a mere bill-payer into a catalyst for reforming the health system. He has used its financial clout to press for studies to prove whether certain expensive treatments really work, and he has promoted efforts to measure the quality of care provided by hospitals, doctors and nursing homes.
 Dr. McClellan wins praise from some Democrats and leaders of advocacy groups for focusing on important policy issues and responding to valid complaints. Some critics disparage him for toeing the administration line too uncritically. But even they think they will be lucky to get anyone so accomplished as his successor.

HEADLINE: Amid Talk of Three Impressive Buildings, Silence on One Crucial Issue

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
There was supposed to be one more big ground zero announcement yesterday to dispel the notion that progress is slow in rebuilding Lower Manhattan.
 The Pataki administration had hoped that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey would formally approve the revised master plan to build four new office towers at the World Trade Center site, clearing the way for construction only days before the fifth anniversary of the terrorist attack. It would have been a public relations coup when combined with the developer Larry A. Silverstein's unveiling of designs for three of the towers by world-renowned architects.
But a tentative meeting of the Port Authority board was canceled. Negotiations between Mr. Silverstein and state, city and Port Authority officials foundered on Labor Day over several key issues, mostly related to money and timing. Mr. Silverstein, however, did show off his building designs. 
 ''There are still some outstanding issues,'' said Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority and the state's top economic development official. ''I believe they'll be worked out. It'll take fairness on both sides. If Silverstein Properties negotiates in good faith, it can be done.''
 Although both sides say that there has been progress and that they will complete the deal in time for the Port Authority's regularly scheduled Sept. 21 board meeting, some officials once again accused Mr. Silverstein of being ''greedy.''
 Executives working with the developer expressed disappointment that officials had focused on a few remaining issues instead of recognizing all that had been accomplished. 
 And they countered that the Port Authority's bureaucracy was moving too slowly, raising the project's cost by hundreds of millions of dollars at a time when construction costs are rising 2 percent a month.
 ''Tremendous progress has been made in discussions between the Port Authority and Silverstein,'' said Janno Lieber, who oversees the trade center project for Mr. Silverstein. ''We fully expect the deal to be finalized as scheduled in the very near future.''
 A tentative agreement in April between Mr. Silverstein and government officials was supposed to have put an end to years of acrimony. 
 Under that plan, Mr. Silverstein surrendered to the Port Authority control of the $2 billion Freedom Tower and a second site nearby. 
 He retained the rights to build the other three towers on the east side of the 16-acre trade center property, along Greenwich Avenue. The Port Authority, in turn, had to complete the excavation and site preparation for the towers along Greenwich Street in 2007 so that Mr. Silverstein could begin construction and complete the work by 2012. The agreement cut Mr. Silverstein's development fee in half, to 2.5 percent. 
 To ensure that he could get a mortgage and build quickly, the city and the authority offered to lease a combined 1.2 million square feet of space in what is known as Tower 4, the smallest of the three new towers, which has been designed by the architect Fumihiko Maki.
 According to state and Port Authority officials, negotiations over a final agreement were progressing quickly enough that Gov. George E. Pataki pushed for the Port Authority to meet yesterday, which was two weeks earlier than planned. 
 Officials complained that Mr. Silverstein then tried to use the governor's eagerness for a deal to extract concessions worth tens of millions of dollars, something Silverstein executives denied vehemently yesterday.
 In recent days, officials said, Mr. Silverstein said that he wanted the city and the authority to pay $78 a square foot for their office space, far more than the $50 a square foot officials assumed in April and $20 more than they offered in recent talks, according to state and Port Authority officials. The difference is no small matter: about $24 million a year.
 The officials said that Mr. Silverstein's rent number for a building in 2012 was exuberant, even for the perpetually optimistic developer. The average rent today for first-class office space downtown is $41.78 a square foot, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
 The Silverstein camp offered to put the matter into the hands of a arbitrator, a suggestion that the Port Authority rejected. 
 In a speech on Wednesday about the resurgence of Lower Manhattan, Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said jokingly, ''Larry Silverstein is so confident in the future that he's already raising the rent for the space the city will take in Tower 4.'' 
 He returned to the subject at yesterday's news conference about the building designs: ''What we are unveiling today is a true testament, Larry, to you and to your vision, to your perseverance, which we all wish sometimes you didn't have as much of.''
 Another contentious issue involves the Port Authority's obligation to excavate the sites along Greenwich Street by mid-2007, which would allow Mr. Silverstein to begin construction and adhere to the strict schedule laid out in April. Mr. Silverstein now contends that the Port Authority will not complete the work until sometime in 2008. 
 Because of the delay, Mr. Silverstein said he should be entitled to a rent reduction over seven months, which officials said could be worth as much as $50 million.
 Port Authority officials countered that they have now figured out an engineering plan that would allow them to do the work by mid-2007. 
 The developer remains unconvinced.

HEADLINE: Conservatives Help Wal-Mart, and Vice Versa

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
As Wal-Mart Stores struggles to rebut criticism from unions and Democratic leaders, the company has discovered a reliable ally: prominent conservative research groups like the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation and the Manhattan Institute.
 Top policy analysts at these groups have written newspaper opinion pieces around the country supporting Wal-Mart, defended the company in interviews with reporters and testified on its behalf before government committees in Washington.
But the groups -- and their employees -- have consistently failed to disclose a tie to the giant discount retailer: financing from the Walton Family Foundation, which is run by the Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton's three children, who have a controlling stake in the company. 
 The groups said the donations from the foundation have no influence over their research, which is deliberately kept separate from their fund-raising activities. What's more, the pro-business philosophies of these groups often dovetail with the interests of Wal-Mart. 
 But the financing, which totaled more than $2.5 million over the last six years, according to data compiled by GuideStar, a research organization, raises questions about what the research groups should disclose to newspaper editors, reporters or government officials. The Walton Family Foundation must disclose its annual donations in forms filed with the Internal Revenue Service, but research groups are under no such obligation.
 Companies and such groups have long courted one another -- one seeking influence, the other donations -- and liberal policy groups receive significant financing from unions and left-leaning organizations without disclosing their financing.
 But the Walton donations could prove risky for Wal-Mart, given its escalating public relations campaign. The company's quiet outreach to bloggers, beginning last year, touched off a debate about what online writers should disclose to readers, and its financing to policy groups could do the same. 
 Asked about the donations yesterday, Mona Williams, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said, ''The fact is that editorial pages and prominent columnists of all stripes write favorably about our company because they recognize the value we provide to working families, the job opportunities we create and the contributions we make to the community we serve.'' 
 At least five research and advocacy groups that have received Walton Family Foundation donations are vocal advocates of the company. 
 The American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, for example, has received more than $100,000 from the foundation in the last three years, a fraction of the more than $24 million it raised in 2004 alone.
 Richard Vedder, a visiting scholar at the institute, wrote an opinion article for The Washington Times last month, extolling Wal-Mart's benefits to the American economy. ''There is enormous economic evidence that Wal-Mart has helped poor and middle-class consumers, in fact more than anyone else,'' Mr. Vedder wrote in the article, which prominently identified his ties to institute. 
 But neither Mr. Vedder nor the newspaper mentioned American Enterprise Institute's financial links to the Waltons. Mr. Vedder, a professor at Ohio University, said he might have disclosed the relationship had the American Enterprise Institute told him of it. ''I always assumed that A.E.I. had no relationship or a modest, distant relationship with the company,'' said Mr. Vedder, who has written a forthcoming book about the company. The book, he said in an interview yesterday, would eventually contain a disclosure about the Walton donations to the institute.
 A spokesman for the Walton Family Foundation, Jay Allen, said there was no organized campaign to build support for Wal-Mart among research groups. All of the foundation's giving, he said, is directed toward a handful of philanthropic issues, including school reform, the environment and the economy in Northwest Arkansas, where Wal-Mart is based. ''That is the spirit and purpose of their giving,'' Mr. Allen said.
 Mr. Allen said the foundation, which had assets of $608.7 million in 2004, the last year for which data is available, has never asked the research groups to disclose the donations because ''the family leaves it up to the individual organization to decide.''
 Those groups, for the most part, say they have decided not to share the information with their analysts or the public. 
 For example, Sally C. Pipes, the president of the Pacific Research Institute, a free-market policy advocate, has written several opinion articles defending Wal-Mart in The Miami Herald and The San Francisco Examiner.
 A month after a federal judge in California certified a sex discrimination lawsuit against the company as a class action in 2004, Ms. Pipes wrote an article in The Examiner criticizing the lawyers and the women behind the suit. ''The case against Wal-Mart,'' she wrote, ''follows the standard feminist stereotype of women as victims, men as villains and large corporations as inherently evil.'' 
 The article did not disclose that the Walton Family Foundation gave Pacific Research $175,000 from 1999 to 2004. Ms. Pipes was aware of the contributions, but said the money was earmarked for an education reform project and did not influence her thinking about the lawsuit. Asked why she typically did not disclose the donations to newspapers, she said: ''It never occurs to me to put that out front unless I am asked. If newspapers ask, I am completely open about it.''
 The lack of disclosure highlights the absence of a consistent policy at the nation's newspapers about whether contributors must tell editors of potential conflicts of interest.
 Juan M. Vasquez, the deputy editorial page editor of The Miami Herald, which ran an opinion article praising Wal-Mart by Ms. Pipes of Pacific Research, said his staff researches organizations that write opinion articles, including their financing. But that does not always require asking if the organization has received money from the subject of an article, he said.
 The New York Times has a policy of asking outside contributors to disclose any potential conflicts of interest, including the financing for research groups. 
 Several of the research groups noted that their mission is to be an advocate for free market policies and less government intrusion in business. ''Those aims are pro-business, so it's not surprising that companies would be supporters of our work,'' said Khristine Brookes, a spokeswoman for the Heritage Foundation.
 Last year, for instance, The Baltimore Sun published an op-ed article by Tim Kane, a research fellow at Heritage, in which he criticized Maryland's efforts to require Wal-Mart to spend more on health care. He objected to the move on the grounds that it was undue government interference in the free market, a traditional concern of Heritage.
 ''The existence of Wal-Mart dented the rise in overall inflation so much that Jerry Hausman, an economist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is calling on the federal government to change the way it measures prices,'' Mr. Kane wrote. ''Translation: Wal-Mart is fighting poverty faster than government accountants can keep track.''
 Ms. Brookes pointed out that the $20,000 Heritage has received from the Walton Family Foundation since 2000 amounts to less than 1 percent of its $40 million budget.
 Ms. Brookes said it was unlikely that researchers and analysts at Heritage were even aware of the foundation's contributions. ''Nobody here would know that unless they walked upstairs and asked someone in development,'' she said. ''It's just never discussed.''
 She said Heritage did not accept money for specific research. ''The money from the Walton Family Foundation has always been earmarked for our general operations,'' she said. ''They've never given us any funds saying do this paper or that paper.''
 A spokeswoman for the American Enterprise Institute said the group did not comment on its donors. The group's focus on Wal-Mart has been notable. In June, the editor in chief then of the group's magazine, The American Enterprise, wrote a long essay defending Wal-Mart against critics. The editor, Karl Zinsmeister, now the chief domestic policy adviser at the White House, said the campaign against the company was ''run by a clutch of political hacks.'' 
 Conservative groups are not the only ones weighing in on the Wal-Mart debate. Ms. Williams of Wal-Mart noted labor unions have financed organizations that have been critical of Wal-Mart, like the Economic Policy Institute, which received $2.5 million from unions in 2005.
 In response, Chris Kofinis, communications director for WakeUpWalmart.com, an arm of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union that gives money to liberal research groups, said: "While we openly support the mission of economic justice, Wal-Mart and the Waltons put on a smiley face, hide the truth, all while supporting right-wing causes who are paid to defend Wal-Mart's exploitative practices.''
 The lack of a clear quid pro quo between research groups and corporations like Wal-Mart makes the issue murky, said Diana Aviv, chief executive of the Independent Sector, a trade organization representing nonprofits and foundations. ''I don't know how one proves what's the chicken and what's the egg,'' she said. 
 Last year, the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a research and watchdog group, published a report, ''The Waltons and Wal-Mart: Self-Interested Philanthropy,'' that warned of the potential influence their vast wealth gives them.
 But Rick Cohen, executive director of the group, said he was more concerned about the role the Walton foundation's money might play in shaping public policy in areas like public education, where it has supported charter schools and voucher systems.
 ''These are certainly not organizations created and controlled by the corporation or the family and promoted as somehow authentic when they aren't,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''More important, I think, is the disclosure of the funding in whatever's written, a sort of disclaimer.''


CORRECTION-DATE: September 22, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Friday reported that the Walton Family Foundation had made contributions to four conservative research groups whose analysts wrote articles favorable to Wal-Mart Stores for newspapers and journals around the country. The Times article said that the groups and their employees had consistently failed to disclose the donations, and it said in the first paragraph that the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research was one of them. But a Manhattan Institute author had told The Times that he had indeed disclosed contributions from the Walton Foundation in an article he wrote, a fact that should have been included in the Times article.
 The article also reported that Tim Kane of the Heritage Foundation and Karl Zinsmeister, formerly of the American Enterprise Institute, were among those who wrote articles favorable to Wal-Mart after their foundations received a donation. 
 Both those groups were called for comment for the Times article. Mr. Kane, who was not called, subsequently said that he did not know about the Walton Family Foundation contribution and that he had criticized Wal-Mart's call for a higher federal minimum wage in an article he wrote. The Times also did not ask Mr. Zinsmeister to comment, but he declined to do so when reached after the Times article was published. Both Mr. Kane and Mr. Zinsmeister should have been asked to comment before publication.
An article in Business Day on Sept. 8 about contributions by the Walton Family Foundation to four conservative research groups whose analysts wrote articles favorable to Wal-Mart Stores, misstated the amount that labor unions contributed to the Economic Policy Institute, an organization that has been critical of Wal-Mart. According to reports that unions are required to file with the Labor Department, they contributed nearly $1.4 million in 2005, not $2.5 million.

HEADLINE: N.F.L. Learns Its Worth and Makes ESPN Pay

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir. 
E-mail: sportsbiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
You might have noticed that ESPN now carries ''Monday Night Football'' and will start with a Minnesota-Washington/San Diego-Oakland doubleheader next week. ''Is It Monday Yet?'' an ESPN campaign asks. Calm down. There are still three days till Tony Kornheiser.
 Why isn't ESPN using ''Monday, Monday'' to promote its shift from Sunday night games? Don't be silly. That song by the Mamas and the Papas warns that ''whenever Monday comes, you can find me cryin' all of the time.'' 
ESPN is doing anything but weeping, even if it is paying $1.1 billion a year, 83 percent more than it paid for Sunday nights, and far more than any other network or DirecTV is spending. Yet for all of ESPN's cash, it is carrying no more than what it used to televise on Sundays: no playoff games, no chance at a Super Bowl, no late-season flexible schedule. Those are NBC's for $600 million, a relative bargain, in its Sunday night package.
 ''Our company is positioned to use a product like the N.F.L. in ways that stretch 24/7, around the world, 365 days across 11 businesses,'' George Bodenheimer, the president of ESPN, said yesterday by telephone. ''It's odd in print to keep score with the rights fees because we're in a different space.''
 With its myriad television, radio, print, video game, fantasy and Web businesses, ESPN is different from the sports divisions at NBC, Fox and CBS. Still, rights fees provide a measure of how much a network covets the N.F.L., and how much the league knows it can extract from a media partner.
 The league knew all along that it could squeeze far more out of ESPN than anyone else. The main reason is that ESPN has two revenue streams: it sells advertising, as do the broadcast networks, and it collects subscriber fees from cable operators, which broadcast networks do not. ESPN charges the steepest monthly fee of any national cable network -- $2.86 a subscriber, Kagan Research said.
 So a modest, double-digit jump over $600 million a year would not do.
 ''I don't know if we felt they had underpaid in the past, but it became clear they were making a lot of money off the N.F.L.,'' said Pat Bowlen, the owner of the Denver Broncos. As chairman of the league's broadcasting committee, Bowlen helped shape the new TV deals. 
 ''We felt we deserved a larger share of that money because the N.F.L. is a big part of their programming,'' Bowlen added. ''They wouldn't be anything near what they are without us.''
 For several years after the last N.F.L. deal began, ESPN collected annual, automatic 20 percent subscriber fee increases from cable operators. It was the N.F.L. surcharge. The executive chiefly behind that was Steve Bornstein, then ESPN's president. Bornstein is now the N.F.L.'s top media official and doubtlessly used his insider's knowledge as part of the team that negotiated the new TV deal. 
 The N.F.L. clearly recognized its leverage over ESPN, which would have to roll back its subscriber fees, losing many millions of dollars, if it lost the right to carry what is now Commissioner Roger Goodell's league.
 The league also knew well that rivals like Comcast and Rupert Murdoch were lurking, helping to maximize its strong hand. The N.F.L. gained further leverage when the Walt Disney Company, which owns 80 percent of ESPN, dawdled before making the $1.1 billion deal. Had it not dallied, Disney might have kept ''Monday Night Football'' on ABC and ''Sunday Night Football'' on ESPN for $1.4 billion a year.
 In the end, ESPN took ''Monday Night'' to its corporate breast. ''ESPN is addicted to and cannot live without the N.F.L.,'' Bowlen said.
 ESPN can afford $1.1 billion a year and the price of a Nascar deal that starts in 2007. But the higher costs will pinch its prodigious profits, said Lowell Singer, an analyst for Cowen & Company. ESPN's operating income, which he estimated would be $1.9 billion for the year ending Sept. 30, will stay flat in the coming fiscal year. 
 ''Strategically, they needed to keep the N.F.L., but their economics will be challenged,'' Singer said.
 Bodenheimer offered no regrets about possibly overpaying for the cable version of ''Monday Night.'' 
 ''Would I always like to get more and pay less? Yes,'' he said. ''But I'm delighted with what we have.''
 He would prefer to discuss how the deal is nourishing ESPN, like the 100,000 sign-ups for the new ''Monday Night Surround'' fan feature on ESPN.com; the jam-packed advertising in the new issue of ESPN the Magazine; and the advertising deal it just signed with Wal-Mart.
 I asked Bodenheimer why his empire never flexed its muscles so wholeheartedly for ''Sunday Night'' all those years. 
 ''I never thought of it that way,'' he said, searching for an answer. 
 Then he segued into the new ESPN mantra: It is carrying the N.F.L.'s best TV package, and who would have thought that possible 27 years ago when ESPN came to life?

HEADLINE: 2 Fed Banks Favored Rise in Discount Rate

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7 

 BODY:
Two regional Federal Reserve banks favored an increase in the discount rate before the policy meeting on Aug. 8, a sign of greater dissent over current monetary policy than had previously been disclosed. 
 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank and the Richmond Fed both requested increases in the discount rate, according to minutes released on Thursday.
The Federal Open Market Committee voted 9-1 to leave the benchmark federal funds target rate at 5.25 percent, breaking a two-year run of increases. The discount rate was left at 6.25 percent. Richmond Fed President Jeffrey M. Lacker, 50, opposed the decision.
 The Philadelphia Fed board voted on Aug. 3, just two days after the arrival of Charles I. Plosser, 57, its new president, to raise the discount rate by a quarter point, reversing July calls to leave the rate unchanged. Unlike Mr. Lacker, Mr. Plosser is not a voting member of the F.O.M.C. this year.
 The regional Fed board votes to raise the discount rate are a signal to the board of governors about their preferences for policy.

HEADLINE: Some Housing Pessimism From Real Estate Brokers 

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Concerns about the housing market deepened yesterday as the nation's leading real estate brokers' group issued a more pessimistic outlook for the year, and two major builders cut their earnings estimates by hundreds of millions of dollars.
 The news added to a growing unease about the economy and helped drive shares on Wall Street lower for the second straight day. 
The latest report to predict a decline in the housing sector was notable for its source. The assessment from the National Association of Realtors, which has until recently been generally upbeat about the health of housing, was the group's least optimistic yet.
 ''The boom is cooling now,'' said David Lereah, the chief economist for the association, who added that falling home sales have been ''a bit worse than we had anticipated.''
 The group said that it now expected sales to fall further than it has said in the past -- about 7.5 percent this year compared with an earlier projection of a 5 percent decline. It also said it expected prices nationwide to drop during the next few months, instead of appreciating modestly. If that happens, it would be the first time since 1993 that median home prices have fallen in any given month.
 The revised realtors' forecast came on the heels of announcements from KB Home and Beazer, two of the nation's largest home builders, that profits this year would be lower than initially predicted.
 A third builder, Hovnanian Enterprises, said yesterday that its third-quarter profits fell by more than a third. It left its guidance for the year unchanged.
 The Realtors' association said it expected both home prices and sales would slide in the coming months as the upper hand in the housing market shifts from the seller to the buyer. But that shift has yet to occur fully, with buyers and sellers staring each other down while unsold houses pile up. 
 ''The seller is a lot more stubborn than any of us had anticipated,'' Mr. Lereah said. ''Sellers for the last five years have been in control. It's very hard for them to give up control and revise their expectations downward.''
 But once sellers begin to drop their asking prices, housing industry officials hope that home sales will start to rise again. 
 The rising number of homes on the market and aggressive discounting by home builders are putting pressure on sellers to lower their prices, said Ronald J. Peltier, president and chief executive of HomeServices of America, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway that owns real estate brokerage firms around the country.
 ''It's going to take the rest of this year at a minimum for that inventory to be liquidated,'' he said. ''This period of correction is going to take a little while, but it's healthy for the market.''
 The Realtors' association predicted that, at most, prices will decline for two or three months before picking back up again. For the year, home prices are still expected to appreciate, on average. Not since the Depression have home prices fallen over the course of a full year.
 There are already signs that prices may soon start to decline nationwide. In a report issued last month, the Realtors' association said home prices in July barely inched up. The median selling price for existing homes, which rose at double-digit rates for much of the previous two years, rose only 0.9 percent compared with a year earlier. And that rise was entirely dependent on a 3 percent median price gain in the South, the only region in the country where prices did not fall.
 John Lonski, chief economist for Moody's Investor Service, said, ''That's got to be one of the biggest difficulties facing the sellers of real estate: the uncertainty of the durability of real estate prices into the foreseeable future.''
 As KB and Beazer cut their earnings guidance, they cited a growing supply of unsold homes.
 ''A higher percentage of home closings are being deferred or canceled,'' Beazer said in a statement yesterday, ''immediately prior to closing in many cases, due to worsening buyer sentiment and the inability of buyers to sell their existing homes.''
 Beazer said yesterday that it expected earnings for the year of $8 to $8.50 a share, compared with its previous outlook of $9.25 to $9.75. 
 KB lowered its earnings guidance for the year to $8 to $8.50 a share, down from an earlier estimate of $10 a share. That is the second time this year the builder has lowered its guidance. Other major builders like Toll Brothers and D. R. Horton have also cut their earnings forecasts.
 Wall Street's reaction was mixed. Shares of KB closed just 1 cent higher, at $40.40 a share, and Beazer dropped nearly 3 percent, to $37.33.
 But in a sign that investors were expecting much worse, news of Hovnanian's profit decline helped lift shares more than 6 percent, to $27.09.
 Slowing home sales actually helped give share prices in other sectors a lift in recent weeks. As it became clear that housing was entering a period of contraction -- in line with the Federal Reserve's expectation of an orderly economic cooling -- investors put more money into equities, betting that the Fed would not resume raising interest rates.
 From Aug. 1 until the beginning of this week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had risen more than 3 percent. But over the last two days, it has erased about half those gains. 
 Housing's decline, said Jeffrey Kleintop, a top investment strategist for PNC, ''has encouraged the stock market in the last month or two to run up.'' He added: ''The market is saying, 'Yeah, we feel pretty confident about a soft landing here.' ''
 Yesterday's housing news raised questions about just how soft that landing would be. ''As an economy, we're more sensitive to housing than we've ever been,'' Mr. Kleintop said, adding that as home values have increased with the housing boom, so has individual net worth. ''Having that suddenly go away and pull into a recession really creates a big question mark.''

HEADLINE: Housing Outlook Darkens, Pulling Share Prices Down

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks declined for a second day on mounting evidence that a housing slump is putting the brakes on the economy.
 Countrywide Financial, the mortgage lender, led financial shares lower after KB Home and Beazer Homes said earnings would be below their forecasts and an industry group said home prices might drop for the first time since 1993. 
''Housing has fallen more dramatically than anyone would have thought,'' said Linda A. Duessel, an equities strategist who helps manage $218 billion at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. Investors are ''worried about an economy that is slowing more than expected.''
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.24 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,294.02. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 74.76, or 0.7 percent, to 11,331.44. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 12.55, or 0.6 percent, to 2,155.29.
 The S.& P. 500 has declined 0.8 percent this month on signs of weakness in housing and worries that inflation is accelerating. A report on Wednesday showing rising labor costs added to investor concern.
 Gold and silver in New York tumbled the most in seven weeks as the dollar strengthened against the euro, eroding the appeal of precious metals as an alternative investment.
 Gold and silver generally move in the opposite direction from the dollar, which reached a three-week high against a basket of six major currencies yesterday. Gold has gained 20 percent this year and silver has jumped 43 percent, while the dollar has lost 7 percent against the euro.
 Gold futures for December delivery fell $16.90, or 2.6 percent, to $624.90 an ounce, the biggest percentage drop since July 18. Prices are still up 39 percent from a year ago.
 Silver for December delivery dropped 50.5 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $12.695 an ounce. Still, it has surged 78 percent in the last year.
 Treasuries were little changed, keeping yields near five-month lows, with investors reluctant to buy securities as companies, agencies and governments prepare to sell as much as $70 billion in debt this month.
 ''We've come into a period of time of enormous corporate issuance, which soaks up cash,'' said Glen Capelo, a Treasuries trader in Greenwich, Conn., for RBS Greenwich Capital, one of the 23 primary dealers that trade directly with the Federal Reserve.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell 0.01 percentage point, to 4.78 percent. It dropped to 4.72 percent last week, the lowest since March 28. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rose 2/32, to 100 22/32.

HEADLINE: U.A.W. Head Rules Out Concessions

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 7 

 BODY:
The president of the United Automobile Workers, Ron Gettelfinger, said Thursday that the Chrysler Group was strong enough financially that its call for cuts in workers' health care coverage, like those approved by union members at General Motors and Ford last year, was not warranted.
 Mr. Gettelfinger, speaking to reporters after a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, also said the union was not willing to do more to help the Delphi Corporation, the auto parts supplier, and could call a strike if a bankruptcy court judge agrees with Delphi's request to void the union's contracts. 
The U.A.W. and Delphi have been negotiating for months on wage and benefit concessions sought by Delphi, which sought bankruptcy protection nearly a year ago.
 ''The membership really wants a leader in there who is willing to draw a line,'' said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. ''Right now they fear that there's no quid pro quo. There have been job cuts despite the concessions. And at the same time it just continues and continues.''
 Workers at G.M. and Ford approved landmark deals last year that require them to pay for a portion of their health care coverage, which the auto companies had previously paid for. Both companies lost billions of dollars on their North American operations last year, and have continued to lose money in 2006, although G.M.'s losses have been significantly reduced.
 Chrysler, the division of DaimlerChrysler based in Auburn Hills, Mich., has been talking to the U.A.W. for months about a deal to reduce its health care costs. But an audit commissioned by the union indicated that such concessions were not needed, Mr. Gettelfinger said.
 ''It's a different situation at DaimlerChrysler than it's been at Ford and G.M.,'' he said.
 Chrysler, which expects to spend $2.3 billion this year on health care for employees and their families, was profitable in the first half of 2006 but is predicting a loss of more than $600 million during the current quarter.
 A Chrysler spokesman, David Elshoff, said the company remained optimistic it would reach an agreement with the union.
 He said that both sides were ''still talking'' and that the union's refusal to deal would put Chrysler in an unfair position.
 ''Failure to reach an agreement with the U.A.W. on health care, which is DaimlerChrysler's biggest fixed cost, certainly puts us at an economic disadvantage compared to all of the other automakers in the U.S.,'' Mr. Elshoff said.
 Last year, 61 percent of G.M.'s unionized workers and 51 percent of Ford's approved paying more of their health care costs.
 The deals are projected to save G.M. about $1 billion a year and Ford $850 million. 
 In standing firm against Chrysler, the union is breaking from its tradition of pattern bargaining, in which it seeks nearly identical deals with all three Detroit automakers.
 With the union's labor agreements set to expire next year, it is ''sending a message not only to DaimlerChrysler but to Ford and General Motors, too,'' Mr. Chaison said. ''They're saying if there's going to be a turnaround, it's going to have to be done by management.''
 Mr. Gettelfinger and a union vice president, Cal Rapson, said on Thursday that they had the same message for Delphi, criticizing the company's approval of multimillion-dollar bonuses for top management as it cuts workers' pay to as low as $12 an hour from $27.
 ''We've done enough, as far as we're concerned,'' Mr. Rapson said. ''It's now a matter of greed.''
 Asked whether the U.A.W. could strike the company, Mr. Gettelfinger replied, ''If the judge voids the contract, you give me a call and I'll have an answer for you real quick.''

HEADLINE: BLAIR TO GIVE UP POST AS PREMIER WITHIN ONE YEAR

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; Graham Bowley contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 7 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair announced Thursday that he would leave office within the next 12 months, bending to pressure after an open rebellion in his own party. 
 His announcement opened a troubled final chapter in a remarkable three-term premiership in which he moved from absolute political dominance of a prosperous Britain to fighting off open mockery about his closeness to President Bush.
Mr. Blair earlier said he would not run for a fourth term. Thursday's announcement narrows the timetable for his resignation. It means that, around or well before next summer, Mr. Blair will resign the leadership of the Labor Party and make way for Gordon Brown, his finance minister, to take over as prime minister. For much of this week, Britain has been gripped by the spectacle of a brutal, behind-the-scenes power struggle between the men over the timing of Mr. Blair's departure.
 ''This first thing I would like to do is to apologize, actually, on behalf of the Labor Party for the last week, which, with everything that is going on back here and in the world has not been our finest hour, to be frank,'' Mr. Blair said on television. ''But I think what is important now is that we understand that it's the interests of the country that come first and we move on.'' 
 ''I would have preferred to do this my own way,'' he said. But he did not go as far as critics had wanted. Mr. Blair has insisted on setting the terms of his departure, the better to control how his legacy will be perceived during a time of steadily ebbing popularity.
 For months the prime minister fought off calls to name a date for stepping down, despite the increasing fears that a delay would hurt his party in the next election and the growing unpopularity at home for his firm backing of American policy in Iraq and the Middle East. 
 It is not clear whether the political costs of allying Britain so closely to the United States would prompt Mr. Brown to change course, though his political allies have suggested that he is eager to bring home British troops from Afghanistan and Iraq and would strike a more independent stance. Mr. Brown's brief has been managing the British economy, not foreign policy.
 In his televised announcement from a schoolyard, Mr. Blair, alternately somber and testy, refused to name a specific date, saying he would act on his own timetable. It was not clear if that was enough to silence his critics, or whether further political bloodletting was in store.
 An hour before Mr. Blair spoke, Mr. Brown pulled back from a final showdown with his onetime ally, pledging to abide by Mr. Blair's decision on timing. The choreography of the appearances suggested that Mr. Brown was signaling his supporters to suspend their rebellion and observe what may be an uneasy truce. Indeed, the eight ministers who resigned from Mr. Blair's government on Wednesday, calling on him to step down, remained silent on Thursday. 
 Temporarily at least, the maneuver spared Mr. Blair the same immediate fate as Margaret Thatcher, forced out of office by her own party in 1990 after months of maneuvering. 
 ''I think the precise timetable has to be left up to me and got to be done in a proper way,'' Mr. Blair said.
 Speaking an hour earlier, Mr. Brown said, ''I want to make it absolutely clear today that when I met the prime minister yesterday, I said to him and I repeat today: It is for him to make the decision'' on the timing of his departure.
 Taken together, the two speeches seemed intended to calm the turmoil within Labor's ranks that risks imperiling the party's electoral prospects. ''We cannot treat the public as irrelevant bystanders in a subject as important as who is their prime minister,'' Mr. Blair warned.
 ''It has been a somewhat difficult week, but I think it's time now to move on, and I think we will,'' he said. It was not clear whether his tattered authority could sustain his ability to do that.
 Doug Henderson, a Labor legislator and supporter of Mr. Brown, indicated that the pressure for an earlier ouster of Mr. Blair had not disappeared. ''People keep saying to me that the Labor Party must have a clear direction forward with clear priorities and a new leader before the elections in 2007,'' he told Reuters. 
 The calculations underpinning both men's behavior emerged from conversations with politicians and associates in both camps, some of whom requested anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal confidences.
 A member of the Blair camp said that, before the summer break, Mr. Blair had told a close friend that he was coming under renewed pressure from Mr. Brown to name a date he would step down, but the friend had advised him not to because that would rob Mr. Blair of his remaining power. Mr. Blair followed this advice, hoping the pressure would decrease after the summer break. 
 But Mr. Brown continued to press, a person close to his camp said. His allies were provoked by an interview with The Times of London on Friday in which Mr. Blair refused to set a date and by a memo, leaked to The Mirror, which showed Mr. Blair's plans for a drawn-out farewell. 
 ''Brown had no choice but to act to put Blair in a position to name a date,'' said John Kampfner, editor of The New Statesman magazine, who has close links to Mr. Brown. ''Brown knew that it would be horrible, but he thought, Let's have one terrible week and get something than having it drag on for weeks.'' 
 Mark Leonard, a British policy expert who ran a research organization championed by Mr. Blair, said Mr. Brown had calculated that he needed to act soon because another challenger for the leadership might emerge. Charles Clarke, former home secretary, has been making a series of recent speeches that have been seen as preparation for a leadership challenge. 
 ''What is holding Brown back is that he does not want to give his party a habit of rebellion and insurrection,'' Mr. Leonard said. ''That is not the way he wants to start his new government.''
 The political stagecraft was evident even in the choice of a school as backdrop for Mr. Blair's announcement, because Mr. Blair wants to be seen not just as a warrior but also as a leader who enhanced public services like schools, policing and health care. 
 For his part, Mr. Brown, less charismatic than Mr. Blair, has been a Labor Party stalwart throughout his political life, taking credit as finance minister for a remarkable era of economic growth. 
 His main contacts with American politicians have been with Treasury Department and banking officials on issues like reducing third-world debt and managing shocks to the global economy. Closer to home, in Europe, he has been more of a euro-skeptic than Mr. Blair, opposed to joining the euro single currency. 
 At the same time, he has tried to build an image as a champion of the poor.
 Last April, he visited Africa -- paying a call on Nelson Mandela and posing for photographs with children in shanty towns -- apparently to soften his public persona as a dour and austere ''Iron Chancellor,'' a closet old-school socialist bent on taxing the middle classes to redistribute wealth. 
 The crisis this week has been building since the election two years ago, and sharpened over the summer when Mr. Blair rejected calls from Labor legislators to support a quick cease-fire in Lebanon, preferring to endorse American and Israeli policies. 
 Then, last Friday, Mr. Blair gave an interview to The Times of London, telling his critics to stop ''obsessing'' over his departure, which outraged Mr. Brown's allies. On Wednesday, Mr. Brown and Mr. Blair had a private meeting described in some newspaper reports as a shouting match. But by Thursday both men seemed to calculate that they needed to back away from a showdown that would have damaged them both. 
 Moreover, continuing political warfare could deepen Labor's unpopularity in advance of regional elections next May. A full national vote, to decide which party would run the government, is scheduled for 2010 at the latest.
 Mr. Blair took power in 1997 on a wave of euphoria that built as he struck the 1998 Northern Ireland peace agreement and, with Mr. Brown running the economy, opened the country to a remarkable period of low unemployment and low interest rates.
 In foreign affairs, he built a close relationship with President Bill Clinton and took a prominent role in the Kosovo war. He won another landslide in June 2001.
 But it was on Sept. 11, 2001, that Mr. Blair's premiership changed. He became a close ally of President Bush, first in the Afghanistan war and then in Iraq -- a war that was deeply unpopular among many Britons, including Muslims, who argued that the vision of British troops fighting in Islamic countries as allies of the United States exposed the country to terrorist attacks.
 In the last national elections in May 2005, Mr. Blair won again but with a much reduced majority, after campaigning with Mr. Brown at his side to shore up his support. The vote was the first time a Labor leader had won a third straight victory.
 At the same time, Mr. Blair lost the trust of many Britons because he insisted that the invasion of Iraq was needed to counter an imminent threat from Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, though no such weapons were found. 
 At home, his administration has been dogged by scandals in recent months relating to campaign financing and the personal behavior of some of his ministers.
 As he seeks to emerge from the current crisis, Mr. Blair risks being seen as losing authority, not just at home but also abroad. He is planning a visit to Israel, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories in the next few days but, reports from the West Bank said on Thursday, Palestinians are reluctant to welcome him because of his refusal to seek an early cease-fire in the Lebanon war.

HEADLINE: Whining Over Discontent

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
We are, finally, having a national discussion about inequality, and right-wing commentators are in full panic mode. Statistics, most of them irrelevant or misleading, are flying; straw men are under furious attack. It's all very confusing -- deliberately so. So let me offer a few clarifying comments.
 First, why are we suddenly talking so much about inequality? Not because a few economists decided to make inequality an issue. It's the public -- not progressive pundits -- that has been telling pollsters the economy is ''only fair'' or ''poor,'' even though the overall growth rate is O.K. by historical standards. 
Political analysts tried all sorts of explanations for popular discontent with the ''Bush boom'' -- it's the price of gasoline; no, people are in a bad mood because of Iraq -- before finally acknowledging that most Americans think it's a bad economy because for them, it is. The lion's share of the benefits from recent economic growth has gone to a small, wealthy minority, while most Americans were worse off in 2005 than they were in 2000. 
 Some conservatives whine that people didn't complain as much about rising inequality when Bill Clinton was president. But most people were happy with the state of the economy in the late 1990's, even though the rich were getting much richer, because the middle class and the poor were also making substantial progress. Now the rich are getting richer, but most working Americans are losing ground.
 Second, notice the amount of time that inequality's apologists spend attacking a claim nobody is making: that there has been a clear long-term decline in middle-class living standards. Yes, real median family income has risen since the late 1970's (with the most convincing gains taking place during the Clinton years). But the rise was very small -- small enough that other considerations, like increasing economic insecurity, make it unclear whether families are better or worse off. And that's the point: the United States as a whole has grown a lot richer over the past generation, but the typical American family hasn't.
 Third, notice the desperate effort to find some number, any number, to support claims that increasing inequality is just a matter of a rising payoff to education and skill. Conservative commentators tell us about wage gains for one-eyed bearded men with 2.5 years of college, or whatever -- and conveniently forget to adjust for inflation. In fact, the data refute any suggestion that education is a guarantee of income gains: once you adjust for inflation, you find that the income of a typical household headed by a college graduate was lower in 2005 than in 2000.
 More broadly, right-wing commentators would like you to believe that the economy's winners are a large group, like college graduates or people with agreeable personalities. But the winners' circle is actually very small. Even households at the 95th percentile -- that is, households richer than 19 out of 20 Americans -- have seen their real income rise less than 1 percent a year since the late 1970's. But the income of the richest 1 percent has roughly doubled, and the income of the top 0.01 percent -- people with incomes of more than $5 million in 2004 -- has risen by a factor of 5.
 Finally, while we can have an interesting discussion about questions like the role of unions in wage inequality, or the role of lax regulation in exploding C.E.O. pay, there is no question that the policies of the current majority party -- a party that has held a much-needed increase in the minimum wage hostage to large tax cuts for giant estates -- have relentlessly favored the interests of a tiny, wealthy minority against everyone else. 
 According to new estimates by Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, the leading experts on long-term trends in inequality, the effective federal tax rate on the richest 0.01 percent has fallen from about 60 percent in 1980 to about 34 percent today. Meanwhile, the U.S. government -- unlike any other government in the advanced world -- does nothing as more and more working families find themselves unable to obtain health insurance.
 The good news is that these concerns are finally breaking through into our political discourse. I'm sure that the usual suspects will come up with further efforts to confuse the issue. I say, bring 'em on: we've got the arguments, and the facts, to win this debate.

HEADLINE: Lebanon's Other Border

 BODY:
Israel is inching toward doing the right thing by agreeing to lift its blockade of Lebanon's airports. It has held up plans to also open the country's seaports, but it should take that step too, once European ships and monitors are in place to prevent Hezbollah from rearming. Reopening Lebanon is an essential first step to rebuilding its battered economy. But if the fragile peace is to hold, more must be done to police the border with Syria, the main route for Hezbollah's arms. 
 If not, despite a United Nations-ordered embargo, Hezbollah will quickly restock its arsenal of Iranian missiles and heavy arms. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel, badly weakened by this ill-conceived war, isn't likely to show much forbearance.
A deal is in the works to place a limited number of German advisers at key border crossings with Syria to provide technical support to Lebanese troops. These advisers will need to be ready to step in quickly -- working the phones or if that fails perhaps calling in U.N. strikes -- to turn back convoys. If not, the Israelis have made clear they will do it.
 But monitoring is unlikely to work without some Syrian cooperation. Secretary General Kofi Annan went to Damascus last week and said he got President Bashar al-Assad's pledge to block weapons smuggling. Mr. Assad, who has tried to bully Lebanon into banning foreign peacekeepers from his border, was silent. We applaud Mr. Annan for trying. But getting Syria to cut Hezbollah's supply lines will take concerted international pressure and the possibility of easing its isolation. 
 The Europeans, whose troops would have to face a rearmed Hezbollah, need to deliver the message directly to Damascus. So does the Bush administration -- this is one urgent diplomatic issue that the White House cannot subcontract. And more must be done to bolster Lebanon's prime minister, Fouad Siniora, so he has the wherewithal to stand up to Mr. Assad and to Hezbollah. 
 Donor countries have pledged nearly $1 billion for Lebanon's reconstruction. Experience suggests it could take months or years for that money to arrive, and the marquee total will never be reached. Hezbollah is already handing out Iranian cash. 
 What Lebanon needs is a smaller, more dependable group to work directly with Mr. Siniora on reconstruction. The United States, which isn't sending troops, should take the lead in making sure that pledges turn into real projects, and quickly. France and Saudi Arabia could be charter members.
 A lot was finessed in the cease-fire resolution. That doesn't mean Hezbollah should be allowed to grow even stronger.

HEADLINE: Spitzer Says He's Willing to Close Hospitals to Trim Medical Costs

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Marc Santora contributed reporting from New York City.

DATELINE: BALDWINSVILLE, N.Y., Sept. 7 

 BODY:
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said on Thursday that if elected governor he would close hospitals and drastically cut spending in an effort to restore fiscal discipline to New York State.
 Giving his most candid glimpse yet of his plans to put the state's fiscal house in order, Mr. Spitzer said that to fulfill his pledge to cut property taxes he would have to take aim at the state's health care system.
''We're going to take the tough medicine,'' he said at a campaign stop in this Syracuse suburb, adding: ''I'm saying to folks this isn't all milk and honey. These are going to be tough decisions. Nobody likes to hear that a hospital is going to close, or a wing of a hospital, or beds are going to be shifted, but that is what we have to do.'' 
 With a few days left before Tuesday's Democratic primary, Mr. Spitzer is up by more than 50 percentage points in polls pitting him against Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, whose campaign has so deteriorated that campaign officials said on Thursday that they had suspended plans for a final television advertising campaign. The campaign's assertion that it is running out of money came after it had spent $8.4 million this year, campaign filings showed.
 With such a wide lead, Mr. Spitzer increasingly sounded on Thursday like a man looking ahead to governing and preparing voters for the challenges ahead, including making budget cuts to finance his campaign promises. 
 Much of Mr. Spitzer's campaign up to now has been spent making costly promises to voters, including cutting property taxes by $6 billion over three years, offering tens of thousands of uninsured children medical care and increasing education spending by billions of dollars.
 His opponents -- Mr. Suozzi, a Democrat, and former Assemblyman John Faso, a Republican -- have said he did not have a clear plan to pay for his proposals. Mr. Spitzer has laid out a variety of cost-saving measures that he said would reduce spending by $11 billion over three years, though some of the measures have failed to pass in the Legislature. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Spitzer also met with workers at an American Axle and Manufacturing plant in Tonawanda in western New York where a new round of temporary layoffs had been announced. He reiterated that the next governor would have to find a way to bring jobs back to their part of the state, saying that he would seek to ease one of the thorns in the side of business -- workers compensation costs -- but he stopped short of offering specifics. 
 Earlier on Thursday, at a stop here, he said that the health care system would be a main target for spending cuts, in part because Medicaid is the largest single part of the budget. He said he would not only seek to close hospitals, building on the work of a state hospital closing commission that is expected to issue a final report in November, but he would also seek to overhaul the system that requires the state to reimburse hospitals for care given to uninsured patients.
 ''One of the major problems we have is the reimbursement structure we have in health care that has provided an incentive to hospitals to build high-tech cardiac, thoracic surgical units, and all the rest, where they make money,'' he said. ''What we really need is at the other end of the spectrum. We need people to be building primary-care, E.R. wings, yet the compensation we give there is designed to make them lose money.''
 He said the state should ''promote primary care rather than dealing with a chronic disease, at the point where, whether it is diabetes, obesity or heart issues, where you have the problem manifesting itself.''
 On Wednesday, Mr. Spitzer told a crowd in Utica, at the Matt Brewing Company, ''If I'm lucky enough to win, I want you to be tough on me, because when I come back here, I want you to say to me, 'where are the results?' '' He continued: ''I'm going to be tough on you. I'm going to say, Here are the tough decisions. Here's what we've got to do.'' 
 Critics have said they are skeptical that Mr. Spitzer can add and subtract from health care spending, but his recent comments appeared to fit in with his self-portrait of a man willing to ''break china'' to get things done in Albany.
 Mr. Spitzer also returned to criticism he leveled months ago at the last budget passed under Gov. George E. Pataki, calling the state's spending levels ''out of control.''
 ''Certainly when you have the state budget, and the state contribution, rising at four times the rate of inflation, that is akin to living off your credit cards and not paying it back every month,'' he said. ''That, we know, we can't do, so probably by a ratio of four to one it was too much.''

HEADLINE: New Role For Rubin: Policy Guru

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Does Robert E. Rubin still matter? 
 Many would probably say yes. In Washington, Mr. Rubin, who was President Bill Clinton's Treasury secretary, has started a small research group aimed at generating policy ideas for Democratic presidential candidates, as well as elevating the next generation of Democrat-supporting financiers.
 On Wall Street, Mr. Rubin, from his perch on the board of Citigroup, has become an influential public defender of its chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, who is feeling the lash from investors over the stock's long stagnant run. 
 Just don't ask the man himself. 
 ''I am a little pebble of sand on the beach,'' Mr. Rubin, 68, said this summer, speaking on a panel for his new policy initiative, the Hamilton Project. ''So what I say does not matter anymore.''
 It was a classic form of a Bob Rubin koan. Asked why he didn't use his sway on Wall Street to prod policy makers in Congress, he offered up a slight smile and a nod of his gray head. So self-denying was the assertion that it bordered on self-aggrandizement. The audience, let in on the joke, laughed. 
 But, as Democrats hope to take over control of the House from Republicans and as an aspiring presidential class of 2008 becomes more assertive, the Hamilton Project, named after the founding father and onetime Treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton, is arguably Mr. Rubin's most overt political act since he stepped down from the Treasury in 1999. Mr. Rubin, naturally, denies any such crass intent. 
 Housed in the Brookings Institution, the initiative embraces a number of mainstream economic prescriptions -- like the necessity of equitable international trade agreements, the virtues of a balanced budget, and making economic growth more broad-based -- that capture Mr. Rubin's eat-your-spinach approach to policy making. 
 But by addressing issues like the costs to the economy of excessive litigation and regulation, Mr. Rubin intends to make the project a laboratory for the type of pragmatic, ideology-free policies that appeal to the project's Wall Street advisers while also hoping to lure Democratic presidential candidates away from populist economic positions. And with Mr. Rubin and his successor and friend Lawrence H. Summers on board, it will also be a training ground for the next crop of financiers with ambitions to shape policy in a Democratic administration. 
 They include those who have done so, like Roger C. Altman, the chairman of Evercore and a former deputy Treasury secretary; those who aspire to do so, like Steven Rattner of Quadrangle, the private equity firm; and, perhaps most important, younger Wall Street executives just now flirting with the idea. 
 It is with this last group of executives, drawn largely from the booming world of hedge funds and private equity, that Mr. Rubin has loomed large as an Obi-Wan Kenobi figure. 
 In the 1980's he cultivated their early careers as arbitrage traders at Goldman Sachs, and he is now guiding them in the ways of securing influence in Washington. 
 Eric Mindich, who runs Eton Park, a $5 billion hedge fund, led Goldman's arbitrage desk at the age of 25, and in 1994, at 27, became Goldman's youngest partner ever. Of the bunch, he comes the closest to being Luke Skywalker: a Harvard graduate like Mr. Rubin, he is a trustee and major donor, with Mr. Rubin, at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. He is also a contributor to Mr. Rubin's favorite senator, Kent Conrad, the Democrat from North Dakota. 
 Then there is Richard C. Perry, who left Goldman's arbitrage desk in 1988 to form Perry Partners, now an $11 billion hedge fund. And Thomas F. Steyer, the founder of Farallon Capital, a $16 billion hedge fund, who also worked under Mr. Rubin in the 1980's and was an adviser to Senator John Kerry's presidential campaign in 2004.
 All three men are generous Democratic donors. But in the public policy realm they are relative neophytes -- just as Mr. Rubin was in the early 1990's before he signed on with President Clinton. 
 ''This is not a political undertaking,'' Mr. Rubin said in an interview. ''There have been some major policy disappointments and they need to be debated. You can conduct this debate without engaging the question of political attribution.''
 Asked if the project would take aim at Bush administration policies that he has criticized publicly, like tax cuts and the fiscal deficit, Mr. Rubin took the high road. 
 ''If you go over everything I have said, you would never see the word 'Bush,' '' he said. ''I make a distinction between policy and politics. There are some immense issues -- the stagnancy of real wages, economic security, the fiscal deficit. We are trying to stir debate.''
 True to his word, the initial output from the project has had a heavy, if not eye-glazing, emphasis on policy, and has been light on the politics. Among the topics tackled are the volatility of income levels, improving productivity of the federal government, and ensuring that free trade remains friendly to American workers. ''When Bob Rubin and others are involved, it becomes an important vehicle,'' said Orin S. Kramer, a hedge fund investor and a prominent Democratic fund-raiser. ''And if you are trying to change the direction of policy, that is what politics is all about.''
 So while Mr. Rubin remains above the fray -- he says he will not lend his support to any individual until the party chooses a Democratic candidate -- most of the others he has recruited have already become fully engaged.
 Mr. Altman, a college classmate of President Clinton who also served briefly in his administration, has emerged as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's leading economic adviser, and Mr. Perry, Mr. Steyer and some other financial executives have lent their financial support. 
 The project is largely financed by Mr. Rubin and his financial backers, all of whom contribute an equal amount each year -- said to be between $100,000 and $150,000 -- to its approximately $2 million operating budget.
 As he has done in politics, Mr. Rubin has kept himself at a distant remove at Citigroup, his base of operations since 1999, particularly from the criticisms leveled at Mr. Prince over the bank's sluggish growth. 
 Partly this is a consequence of his unusual job description. As an executive at the company, he has no operational responsibility, and as a director he sits on no board committees (the executive committee, of which he is chairman, rarely meets). And partly it is a function of his personal style. 
 ''He has this enormous influence and yet he is not on the radar screen when people are looking to assign credit or blame,'' said Michael Holland, an investor and longtime shareholder of Citigroup. ''I presume it is very comfortable for him that way.''
 At Ford, where he was a director since 2000, he stepped down last month, citing banking conflicts. 
 Still, there are some who have asked what it is that he does to earn his guaranteed $15 million a year. An influential rainmaker at the company, he meets frequently with clients in the public and private sectors. His outside interests are broad as well as time-consuming. As part of his contract, he is given free rein to indulge himself in this regard and to use Citigroup's planes to do so. 
 Last year, he booked $330,000 worth of personal travel time, almost three times as much as Mr. Prince logged, according to the bank's proxy. Starting this year, he will reimburse Citigroup for his personal use of corporate aircraft. 
 At Citigroup's investor day last year, Michael L. Mayo, a bank analyst with Prudential Equity Group, put the question directly to Mr. Prince: What is it, exactly, that Mr. Rubin does?
 ''He has been very, very important in our strategic thinking,'' Mr. Prince replied. ''Especially about international. Bob is a big influence in the place.''
 As a member of the chairman's office with Mr. Prince and part of the committee of 12 business heads, Mr. Rubin has become a valued adviser, especially now, given the youth and untested qualities of Mr. Prince's potential successors.
 ''My office is right next to Chuck's and he uses me as a sounding board,'' said Mr. Rubin. Currently, a crucial matter of debate on the board has been how much Citigroup needs to invest in its investment bank and consumer franchise to make up for the years of neglect in these areas. Mr. Prince, with the support of Mr. Rubin, has been an advocate for an aggressive commitment of more resources. Other directors have been less enthusiastic as costs have increased.
 ''I think he is on the right track,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''My impression of the board is that there is broad-base agreement to invest to get us where we need to be. If there is discussion, it's a matter of degree and pace.''

HEADLINE: Candidates Say Bush's Efforts Won't Hurt, but May Not Help

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and ADAM NAGOURNEY; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7 

 BODY:
President Bush's effort to refocus attention on national security is still in its early stages, but Republicans facing tough races said Thursday that their initial reaction was that it would not substantially alter the political environment in their favor.
 Even as the White House followed up on Mr. Bush's series of speeches with steps like e-mailing talking points to sympathetic radio talk show hosts and unleashing new attacks on Democrats, the candidates who are the intended beneficiaries -- Republicans in danger of losing House and Senate seats -- suggested that the president might have trouble changing the way voters are approaching the election. 
''It just doesn't help me; the things he says or does in my district don't really help,'' said Representative Rob Simmons of Connecticut, a Republican facing a particularly tough challenge from Democrats. ''My race is about me, not about him. I learned a long time ago to continue to focus on my people and their needs.'' 
 Representative Chris Chocola, Republican of Indiana, said the war in Iraq had not played a central role in his campaign. ''I don't think it will change the environment,'' Mr. Chocola said.
 He added, ''I think it will help focus on the issues, and I think it is an important issue to focus on.''
 In Michigan, Mike Bouchard, the Republican challenger to Senator Debbie Stabenow, said he was campaigning on economic issues, not security. Although Mr. Bush will visit Michigan on Friday to raise money for Mr. Bouchard at the end of what the White House sees as a successful week, the two men will not campaign together, Mr. Bouchard said.
 ''I appreciate his support, and he's going to help me raise valuable resources,'' he said. ''But the focus of my campaign is Michigan: I'm on the ballot.''
 Similarly, Mr. Bush will appear at a fund-raiser on the same day for Senator Jim Talent of Missouri, another endangered Republican. Mr. Talent's aides said that the president and Mr. Talent would not campaign together, continuing a pattern in which Republican candidates in tough races have distanced themselves from Mr. Bush even as they have taken advantage of his ability to raise money for them.
 Mr. Bush's announcement on Wednesday that he had transferred 14 high-profile terrorism suspects into military custody and wanted them brought to trial in military tribunals was an example of a president's unmatched power to shape events and influence the politics of an issue.
 In coming weeks, both parties will be trying to assess the impact of his move and recalibrate their strategies accordingly as they head toward Election Day. 
 The early responses from Republican candidates could change if the White House message breaks through, and some Republicans praised Mr. Bush on Thursday for having made his case.
 Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, one of the most endangered Republicans in the Senate and a steadfast defender of Mr. Bush and his administration, said the president's effort could only help.
 ''I think it is important for the conduct of this war to better explain what is going on, the nature of the enemy we are facing, the complexity we are dealing with,'' Mr. Santorum said. ''What I have found when I have talked about this and laid out in broader detail the threat we are confronting and the challenge in meeting that threat, people come up to me universally and say: 'Boy, I didn't know that. Now I have a better understanding.' ''
 ''Until recently,'' he said, ''I don't think the president has really done that effectively.''
 The remarks came as the White House continued to roll out a post-Labor Day campaign that offered echoes of the Republican National Convention in New York two years ago, where Mr. Bush was nominated to a second term amid constant reminders about the attacks of Sept. 11. 
 And the speeches by Mr. Bush were just one part of what Karl Rove, the president's chief strategist, told lobbyists in a private briefing this week would be a hard-charging effort that would include frequent quotations from Osama bin Laden and a warning that terrorists were out to destroy Israel and dominate the world economy through the control of oil reserves.
 In a repeat of the 2004 campaign, a group supportive of the president, Progress for America, began running an advertisement this week on national cable television and on stations in Missouri echoing Mr. Bush's new theme. With images including the World Trade Center collapsing on Sept. 11, 2001, and pictures of terrorists, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of the Iraqi insurgency who was killed in June, an announcer says, ''These people want to kill us.''
 The announcer continues: ''Many seem to have forgotten the evil that happened only five years ago. They would cut and run in the Middle East, leaving Al Qaeda to attack us again.''
 Stuart Roy, a spokesman for Progress for America, said the group was not coordinating with the White House.
 ''I'm sure that there are people within the administration that are aware generally of what we are doing,'' Mr. Roy said. But, he said, ''We haven't had any substantial heads-up from the White House about the elements of the speech or their particular schedule.''
 In addition to the talking points e-mailed by the Republican National Committee, Sara Taylor, the White House political director, held a briefing with hundreds of state Republican Party executive directors and communications directors going over points they should make to local reporters to reinforce the White House message. And the Republican National Committee released a mock newspaper called America Weakly, intended to portray Democrats as weak on national security.
 Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut, one of three Republicans in the state facing a tough challenge, said that while he appreciated the effort by Mr. Bush, it would not matter significantly in his race.
 ''I think he needs to be doing what he is doing, but I don't think it is going to be all that helpful,'' Mr. Shays said. ''There are very few undecided folks. People have pretty much made up as to how they are going to vote. But do I think it is important the president says what he believes? Absolutely.''

HEADLINE: Corzine Offers Proposals To Bolster Business Climate

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 7 

 BODY:
Jon S. Corzine's official title is governor of New Jersey. But he would also like to be thought of as marketer in chief.
 Stating repeatedly on Thursday that he wanted to improve the sagging business climate in New Jersey, Mr. Corzine unveiled what he billed as an economic growth strategy devised to make the state more hospitable to business and to generate at least 30,000 new jobs a year.
To help small and medium-size businesses struggling to get by in an expensive state with high taxes during a sluggish economic period, Mr. Corzine pledged to dedicate $335 million of existing state funds to attract more than $900 million in venture capital. To generate more revenue, he pledged to make the state more appealing to international businesses, whether through an expansion of existing trade zones or increased trade missions abroad. 
 And through it all, he pledged to erase the perception that New Jersey was, in his words, ''adversarial'' to business.
 ''If we don't actually make the case that New Jersey is the place to be, instead of beating up on ourselves all the time, we're going to have a hard time convincing anyone to want to be here,'' Mr. Corzine said in a speech at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. ''We're going to work on changing the perception. I'm going to make myself marketer in chief.''
 At 40 minutes, the speech was one of the longest -- if not the longest -- that Mr. Corzine has delivered since taking office in January. But business is a subject that Mr. Corzine feels passionately about, and knows quite well, having served as co-chairman of Goldman Sachs.
 Many business leaders and elected officials had been anticipating the speech for weeks, hopeful that, given his Wall Street background, Mr. Corzine would offer new ideas or practices to stimulate the economy.
 Many were also optimistic that Mr. Corzine's point person on the plan -- Gary D. Rose, director of the new Office of Economic Growth, who is a former colleague of Mr. Corzine's at Goldman Sachs -- would be motivated more by business than by politics.
 Most groups -- businesses, educators, environmentalists -- responded enthusiastically to the address.
 ''For the first time in years, we have a comprehensive plan to tackle many of the problems that have been holding our private-sector economy back,'' said Philip Kirschner, president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. ''Gov. Jon Corzine has picked up on many of the key issues facing employers. This is a report that attempts to build on the state's strengths and address the problems that many businesses face.''
 Environmentalists said they were pleased that Mr. Corzine had talked about alternative energy and redevelopment of brownfields -- former industrial sites where there may be contaminants -- as examples of how to balance economic development with environmental considerations.
 ''He laid out a creditable skeleton,'' said David Pringle, campaign director of the New Jersey Environmental Federation. ''Now he's got to put the right meat on the bones.''
 But there was a degree of skittishness as well because of recent economic trends. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia projected that economic growth in New Jersey would be only 0.6 percent during the next nine months, the slowest rate in nearly five years.
 Although the bank based its projection on an increase in initial unemployment claims, a drop in housing permits and paltry growth in private-sector jobs, some Republicans noted that Mr. Corzine recently had raised the sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent to help plug a $4 billion budget deficit.
 ''While I commend Mr. Rose and the governor on recognizing the challenges we have in overcoming the complicated bureaucracy, and while I think the process part is relevant, I do think the issue is more fundamental than that, and it relates to the very high tax burden in New Jersey,'' the Senate minority leader, Leonard Lance, said.
 As an indication of the plan's importance to the Corzine administration, Mr. Rose was joined by 10 other cabinet officers to elaborate on the plan at a news conference after the governor spoke.
 In his speech, Mr. Corzine acknowledged that the state would have to do more with fewer resources. But he said that money could be saved by reducing the number of agencies involved in development, perhaps streamlining the bureaucracy under the aegis of either the state's Economic Development Authority or the newly created 36-member Economic Growth Council.
 Mr. Corzine also promised that the state would gauge the effectiveness of incentive and grant programs for businesses. But as an example of just how stiff the competition would be, Mr. Corzine noted that during a recent trade mission to China, he encountered two other states there embarking on similar ventures.
 ''If you don't ask for the trade, in the world that I came from,'' said Mr. Corzine, who spent most of his career at Goldman Sachs as a bond trader, ''you don't get it.''

HEADLINE: Remote Control For Health Care 

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The communications system at her home bedside can't cure Heather Huntoon. But it may be helping keep her alive. 
 Since the night 18 months ago when she woke up fearing she was having a heart attack, Mrs. Huntoon's life has been dominated by a succession of heart, kidney and circulatory problems that have repeatedly landed her in the hospital.
''When you go through what I've been through, you have an overwhelming feeling that you can't trust your body any longer,'' said Mrs. Huntoon, who is 42 and lives near Wichita, Kan.
 But Mrs. Huntoon does trust the lifesaving potential of an array of devices that let doctors monitor her condition remotely. Mrs. Huntoon's setup is among the most sophisticated of the remote-monitoring systems now in use around the country to follow several hundred thousand patients. 
 The centerpiece of her system is an implanted device that regulates her heartbeat, delivers lifesaving shocks when necessary, and wirelessly communicates with her doctors via the Internet. 
 The same communications system is also linked to her blood-pressure monitor and a bedside electronic scale. By remotely watching data on her condition for signs of the next potentially life-threatening development, her doctors have occasionally been able to change her heart medications in time to let Mrs. Huntoon avoid yet another trip to the hospital. 
 A month ago, the system alerted her doctors that it might be time for her to be readmitted. Weight gains picked up by Mrs. Huntoon's monitors led to a series of phone consultations in which she reported unusual dizziness and breathing problems. She was quickly sent to the hospital where a CAT scan revealed the onset of pneumonia. She was released a week later. 
 Medical device makers see patients like Mrs. Huntoon as harbingers of technology changes that will allow tens of millions of Americans with chronic problems like heart failure, diabetes and mental illness to have their conditions constantly monitored, remotely and virtually, as they go about their daily lives. The payoff for patients could be more effective use of drugs, fewer and shorter hospital stays, and longer stretches between routine visits to physicians' offices. 
 ''It's about just-in-time medicine, instead of just-in-case,'' said Dr. Adam Darkins, a care coordination expert at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which oversees the Veterans Health Administration. 
 The department is currently using relatively simple home monitoring devices to help manage the treatment of nearly 14,000 military veterans suffering from heart disease, depression, diabetes and post-traumatic stress disorder, Dr. Darkins said. It plans to expand to 21,000 patients by October.
 The many companies betting on remote-monitoring medical technology include makers of implantable devices like Medtronic, instrument companies like Honeywell and Philips, and countless hardware and software companies ranging from start-ups to giants like Intel. 
 Business executives say that demographics and health care economics will give patients and doctors little choice but to adopt the technologies as they improve. 
 ''The aging population and chronic diseases create an untenable drain on the health care delivery system,'' said L. David Whitlinger, a health care electronics specialist at Intel, which sees the growing array of networked devices being developed for remote and automated medicine as a huge new market for its microchips. 
 ''The hospital bed and waiting room of the future is your home,'' Mr. Whitlinger said. 
 For every extreme case like Mrs. Huntoon's, there are many more patients like Mason Bohana.
 Mr. Bohana, an 82-year-old World War II veteran, has been able to move from living in a hospice under round-the-clock medical supervision to a Brooklyn studio apartment with the help of a relatively simple monitoring system from Health Buddy Networks. 
 The hand-held Health Buddy console, which plugs into his phone, delivers his blood pressure and weight readings to a Veterans Affairs nurse. It also prompts him to answer a series of qualitative questions about his lung and circulatory ailments, like whether his breathing is better or worse than the day before.
 ''This is so simple a 2-year-old could do it,'' Mr. Bohana said. 
 Still, the industry's vision of an electronic health care network that never sleeps is a long way from reality. 
 Even leading-edge systems like Mrs. Huntoon's currently fail to provide a comprehensive picture of chronic diseases. She had to be hospitalized in July when a drop in potassium levels in her blood -- something none of her devices track -- destabilized her heart. 
 For many doctors, there is also a pragmatic financial concern about gathering and reviewing remote data because many insurers are providing little or no reimbursement for such work.
 ''There's only so much time in a day you can devote to some of these things,'' said Dr. Stephen T. Hustead, a doctor in Coon Rapids, Minn., who implants heart devices like Mrs. Huntoon's.
 So far, doctors say, there are no set standards for how frequently the available data must be checked. Many physicians currently rely on data collection services run by the device companies and independent monitoring services to warn them of anomalies that might require prompt attention. But doctors and their employees fear that plaintiffs' lawyers will try to pin legal responsibility for recognizing warning signals on them, no matter who is collecting the data. 
 ''You have to follow up on more things,'' said Jennifer Gorham, one of the nurses working in Coon Rapids for Dr. Hustead and his partners at Metropolitan Cardiology Consultants. ''If the device is programmed to look for it, you have to look for it.''
 A main use of the data gathered by the newest devices is to reconstruct events that send patients to emergency rooms. In some cases involving heart implants, doctors get the data soon enough to reassure patients that their implant has restored normal heart function and there is no need for such a trip.
 More often, the remotely monitored data is used to cut down on the need for routine checkups. Many of Dr. Hustead's patients come to his office once or twice a year now instead of every three months. A Veterans Affairs study that followed 70 patients over three months found that remote monitoring of their heart implants freed up eight days of time doctors would otherwise have devoted to office visits. 
 Determining what the devices should be looking for, however, is a work in progress. In cardiac care, Medtronic and its rivals, including Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical, have competing visions of how to provide the earliest reliable warning of fluid buildup in the lungs and other signs of imminent heart failure. 
 ''Picking what you want to measure is a big part of what's going on today,'' said Mike Coyle, president of St. Jude's cardiac rhythm management division. 
 The various companies are also competing to develop the best systems for getting data from the devices to patients and health care providers. 
 Mrs. Huntoon's wireless system linking the implant, the scale and the blood pressure monitor is a product called Latitude. Guidant, which designed Latitude and began rolling it out late last year, was acquired by Boston Scientific in April.
 For now, the only implantable heart device Latitude works with is Guidant's top-of-the line Contak Renewal defibrillator. But Boston Scientific plans to expand the wireless communications features to its other defibrillators and pacemakers.
 Boston Scientific is playing catchup to Medtronic, which has built up a data monitoring subsidiary called CareLink that can track data from 95 percent of its heart implant product line for doctors. Medtronic says that the network currently has 80,000 patients. Medtronic is now working on extending the CareLink concept to its diabetes monitors and insulin pumps. 
 One hot new area for the device industry is diabetes monitors that check blood sugar levels every five minutes through a tiny catheter inserted just under the skin of the abdomen. Medtronic received Food and Drug Administration approval to market its Guardian unit in August 2005. DexCom, a start-up company based in San Diego, began selling a similar device in the $6 billion diabetes care market in March. A third company, Abbott Laboratories, expects clearance to introduce its version by the end of this year. 
 The main function of the devices is to provide direct feedback to patients, letting them know when to take an insulin shot or alter their diet to avoid short-term symptoms of unbalanced blood sugar, like headaches and dizziness. 
 Such virtually continuous glucose monitors are more expensive, though less accurate, than the traditional finger-prick blood tests that millions of diabetics use, typically once or twice a day. The DexCom device, for instance, costs $800, plus $35 for sensors that are replaced every three days to limit the risk of infection. 
 Still, continuous monitoring is an important breakthrough, according to experts like Dr. Aaron Kowalski, scientific program director for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.
 Keeping tabs on such data not only helps avoid short-term discomfort but also lowers the risks of long-term complications like stroke, blindness and heart disease. And the data collected on the devices, which can be downloaded to a personal computer, provides doctors with a much clearer picture of how well their patients are managing the disease.
 ''Knowing which way your glucose is going is really important in controlling diabetes,'' said Dr. Kowalski, himself a diabetic. He described getting a DexCom device for himself in April as ''almost a life-changing experience.''
 Mrs. Huntoon says longer stretches between hospitalizations would be enough of a life change to make her happy. She says she hopes her doctors can add remote monitoring of her potassium levels to her routine, thus increasing the chances of stabilizing her unreliable heart. 
 The hospital employees know her so well they treat her like family, Mrs. Huntoon said. ''But I don't want to be a part of that anymore.''

HEADLINE: A Strategy For Prudence On Pensions 

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The winter of 2002 was a scary time for pension funds and the millions of Americans whose retirement they have promised to secure.
 Investment losses had wiped away billions of dollars. Required contributions were ballooning. Some companies even started talking about going into bankruptcy, in part because they could no longer afford their pension obligations. Congress and the Bush administration began planning to tighten the law.
Most corporate pension funds sat tight, warning that if the government got too tough, they would be forced to freeze their plans. But one large company, International Paper, decided to strike out in an entirely different direction.
 Today, International Paper's $7 billion pension fund, which covers 175,000 people, is three years into a broad revamping, one that the company believes will protect it from the forces that wreaked havoc in the last few years. 
 When the changes to its investment strategy are complete, said Robert Hunkeler, the company's vice president for investments, ''we will have protected the company and the plan -- and therefore the plan participants -- from the worst effects of interest rate moves.'' 
 The ability to shelter the plan from financial storms has allowed International Paper to keep it going, even as a number of other large companies, like I.B.M., Tenneco and DuPont, have frozen theirs.
 Freezing a plan halts the growth of benefits, and even though most companies sweeten the pill by expanding their 401(k) programs, the move often dashes the hopes of older workers. That is because in traditional pensions, which provide a predictable monthly income in retirement, workers typically build the biggest part of their benefit in their last few years of service.
 Danny Morris, president of the United Steel Workers local that represents 400 employees in International Paper's mill in Courtland, Ala., said that he was pleased with the steps the company had taken to make its pension fund more secure. 
 Pensions, he said, are always ''the No. 1 topic'' when he asks his members what matters to them most. The average worker at the mill is 54 years old, he said, with 25 to 35 years of service. A pension freeze would devastate them. 
 ''It's really the only thing they've known all through the years,'' he said of the plan, which pays a flat pension of $45 a month for every year of service a person has completed. ''Any time you start talking about a change to the pension plan it sort of scares people.'' 
 Yet even as traditional pension plans -- which still cover about 21 million of the nation's 115 million private-sector employees -- have come under siege, International Paper's efforts suggest there may be ways of preserving them, at least for those already promised a pension when they retire. 
 International Paper began putting newly hired employees into a 401(k) plan after an acquisition in 2004, but the previous employees still participate in the pension plan, with no freeze. And others are beginning to look at International Paper's approach as a possible way out of the pension minefield.
 ''There's a very healthy discourse that's taking place in the industry,'' said Joseph Nankof, a partner with Rocaton Investment Advisors, a firm in Norwalk, Conn., that advises pension funds, including the one at International Paper.
 It can take a strong stomach to make the necessary changes, however, because they involve breaking away from the herd approach to managing pension assets. Federal law requires pension officials to operate ''prudently,'' and years of court decisions have taught them that they will be bulletproof in a lawsuit if they stick to the same investment techniques everybody else uses.
 Nearly all pension funds invest in a broad mix of stocks and bonds, counting on expected gains over the long run to make up for any short-run losses. But that approach has exposed companies -- and their shareholders -- to big risks.
 The risks were hidden by the longstanding actuarial practice of ''smoothing'' pension numbers, or spreading short-term market swings over many years. Smoothing was supposed to reduce pension volatility, but it is now widely understood to have merely concealed volatility that was there all along. 
 The pension law that Congress just approved, along with coming accounting changes, will greatly reduce the ability of companies to smooth their pension numbers. So if a company decides to use an aggressive, high-volatility pension strategy in the future, investors will be able to see it and may well shun the company's shares.
 One of the biggest sources of pension fund volatility is interest rates.
 Pension funds are acutely sensitive to interest rate changes because of the role rates play in setting the value of pension benefits that will be paid in the future. When interest rates fall, the value of the benefits rises because it will take more of today's dollars, compounding at the lower rates, to be able to pay benefits falling due in the future.
 The interest rate effect is very powerful. The decline of interest rates, combined with depressed stock prices, brought many pension funds to their knees in the early years of the decade. At G.M., for example, a mere quarter-point rate decline increased pension obligations by $2.3 billion.
 The interest rate International Paper uses for its pension calculations fell by a full percentage point from 2001 to 2003, and smoothing, rather than eliminating the pain, was making it last longer. 
 Those harsh conditions made Mr. Hunkeler start to think, in 2002, about hedging International Paper's pension fund against future rate swings. He knew it would be possible to do this with fixed-income assets, like bonds.
 Bonds react to interest rate changes in the same way pension obligations do. When rates fall, bond prices go up. So if International Paper had bonds in its pension fund that matched the characteristics of its pension obligations, it would not matter how far rates fell -- the prices of the bonds would rise in step to keep pace with the increased pension obligations.
 Mr. Hunkeler was not the first person to think of this. A number of pension funds in the 1980's bought bonds with payment schedules timed to coincide with the benefit payments they owed. High interest rates at that time made such bonds inexpensive.
 American Airlines adopted such a strategy in 1987. Its investment manager, William F. Quinn, held onto the bonds even in the 1990's, when the soaring stock market made bond-matching strategies go out of style and lured many pension funds into putting most of their money into stocks. 
 Keeping the hedge intact proved a good move. Of all the major airlines, American's bond-laden pension fund weathered the financial storms of the last few years the best. The pension funds at most other airlines -- United, US Airways, Aloha, and now Delta -- have failed, leading them to be taken over by the federal government. 
 American's pension fund, meanwhile, is ''below where it needs to be, but it is in much better shape than most of the others,'' Robert L. Crandall, the former chief executive of American, told a Congressional committee two years ago. ''Anybody who wants to offer a fixed-benefit pension plan should be required to put those assets into long-term fixed-income instruments which match the liability stream over time,'' Mr. Crandall said in his testimony.
 ''If that happens, Senator,'' he added under questioning from Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, ''you won't ever have underfunded benefit plans.'' 
 International Paper already had about 20 percent of its total portfolio in bonds at the end of 2002. But the bonds were not serving as a hedge against interest rate swings, because their durations then did not match those of the company's pension obligations.
 The bonds in International Paper's pension fund had a duration of four or five years in 2002, Mr. Hunkeler said, but its pension obligations had a duration of about 12 years. The difference meant the bonds and the pension obligations would not respond the same way to interest rate changes.
 To make a better match, Mr. Hunkeler needed bonds with longer durations. One way to get them would be to do what American Airlines did: sell the existing bonds and buy new, longer ones. But buying enough long bonds to carry out that strategy was a lot more expensive in 2002 than in the 1980's. 
 So Mr. Hunkeler chose a second method, which used a financial instrument, interest rate swaps, to extend the duration of the bonds the pension fund already owned.
 Interest rate swaps are a relatively recent innovation, but they are in widespread use. The global market is valued at almost $5 trillion, according to the Bank for International Settlements. 
 International Paper is setting up its hedge in phases. Starting in December 2002, it extended the duration of its bonds to 10 years, then kept the portfolio at that point for three years, while the company evaluated how the strategy was working. 
 Phase 2 began this year. It involves expanding the hedge until 50 percent of International Paper's pension obligations are hedged against interest rate swings, a process Mr. Hunkeler says will take two to three more years. He said a company like International Paper would probably get the greatest benefit from the strategy when 75 percent of its pension obligations were hedged, but it was not rushing to get there.
 Indeed, International Paper is confident that even if it takes several years to fully build its hedge, it will still be better positioned than most companies that have not even started to secure their pensions.
 ''It's like the old joke, 'How fast do you have to run to outrun a hungry bear?' '' Mr. Hunkeler said. ''You have to run faster than your friend.''

HEADLINE: Singapore's Barring of Some Activists Prompts a Protest 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN and WAYNE ARNOLD; Steven R. Weisman reported from Washington and Wayne Arnold from Singapore.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 

 BODY:
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, two organizations that repeatedly praise the role of ''civil society'' activist groups in poor countries, have protested a decision by Singapore to bar representatives of several such groups at their meeting with the leaders of poor countries next week. 
 The action by Singapore was taken out of fear of protests and violence, according to the Singapore police. But several of those barred were invited by both the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to attend the meetings as part of a general effort in recent years to reach out to nongovernment organizations. 
''We believe that all individuals who have been accredited to the annual meetings should be allowed to attend,'' the two organizations said Friday. ''We strongly urge the Singapore government to act swiftly and reverse their decision on entry and access to the meetings for these representatives.''
 The State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said the United States understood Singapore's concerns about security and recognized its sovereign right to handle it the best way it saw fit. But he called on Singapore ''to be as flexible as possible'' and let those groups accredited to attend do so ''and express their views.''
 Singapore generally has a low tolerance for political protests and unruly behavior, sometimes invoking extremely punitive laws against foreigners. The government previously banned outdoor protests at the meeting.
 Accordingly, several groups have organized protests on the nearby island of Batam, a part of Indonesia, but it was not clear whether Indonesia would let them take place.
 Leaders of the bank and the fund, established after World War II as the guardians of economic stability and poverty reduction, are due to meet with scores of finance ministers next week. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. is to represent the United States, along with Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve board.
 The move by Singapore was especially embarrassing for the bank's president, Paul D. Wolfowitz, who has made his appeals for proper ''governance'' a cornerstone of his 15 months at the bank and called on poor countries around the world to strengthen the role of nongovernment organizations.
 The annual meetings of the two organizations have been a focus of protests over the years by dissidents demonstrating against trade, environmental and economic policies of the richest countries of the world. Such protests have nearly shut down some meetings but in recent years the protests have been peaceful.
 Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have tried to quiet the rebellion by inviting groups to their meeting. For next week's session, they have accredited nearly 500 representatives from more than 45 countries, they said Friday.
 Among the individuals barred from Singapore was Antonio Tricarico, coordinator of an Italian group, Campaign to Reform the World Bank. The barred groups included the International NGO Forum of Indonesia, or Infid; Focus on the Global South, based in Thailand; and the World Development Movement, based in Britain.
 ''It's completely astonishing,'' Mr. Tricarico said, ''in particular because the World Bank welcomed us to go and even our government cleared our participation.'' He said he had never been involved in any violent protests.
 The Singapore police issued a statement saying that the annual meetings of the bank and the fund would ''attract the attention of many, not least those who may want to use the ready platform and presence of the international media to stage events that will pose a security threat to Singapore.''

HEADLINE: Now Arriving: Ideas on Boarding

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
NECESSITY may or may not be the mother of invention, but it may eliminate one of the small -- but vexing -- problems that has plagued business (and other) travelers seemingly forever.
 As anyone who has ever flown knows, the longstanding policy of boarding passengers starting at the rear of the plane makes limited sense.
Yes, it keeps people from bunching up at the front of the plane as they try to find their seats. But invariably the person in 28A, a window seat, comes aboard after the person in 28C, on the aisle, is seated. As they maneuver to get into their correct seats, they inevitably move into the cramped aisle, bumping into the people behind them. A domino effect ensues. Before you know it, passengers are backed up into the jetway. 
 That may change.
 ''Facing huge fuel bills and competition from small carriers, some big airlines are cutting costs by dropping the old back-to-front method for boarding passengers,'' Reader's Digest reports.
 United Airlines says its window-middle-aisle seating policy, introduced last fall, saves four to five minutes a flight and $1 million a year. And the magazine says US Airways is trying what it describes as a ''reverse pyramid'' -- window seats in back first; aisle seats in front last, which would seem to make the most sense.
 Now, if they could just do something about legroom and on-time arrivals.
 INNOVATION U -- Maybe the nation's colleges should start offering a course titled Dealing With Venture Capitalists 101.
 Saying ''the next 20 years of American innovation will be shaped by these 10 cutting-edge science and engineering programs,'' Popular Mechanics highlighted various projects at those colleges, with many of them seeming to have substantial commercial possibilities.
 At Olin College in Needham, Mass., students are building robot tractors as part of the curriculum devoted to real world engineering applications.
 Understanding that ''powering office buildings accounts for 36 percent of the United States' energy consumption,'' students at the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design in Denver are working on creating ''green'' office buildings.
 In a project financed by Johnson Controls, students at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif., are working to design car interiors for the disabled and elderly.
 And at the University of California, Irvine, students are working to create computer and video games ''that project themselves as fully realized alternate realities.''
 CHINA POWER -- ''As China's economy has soared at consistently astonishing rates, many global companies have focused on serving the country's most affluent urban customers,'' The McKinsey Quarterly reports, adding that when those people were the only consumers with significant disposable income, that decision made sense.
 There is, however, a new, large market to pursue: China's rising urban middle class, write Diana Farrell, Ulrich A. Gersch and Elizabeth Stephenson. ''The rising economy in China will lift hundreds of millions of households out of poverty,'' they write. ''Today 77 percent of urban Chinese households live on less than 25,000 renminbi (about $3,125) a year; we estimate that by 2025 that figure will drop to 10 percent.
 ''By then, urban households in China will make up one of the largest consumer markets in the world, spending about 20 trillion renminbi annually -- almost as much as all Japanese households spend today.'' 
 The authors' recommend that businesses start looking at this market today. By doing so, a business ''will gain the exposure and experience necessary to stay relevant as the incomes and tastes of urban consumers evolve.''
 FINAL TAKE -- Should a pandemic flu strike, at least you can be stylishly dressed, The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists reports. Fashion Flu Masks of New York offers surgical masks, approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with animal prints or sequins or studded suede trim. Maybe it really is, in the words of that old ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch, better to look good than feel good. PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: Use of Nonprime Mortgages Jumped Sharply in 2005

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 

 BODY:
Mortgage lending data show a sharp increase in the use of higher-priced ''nonprime'' mortgages for home purchases in 2005 over 2004, and even steeper gains in the incidence of such loans among blacks and Hispanics, a Federal Reserve study showed Friday. 
 The mortgage data, gathered from lenders under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, show more buyers were pushed out of the most favorable loan categories as they stretched to buy homes at the height of the housing boom. Home prices in many markets peaked in the third quarter of 2005.
The Fed study showed higher-priced first-lien mortgages, which it described as three percentage points over Treasury yields of comparable maturities, made up 24.6 percent of conventional home purchase loans on owner-occupied homes, compared with 11.5 percent in 2004.
 Among blacks, such loans made up 54.7 percent of 2005 home purchase loans, compared with 32.4 percent in 2004. Among whites, the incidence of such loans was 17.2 percent in 2005, compared with 8.7 percent in 2004, while among Hispanics, it was 46.1 percent in 2005 compared with 20.3 percent in 2004.
 The incidence of such ''subprime'' and ''near-prime'' loans among Asians was 16.6 percent in 2005 compared with 5.9 percent in 2004, the Fed said.
 Blacks were also the most likely to be denied a home purchase mortgage loan in 2005, with a denial rate of 27.5 percent, compared with 18.0 percent for Hispanics, 15.8 percent for Asians and 12.3 percent for whites.
 The study said the jump in higher-priced lending was driven partly by a flattening of the Treasury yield, which pushed up home mortgage rates, particularly for adjustable rate loans.
 Consequently, loans with the same risk characteristics would have had higher interest rates in 2005 and more of them would have been categorized as nonprime under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.
 It also said borrower-specific risks generally increased, pushing more buyers into nonprime categories.
 ''Evidence indicates that changes in risk characteristics varied across geographic regions, largely because of substantial house-price appreciation in some locals, and likely caused more borrowers to stretch financially to obtain loans,'' the Fed said. 
 Piggy-back lending, the use of second-lien mortgages to allow buyers to buy homes with down payments of less than 20 percent, also grew substantially in 2005 and accounted for more than half the increase in the number of higher-priced loans.

HEADLINE: Consumer Credit Slowed in July As Higher Wages Provided Cash 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing increased less than expected in July as higher incomes allowed Americans to reduce their credit card use.
 Consumer credit, or nonmortgage loans to individuals, rose 2.8 percent at an annual rate, to $2.35 trillion, the Federal Reserve said yesterday in Washington. In June, consumer debt increased at a rate of 7.3 percent. 
Rising wages gave Americans more cash to spend as they went to shopping malls and auto dealerships in July. Consumer borrowing and spending may slow in coming months as the cooling housing market dents confidence and household wealth.
 ''Consumers have seen a pickup in their wages lately and this may be one reason they are not overdoing it when it comes to paying the bills with their credit cards,'' said Chris Rupkey, an economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York. ''They are not overextending themselves to make purchases.''
 Total consumer borrowing increased by $5.5 billion in July, the report showed. Economists had forecast an increase of $6.8 billion after an initially reported gain of $10.3 billion in June, according to a median of forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.
 Nonrevolving debt, including loans to buy cars, rose $3.1 billion in July after increasing $5.01 billion in June. Revolving debt, which includes credit cards, rose $2.4 billion after gaining $9.1 billion.
 Home sales have been depressed by rising borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark lending rate to 5.25 percent on June 29, the 17th straight increase since June 2004. The prime lending rate, the basis for home equity loans and other consumer debt, has risen to 8.25 percent from a four-decade low of 4 percent at the start of the Fed increases.
 At the same time, cooling home prices have made home equity loans less attractive
 ''Credit card borrowing has been going down for the last few years mainly because people have been refinancing credit card debt into their mortgages,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's in New York. ''That is going to go in the other direction.''

HEADLINE: Measuring National Economies by the Arm's Length 

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
FINANCIAL systems in major countries around the world are gradually being transformed by new technologies and additional competition, but the pace of change varies drastically from country to country, and that can have an effect on economic cycles. 
 The International Monetary Fund announced this week that it had created a new ''financial index'' for countries, measuring the degree to which they are more ''arm's length'' or ''relationship based'' when it comes to transactions. In the first category, there are more transactions in which the parties have little information that is not available publicly about those they are doing business with. The United States is the leader in that group.
Countries in the second category remain more reliant on longer-term relationships between borrowers and lenders. Germany is the leader in that group, but it, too, is moving toward arm's length transactions. 
 The I.M.F.'s World Economic Outlook argued that arm's length economies are better equipped to move capital from old industries to new ones, which helps productivity and lifts growth. In relationship-based systems, banks are more likely to feel they have a stake in the continuing well-being of their customers, and are therefore more willing to lend in hard times.
 Households in arm's length systems find it easier to borrow, and they do so. But household debt in all countries, expressed in relation to personal income, appears to be rising.
 The chart here shows one indication of just how ''arm's length'' an economy is, measuring the amount of bonds and stock that are traded, in relation to national gross domestic product, and how much of that is held internationally. The more securities there are, and the more widely they are held, the more arm's length a financial system. The figures show the United States, Japan and seven European countries.
 As can be seen from comparing the bars for 1995 and 2004, all countries have been increasing the supply of securities, led, unsurprisingly by the United States, where the total is more than three times the nation's gross domestic product. (It actually was a little larger in 1999, thanks to the inflated stock market of that year.)
 In Germany, France and Portugal, by contrast, the total supply of securities amounts to only a little over twice the gross national product. And in those countries the tilt toward bonds rather than stocks is much greater than in the United States.
 Much is made of the United States' dependence on foreigners to support its currency and trade deficit. But the figures show that in 2004 only about a sixth of the total securities were held overseas. That was lower than in any other country shown, except for insular Japan, where less than a tenth were owned by foreigners. 
 One indicator of change toward an arm's length economy is whether a country depends more than it did on stocks, and less on debt. Over the decade shown, most countries moved in that direction. But there was little change in Germany and Portugal, and Japan's proportion fell, as the long bear market there continued.
 Having a lot more securities outstanding can make a country more vulnerable to changes in asset prices, the I.M.F. concluded. As a result, ''The slowing of the U.S. housing market is a key risk for the U.S. and global economic outlook.''

HEADLINE: New Concern Over Fate Of Iraqi Antiquities

BYLINE: By MICAH GAREN and MARIE-HELENE CARLETON

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Sept. 8 

 BODY:
There is mounting concern among scholars that the appointment of religiously conservative Shiite Muslims throughout Iraq's traditionally secular archaeological institutions could threaten the preservation of the country's pre-Islamic history.
 Donny George's recent departure as chairman of the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, and his flight to Syria with his family, is among the latest results of a transformation that began in December when a Shiite-dominated government was elected in Baghdad. The radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who commands his own militia, emerged with enough seats in Parliament to take control of four ministries and to create a Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.
 The State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, traditionally under the Ministry of Culture, now reports to this new ministry as well.
 ''The Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities wants to control Iraq's archaeological heritage by demolishing this institution, one of the oldest institutions in Iraq,'' Dr. George said in a telephone interview from Damascus. ''This will be a disaster for this field, and for the cultural heritage of the country.'' 
 Although the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has begun operating, the law creating it has not yet been approved by Parliament, which is about to begin debating the measure, said Abudul Zahra al-Talaqani, a spokesman for the new ministry. 
 The proposed law would divide the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage into four administrative departments: museums, excavations, manuscripts and heritage. The present departments of restoration and research would be eliminated, suggesting that preservation and scholarship would no longer be the institution's focus.
 The long history of secular scholarship in Iraq has covered all periods, including excavations at the Islamic site of Samarra and the restoration of Ukhaidir, an Islamic fortress near Karbala. Earlier sites include ruins from the Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Parthian and Sassanian civilizations. 
 The State Board of Antiquities and Heritage was created in 1923, when Gertrude Bell, the British explorer and administrator, founded the Iraqi National Museum. ''It was the best in the whole Middle East,'' said McGuire Gibson, a professor of Mesopotamian archaeology at the University of Chicago. ''At one point there were 13 Iraqi Ph.D.'s working there.'' 
 Liwa Sumaysim, the new minister of tourism and antiquities, is a dentist whose wife, a member of Parliament, is related to Mr. Sadr. The new ministry has already replaced employees of the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage at both the national and local level.
 Burhan Shakur, an archaeologist who was director of excavations at the Iraqi Museum, was fired in the spring, then given the option to retire; he has left for Germany. Abdul-Amir Hamdani, the inspector for antiquities in the Dhi Qar province, an area rich in pre-Islamic sites, was jailed in April on charges of corruption. After three months he was released, and the charges were dropped. But his job was then filled by a man with ties to Al Fadilah, an Islamist party aligned with the Sadr movement. 
 With the looting of archaeological sites in southern Iraq still thriving, control of the antiquities department is a significant prize. Most of the archaeological sites in the southern Dhi Qar province are pre-Islamic, dating roughly from 3200 B.C. to A.D. 500.
 A link between Islamic militants and looting at pre-Islamic archaeological sites has long been suspected, but is difficult to prove. The Nasiriyah Museum was burned and looted in 2004 by militants affiliated with Mr. Sadr. The museum's guards reported that the militants promised to do to the antiquities there exactly ''what the Taliban did.'' 
 The center for Iraq's illicit antiquities trade, Fajr, in the heart of the Sumerian plain, is also a stronghold for militants loyal to Mr. Sadr. And anti-Western graffiti has appeared at looted archaeological sites.
 ''It is hard to say yes or no if these gangs have a relation with the Sadr movement,'' cautioned Mufeed al-Jazairi, Iraq's first minister of culture after the Coalition Provisional Authority disbanded, who noted that looters were active in Saddam Hussein's time as well. ''But it is not surprising to imagine that one of these gangs will announce that they are allies with Sadr, hoping to gain a political shield in case they are being followed by authorities.''
 The recent deployment of a 1,400-strong Mobile Archaeological Site Protection Force was considered a hopeful sign by scholars. The guards, in an effort conceived in 2003, finally began work in November 2005. They were first used in Dhi Qar under the direction of Mr. Hamdani. 
 ''Now there is no money to pay them beyond August,'' Dr. George warned last month. ''I had been applying for money to protect the guards in the south, and I never got that money. There was money allocated to different Islamic projects.''
 Mr. al-Talaqani, the ministry spokesman, denied that there was a lack of funds for the mobile guard force. ''The government is concerned with protecting all cultural history in all regions,'' he said. But reports from the south indicate that there is no money for fuel and that the patrols have stopped.
 ''If the destruction of sites continues, it is not just the death of archaeology,'' Dr. Gibson of the University of Chicago said. ''Antiquities are key to Iraq's economy; at some point the oil will run out. Iraqi tourism will be built on archaeology.''
 Yet Dr. Gibson warned that putting an archaeological department under a tourism office tends to have negative consequences because sites may become mothballed, and research possibilities lost.
 The Sadrist leadership in the new ministry has made its views known in other ways. Recently two pre-Islamic statues it returned to the Iraqi Museum were accompanied by a note describing them as ''idols.'' Elizabeth Stone, an archaeologist and professor of anthropology who has excavated in southern Iraq, said that officials of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities had also visited the museum before the departure of Dr. George, who is Christian, and asked, ''Do you want to be governed by a crusader?''
 Dr. Stone, who is now training Iraqi archaeologists at Stony Brook University, joined others in the archaeological and diplomatic communities in praising Dr. George. ''As director general, he was really fighting for Iraqi antiquities,'' she said. ''He had a vision for where international archaeology could go, particularly in collaborating with other institutions. That is all gone.''
 Dr. Gibson, who worked at the Nippur archaeology site in Iraq, agreed. ''The loss of anyone with the qualifications and dedication he has to the archaeology of Iraq is really a tragedy,'' he said. ''We would hope he would stay on, but he is one of many leaving the country.''
 From Damascus, Dr. George suggested that hope for Iraq's cultural heritage lay with Mr. al-Jazairi, the former culture minister, and his former deputy, Naysoon al-Bamaluji, who are now in Parliament; the current minister of culture, Afad al-Hashimi;and those working in the provinces. 
 ''We need to rehabilitate the Iraqi Museum and make people aware of the importance of archaeological artifacts,'' Mr. al-Jazairi wrote in an e-mail message from Baghdad, ''and to make strict procedures to stop the sabotage of archaeological sites.''

HEADLINE: Iranian Troops Arrest 5 From Iraqi Security Forces on Border

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Sept. 8 

 BODY:
Five members of the Iraqi security forces and their interpreter were arrested by Iranian troops as the Iraqis were patrolling the Iraq-Iran border this week, an Interior Ministry spokesman said Friday.
 The Iraqis were on a joint patrol run by the Interior and Defense ministries, said the spokesman, Muhammad al-Askari, and were seized near the town of Mandali, in Diyala Province. The area has been rife with sectarian violence.
It was unclear which side of the border the Iraqis were on. 
 This is not the first time in recent years that Iran has arrested foreign troops for operating near its border. In June 2004, Iran seized three British naval boats and detained eight sailors as the boats were patrolling in the waters straddling the Iraq-Iran border in the south. The sailors were eventually released.
 The arrests of the Iraqis come at a time of growing tension between the United States and Iran. The Bush administration is pushing for a United Nations resolution that would impose economic and political sanctions on Iran for going forward with its uranium enrichment program, which American officials say could result in a nuclear weapon. 
 Here in Baghdad, the American ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, and military commanders have accused individuals or groups in Iran of supporting Shiite militias and urging them to step up attacks against the Americans.
 Several prominent Iraqi Shiite leaders with strong ties to Iran have denied the American accusations.
 Iran and Iraq fought a war from 1980 to 1988 in which up to one million people were killed. Though Iraqi Shiite political parties are close to some Iranian officials, many Iraqis distrust the Iranians, who have been the traditional rivals of Arabs for influence in the region. Iran's population is mostly Shiite Persian.
 Violence rippled across parts of Iraq on Friday. In Baghdad, a homemade bomb exploded near a police convoy, killing three civilians and wounding three policemen.
 The police found six bodies in four different parts of Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official said.
 In the insurgent stronghold of Hawija, near the oil city of Kirkuk, gunmen assassinated a prominent sheik, Khalaf Ibrahim, police officials said. A volley of mortars in the town of Musayyib killed three Shiite pilgrims and wounded 22 others. The pilgrims were going to Karbala to celebrate the birthday of a vanished Shiite imam.
 The American military said a soldier was killed by a roadside bomb south of Baghdad. An Iraqi civilian was killed and a young child injured in an accident on Friday involving a military convoy, American officials said.
 The British military said a British soldier died Thursday from wounds suffered earlier in the week when his patrol was attacked in the town of Qurna.
 The latest round of violence came a day after a Baghdad morgue official told reporters that more than 1,500 Iraqi civilians died violently in the capital in August, about the same level as in June. If the August figure is accurate, it shows that the new Baghdad security plan rolled out by the American military in early August has made little difference so far in quelling violence.
 On Thursday, the new leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, Abu Hamza al-Muhajir, released an audio message urging every Sunni Arab to kill an American within the next 15 days, and beseeching those Sunnis whose family members have suffered under the Shiite-led government to kill a member of a Shiite party or militia, according to a translation by the SITE Institute, which tracks jihadist messages. 
 It was Mr. Muhajir's first audio message since he was named successor to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Qaeda leader who was killed by an American airstrike in June.
 ''What you saw in the past is a drop of what you are going to see and what is prepared for you,'' Mr. Muhajir said.
 American military officials have said they believe that Abu Hamza al-Muhajir is the nom de guerre of Abu Ayyub al-Masri, an Egyptian explosives expert said to have trained in 1999 at a terrorist camp in Afghanistan run by Al Qaeda.

HEADLINE: At 26, Baby-Faced Mayor Takes Over an Aging Pittsburgh

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA; Sean Hamill contributed reporting.

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Sept. 7 

 BODY:
At 26, many people haven't even decided on a career. Luke Ravenstahl is already the mayor of Pittsburgh. 
 In the four short years since he left college, Mr. Ravenstahl has mastered the art of being at the right place at the right time, and last week he became the youngest mayor of any major city in the country, after the previous mayor, Bob O'Connor, died of a brain tumor.
But now comes the hard part. As he strives to be taken seriously and take charge of a city only recently back from the brink of bankruptcy, the baby-faced Mr. Ravenstahl said that even the smallest decisions felt weighty.
 What to wear to the Steelers game? Stick with his standard blue jeans and football jersey or don a button-up polo and black slacks, setting a more serious tone at his first public appearance since Mr. O'Connor was buried? 
 ''I guess I'm taking it one decision, one day, at a time,'' Mr. Ravenstahl said Thursday before heading to the game, having chosen the awkward hybrid of football jersey tucked neatly into pressed suit pants.
 Mr. Ravenstahl is a young man taking over an old steel town that has lost all its mills, nearly half its population and much of its downtown commercial district in the last several decades. Having just ascended from being City Council president, he now faces difficult contract negotiations with city firefighters and has to draft a city budget with approval from two state oversight bodies that have been mandated. 
 Shy and business-minded, Mr. Ravenstahl, a Democrat who said he averaged 12 Diet Pepsis a day, also follows on the heels of one of the most popular and gregarious politicians in the city's history.
 ''Ravenstahl is a perfect storm of ambition, political pedigree and luck, and it has taken him far,'' said Morton Coleman, a professor of social work at the University of Pittsburgh. ''But it has also left him with a lot to prove.''
 For Mr. Ravenstahl, whose resume consists largely of playing football in college and working as an account manager for a courier service, the first challenge may be to loosen up.
 ''With our mayors, Tom Murphy was the guy who wouldn't know what a tailgate party was if he got invited to one, O'Connor was the guy throwing the tailgate party, wearing the chef's hat, and Ravenstahl is the guy nursing a beer in the corner and trying to decide whether it's safe to double dip that chip,'' said Sean Cannon, a political writer for Carbolic Smoke Ball, a satirical Web site and the city's equivalent of The Onion.
 Asked if he is nervous, Mr. Ravenstahl looked at his Steelers jersey before offering an impish grin.
 ''He's a young guy too, you know,'' Mr. Ravenstahl said, pointing to the number 7 and referring to Ben Roethlisberger, the 24-year-old Steelers star who last year became the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl ring. By his side, Mr. Ravenstahl's press secretary -- a white-haired man at least 30 years his elder -- nodded quietly.
 Mr. Ravenstahl, who got a $40,000 raise, to $94,157 a year, by going to mayor from councilman, has yet to develop an agenda of his own, but he is eager to strengthen the city's economy.
 ''The rap on Allegheny County, where we are located, is that it's the second-oldest county in the country,'' he said. ''But Pittsburgh has 50,000 college students, and our challenge is to figure out how to retain them and to increase downtown development.''
 Mr. O'Connor was known for taking weekly strolls through different neighborhoods and chatting up residents about potholes and the city budget. His face is plastered on billboards everywhere that read ''Let's Redd Up Pittsburgh'' -- a campaign intended to straighten up (or, in Pittsburghese, ''Readying up'') the city.
 Mr. O'Connor's brief tenure corresponded with a sense of renewed hope in this city of 325,000. Shortly after he took office in January, the Steelers won the Super Bowl for the first time since 1979. Then, in July, the city was the site of Major League Baseball's All-Star Game, which attracted thousands of tourists. 
 ''The biggest problem with Luke right now is all the uncertainty surrounding him,'' said Doug Shields, who was elected the new City Council president on Tuesday. ''He'd be a fool not to use O'Connor's playbook. At the same time, he is going to need to establish himself as his own man.''
 One of the biggest uncertainties is how long he will remain in office. The city's lawyers have said that, according to the city charter, Mayor Ravenstahl's term will not expire until November 2009. 
 Other lawyers, however, including the chairwoman of the city Democratic committee, have argued that Mr. Ravenstahl must face the electorate next year, and the matter is likely to be decided by the courts. Mr. Ravenstahl, who under the charter had the option to turn down the mayor's office after Mr. O'Connor died, said he intended to run, regardless of when the election was held.
 Fate has played a role more than once in Mr. Ravenstahl's political rise.
 Last December, after rival City Council factions deadlocked over who should be president, Mr. Ravenstahl emerged as the compromise candidate, becoming the city's youngest council president ever. That put him in line to succeed Mr. O'Connor.
 In 2003, Mr. Ravenstahl cashed in on his family's political name (his grandfather was a state representative and his father is a widely known district judge) and toppled a seasoned incumbent.
 Growing up on the city's North Side in Observatory Hill, a neighborhood of firefighters and police officers, Mr. Ravenstahl attended one of the area's most prestigious Roman Catholic high schools. He graduated in 2002 from Washington & Jefferson College in Washington, Pa., where he was a star kicker for the football team. After college, he married (his wife, Erin, is a beautician) and he worked for a courier service before running for a City Council seat.
 ''Luke is very mature and doesn't make the same mistake twice,'' said John Banaszak, a former Steelers defensive lineman who coached Mr. Ravenstahl in college. 
 Mr. Banaszak recounted a game early in Mr. Ravenstahl's career when he was told to kick a squib kickoff toward the sideline in hope of keeping possession, but instead he kicked it down the middle. The opposing team recovered the ball and ran halfway up the field with it.
 ''I chewed him out, and he never disobeyed an instruction the rest of his career,'' Mr. Banaszak said, adding, ''I think he takes that same wisdom with him in politics in that he knows when he is getting good advice and he follows it.''
 Jim Motznik, a councilman and an ally of Mr. Ravenstahl, said concerns about Mr. Ravenstahl's age would dissipate once the city saw his work ethic.
 ''Luke's age will come up,'' Mr. Motznik said, ''but you will see it's just a temporary question. It came up with the presidency role, but those questions went away very quickly.''
 Mayors elsewhere have been younger. Jeff Dunkel was 18 in 2001 when he was elected mayor of Mount Carbon, Pa., a borough of about 100 residents in Schuylkill County. Small towns in New York, North Dakota and elsewhere have also elected teenagers as mayors.
 But, according to the United States Conference of Mayors, Tallahassee, Fla., is the only other city with a population over 100,000 that has had a mayor as young as Mr. Ravenstahl -- Scott Maddox, who was 26 when he was elected in 1995. Detroit, Cleveland and Dearborn, Mich., have had mayors who were 31, the conference said.
 Mayor Ravenstahl said he was still coming to terms with the challenge he faced.
 ''Last night at the wake I was very emotional,'' he said, ''and that's when it hit me that this is real. I only then started to think that this was actually happening and I will be leading the city.'' 
 [At City Hall, the mood remained somber. On Friday city crews finally took Mr. O'Connor's name off the double-glass doors to the mayor's office and began painting on Mr. Ravenstahl's -- a move purposely delayed until the day after the funeral, even though Mr. Ravenstahl has officially been mayor for a week.]
 At the Third Avenue Deli, a sandwich shop frequented by City Hall regulars, the owner, Jimmy Cvetic, said he was withholding judgment on Mr. Ravenstahl. 
 ''I call him Cool Hand Luke,'' Mr. Cvetic said. ''He'll be all right, but he's going to need a cool hand to get through this.''

HEADLINE: China Is Not Just Rising, but Also Changing

BYLINE: By Ross Terrill. 
Ross Terrill, a research associate at Harvard's Fairbank Center, is the author of ''The New Chinese Empire.''

DATELINE: Xian, China 

 BODY:
CHINA'S advance toward global economic pre-eminence appears irresistible. Having recently surpassed Britain, France and Italy, its economy is now the fourth-largest in the world, growing, Beijing says, at the startling rate of 10 percent a year. Brokers in Hong Kong and New York entertain themselves by predicting the year in which China's gross domestic product will outstrip that of the United States. 
 The speculation is understandable. China's appetite for oil, gas and other natural resources from abroad is all but insatiable. Its urban middle class enjoys cellphones, poodles, Haagen-Dazs, gated apartments, psychiatrists, overseas vacations and cars for which city streets have little room in a nation that is now 40 percent urban. 
Yet the facade of China's urban coastal economy hides problems that, sooner or later, are sure to put a damper on the celebration. 
 If China is perfecting a new system of Leninism-plus-consumerism, based on yin and yang, such a hybrid would be a first. The Soviet Union and its satellites could not blend strict authoritarianism and a loosened economy. Nor did they slide gracefully into post-communism; several states broke into pieces in the process. 
 China is more brittle than it looks from the superb restaurants overlooking the Shanghai Bund. Scores of new skyscrapers in Shanghai are half-empty. The government seldom allocates capital to private, commercially rational projects. Banks extend 65 percent of their loans to state-owned firms that produce only 25 percent of the national output. State subsidies make it hard to measure the returns on capital.
 Meanwhile, labor costs are on the rise in southeastern China, prompting exporters to move to Vietnam and Cambodia. Old folk proliferate, as do farmers on the move for coastal cities. Urban air is dirty, and water is in short supply in the north. 
 China welcomes some foreign business but still fears domestic entrepreneurs. The country ranks high on global lists of gross domestic product, foreign direct investment and exports, but its legal system is unreliable, making capitalism at times a difficult game to master. Although China's per capita income is double that of India, China is only 37 percent wealthier. So it's no surprise that the World Economic Forum's most recent Global Competitiveness Report, which takes into account the rule of law and open flow of information, was warmer on India's prospects than on China's.
 China's recent growth has been aided by an unprecedented calm. No international crisis has complicated Beijing's economic decision-making in the 27 years of peace since the China-Vietnam war; no domestic disturbance has shaken the state in the 17 years since Tiananmen Square. But tensions, both internal and external, are unlikely to remain at bay. 
 Should there be unrest in North Korea, millions of refugees could destabilize northeastern China. A confrontation with Taiwan would bring tension between commercial south China and the politically orthodox north. 
 A tussle between economics and politics, yin-yang's stiffest test, seems inevitable. President Hu Jintao has surely bet that freedom in the two realms can be separated. But if Adam Smith was correct to call his free market economics a ''system of natural liberty,'' this will not be possible. In Beijing in the spring, I watched people snap up Chinese-language copies of F. A. Hayek's ''The Road to Serfdom,'' which says a command economy is precisely that.
 Many Chinese shrug off official doctrine, whose cultivation, together with the allocation of resources, is a key vocation of communist rule. In Shanghai, the only time I have seen Mao recently is in a department store display, reclining in a suspiciously bourgeois pair of green silk pajamas.
 Although Maoism has been buried and Mao himself airbrushed out of history textbooks, the Leninist lid is still clamped awkwardly on the bubbling cauldron of a complex new economy and society. Just last month, the Chinese government locked up a lawyer and two journalists -- including Zhao Yan of The New York Times -- on trumped-up charges behind which lay the offense of indiscreet speech.
 Even without such sharp contradictions, economic fireworks have a way of flaming out sooner than expected. It was just a short time ago that Japan's economy was the object of envy and terror. That experience -- and the hype that accompanied it -- is a reminder that linear projections of economic growth are subject to the nonlinear realities of politics, culture and human nature.
 China's new economy will surely experience setbacks. But eventually, with its emerging middle-class society, it will refashion the old politics. In that sense China's economic boom will both fail and succeed. As Leninism-plus-consumerism it will reach its limit. But as a base for a post-communist political system, it seems destined to run well into the future.

HEADLINE: A Brief Rebound but Losses for the Week

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street rebounded moderately yesterday from two losing sessions as oil prices dropped further and investors mostly shrugged off another warning from a home builder about declining demand. The major indexes ended the week with losses.
 Investors apparently took in stride the Lennar Corporation's announcement that it was lowering its third-quarter profit forecast, joining several rivals in pointing to lackluster demand in a slowing housing market. Warnings earlier in the week from companies like Beazer Homes USA and Hovnanian Enterprises left Wall Street unnerved at the prospect of a sharp economic slowdown.
With relatively little in the way of market-moving economic news to chew on, investors got their biggest clue about the economy from the home builders. A few speeches from Fed officials also kept Wall Street guessing about the central bank's future. 
 ''It's the third warning in three days from the home building industry and it's a sign that the damage on the rest of the economy is all still in front of us,'' said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset and Wealth Management.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 60.67 points, or 0.54 percent, to 11,392.11.
 Broader stock indicators extended their gains. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 4.90 points, or 0.38 percent, at 1,298.92, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 10.50 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,165.79.
 Bonds rose, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note gaining 3/32, to 100 25/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, falling to 4.77 percent from 4.78 percent late Thursday. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices fell.
 The major indexes ended the erratic, holiday-shortened week with losses amid a dismal outlook of an economic slowdown accompanied by higher inflation; investors' dismay at the home builders' warnings was compounded by government data showing a jump in wage inflation during the second quarter.
 For the week, the Dow lost 0.63 percent, the S.& P. shed 0.92 percent, and the Nasdaq dropped 1.25 percent.
 But yesterday, Wall Street, which has been hoping the Federal Reserve will temper its efforts to hold back inflation should the economy show further signs of slowing, appeared to regard comments from the Cleveland Federal Reserve president, Sandra Pianalto, as acceptable.
 She was quoted by news services as saying it was crucial that the Fed ''anchor inflation expectations in order to best promote sustainable economic growth.''
 Ms. Pianalto's speech followed remarks from the San Francisco Fed president, Janet L. Yellen, on Thursday that some on Wall Street saw as indicating that further interest rate increases were likely.
 Many investors are wary of more rate increases, contending the Fed's previous string of 17 straight increases have already slowed the economy too quickly. The Fed, which left rates unchanged at its last meeting, plans to meet again Sept. 20.
 Mr. Schweitzer predicted that a cooling economy could lead to a rate cut in the first half of next year.
 ''I think the market is in a tug of war between the potential benefits and problems from a slowdown in the economy,'' he said.
 Falling oil prices also helped stocks yesterday. Oil, which had recently been above $70 a barrel, has fallen in recent days as inventory figures showed increases and as tensions with Iran over its nuclear ambitions eased. The end of the summer driving period and a relatively uneventful hurricane season have also helped lower prices. Light crude oil was down $1.07, at $66.25 a barrel.
 Lennar fell 54 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $42.71 after saying it expected to earn $1.25 to $1.35 a share for the third quarter, well below the $2.06 a share the company earned in the comparable quarter last year. Wall Street had been expecting $1.81 a share. Beazer Homes USA declined 9 cents, to $37.24, while Hovnanian Enterprises shed 92 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $26.17.
 AirTran Holdings, which operates the low-fare carrier AirTran Airways, fell $1.19, or 11 percent, to $9.48 after the airline cut its third-quarter revenue forecast amid falling demand.
 Equifax, a credit-reporting and marketing company, rose $3.92, or 12 percent, to $36.34, after it said its full-year earnings would exceed $2 a share; it had previously forecast a profit of $1.90 to $1.99 a share.

HEADLINE: Rethinking Retirement And Pensions

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER

 BODY:
Since being named chief executive of the Principal Financial Group in 2000, J. Barry Griswell, 57, has overseen a $1.8 billion initial public offering, expanded the company's reach and broadened its product line beyond insurance and banking to encompass other financial services. 
 Principal also offers 401(k) and other retirement plans to 45,000 small and medium businesses. The company, which has $206 billion in assets under management and serves over 16 million customers, recently acquired Washington Mutual Advisors, a mutual fund, that it expects will place the company in the top 40 mutual fund companies in the United States. Mr. Griswell talked about the recent pension reform law, defined benefits and wellness recently. Following are excerpts:

Q. Are defined-benefit plans becoming obsolete?

A. I personally believe that over the long haul it is going to be very difficult for American companies to compete in a global economy if we are the only ones who are providing the kind of rich benefits we have offered in the past. I believe that the D.B.(k) may certainly become a more popular option where you still have a defined benefit but at a lower level and you have a robust 401 (k) or defined-contribution plan on top of it. In some ways, that's what the market has already done by moving from a traditional defined benefit to a cash-balance defined benefit and augmenting that with 401(k's).

Q. Do you think there will be other changes in company-sponsored savings plans?

A. There have already been changes. For example, two things have been running in parallel: the slimming down of defined-benefit and the beefing up, if you will, of defined contribution. If you look at the companies who are out front and who are recognized as being leaders in providing excellent retirement plans they typically have a very robust 401(k) with higher matches. Then you get into some of the things that were included in the pension bill that get at the issue of workers not participating in their defined-contribution plans -- the automatic enrollment, the automatic step-up plan -- all these things are designed to take the apathy out of the picture.

Q. Principal Financial, with nearly 15,000 employees worldwide, has been recognized as a good company to work for by numerous magazines. What is it that they are recognizing?

A. It is all the traditional things you would think of, but then there is a sprinkling in of other little interesting things: we provide every employee with 8 hours a year of voluntary time off that they can go contribute. We have free-drink Monday; every employee gets a free drink. We have no-meeting Fridays so employees can catch up on their work. We have town hall meetings. I have a monthly breakfast with employees. We're big on diversity -- one of the first companies to offer same-sex medical coverage to domestic partners.

Q. Your compensation package is said to have been nearly $9.4 million last year. We repeatedly read that the wages of regular employees are stagnating. Do you think that's an area that needs to be addressed?

A. Yes, I do. It's interesting, though. Typically, my cash compensation is $2 million to $3 million a year. I get a million-dollar salary and a bonus of a million and a quarter to a million and a half dollars. The rest is through incentives, stock options and restricted stock. All of that can go up and all that can go down. There's a huge risk factor. I think my salary compared to my employees' is reasonable.

Q. What is your relationship to the Wellness Council of America?

A. We're on the Wellness Council and we have the wonderful distinction of being a recipient of their Platinum Award, given to a very small group of companies that are really integrating wellness into the workplace.

Q. When did you go on your fitness kick?

A. It was about three or four years ago. My wellness director asked me to give a statement about our commitment to wellness for our Platinum Award application. It dawned on me that it was going to be lip service. I looked at myself -- I was almost 300 pounds. I'm 6-9 so I can carry a lot of weight, but I was way overweight.
 After I lost the 50 pounds we had a big event promoting wellness. My wellness director got a bag and filled it with 50 pounds of fat. She pulled it out of the box at this meeting and said this is what Barry was carrying around. It was incredibly graphic.
 I got religion, I guess.

HEADLINE: Another Home Builder Warns Of Sagging Profits Ahead

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The Lennar Corporation, one of the nation's largest home builders, lowered its profit forecast yesterday and said its income fell in the third quarter, the first decline in six years, after a slump in demand forced the company to offer incentives to buyers. 
 Earnings for the three months that ended Aug. 31 totaled $1.25 to $1.35 a share, down from $2.06 a year earlier, the company said. Net new orders fell about 5 percent, the company said.
Lennar's profit margins are eroding as it offers upgrades like stainless steel appliances and hardwood floors to lure buyers. Nationwide, the inventory of new homes for sale swelled to a record of 568,000 in July as higher mortgage rates brought an end to the five-year housing boom.
 Lennar, based in Miami, is the third home builder, after KB Home and Beazer Homes, to reduce its forecast this week as demand slumps. 
 ''The market is very weak and may be staring at a hard landing,'' said Paul Puryear, managing director of Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''Housing is a key driver in the economy, and consumers are in for some bad news in regards to the value of their homes.''
 Lennar's drop in new orders is less than expected, said Rick Murray, an analyst at Raymond James, who had expected a decrease of 10 percent.
 Lennar's new forecast is 33 percent below its previous projection for fiscal third-quarter earnings of $1.90 to $1.95 a share. Analysts had expected $1.81 a share, according to Thomson Financial.
 In another sign of a slowing home market, Home Depot, the home-improvement retailer, plans to increase sales to builders of offices and apartments, its chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, said.
 Home Depot Supply, the company's professional builder unit, grew from almost nothing three years ago to about $12 billion in sales this year, accounting for 13 percent of total revenue. The unit will grow to 20 percent of sales by 2010, Home Depot says. The company had $81.5 billion in revenue in 2005.
 The division provides revenue that is less tied to the residential housing market, so it is more stable than the company's main market of homeowners and contractors.

HEADLINE: Ex-Congressional Aide Accused In Iraq Spy Case Is Released 

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
A former journalist and Congressional aide accused of working with Iraqi intelligence before the war was released from prison yesterday after a federal judge ruled that she could not be forced to take antipsychotic medication in an effort to make her competent to stand trial.
 The judge, Michael Mukasey of Federal District Court in Manhattan, said he was not convinced that even if she took the medication, the defendant, Susan P. Lindauer, 43, would improve enough to be capable of standing trial. 
Judge Mukasey also criticized the strength of the government's case, saying that the legal standard for forcibly administering medication requires a strong government interest in prosecution, and that the government has not been able to establish that standard in this case. The ruling was a setback for the government's case against Ms. Lindauer, who was arrested in March 2004 at her home in Takoma Park, Md. An indictment charged that Ms. Lindauer, also known as Symbol Susan, conspired to act as an unregistered agent of the government of Iraq from October 1999 until February 2004, and engaged in illegal financial transactions.
 Although he was reluctant to analyze the government's case before trial, the judge said, ''There is no indication that Lindauer ever came close to influencing anyone, or could have.'' The indictment, he said, describes an attempt to influence an unnamed government official as unsuccessful.
 Investigators said she had tried to influence American policy by presenting herself as an agent of Saddam Hussein's government in early 2003 to Andrew H. Card Jr., then the White House chief of staff, who was described as a distant relative.
 Judge Mukasey said that for Ms. Lindauer to succeed as an agent of the Iraqi government, she would have had to influence other people. But her mental condition makes that highly unlikely, he said. 
 ''The record shows that even lay people recognize that she is seriously disturbed,'' Judge Mukasey said in a 35-page ruling issued on Wednesday. He said that a neighbor had suspected her of being mildly schizophrenic.
 Prosecutors said she met with Iraqi intelligence officers at places in Baghdad, including Al Rashid Hotel, in 2002, where she accepted $5,000 in cash.
 Ms. Lindauer told a television reporter after her arrest that she was innocent, and that she was an antiwar activist.
 Ms. Lindauer worked as a journalist in Washington and in the press offices of several liberal Democrats in the House and Senate, although her last such job was in 2002.
 At least a half dozen doctors for both the defense and the prosecution have found that Ms. Lindauer suffers from delusions of grandeur and paranoia, which makes her incompetent to stand trial, the judge said. But she refuses to accept the diagnosis or to take medication, he said. One doctor found that Ms. Lindauer had a history of psychotic episodes going back to her childhood, possibly at the age of 7, the judge said. These include her contention that she had gifts of prophecy that allowed her to report 11 bombings before they happened, that she spoke with divine inspiration and that she was an angel.
 Among her paranoid delusions, doctors said, were the notion that she was being watched by hidden cameras in her apartment, that the Egyptian government had tried to assassinate her and that men next door had videotaped her under instructions from President Bill Clinton.
 At a hearing before Judge Mukasey yesterday, prosecutors offered a backup plan, asking the judge to order Ms. Lindauer to either voluntarily take antipsychotic drugs for 30 days or be held in contempt. Contempt charges could be punished with jail time.
 Judge Mukasey declined to rule on the prosecutor's suggestion, saying that the case was being assigned to another judge and that he would leave that decision to her. 
 Meanwhile, he ordered Ms. Lindauer to be released under previously determined terms, including on bail of $500,000, on the condition that she receive psychological counseling and that her travel be restricted. 
 Her lawyer, Sanford Talkin, said she was released from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, where she has been held for the last few weeks.
 Before that, she was in a federal prison hospital in Carswell, Tex. He said she would now return to her home in Maryland. 
 ''She can't go to trial until she's competent,'' Mr. Talkin said. ''I think it was a difficult decision, but I think it was the right decision, and I think it was a just decision.'' 
 Ms. Lindauer is a 1985 graduate of Smith College, where she majored in economics, and she received a master's degree from the London School of Economics. 
 Her father, John Lindauer, was the Republican nominee for governor of Alaska in 1998.
 Judge Mukasey also expressed humanitarian concerns about forcing Ms. Lindauer to take medication, which, he said, ''necessarily involves physically restraining defendant so that she can be injected with mind-altering drugs.''

HEADLINE: Musical Chairs in the Executive Suites

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
TUMULT in executive suites shook up some storied corners of corporate America, including Ford, Boeing and Viacom, as underperforming chief executives were effectively fired -- or, in one case, fired himself -- and several boardroom bridesmaids were finally given their shot at the top.
 Whether the changes prove to be good news for investors remains to be seen, but some unequivocally good news came from the Gulf of Mexico, where deepwater drilling has turned up evidence of potentially huge new oil deposits.

SHIFTING GEARS -- William Clay Ford Jr., a great-grandson of the founder of the Ford Motor Company, replaced himself as chief executive with an aerospace executive in an effort to turn around the company, which has lost roughly $1.5 billion so far this year and is in danger of being overtaken by Toyota as the nation's second-biggest carmaker.
Though the new C.E.O., Alan R. Mulally, has never worked in the auto industry, he did gain some useful experience while he ran Boeing's commercial-aircraft division. Aerospace and auto companies both deal with powerful labor unions, require billion-dollar bets on products that take years to get to market, and require close relationships with many suppliers. 
 While overhauling Boeing's commercial airplane division, Mr. Mulally studied how Ford pulled off an earlier revival, in particular how it developed the Taurus, which outsold rival models from Toyota and Honda to become the best-selling car in America. Mr. Mulally is also a student of Toyota's production system, which stresses minimizing waste, improving continuously and involving workers in fixing problems. 
 Mr. Ford, 49, will remain chairman, and plans to help Mr. Mulally run the company. Boeing said Scott Carson, who had been in charge of the airplane division's sales, would succeed Mr. Mulally as its chief executive of commercial aviation.
 This month, Ford is expected to announce more job cuts, plant closings and other steps under a restructuring plan it unveiled in January. The plan initially called for Ford to eliminate 30,000 jobs and close 14 factories through 2012.

HOLLYWOOD ENDING -- Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman of Viacom, forced out the company's chief executive, Thomas E. Freston, reasserting his control over the media giant just eight months after he split it into two parts: CBS and Viacom.
 Mr. Redstone said that Philippe P. Dauman would succeed Mr. Freston, and that Thomas E. Dooley, will be the senior executive vice president and chief administrative officer. Mr. Dauman and Mr. Dooley worked with Mr. Redstone for many years at Viacom and left only after Viacom acquired CBS in 2000.
 When Mr. Redstone spun off CBS five years later, he said that he expected Viacom to be the faster-growing company, but its share price has lagged behind that of CBS. He criticized Mr. Freston for being indecisive, and recently overstepped his C.E.O. to order Paramount Pictures, which is part of Viacom, to sever ties with the actor Tom Cruise.
 Investors will wait to see if the new managers try to revive Viacom's share price by making big acquisitions quickly, a strategy that could backfire, analysts said.

INVENT, OR INVESTIGATE? -- California's attorney general said he would review the methods Hewlett-Packard's board used to track down how some of its internal discussions became public knowledge.
 Attorney General Bill Lockyer's investigation followed Hewlett-Packard's disclosure that its chairwoman, Patricia C. Dunn, authorized an investigation that led to private detectives' monitoring the calls that other board members made from home and on their cellphones.
 The company, which uses the one-word slogan ''Invent,'' denied it had recorded calls or eavesdropped on conversations, but did say that its agents had misrepresented themselves to obtain records showing whom board members had spoken to.
 When the report was presented to the full board in May, the directors asked one member, George A. Keyworth II, to resign; he refused. But another director, Thomas J. Perkins, did resign, to protest the investigation.
 Hewlett-Packard's next board election is scheduled for March. The company said Mr. Keyworth would not be renominated for his seat.

GUSHER IN THE GULF -- Chevron, Devon Energy and Statoil, the Norwegian oil giant, said they had found as much as 15 billion barrels of oil in several ultra-deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico about 270 miles southwest of New Orleans.
 While more wells will have to be drilled -- some as deep as 30,000 feet below the surface of the sea -- to know for sure how big the fields are, the oil companies said they had the potential of being even larger than those at Prudhoe Bay, off the northern coast of Alaska.
 The United States has reserves of 29 billion barrels, meaning that at the high end of the estimates, the discovery could increase reserves by 50 percent. Since the country uses 20.5 million barrels of crude oil every day, the new areas would be able to meet the nation's needs for about two years.
 The three companies said they would drill another test well next year to confirm the extent of their find, and would probably decide on developing the field late in 2007 or in 2008.

STAGFLATION AFOOT? -- Labor Department statistics on productivity and hourly pay showed that wage pressures from January through June increased faster than first forecast, even as growth was slowing in many parts of the country.
 The department found unit labor costs -- which take into account changes in productivity and hourly wages -- increased sharply in the first half, suggesting that the threat of higher inflation had not diminished and that it might take more interest rate increases to hold prices down.
 The Federal Reserve, which sets short-term rates, faces the prospect of both slower growth and higher prices, creating a quandary over whether to risk even further economic weakness to contain inflation.

BANKRUPTCY BRAKE -- Setting the stage for the first test of a new law aimed at curbing retention bonuses for officers of bankrupt companies, the Justice Department joined with unions and creditors of the Dana Corporation in opposing a proposed pay system for top executives of the company.
 New contracts for Dana's chief executive, Michael J. Burns, and other executives propose to give them big bonuses when the company, a major auto parts maker, emerges from bankruptcy, and could pay additional bonuses based on the value of the company's securities six months after the bankruptcy ends. 
 At issue is whether that amounts to a retention provision because the targets are sure to be met, as opponents say, or whether they are performance bonuses because the targets are difficult to meet.
 The bankruptcy trustee assigned to the case, Diana G. Adams, said she might ask an independent examiner to review the pay plan.

HEADLINE: A Paranoid Prime Time Looks Over Its Shoulder

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
MURDER is so over. 
 All kinds of crimes darken the fall season, but homicide is the least of them. That may be because killings on police shows have come to seem so straightforward, the obvious start to a whodunit that ends with the ritual unmasking of the culprit. The new dramas are less about discovering who did it than figuring out what the hell happened in the first place.
 Plots turn elliptically around kidnappings, hostage takings, art theft, fugitives, and even genetic mutations and nuclear holocaust. The occasional dead body is just a sideshow in these sinister intrigues, a cost of doing black business in a world that gets ever more complicated and conspiratorial. 
 This fall the procedural has been replaced by the paranoidural. 
 It's tempting to ascribe the sudden surfeit of ominous suspense to the uncertainty of the times, but mostly it is because of ''Lost.'' That spooky ABC series about plane-wreck survivors emboldened network executives to take on large casts, layered stories and delayed denouements. Its success spawned a generation of cinematic dramas that begin in the middle of the narrative and zigzag -- often with jerky time-lapse photography -- from the beginning to the middle and back to an episode-clinching cliffhanger. 
 ''Heroes,'' an NBC series about a group of strangers who all develop different but seemingly paranormal abilities, taps into a ''Lost''-like taste for the supernatural. Others, like ABC's ''Nine'' and ''Six Degrees,'' toy with the chemical reactions of strangers suddenly tossed together. 
 Bad things always happen to rich people on television, but now money is not the only motive for their torment. On NBC's ''Kidnapped,'' the son of a Wall Street mogul is held for ransom by criminals who seem to have connections or an agenda set by someone on high. On ''Vanished,'' a Fox kidnapping series, the wife of a Kennedyesque senator is snatched, but as soon as she disappears, clues surface that suggest she is not who she claims to be. 
 Both series revolve around an ornery, maverick investigator. On ''Kidnapped'' Jeremy Sisto plays a brusque former F.B.I. agent who warns clients not to call in the feds. On ''Vanished'' the brusque current F.B.I. agent warns clients not to take matters into their own hands. 
 ''Jericho,'' on CBS, is the clearest example of prime time's tense mood. After a nuclear confrontation with an unnamed enemy, Jericho, Kan., appears to be the one town in America left intact. Global warfare is not the only mystery. Just what was the hero, Jake (Skeet Ulrich), doing in the five years before he returned home? He tells some neighbors he was in the Army, or the Navy. Others are led to believe he was playing minor league baseball. 
 ''Smith,'' a CBS drama about a gang of art thieves, is less apocalyptic but equally enigmatic. Ray Liotta plays a suburban family man with children, a loving wife (Virginia Madsen) and a secret second life: he heads a gang of gifted, ruthless criminals -- attractive but much meaner and deadlier than the cuddly con men of ''Hustle'' on AMC -- who get their assignments from a glamorous Middle Eastern woman. 
 ''It will all be over in five minutes,'' is what one of two bank robbers tells employees and customers at gunpoint on ''The Nine.'' The next thing on screen are the words ''52 hours later.'' There are grainy, time-lapse shots of a rescue, but what happened for those two days and four hours is not revealed. Instead, hints leak out in flashbacks and snatches of conversation. 
 Tim Daly (''Wings'') plays a troubled cop who happens to be in the bank but fails to stop the robbers. His first act after rescue is to find the hostage negotiator and punch him in the face. A handsome young surgeon who was held along with his fiancee apparently did or said something unforgivable under pressure. ''It was a moment, Lizzie, a moment,'' he pleads with her after they are set free. ''Does it have to mean everything?''
 Even shows aimed at teenagers are cryptic. ''Runaway,'' on the CW is not your daughter's ''Everwood.'' A lawyer is on the lam after being falsely accused of murder and takes his wife and three children with him. As the F.B.I. closes in, they rent a house and the teenagers start high school under false names. But law enforcement is not their only problem. The real killer, or killers, are also on their tail, for reasons that are only hinted at in the grainy, black-and-white flashbacks to the days before and after the murder.
 Every season prime-time dramas narrow the gap between television and movies, and this time the two nearly converge. ''Kidnapped'' owes a noticeable debt to ''Man on Fire,'' a 2004 thriller that starred Denzel Washington, while both ''The Nine'' and ''Smith'' look a lot like ''Inside Man,'' a 2006 thriller that starred Denzel Washington. 
 The cinematography behind the new shows is stylish and different from conventional network drama, but the series also all sound and look sleekly alike: even the most anodyne location shots are pumped up with music and spooky sound effects: the swooshing roar of a jet or a heartbeat amplified to the level of jungle drums. Indoor and outdoor scenes are shot in washed-out film that gives every scene the look of a 40's film noir. Even a Kansas farmstead on ''Jericho'' looks like something out of a Wim Wenders movie. 
 These thrillers are not the first time the networks have tried to create their own version of ''Lost.'' Last year the fall schedule was crammed with science fiction. ''Surface'' on NBC featured a sea monster, while ''Threshold'' on CBS and ''Invasion'' on ABC went for aliens from outer space.
 Those flopped, but some networks caught the new wave early. USA got lucky with ''The 4400,'' about people abducted by aliens who return to earth with strange powers but no memory of what happened. Fox, which had a proven success with ''24,'' last year introduced ''Prison Break,'' and that series, which began its second season last month, also serves as a model for this year's crop: a thriller told in soap opera installments. 
 It took an entire season for its hero, Michael Scofield, to escape after getting himself sent up the river with the blueprint of the prison tattooed on his chest to break out his brother, Lincoln Burrows, from death row. That complicated plan intersected with a larger conspiracy on the outside: the person who framed Lincoln for the murder of the vice president's brother was the vice president, and by season's end, she became the commander in chief.
 The new season began with Michael, Lincoln and their merry band of convicts out of prison and on the run. Only now they are being hunted down by an ace F.B.I. investigator, who is played by William Fichtner, the villain on the canceled ABC show ''Invasion.''
 Many of the stars of the new shows look familiar, and a large number of them were recruited from Fox's ''24,'' which is still going strong on the eve of its sixth season. At least four alumni show up in the new season: Leslie Hope, who played Jack Bauer's wife in the first season of ''24,'' is the mother on ''Runaway.'' Kim Raver, who played Bauer's girlfriend in Seasons 4 and 5 is now Kathryn, an assistant district attorney who is held hostage with the others in ''The Nine.'' John Allen Nelson, who played Walt Cummings, President Logan's shifty chief of staff in Season 5,is Senator Jeffrey Collins in ''Vanished,'' while Shohreh Aghdashloo, the Iranian actress who played a snaky Muslim conspirator on the fourth season returns as the mysterious crime boss on ''Smith.'' 
 Gerald McRaney, the former star of ''Major Dad,'' is double-dipping: he is George Hearst on HBO's ''Deadwood'' and also Mayor Green on ''Jericho.'' 
 Hollywood has no shortage of unemployed film and television actors, so the networks' insistence on hiring actors who made their name on other hit series seems almost superstitious. Like primitive tribesman who carry totems of rival warriors, network executives must hope that those stars will bring some of their previous successes to the new genre of drama.

HEADLINE: Virtually Cool

BYLINE: By Chip Brown. 
Chip Brown, a contributing writer, last wrote for the magazine about a former Taliban official studying at Yale.

 BODY:
If you're not reading this on a screen, if you don't have a blog, if your phone is still leashed to a wall, if time has cruelly removed you from the 25-to-34-year-old age bracket beloved by advertisers, you probably missed the book party at the TriBeCa Cinemas in July. The author of the hour was Chris Anderson, who after the drinks entertained the crowd with a simulcast PowerPoint lecture on the topic of his new best seller, ''The Long Tail,'' which describes how the chokehold of mass culture is being loosened by the new Internet-enabled economics of niche culture and niche commerce.
The party was sponsored in part by a small SoHo-based new-media company called Flavorpill, which produces free e-mail magazines and weekly event guides for New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and London. (Soon to come are editions for Austin, Miami, Seattle and Boston.) Flavorpill's number of subscribers has been doubling annually since the company started in New York six years ago, and now its family of 10 digital publications has 355,000 readers and projected revenues of $3.5 million this year. Such is Flavorpill's trend-setting street cred that in some quarters its seal of approval is considered the equivalent of a papal blessing. 
 ''We've been called the Conde Nast of e-mail,'' says Sascha Lewis, a co-founder.
 To whisk up the mood after Anderson's economics seminar, Flavorpill brought in dance-punk disk jockeys, and from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. there was live music from bands your mother has never heard of, unless her iPod is unaccountably stuffed with booty rap by Spank Rock. Flavorpill also put together a ''Tap the Tail'' promotional CD of cutting-edge tunes, which staff members were handing out at the door -- a far cry from the early days when the company's brand-extension missionaries used to chalk the logo on the sidewalks of Union Square.
 More than 1,300 people showed up at TriBeCa Cinemas; because the event had been ''Flavorpilled'' -- that is, listed in Flavorpill's New York City e-mail issue No. 318 -- a lot of them were what Lewis and his partner, Mark Mangan, call ''urban influencers.''
 Anderson is such a creature himself -- a regular reader of Flavorpill San Francisco, the city where he lives and works as the editor in chief of Wired magazine.
 ''It resonates with me,'' he said when I asked why he likes it. ''Why does anybody read anything?''
 On one hand it makes perfect sense that Flavorpill would want to fete a book focused on a component of the company's success. The efficiency with which information can be assembled and distributed on the Internet is the foundation of every digital-content company. Flavorpill created an audience by deftly exploiting a new medium. ''In many ways,'' Mark Mangan says, ''what we're doing with the events we list is the same as what Time Out New York, The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Village Voice and other publications are doing. But if you can't click to a map of where the event is, if you can't forward it to your friends, if you can't send it to your cellphone, is it really that useful?''
 On the other hand, part of Anderson's Long Tail thesis is that the Internet is removing bottlenecks between supply and demand and establishing a market where ''everything becomes available to everyone.'' Unlike with archetypal Long Tail businesses like iTunes or eBay, the success of Flavorpill's weekly e-mails has less to do with new digital efficiencies than with the classic distinctions of sensibility. Despite the founders' professed desire not to cater just to a ''clique of hipsters,'' Flavorpill's subscriber traffic, ad trade and growing cultural influence depend on the ''cultural filtering'' of staff members who would not have to change much if they wanted to attend Flavorpill's ultracool Halloween party dressed as a clique of hipsters. The success of Flavorpill in defining what's cool raises the question: How cool can anything really be if everyone knows about it?
 It's hard to think of things that are less dynamic than the production of a digital city-events guide, which is why Mark Mangan came to work one day with a hand-held Chinese gong. The editorial process at Flavorpill starts quietly each Wednesday morning, and stays quiet as the week unfolds, until Monday evening, when a series of ear-shattering gong strikes ceremoniously marks the moment each city's week of ''filtered cultural stimuli'' is released to the tech leprechauns who then push the stuff onto the Net for subscribers to open on Tuesday afternoon.
 The managing editors of each city edition live in the cities they cover, but Mangan and Lewis, the sales staff, the techies and the production editors who format and copy-edit the cultural stimuli are all based in New York. Headquarters is a 2,500-square-foot loft on Broadway, next door to the New York institute of Alfred Adler, the famous Freudian apostate whose cultural profile is sorely lagging Spank Rock's, to judge from the 20-somethings at Flavorpill who had never heard of him. The office has the shoestring-chic of a college newspaper. There's always music going -- evidently nothing facilitates cultural filtration like minimalist German techno. Four clocks mind the time in Flavorpill cities. There is a bicycle by the fire exit, a conference room designed around a garage door and dozens of desks glowing with the flat-screen fire of Macs and PC's. As for the Aeron chairs that were once de rigueur at digital media companies before the Internet bubble burst in 2000, there are just two, reserved for the head guys.
 The week after the Long Tail party I followed the preparations for Flavorpill N.Y.C. No. 319. It was being edited, or ''curated,'' as they like to say, by the New York managing editor, Jake Lancaster, a tall 30-year-old Boston University graduate who got his start at Flavorpill a few years ago when, for joy not money, he reviewed the Brooklyn hip-hop artist Beans. Eventually he landed a gig as one of Flavorpill's 12 full-time employees.
 When he got to his desk that Wednesday, his e-mail in-box was swollen with potential listings, all of them tagged and routed by a proprietary content-management system built by Flavorpill and known, somewhat ominously, as the Tool. About half of the final cut of 25 items for the coming week would be gleaned from suggestions submitted by regular Flavorpill contributors, nearly all of whom were also writing for the joy of it, or -- if they were young and aspiring journalists -- for clips and contacts.
 One possible No. 319 item caught Lancaster's eye right away: an anniversary performance of ''Asssscat'' by the improv comedy group the Upright Citizens Brigade. It was sent in by longtime Flavorpill contributor Mindy Bond, who has a double life not atypical of Flavorpill contributors. At night she trolls obscure cultural tributaries; during the day she works in the main channel of the mainstream, in the speech-writing department of Time Warner. (''I look for events that are quirky or weird,'' she told me later. ''Or things that are going to catch on but haven't quite. I steer away from things that are listed in The New Yorker. If something has the Flavorpill stamp, you know it is cool or interesting or funny or ahead of the curve and will attract people that have the same interests you do.'') Good comedy listings were hard to come by, and Lancaster quickly made Asssscat a finalist; it was knocked out at the last minute for technical reasons (Flavorpill e-mails don't list shows that sell out before publication).
 Done with the submissions in the Tool, Lancaster turned to sift through a long queue of e-mailed press releases and his massive list of venue Web sites. ''We try to keep the issue a light read,'' he said. ''No one wants a novel in their e-mail.''
 ''What would never make the final cut?''
 ''Anything really really expensive,'' Lancaster said.
 ''Anything at Madison Square Garden,'' said Leah Taylor, the 22-year-old New York production editor who was sitting at the next computer, reading a British music Web site called This Is Fake DIY.
 ''Anything exceedingly banal,'' Lancaster added. ''There's no point to listing a classic rock band that's been around for 40 years, like the Allman Brothers. But an old lounge act we might list for the kitsch factor. Occasionally some venues will really surprise you. Like B.B. King's. They'll have a lot of incredibly cheesy stuff -- Beatles brunches and terrible cover bands -- and then they'll have some crazy death-metal band. The tough thing is keeping track of nontraditional venues.''
 In the course of the week I made a point of asking anyone I could what characterized the sensibility behind each week's batch of filtered cultural stimuli. It proved a surprisingly hard needle to thread: a set of ineffable intuitions and aesthetic standards that seemed as nebulous as they were exacting. Possibly Flavorpill's influence has less to do with what is on its menu than with the fact that the menu isn't overstuffed with entrees. Flavorpill doesn't take the Greek coffee shop approach and paralyze readers with a surfeit of options.
 ''I would say the primary focus is on emerging culture of all kinds,'' said Jocelyn Glei, the 29-year-old group managing editor who oversees all five city guides, as well as the specialized magazines. ''There aren't really any parameters, the only overriding factor is that we really believe in the artist or the production -- we really think something is great.'' As an example of how Flavorpill draws from mainstream sources as well as cultural backwaters, Glei cited New York Flavorpill issues that listed both the conventional production of ''The Importance of Being Earnest'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and a production at the Brick Theater in Williamsburg of ''The Kung Fu Importance of Being Earnest,'' which hilariously stitched martial arts scenes into Wilde's classic drawing-room comedy.
 ''I would say the aesthetic we uphold is always about our own canon,'' said Lisa Rosman, a longtime contributor. ''Either very new cultural trends or older ones that are vital to the ones that prevail at the moment. An example would be that we always highlight Gil Scott-Heron, even though he was a 60's-70's dude, since he pretty much helped launch hip-hop. Our aesthetic is mainstream indie, though we don't admit it. It's under the wire, but just. And the minute we report on it, its under-the-wire status is absolutely blown.''
 As Flavorpill's film editor, Rosman contributes to all the city publications, and she has developed a feel for the subtle regional differences. ''Chicago has its own kind of hard-core R.&B.-inspired scene and an art scene inspired by both the Art Institute of Chicago and cheaper rents. L.A. has a refracted neon palm tree glam, which is a reaction to all that Hollywood veneer that wends its way into visual art especially, but also into music and all the retro-movie houses. London, well those kids have a jaunty charm I've yet to pin down.''
 Every list item seems to entail a complex aesthetic calibration and raises the possibility that staff members who imagine themselves consummate indie hipsters may actually have an uncomfortable amount in common with mainstream dorks. Rosman told me that a few editors had a big debate about whether to list a Justin Timberlake concert. ''The feeling was we couldn't, because Justin Timberlake is not cool,'' she said. ''But everyone at Flavorpill secretly loves Justin Timberlake.''
 Flavorpill's founders, Mark Mangan, 35, and Sascha Lewis, 36, are both veterans of the first Internet boom. Mangan grew up in a Main Line Philadelphia suburb, the second of four kids. Having read ''The Aeneid'' in Latin at the Episcopal Academy, he thought he would be a scholar or a writer. But he showed an early knack for business, selling taffy out of his locker to his fellow fourth graders and turning the family basement into a profitable silk-screen T-shirt factory during high school.
 ''My mom is an accountant; she explained C.O.G.S. to me -- cost of goods sold,'' Mangan recalled one day over lunch at Barmarche in NoLIta. He was casually dressed, dark-haired, with friendly brown eyes and a delicate starfish of a scar on his forehead, a result of a car crash in the family Volvo when he was 5.
 At the University of Vermont, Mangan studied English and French; he spent a year in Paris reading philosophy and literature at the Sorbonne and bartending in the Paris branch of Cactus Charly.
 Back home after graduation, he took the LSAT but decided not to follow his father and his older brother, Mike, into a law career. A friend had given him a 1993 report on the growth and future of the Internet. He was inspired to dig out his dad's I.B.M. desktop computer and start poking around online.
 In 1995 he landed a job as a Web consultant, and a year later, with Jonathan Wallace, he wrote a well-received book, ''Sex, Laws and Cyberspace.'' In 1998, as the frenzy of the Internet land rush was cresting, he set out to stake a claim with his own lifestyle e-commerce business. He was looking for capital when he bumped into Lewis, whom he had known through a mutual friend since college.
 Lewis, unlike Mangan, had no itch to homestead in cyberspace. He grew up on Manhattan's Upper East Side, with an older sister. His mother worked as a child therapist; his father founded the New York-based Touchstone Center for Children. Lewis was 11 when they divorced. He played baseball and basketball at the Walden School in New York. During the winter of his senior year, he worked as the ball boy for the New York Knicks. He occasionally got to shoot around on the floor of Madison Square Garden with visiting gym rats like Larry Bird and Isiah Thomas.
 Today, with his hair gone, his athletic competitiveness tempered by age, a regular yoga practice and possibly the pacifying effects of a vegetarian diet, he still seems driven -- ready to dive for a loose ball. Two fixtures of his wardrobe are his white Royal Elastics sneakers and a colored terry cloth wristband.
 After graduating from Union College in 1992, Lewis worked at a club called Mr. Fuji's. ''I loved night life,'' he says. ''I was always the guy in the group who takes charge of where we should go.''
 A year later, he got into real estate and in 1995 started his own company, but the unutterable bliss of finding apartments for supermodels like Linda Evangelista wasn't what he had in mind when he recalled his boyhood desire to change the world. Neither was e-commerce. He didn't own a computer; he knew virtually nothing about the Internet. But anything was better than haggling with landlords, and when he heard Mark Mangan's pitch, he agreed to put up $10,000 and join the team.
 Netsetgoods.com opened in December 1998. The e-shelves were stocked with pashminas from India, watches from Japan, one-strap messenger bags from France. Within 18 months the company had customers from all 50 states and 15 countries and notices from all the major style magazines. Revenues peaked at $300,000 a year.
 Then, in March 2000, the Internet bubble burst.
 ''We just never got the bird off the ground,'' says Mark's brother, Mike Mangan, who was the company's lawyer.
 In the final months before Netset folded in October 2000, the would-be e-commerce moguls sent out e-mail messages to New York Netset customers and people on party lists from the first dot-com boom, when there was an event nearly every night for digital workers eager to relax after a hard day burning venture capital.
 The first e-mail message was dispatched on July 11, 2000. With four plain-text items separated by asterisks, the visual presentation was on a par with the wire-service telexes that rattled out the news of Nixon's resignation in 1974. But the reception was good. So they did one the next week, and another the week after that. When they stopped moving merchandise, Mangan and Lewis thought they might make a go moving cultural advisories instead.
 ''We had no capital,'' Mangan recalls. ''No business plan, no model. But we had a growing publication that people were digging, so we said to each other, 'Let's just push forward, see how far we can take this.'''
 Needing a name, they came up with Flavorpill after three days of brainstorming, convinced that the image of a mouthwatering capsule of culture outweighed the unwanted drug connotations. They registered the domain name that September.
 ''I wrote the first six months of Flavorpill New York in my kitchen and then e-mailed it to Mark,'' Lewis told me. ''For three and a half years I don't think I went to bed once before 2 a.m. on Monday night. Our parents were like: 'What are you guys doing? You're college graduates and you're sending out e-mails?' My girlfriend at the time would ask for rent, and I would say, 'Sweetie, it's just around the corner.'''
 Lewis put the $200 monthly Web hosting bill on his Visa card, and took work D.J.-ing at clubs. Mangan scraped by doing Web consulting. Will Keh, a friend they had in common, lavished them with leftovers from his catering company.
 In April 2001 they sent out the first issue of Flavorpill that contained graphics. Cover art -- original paintings and graphics offered by artists eager to publicize their work -- would eventually become a Flavorpill trademark, as would the clean color-shot layout. And then in January 2002 they were able to replace the line of asterisks that delineated the days of the week in their very first e-mail with banner ads from an advertiser. Bloomberg, the news and financial information company founded by the new mayor of New York, bought five weeks of ads for $4,000 per week. Over the next three years Flavorpill would maintain the practice of selling each issue exclusively to one advertiser -- companies like Nokia, BMW, Anheuser-Busch -- but the rates would rise to $18,000 per issue, about 7 to 10 times the cost of an ad on a mainstream portal like Yahoo. Signs that they had some traction with their audience were springing up everywhere.
 ''We had club owners starting to call us up and ask, 'Can you not list us?''' Mangan told me.
 A striking example of Flavorpill's influence was the company's collaboration with the Guggenheim Museum. Last year the museum began throwing a D.J. party in the Guggenheim rotunda on the first Friday of the month. The idea was to get a younger crowd of potential new members into the museum after hours. An e-mail press release from the Guggenheim arrived at Flavorpill.
 ''I had never heard any of their D.J.'s,'' Lewis says. ''I offered to help. I thought what we would get out of it would be media content, branding and a level of respect with the artistic community.''
 ''They brought in Diplo,'' recalls Julia Brown, the museum's manager of membership. ''We had no idea this guy was the biggest thing since sliced bread.'' The museum had been averaging 1,500 people; Diplo turned out nearly twice that number.
 In retrospect, that primitive e-mail message Lewis and Mangan first sent out in July 2000 was an uncanny template of the future. It lacked the elegant Flavorpill graphics and the embedded hypertext links that now make each e-mail magazine a springboard to the fathomless esoterica of the Web. But the essential form was there from the start: the brief, superpositive event descriptions with the accent on why readers had to go; the ticket giveaways for added inspiration; the when-and-where info; the scope of venues that included New York's outer boroughs; the viral marketing and community building embedded in the opportunity to ''add a friend'' to the e-mail list. Most important, Lewis and Mangan's initial effort contained an appeal to readers to submit items of what they thought was must-see culture. Soliciting help was hardly an original idea -- Tom Sawyer used the same tactic to get his fence painted -- but it worked like a dream, providing fresh proof that if you get people excited about a job, they might well do it free.
 When Monday arrived, one of the important cultural filterers was missing. ''Leah's home with pinkeye,'' said Jake Lancaster. ''But she's working remotely.''
 Lancaster was writing the introductory summary of the week. Each Flavorpill issue has a loose theme -- Breezy Flavor, Profligate Flavor, Fecund Flavor -- and with the Middle East exploding, the one he came up with for No. 319 was Discordant Flavor.
 Leah Taylor being off-site meant that her boss, Jon Schultz, the 29-year-old group production editor, would have to pick up the slack. At the moment he was putting in some special coding so that spam filters would not reject a Flavorpill issue containing a word that would make your mother blush. Profanity is generally discouraged, but when writers are working free, you indulge them when you can.
 When the San Francisco edition was done, Gerry Mak, the production editor, picked up the Chinese gong and whaled on it with a mallet.
 ''Woo-hoo!'' said Jocelyn Glei, knocking fists with Mak. She turned back to proofreading, finding a space that needed to be closed up between a word and an ellipsis.
 One by one, as London, L.A. and Chicago were wrapped, city production editors rose and trooped to the gong. Whether they whacked it once or twice, or apologetically, or vigorously, or with a demented zeal, the crescendo of sound cut through the minimalist German techno like Patton's Third Army, lending texture and drama to the invisible rush of bytes.
 Finally Schultz stood up. New York No. 319 was done. ''Bring me the mallet!'' he said.
 wo days later I stopped by Mark Mangan's apartment in the East Village, a 15-minute walk from his office. He brought some beer up to the roof, where there were a couple of chairs and a view.
 Somehow time had carried him beyond the demographic center of his audience, more than half of whom were between 25 and 34. And he was looking in from the outside in other ways, being in the business of telling people where they could go but hardly ever getting out himself.
 ''It's a little bit the story of the cobbler's son -- you know, he's the one who doesn't have any shoes,'' he said.
 Work was always on his mind. New cities beckoned, potential Flavorpills for Berlin, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, Toronto. It was possible that in a few years they could have three million readers. Every day he scanned a hundred Web sites, he read 200 to 300 e-mail messages. Six years on, the company was finally hitting its stride; they had turned down buyout offers.
 ''Now is when then fun begins,'' he said.
 More than once both Mangan and Lewis told me that their ambition was ''to raise the water level of good culture,'' as if buried in Flavorpill's consumerist approach -- in the trivial hedonism of any list of things to do -- was a reformer's agenda. Set aside that cultures are defined as much by what people detest as what they love. Week after week Flavorpill finds things to praise in the seemingly quixotic hope that the heavy lifting of cultural improvement might be accomplished through the rigor of a rosy focus.
 The sun was long gone when we climbed down the stairs from the roof. It was a blistering night in the East Village. Mangan flipped open his cellphone. On the screen were the Flavorpill suggestions for that Thursday, fed to his phone by Dodgeball.com. He scrolled down the list. There was an Okkervil River concert at Castle Clinton. Missed that. At the Prospect Park Bandshell Yo La Tengo was performing their original score for eight documentary short films by the ''surrealist aquanaut Jean Painleve.'' Missed that too. The Canada Gallery was featuring a group show led by Jim Drain, who was known for his ''patchwork totem-sculptures that exude alien cool.'' Too late again. The Great Villains in Cinema at Brooklyn Academy of Music? Not tonight. He shrugged. No matter. There was a feast out there, and something with his name on it was sure to turn up soon.

 BODY:
Brenda Ann Kenneally's photo essay (Aug. 27) put a scorching spotlight on the continuing tragedy of the disaster in the Gulf Coast region, laid bare by Hurricane Katrina. But we all know that the hurricane did more than expose the fault lines in New Orleans. It made visible the vulnerability of our nation's poor -- seen in your photos through the fragile existence of children, where upheaval and chaos are the norms and hope seems to present too great a risk. Most sadly, the photos could have been shot in virtually any city or town in our nation. 
 As a whole year has passed, it's long overdue that we have a national discussion about race and opportunity in our country, about living-wage jobs and affordable housing that will light the way to economic security.

For me, the pictures in your photo essay were disturbing not only because they are of children who have lost everything but also because they are of children who have never known anything but poverty. The hurricane has merely exacerbated what we as a society chose to ignore the first time.

HEADLINE: On Self

 BODY:
The most prominent New York intellectual of her generation, Susan Sontag appears, to a reader of her journals, to have filled every idle moment with a notation. She wrote in steno pads and City College spiral-bound notebooks, hardcover journals and even on loose sheets of paper. This churning of life and thought could be found tucked away here and there in the many-roomed apartment at 24th Street and 10th Avenue where she spent her last years; she died on Dec. 28, 2004, shortly before what would have been her 72nd birthday.
Sontag's interest in traditional journal-keeping -- with dated entries and considered sentences -- was episodic. There are outbreaks of diary writing, though more typical are lists: of movies seen, books to read, places to eat and drink in the cities that interested her; and of words, usually English words but sometimes words and phrases in French, German, Greek, Italian and Spanish. There are lists of notable writers, poets or painters of a particular moment, all jotted with the meaningful intensity of a student, an intensity she kept throughout her life. 
 In certain periods, she traces every detail of her private life with anxious care; in other periods, close relationships seem hardly to have been noted. Exploratory passages of novel-writing further blur the line between private drama and literary or intellectual narratives. Seen in the light of her accomplishments and celebrity, Sontag's life seems to have an admirable coherence. Her public persona was durable and unmistakably hers. But in the journals, the effort of it appears again and again: the reworking of the life and ideas, the total concentration, along with the excitement she felt when things were finally going well. She often meditates on this constant self-construction, and indeed some aspects of her life -- the mixing of high and low culture, the sexual enthusiasm, the passionate intellectualism -- would become, beginning in the 1960's, hallmarks of the Downtown life. 
 The selection here begins at the end of 1958, when Sontag is about to turn 26. Her marriage to Philip Rieff had grown troubled, and with a one-year fellowship to study abroad, she planned to settle in Oxford, England, but went instead to Paris. 
 29 December 1958, Paris
 St. Germain des Pres. Not the same as Greenwich Village, exactly. For one thing, expatriates (Americans, Italians, English, South Americans, Germans) in Paris have a different role + self-feeling than provincials (e.g. kids from Chicago, the West Coast, the South) who come to New York. No rupture of national identification, and mal-identification. Same language. One can always go home. And, anyway, the majority of Villagers are New Yorkers -- internal, even municipal, expatriates
 The cafe routine. After work, or trying to write or paint, you come to a cafe looking for people you know. Preferably with someone, or at least with a definite rendez-vous.. . . One should go to several cafes -- average: four -- in an evening.
 Also, in New York (Greenwich Village) there's the shared comedy of being Jewish. That's missing, too, from this bohemia. Not so heimlich. In Greenwich Village, the Italians -- the proletarian background against which deracinated Jews + provincials stage their intellectual and sexual virtuosity -- are picturesque but pretty harmless. Here, turbulent marauding Arabs.
 . . .
 The rates, the failed intellectuals (writers, artists, would-be Ph.D.'s). People like Sam Wolfenstein [mathematician], with his limp, his briefcase, his empty days, his addiction to the films, his penny-pinching and scavengering, his arid family nest from which he flees -- terrifies me.
 Harriet [Sohmers, author and artists' model]. Finest flower of American bohemia. New York. Jewish. Family apartments in the 70's and 80's. Middle-class business (not professional) father. Communist aunts. Own history of CP flirtation. Negro maid. New York high school, N.Y.U., experimental artsy-craftsy college, San Francisco, flat in Greenwich Village. Early sexual experience, including Negroes. Homosexuality. Writes short stories. Bisexual promiscuity. Paris. Lives with a painter. Father moves to Miami. Trips back to America. Expatriate-type night employment. Writing peters out.
 30 December 
 My relationship to Harriet baffles me. I want it to be unpremeditated, unreflective -- but the shadow of her expectations about what an ''affair'' consists in upsets my poise, makes me fumble. She with her romantic dissatisfactions, I with my romantic needs and longing.. . . One unexpected gift: that she is beautiful. I had remembered her as definitely not beautiful, rather gross and unattractive. She's anything but that. And physical beauty is enormously, almost morbidly, important to me.

 On Keeping a Journal. Superficial to understand the journal as just a receptacle for one's private, secret thoughts -- like a confidante who is deaf, dumb and illiterate. In the journal I do not just express myself more openly than I could to any person; I create myself.
 The journal is a vehicle for my sense of selfhood. It represents me as emotionally and spiritually independent. Therefore (alas) it does not simply record my actual, daily life but rather -- in many cases -- offers an alternative to it.
 There is often a contradiction between the meaning of our actions toward a person and what we say we feel toward that person in a journal. But this does not mean that what we do is shallow, and only what we confess to ourselves is deep. Confessions, I mean sincere confessions of course, can be more shallow than actions. I am thinking now of what I read today (when I went up to 122 Bd. St-G to check for her mail) in H's journal about me -- that curt, unfair, uncharitable assessment of me which concludes by her saying that she really doesn't like me but my passion for her is acceptable and opportune. God knows it hurts, and I feel indignant and humiliated. We rarely do know what people think of us (or, rather, think they think of us).. . .Do I feel guilty about reading what was not intended for my eyes? No. One of the main (social) functions of a journal or diary is precisely to be read furtively by other people, the people (like parents + lovers) about whom one has been cruelly honest only in the journal. Will H. ever read this?
 . . .
 Writing. It's corrupting to write with the intent to moralize, to elevate people's moral standards.
 Nothing prevents me from being a writer except laziness. A good writer.
 Why is writing important? Mainly, out of egotism, I suppose. Because I want to be that persona, a writer, and not because there is something I must say. Yet why not that too? With a little ego-building -- such as the fait accompli this journal provides -- I shall win through to the confidence that I (I) have something to say, that should be said.
 My ''I'' is puny, cautious, too sane. Good writers are roaring egotists, even to the point of fatuity. Sane men, critics, correct them -- but their sanity is parasitic on the creative fatuity of genius.
 2 January, 7:30 a.m.
 Poor little ego, how did you feel today? Not very well, I fear -- rather bruised, sore, traumatized. Hot waves of shame, and all that. I never had any illusion that she was in love with me, but I did assume she liked me.
 . . .
 Tonight (last night!) at Paul's place I reely wuz speeking French. For owers 'n owers, with him and his very sweet parents. What great fun!!
 19 February
 Yesterday (late afternoon) I went to my first Paris cocktail party, at Jean Wahl's -- in the disgusting company of Allan Bloom. Wahl [a philosopher] very much lived up to my expectations -- a tiny slim birdlike old man with lank white hair and wide thin mouth, rather beautiful, like Jean-Louis Barrault [actor] will be at 65, but terribly distrait and unkempt. Baggy black suit with three large holes in the rear end through which you could see his (white) underwear, + he'd just come from a late afternoon lecture -- on Claudel -- at the Sorbonne. Has a tall handsome Tunisian wife (with a round face and tightly-drawn-back black hair) half his age, about 35-40 I'd guess, + three or four quite young children. Also there were Giorgio de Santillana [historian of science]; two Japanese artists; lean old ladies in fur hats; a man from Preuves; middle-sized children straight out of Balthus, in Mardi Gras costumes; a man who looked like Jean-Paul Sartre, only uglier, with a limp, and was Jean-Paul Sartre; and lots of other people whose names meant nothing to me. I talked to Wahl + de Santillana + (unavoidably) to Bloom. The apartment, it's in the rue Peletier, is fantastic -- all the walls are drawn + sketched + painted on by the children and by artist friends -- there is dark carved North African furniture, ten thousand books, heavy tablecloths, flowers, paintings, toys, fruit -- a rather beautiful disorder, I thought.
 28 Feb.
 Heard Simone de Beauvoir talk on the novel is it still possible last night at the Sorbonne (with [the journalist Irv] Jaffe). She is lean and tense and blackhaired and very goodlooking for her age, but her voice is unpleasant, something about the high pitch + the nervous speed with which she talks. In the late afternoon read Carson McCullers's ''Reflections in a Golden Eye.'' Slick, really economical and 'written,' but I don't go for motivation by apathy, catatonia, animal empathy.. . .(In a novel, I mean!)
 Early 1959, New York City
 The ugliness of New York. But I do like it here, even like Commentary [to which she contributed]. In NY sensuality completely turns into sexuality -- no objects for the senses to respond to, no beautiful river, houses, people. Awful smells of the street, and dirt.. . .Nothing except eating, if that, and the frenzy of the bed.

 Adjusting the self to the city vs. making the city answer better to the self
 March 12, 4:15 p.m.
 I am in bad shape. I write it out here; I write slowly and I look at my handwriting which looks OK. Two vodka martinis with Marty Greenberg [editor at Commentary]. My head feels heavy. Smoking is bitter. Tony + a curd-faced bloke (Mike Harrington) are talking about Stanford-Binets. Kleist is wonderful. Nietzsche, Nietzsche.

 I'm not pious, but co-pious.
 Nov. 19
 The coming of the orgasm has changed my life. I am liberated, but that's not the way to say it. More important: it has narrowed me, it has closed off possibilities, it has made the alternatives clear and sharp. I am no longer unlimited, i.e. nothing.
 Sexuality is the paradigm. Before, my sexuality was horizontal, an infinite line capable of being infinitely subdivided. Now it is vertical; it is up and over, or nothing.
 . . .
 The orgasm focuses. I lust to write. The coming of the orgasm is not the salvation but, more, the birth of my ego. I cannot write until I find my ego. The only kind of writer I could be is the kind who exposes himself.. . .To write is to spend oneself, to gamble oneself. But up to now I have not even liked the sound of my own name. To write, I must love my name. The writer is in love with himself. . .and makes his books out of that meeting and that violence.
 Nov. 20 (3 a.m.)
 I have never been as demanding of anyone as I am of [the Cuban-American playwright Maria] I[rene Fornes]. I am jealous of everyone she sees, I hurt every minute she goes away from me. But not when I leave her, and know that she is here. My love wants to incorporate her totally, to eat her. My love is selfish.
 . . .
 Tonight she went from work to meet Inez at the San Remo. Ann Morrissett [journalist and playwright] was there. After, the Cedar Bar. She came home at 12:00; I was asleep.. . .She came to bed, told me about the conversations of the evening, at 2:00 asked that the light be put out, went to sleep. I was paralyzed, mute, swollen with tears. I smoked, she slept.

 Dec. 24
 My desire to write is connected with my homosexuality. I need the identity as a weapon, to match the weapon that society has against me.
 It doesn't justify my homosexuality. But it would give me -- I feel -- a license.
 I am just becoming aware of how guilty I feel being queer. With H., I thought it didn't bother me, but I was lying to myself. I let other people (e.g. Annette [Michelson, film scholar]) believe that it was H. who was my vice, and that apart from her I wouldn't be queer or at least not mainly so.
 . . .
 Being queer makes me feel more vulnerable. 
 Dec. 28
 Till now I have felt that the only persons I could know in depth, or really love, were duplicates or versions of my own wretched self. (My intellectual and sexual feelings have always been incestuous.) Now I know + love someone who is not like me -- e.g. not a Jew, not a New York-type intellectual -- without any failure of intimacy. I am always conscious of I's foreignness, of the absence of a shared background -- and I experience this as a great release.

 Cogito ergo est
 Feb.
 How many times have I told people that Pearl Kazin [editor] was a major girlfriend of Dylan Thomas? That Norman Mailer has orgies? That [F.O.] Matthiessen was queer? All public knowledge to be sure, but who the hell am I to go advertising other people's sexual habits.
 How many times have I reviled myself for that, which is only a little less offensive than my habit of name-dropping (how many times did I talk about Allen Ginsberg last year while I was on Commentary?) and my habit of criticizing people if other people invite it.. . .I have always betrayed people to each other. No wonder I've been so high-minded and scrupulous about how I use the word ''friend''!

 March 8 (noon)
 Via benzedrine, the ever-seeping down impact of Irene, Dr. Puroshottam [Hindu scholar] 
 last week, this morning's lectures on Spinoza's ethics, the long meditation on Kant which began in October, yesterday's idea of the difference between 'the truth that' and 'the truth about.'
 There is no stasis. To stand still is to fall away from the truth; the inner life dims and flickers, starts to go out, as soon as one tries to hold fast. It's like trying to make this breath serve for the next one, or making today's dinner do the work of next Wednesday's as well.. . .Truth rides the arrow of time.
 August 8
 Monday Morning
 I must help I. to write. And if I write, too, it will stop this uselessness of just sitting and staring 
 at her and begging her to love me again.
 . . .
 It hurts then to love. It's like giving yourself 
 to be flayed and knowing that at any moment the other person may just walk off with your skin.
 August 14
 I SHOULDN'T TRY TO MAKE LOVE 
 WHEN I AM TIRED.
 I SHOULD ALWAYS KNOW WHEN I AM 
 TIRED. BUT I DON'T.
 I LIE TO MYSELF. I DON'T KNOW 
 MY TRUE FEELINGS.
 (Still?!)
 12/3/61
 Becoming aware of the 'dead places' of feeling -- Talking without feeling anything. (This 
 is very different from my old self-revulsion at talking without knowing anything.)
 The writer must be four people:
 1) the nut, the obsede
 2) the moron
 3) the stylist
 4) the critic
 1) supplies the material
 2) lets it come out
 3) is taste
 4) is intelligence
 a great writer has all 4 -- but you can still be 
 a good writer with only 1) and 2); they're most important.
 9 Dec. 1961
 The fear of becoming old is born of the recognition that one is not living now the life that one wishes. It is equivalent to a sense 
 of abusing the present.
 [Not dated]
 Mary McCarthy's grin -- grey hair -- low-fashion red + blue print suit. Clubwoman gossip. She is The Group. She's nice to her husband.
 . . .
 I write to define myself -- an act of self-creation -- part of process of becoming -- in a dialogue with myself, with writers I admire living and dead, with ideal readers
 Because it gives me pleasure (an 'activity')
 I'm not sure what purpose my work serves
 Personal salvation -- Rilke's 'Letters to a 
 Young Poet.'
 Sept. 3, 1962
 I am sitting on the grass by the river. David is play[ing] ball with a Puerto Rican boy and man.
 Alone, alone, alone. A ventriloquist's dummy without a ventriloquist. I have brain-fatigue and heart-ache. Where is peace, the center?
 There are seven different kinds of grasses 
 where I am lying. Dandelions, squirrels, little yellow flowers.
 . . .
 I want to be able to be alone, to find it nourishing -- not just a waiting.
 Hippolyte says, blessed is the mind with something to occupy it other than its own dissatisfactions.
 I dreamed of Nat[han] Glazer last night. He came to borrow a black dress of mine, a 
 very beautiful dress, for his girlfriend to wear at a party. I tried to help him find it. He lay 
 on a single bed + I sat beside him and stroked his face. His skin was white except for patches of black moss-like beard on his face. I asked 
 him how his face got so white, + told him he should get into the sun. I wanted him to 
 love me but he didn't.
 Sept. 12, 1962
 Premature pliability, agreeableness
 so that the underlying stubbornness is 
 never touched 
 accounts for 80% of my notorious flirtatiousness, seductiveness
 10/16/62
 Sentimentality. The inertia of the emotions. They are not light, buoyant. -- I am sentimental. I cling to my emotional states. 
 Or do they cling to me?
 July 27, 1964
 Art = a way of getting in touch with one's 
 own insanity.
 My need to get rid of it, once hauled up. 
 A freshly typed manuscript, the moment it's completed, begins to stink. It's a dead body -- it must be buried -- embalmed, in print. I rush out to mail the mss. the moment it's finished, even if it's 4 a.m.
 The greatest crime: to judge.
 The greatest failing: lack of wholeheartedness.
 [On a loose scrap of paper, probably from 1964]
 I will be all right by 7:00 a.m. this morning.
 . . .
 M. [Mildred Jacobsen, Sontag's mother] 
 didn't answer when I was a child. The worst punishment -- and the ultimate frustration. 
 She was always 'off' -- even when she wasn't angry. (The drinking a symptom of this.) 
 But I kept trying.
 Now, the same with I. Even more agonizing because for four years she did answer. So I know she can.
 . . .
 My faults:
 -- to censor [sic] others for my own vices*
 -- to make my friendships into love affairs
 -- to ask that love include (and exclude) all
 *but, perhaps this becomes most hectic and obvious -- reaches a climax, when the thing in myself is deteriorating, giving way, collapsing -- like: my indignation at Susan [Taubes]'s and Eva [Kollisch]'s physical squeamishness
 NB: my ostentatious appetite -- real need -- 
 to eat exotic and ''disgusting'' foods = a need to state my denial of squeamishness. A counter-statement.
 Nov. 17, 1964
 Where I detected envy, I forbore to criticize -- lest my motives be impure, and my judgment less than impartial. I was benevolent. I was malicious only about strangers, people who were indifferent.
 It seems noble.
 But, thereby, I rescued my 'superiors,' those I admired, from my dislike -- my aggression. Criticism was reserved only for those 'beneath' me, whom I didn't respect.. . .I used my power of criticism to confirm the status quo.
 . . .
 all capital cities are more like each other than like the rest of the cities in their country (people in NY more like Paris than in St. Paul)
 . . .
 Cal [Robert Lowell]: in madness, a machine operating at 5 times its normal rate, without its governor -- sweating, [expletive], pouring 
 out words, lurching back + forth
 [Not dated, probably 1964]
 The intellectual ecstasy I have had access to since early childhood. But ecstasy is ecstasy.
 Intellectual 'wanting' like sexual wanting.

 [George] Balanchine, the last of the modernist geniuses
 3/26/65
 recent painting (Pop, Op) -- cool; least amount of texture possible -- light colors
 need to have canvas, because you can't float colors off in space
 . . .
 feeling (sensation) of a Jasper Johns painting or object might be like that of the Supremes
 Pop Art is Beatle art
 another key text: Ortega, 'Dehumanization 
 of Art'
 every age has its representative age group -- ours is youth -- spirit of age is being cool, dehumanized, play, sensation, apolitical
 Jasper Johns -- Duchamp painted by Monet
 April 20
 My vision is unrefined, insensitive; this is the trouble I'm having with painting.
 another project: Webern, Boulez, Stockhausen. Buy records, read, do some work. I've been very lazy.
 To give no interviews until I can sound as clear + authoritative + direct as Lillian [Hellman] does in the Paris Review.
 May 20, Edisto Beach [S.C.]
 ''the arrogant object'' (Johns)
 one doesn't learn from experience -- because the substance of things is always changing
 there is no neutral surface -- something is only neutral with respect to something else (an intention? An expectation?) -- Robbe-Grillet
 Rauschenberg's use of newsprint, tires
 Johns: broom, hanger
 The only transformation that interests me is a total transformation -- however minute. I want the encounter with a person or a work of art to change everything.
 July 4, Bled [Yugoslavia]
 Mailer: how to be pure and be a movie star
 In every important modern American writer you feel a struggle with the language -- it's 
 your enemy, doesn't naturally work for you. (Completely different in England, where 
 the language is taken for granted.) You have 
 to subdue it, reinvent it.
 July 16, Paris
 I haven't learned to mobilize rage -- (I perform militant actions, without militant feeling)
 Sept. 17 (on plane to NY)
 Sartre: ''When people's opinions are so different, how can they even go to a film together?''
 Beauvoir: ''To smile at opponents and friends alike is to abase one's commitments to the status of mere opinions, and all intellectuals, whether of the Right or Left, to their common bourgeois condition.''
 Nov. 8
 Through 2/3 of Greta Garbo's ''Private Potato Patch'' I wanted to be Garbo (I studied her; 
 I wanted to assimilate her, learn her gestures, feel as she felt) -- then, toward the end, 
 I started to want her, to think of her sexually, 
 to want to possess her. Longing succeeded admiration -- as the end of my seeing her drew near. The sequence of my homosexuality?
 . . .
 In NY, little or no ''community'' but a great sense of ''scene.''
 . . .
 My biggest pleasure the last two years has 
 come from pop music (the Beatles, Dionne Warwick, the Supremes) + the music of Al Carmines [actor, composer, director, reverend]
 In the next apt. I'll have lots of plants, massed together.
 . . .
 A problem: the thinness of my writing -- 
 it's meager, sentence by sentence -- too architectural, discursive
 [Mid-November]
 Mailer says he wants his writings to change 
 the consciousness of his time. So did DHL[awrence], obviously.
 I don't want mine to -- at least not in terms of any particular point of view or vision or message which I'm trying to put across.
 I'm not.
 The texts are objects. I want them to affect readers -- but in any number of possible ways. There is no one right way to experience what I've written.
 I'm not ''saying something.'' I'm allowing ''something'' to have a voice, an independent existence (an existence independent of me). 
 Nov. 24
 Lillian [Hellman] identified with Becky Sharp -- always wanted to be a bitch, to bait people.
 I never got past admiring and envying her for being able to throw the dictionary back at the drippy schoolmistress. All that manipulative stuff with men was beyond me. 
 Analysis: two or three cataracts have fallen from my eyes. A hundred more to go?
 I come each night around 2:00 or 3:00. The N.Y. Times is my lover.
 [Not dated, late 1965]
 The unpleasantness of the feedback -- other people's reactions to my work, admiring or adverse. I don't want to react to that. I'm critical enough (+ I know better what's wrong).
 I like to feel dumb. That's how I know there's more in the world than me.
 . . .
 my intellectual formation:
 a) Knopf + M[odern] L[ibrary]
 b) P[artisan] R[eview] (Trilling, Rahv, 
 Fiedler, Chase)
 c) University of Chicago

 Burke 
 d) Central European ''sociology''
 The German Jewish refugee intellectuals
 Strauss, Arendt, Scholem, Marcuse, Gourevitch, [Jacob] Taubes, etc.
 (Marx, Freud, Spengler, Nietzsche, Weber, Dilthey, Simmel, Mannheim, Adorno et etc.)
 e) Harvard Wittgenstein
 f) the French -- Artaud, Barthes, Cioran, Sartre
 g) more history of religion
 h) I -- Mailer, anti-intellectualism
 i) Art, art-history

 Jan. 4, 1966
 The situation in painting is tight: like science. Everyone conscious of ''problem,'' what needs to be worked on. Each artist by his recent work issuing ''white papers'' on this or that problem, + the critics judging whether their chosen problems are interesting or trivial. (The Barbara Rose approach.) Thus Rosalind Krauss judges Jasper's flashlight, ale cans, etc. to be the solution to/exploration of a peripheral (trivial) problem of sculpture now: what to do with 
 the pedestal.. . .While Frank Stella's work is thought to be very interesting because it is a solution to central problems. W/o a knowledge of recent art-history + its ''problems,'' who 
 wd. be interested in Frank Stella? 
 Artists working hip to hip -- very tight -- everything changing each six months, as more ''work'' from the diff. academies comes in. 
 One has to keep up, have a very keen radar. (To be relevant, to be interesting.)
 While in literature, everything is so loose textured. One could make a parachute jump blindfolded -- anywhere you land, if you push it hard enough, you're bound to find interesting unexplored valuable terrain. All the options are lying about, barely used.
 . . .
 Jasper is good for me. (But only for a while.) 
 He makes it feel natural + good + right to be crazy. And mute. To question everything. Because he is crazy.
 . . .
 The only thoughts I have that seem to 
 stay ''true'' are thoughts about thinking (and feeling) -- their contours, methodology, dilemmas --
 No thoughts about how things are 'in the world' (estimates of people, art, political ideas) stay persuasive for long. One look again at 
 that reality.. . !
 . . .
 making lists (+ checking off things known, recognized, seen or owned) on an already existent list: another version of ''blessing''!
 I take these things under my wing -- I 'include' them.
 [Not dated, late winter 1966]
 NYC with its intelligentsia, its liberal consensus, is in relationship to the rest of USA like Vatican in the midst of Italy, a tiny private state with immense power + wealth, but separate
 . . .
 Interesting that Merce [Cunningham] called the potting + repotting of the plant and the bicycle riding in ''Variations V'' ''non-dance activities.'' Just when I'd gotten used to the Judson [Church, a Village dance venue] idea that any behavior could be thought as part of dancing. 
 Duchamp has said two contradictory things -- (1) that a work of art has a (short) life-span and (2) that the value of a w-o-a can only be established by posterity.
 One view: art is a language, not just what it is.
 Is this the ''conservative'' view?
 Ad Reinhardt's ''black'' paintings are like Robbe-Grillet's novels -- an idea mapped on a grid. You ''get it'' too easily. That's ''romantic'' 
 in one sense (romanticism as concentrating on a part rather than the whole).
 . . .
 Self-expression is the limiting idea, limiting if it's central. (Art as self-expression is very limiting.) From self-expression one can never arrive at an authentic, a genuine, not merely expediential, justification for courtesy.
 But if you start with courtesy, you can accommodate most of what people attribute 
 to self-expression (through idea of courtesy 
 to oneself).
 . . .
 Atmosphere at Merce's lecture-demonstration: everything was important. Things handled evenly, with measure, with care. The rag he 
 wiped his sweat with. The stool he moved, then sat on at the back of the stage.
 . . .
 Jasp[er Johns]: ''I don't think a thing is anything'' (i.e. any one thing) -- So de Kooning was being simple-minded when he destroyed 
 a painting because X liked it. Maybe X didn't like what de Kooning assumed he would encounter + wanted him to dislike. Maybe he liked something entirely different. 
 June 1
 One of my strongest and most fully 
 employed emotions: contempt. Contempt 
 for others, contempt for myself.
 . . .
 I'm impatient (* contemptuous) of people who don't know how to protect themselves, stand up for themselves.
 My mind = King Kong. Aggressive, tears people to pieces. I keep it locked up most of 
 the time -- and bite my nails.
 June 27, Paris
 When the provos stage ''happenings'' at night in the streets of Amsterdam, there is a risk. They provoke the police, they 'say' something, they try to make something happen. (More liberty, etc.)
 Happenings in NY are not only apolitical. 
 They risk nothing. They are witty exercises in irrationality -- entirely safe.
 If only my novel could have the speed -- and the range, the relevance -- that Godard's last two films have. The ulcer of Vietnam, the sound of guns going off --

 Peter Brook: very intense, high-pitched, pale blue eyes -- balding -- wears black turtleneck sweaters -- warm generous handshake -- fleshy, meaty face

 Oct. 8
 Jap [Jasper Johns]; of a young painter's work 
 he saw this afternoon. ''The paintings are very beautiful. But that's all.''
 Jap's authority, his elegance. He is never flustered, apologetic, guilty, ashamed. Perfect certitude. So, if he picks his nose or eats in 
 the Automat, he's being elegant.
 . . .
 The only people who should interest themselves in an art (or several arts) are those who practice it -- or have -- or aspire to. The whole idea of 
 an ''audience'' is wrong. The artist's audience is his peers.
 [Not dated, late 1966]
 Joe [Chaikin] asks me tonight how I feel when 
 I discover, say, three-fours through something I'm writing that it is mediocre, inferior. I reply that I feel good and plow on to the end. I'm discharging the mediocre in myself. (My excremental image of my writing.) It's there. 
 I want to get rid of it. I can't negate it by an act 
 of will. (Or can I?) I can only allow it its voice, get it ''out.'' Then I can do something else. 
 At least, I know I won't need to do that again.
 Feb. 22, 1967, 3 a.m.
 I'm finishing the [''Story of] O'' review which has turned into a 35-page essay. It's OK. Still, 
 I don't believe a word I'm saying. 
 It's interesting, maybe valuable -- but I don't see how ''true.''

 In Calif., a stranger is a [potential] friend until he proves otherwise; in NY, a stranger is an enemy until he proves otherwise. One uses up

 The ideal life: doing only things which are indispensable.
 Two ways to be -- a saint or a thief.
 My image of myself since age 3 or 4 -- the genius-schmuck. I allow one to pay off the other. Develop relationships to satisfy principally one or the other.
 . . .
 Sartre (cf. ''Les Mots'') the only other person 
 I know of who had this ''certainty'' of genius. Living already a posthumous life, even as a childhood. (The childhood of a famous man.) 
 A kind of suicide -- with the ''work'' of 
 genius you know you'll do when adult your tombstone. The most glorious tombstone possible.
 Sartre was very ugly -- and knew it. So he didn't have to develop ''the schmuck'' 
 to pay off the others for being ''the genius.'' Nature had taken care of the problem for 
 him. He didn't have to invent a cause of failure 
 or rejection by others. As I did, by making myself 'stupid' in personal relations. (For 'stupid,' also read 'blind.')

HEADLINE: Political Stagecraft

BYLINE: By Jesse Green. 
Jesse Green frequently writes about theater for the magazine.

 BODY:
The debut of a new show at a nonprofit theater is always an occasion for schmoozing donors, not so often for flinging dirt in their faces. But at the opening of ''Amajuba: Like Doves We Rise'' at Culture Project in July, both things happened. For half an hour before curtain (though there was no curtain), Allan Buchman cruised the crowded lobby of the former lumberyard on Bleecker Street, shaking hands with people who seemed less like theater types than refugees from a wonkfest: the Democratic fund-raiser Gail Furman; the political-talk-show host Patricia Duff; the United Nations official (and former would-be first sister) Peggy Kerry; and, somewhat rightward of the rest of the room, the real-estate-tycoon-turned-publishing-magnate Mort Zuckerman. To each, in turn, Buchman talked up the play and the forthcoming Impact Festival: a $1.2 million fall project that would either make the company's future or sink it. But Buchman, who has sometimes called himself Culture Project's artistic director and sometimes its executive director and sometimes (as his hero Joseph Papp did at the Public Theater) simply its producer, didn't seem worried; wearing sneakers and a pink shirt untucked over chinos, he looked as if he might be captaining a luxury vessel over smooth seas on a cloudless night. 
The dirt came later. At the climax of ''Amajuba,'' after the five actors had re-enacted terrible scenes from their childhoods under apartheid in South Africa's townships, one of them started shoveling heaps of ''river sand'' (actually red dirt from a construction site near 10th Street and Avenue C) across the stage. The effect, abstractly gorgeous but also congruent with the play's themes of buried grief and resurrection, quite literally altered the audience's vision and (because the dust went everywhere) its breathing too. Coughing all the way home on the subway, I thought that seemed like an apt definition of good theater, or at least the kind that Buchman is trying to revive at Culture Project: something that changes how you see and how you internalize the world. 
 This kind of political theater has been all too rare in New York in recent years -- certainly on Broadway and at the major uptown nonprofits, but even in its natural habitat downtown. There is agitprop, of course, directly and often ham-handedly advocating particular positions; since 9/11, much of what you can see below 14th Street is straight-up progressive cheerleading, cathartic more in the manner of a rally than of classical drama. There is the Public, which this summer directly tackled the theme of war in three different works. And there is plenty of theater that through the prism of invented character and plot means to address social and even governmental realities. But somewhere between the anti-Bush cabarets and the ''artistic'' plays, Culture Project has carved out a niche by offering first-person and documentary accounts of real life right now.
 Perhaps because left-leaning New York audiences crave an alternative to news coverage they find ''objective'' in all the wrong ways -- that is, centrist and unimpassioned -- several Culture Project shows have done very well, extending their runs and even touring or transferring to larger theaters. But Buchman (he pronounces it ''Bushman'') would produce them anyway; they're the only plays he really likes. He has little interest in anything that requires the unpacking of metaphors to make its point. He'd rather just make the point. ''We want to be conducting reconnaissance in the battlefield of social issues,'' he told me.
 So the play is not the thing -- or not the only thing; the productions that have established Culture Project's identity over the last few years barely fit within conventional definitions of the word. ''The Exonerated'' was basically a staged deposition, expertly redacted from the testimony of death-row inmates who were later found to be innocent of the crimes for which they had been sentenced. ''Guantanamo: Honor Bound to Defend Freedom'' was a journalistic collage based on accounts of British citizens held without apparent cause at that notorious detention camp. And then there were the one-woman, multicharacter transformation acts: ''Belfast Blues,'' Geraldine Hughes's autobiography of life in violent Belfast, and ''Bridge and Tunnel,'' in which Sarah Jones portrayed 14 New York poets trying to domesticate their adopted language and country. Though technically fiction, ''Bridge and Tunnel'' felt more like cinema verite, even when it moved to Broadway.
 The genre confusion will continue at the Impact Festival, which runs for six weeks starting Sept. 12. Billed as ''a citywide arts festival focusing on human rights, social justice and political action,'' it features the usual Buchman mix (he calls it a Chinese menu) of earnest first-person storytelling, current events and drawing-card celebrities, including Dylan McDermott and Suzanne Vega. A centerpiece of the festival is Eve Ensler's new play, ''The Treatment,'' about interrogation and torture, military and interpersonal; other works -- not just plays but also films, dances, concerts and art exhibits -- address unjust incarceration, failed U.S. drug policy as seen by former addicts, homeland security and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (with Israeli and Palestinian actors). ''Mental Missiles,'' a revue by the composer Elizabeth Swados, will, in this context, constitute light entertainment.
 If it's surprising to find a theater company producing a festival at which one of the anticipated highlights is a series of weekly debates at the New York Public Library, perhaps it makes more sense when you learn that Buchman, who is 61, was not until recently a man of the theater. Blame Napoleon's piano for making him one. Until 1993, a few years before he started Culture Project, Buchman was one of the country's leading importers and restorers of fine keyboard instruments. Among the highlights of that career, he told me, were restorations of Keith Richards's Ibach and Richard Wagner's Bechstein.
 But when Napoleon's Sheraton-style piano came up for sale around 1990, he was thwarted by the terms of a 1988 embargo meant to protect African elephants; if he wanted to bring the emperor's instrument into the U.S. for restoration, he would first have to ruin it by stripping the veneer off its keys. (A letter he wrote to President George H.W. Bush, pointing out that piano restorers were even more endangered than elephants, got him nowhere.) The embargo, since modified, put a huge dent in Buchman's business, as did the first Iraq war and the uncertain economy. The situation, Buchman said, ''was not conducive to even rich people spending $100,000'' on objects many of them could not play.
 Over lunch in a downtown Chinese restaurant, where his concept of dessert was a cup of green tea, Buchman told me that the problem with pianos was not just financial; it was really, for want of a better word, spiritual. ''If I made a fantastic discovery with a piano,'' he said, ''it would create a tremor that would hardly be felt by anyone.'' What was once a mass-market product had become elitist -- a word Buchman accompanied with a half-sour grimace. ''I wasn't accomplishing what would make me proud as a participating human being,'' he added. ''I wanted to be part of a tradition that would have a role in the future.''
 It takes an amazing kind of optimism to refer to the tired old theater that way, but Buchman said it wasn't so much optimism as desperation that led him to become a producer.
 Buchman was born Sidney Blume on V-J Day but was soon adopted (and renamed) by a middle-class couple in Meriden, Conn. He later had three daughters with a woman about whom he doesn't say much else. The first was born when Buchman was 20 and at loose ends, having dashed his family's hopes for Harvard and dealing with ''some erroneous charges with regard to possession of marijuana.'' That baby was placed for adoption; she recently contacted Buchman for the first time and told him that she was a mortuary-affairs officer in the National Guard. In 1968, a second child, Jhardene, was born, though she preferred to be called Chitra. Next came Tara -- named, Buchman hastens to add, after a Hindu goddess, not the fictional antebellum mansion. Tara is now a restaurant manager in Westport, Conn., but Chitra's life proved turbulent. In her teens, Chitra became anorexic, bulimic and alcoholic. Faced with ''the injustice of a child's helplessness,'' Buchman says he tried everything he could think of to save her, but ''any form of intervention I employed turned out to have a result that was the opposite of what I intended.'' In time, Chitra became H.I.V. positive, and in 1993, at 25, she died. 
 ''I lost my daughter and business within a few weeks,'' Buchman said. ''It was not terribly different than a crucifixion.''
 At the time, Buchman was still living in a huge loft on East 91st Street that had housed his piano business. To keep it (and himself) occupied, he rented part of the space to the Riverside Shakespeare Company and held some ''salon type'' events of his own. Gradually it dawned on him that the theater, lashing the abstractions of art to the reality of social interaction in a dark room, might help him ''make something better'' of the painful experience that had been ''entrusted'' to him. In 1996 he inaugurated the Culture Project (the definite article was dropped only recently) with a summer festival he called Women Center Stage. ''I wanted to find a way to sustain Chitra after her life,'' he said. Political theater was a way of literalizing empathy for others in pain.
 Dogeared copies of the Vedas and Upanishads lie open among the stacks of scripts in Buchman's deliberately ungrand office. He says he hasn't missed his morning meditation more than a handful of times in the last 35 years and has committed himself ''to a religious path that encourages celibacy.'' So it's no surprise that he takes a spiritual rather than a psychological approach to even his employment history. But I can't help thinking that in addition to enlightenment he was also hoping to find in the theater a way of making interventions in reality that might work out better than they had with his daughter.
 It quickly became apparent, though, that 91st Street wasn't the place to do it. ''On the Upper East Side, if an interesting person walked by it would be a notable experience for a week,'' he said.
 Though there were plenty of interesting people walking by the lumberyard at 45 Bleecker, Buchman could not at first afford to reach them. By the time the 199-seat first-floor theater was ready in 1999 (a 99-seat basement space opened in 2002), the company was too much in debt to produce anything resembling a season. For its first two years downtown, Culture Project was mainly a landlord for outside productions, some apt and some not; this balanced the books but did nothing to establish a theatrical identity. Nor was it how Buchman had intended to do business. He had chosen the name Culture Project to suggest that art could be ''a natural resource, like a redwood, sustaining itself and accomplishing something worthwhile in the process.'' He did not want it to be a beggar but a provider. He wanted to find a way of doing theater that addressed current headlines head on -- and, ideally, made headlines too.
 Now he had the place; he had the philosophy; all he needed was the work that would fill and embody them. In 1975 Papp got lucky with ''A Chorus Line,'' which made the Public a national name and flooded its coffers for years. Was there a kind of ''Chorus Line'' out there for Culture Project -- one without music or glitz but with a cutting-edge progressive slant?
 The solution began to take form when Jessica Blank asked Erik Jensen out on a date -- to a death-penalty conference. (Jensen says he would have said yes even if she'd proposed knee surgery.) Not long afterward, in May 2000, they came to Buchman with the idea of interviewing wrongly convicted people who had served time -- sometimes years -- on death row, then transforming the interviews into a kind of oral-history play. Buchman knew the pair only as actors but said the idea was the kind for which his theater existed; he promised them seed money on the condition that a draft be ready before the presidential election that November. He wanted to make ''a pre-emptive strike.''
 Buchman's $1,000 investment paid for the first in a series of very frugal road trips and resulted in three Monday-night readings, starting that Oct. 30, of ''The Exonerated.'' An expanded version returned as a full production in 2002; featuring Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins and David Morse, it soon become a kind of ''Hollywood Squares'' for dozens of lefty celebrities, including Mia Farrow and Richard Dreyfuss.
 It's easy to belittle political theater as preaching to the converted; in his rave for ''The Exonerated'' in The New Yorker, John Lahr wrote that ''arguing Off Broadway against the death penalty is like pushing at an open door.'' True, but Buchman planned to preach to the unconverted as well, by ''engaging the media in such a way as to make a high return on our investment.'' That meant celebrities but also advertising; during the 18 months that ''The Exonerated'' ran at Culture Project and the additional 6 months it toured, Buchman spent almost $2 million plugging it -- an expense he sees not as a budgetary drain but as part of the point of doing the show in the first place. The advertising was ''a public-awareness campaign'' on the issue of the inequalities of the criminal-justice system, reaching many more people than the play ever could. In effect, the theater was subsidizing the political message -- quite a switch from the normal model, in which governmental bodies subsidize theater. The high point of that campaign (and, Buchman says, of his life) was a special performance of the play for Gov. George Ryan of Illinois in December 2002. A month later, Ryan commuted the death sentences of or pardoned all 171 inmates facing the death penalty in his state.
 ''The Exonerated'' put Culture Project on the map, establishing its voice and modus operandi. Buchman used similar media-leveraging techniques in 2004, rushing ''Guantanamo'' into production in time for the Republican National Convention in New York. When, a few weeks later, Archbishop Desmond Tutu agreed to play a small role in the play, and to lead discussions afterward, the prelate's appearance made front pages around the world and helped raise public awareness about military torture. ''People listen to talking heads all their lives,'' said Michael Ratner, a Culture Project board member and the president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents many of the Guantanamo detainees in their actions against the U.S. government. ''You can read op-eds, debate these things at universities for hours and a kid will still come up and deal with it as a purely intellectual matter. But get a torture victim in the room, get a playwright to make it into an emotional experience, and you tap into the craving we have to understand what other people go through. It's hard to get that kind of bang for the buck any other way.''
 Both ''The Exonerated'' and ''Guantanamo'' were successful in those terms, but neither turned out to be Culture Project's ''Chorus Line'' financially. Buchman said that much of the proceeds from ''The Exonerated'' went to the six exonerated individuals who were portrayed in the play; they eventually shared nearly $1 million. Blank and Jensen got far less (though they did marry), and Buchman nothing more than his $70,000 salary and the modest apartment on the fourth floor of the theater's building, where he lives like a shopkeeper above his shop. Culture Project ended up with about $50,000 profit, not nearly enough to secure its footing. Its annual budget -- $2 million last year, compared with $14 million for the Public -- remains small and sometimes wishful, based as it is on resources that aren't automatically renewable: 65 percent of income comes from ticket sales. Most of the rest comes from foundations, which have generally been interested in the issues being addressed, not in theater at large. In any case, the fiscal year recently ended was Culture Project's worst yet. Was there really no place in New York for what Buchman calls ''a human rights organization with an important theater agenda''?
 Exactly the time, then, to bet the future of that organization on its most ambitious initiative, one meant to be for Culture Project what free Shakespeare was for Papp at the Public: as Buchman puts it, both ''a signboard and reason to exist.''
 ''It's how we hope to achieve critical mass,'' he said. ''How we hope to become an institutional part of the annual New York terrain, like the TriBeCa Film Festival. And we hope it will make it easier for funders to support us going forward, because they will finally get to know what we do.''
 Maybe. But funders usually like groups that do one recognizable thing. Buchman's plans are literally all over the map. ''Allan wants to make the institution successful outside of New York,'' Colin Greer, the board president, told me recently, ''and I use the word 'institution' advisedly. It's the board's job to develop strategies to discipline Allan's imagination.'' For the most part, though, the board -- only three of whose nine members have theater experience -- has not so much disciplined Buchman's imagination as stoked it. This year the board approved Buchman's Tickets for the People initiative, which will give away 30,000 free seats to improve audience diversity during the coming season. And the Impact Festival is going forward with, as of late summer, only part of its financing in place.
 Buchman admits he's mostly making things up as he goes along. What's amazing is how many people he can persuade to join him out on his limb. Partly that's charisma; Jessica Blank calls him ''a Joe Papp for the 21st century with a yogi twist.'' Partly it's a longing some people feel to be part of at least a hope for change -- a hope that seems to have disappeared from the political system, let alone the arts. In any case, it's a charm that works better on some people than others. Staff members who want clarity and organization (and a nondingy office) quickly become frustrated and leave. Others, like Lauren Saffa, who finally got the title of producer after three years (naturally, Buchman dislikes titles), will literally do anything to stay. As we talked about programming and lines of responsibility, Saffa was happily minding an oven in which dirt was drying after a performance of ''Amajuba.'' To the true believers, Buchman is more of a father figure than a boss; Saffa calls him ''our crazy captain in a terrible storm.''
 But for traditional theater types, Buchman can seem ominous. What is he suggesting about other theaters when he says Culture Project only happens to be a theater? Are other theaters less noble? When he insists on doing work that's topical, what is he suggesting about classical work? That it's reactionary? Buchman has tried to make clear that he's not judging anyone else's choices; he's merely doing something different. But his radical commitment to content over form can nevertheless be disturbing to those who love the forms. It can seem anti-art. His ascetic style, too, can be read as a comment on the cushy emoluments other theater people expect as a reward for surviving in an impossible business. It's hard to imagine another producer who would abandon a Lotus Elan sports car on a Village street with its keys inside, just to rid himself of a worldly distraction. Admittedly, Buchman later regretted it and bought another, but that one was destroyed when a garage lift collapsed. He now has no car.
 If there is a feeling of renunciation in such acts, perhaps it's because Buchman, through the theater, is seeking his own kind of exoneration. His daughter's death is never far from the agenda -- an agenda he said he might be willing to die for. When he told me, after cracking open a fortune cookie, that he wants Culture Project to be not just a ''social-justice arts conservatory'' but also ''a compass, heading in a direction we're proud of as moral individuals,'' the political really had become personal. Or vice versa. ''Anyway,'' he added, chuckling, ''this work is the only chance I have of getting into heaven.'' Then he fiddled for a moment with his fortune, a quotation from John F. Kennedy that I'm pretty sure he had stage-managed: ''We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda; it is a form of truth.''

HEADLINE: Where It's At

BYLINE: By James Traub. 
James Traub is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
In New York City, Bohemia is determined by real estate: artists gather in raffish neighborhoods where studio space is cheap; the new outposts of culture and consumption they establish make the quarter desirable, thus raising the rents to prohibitive levels; the artists then decamp for the next shabby enclave. Starting in the 1960's, what New Yorkers meant by ''downtown'' shifted from Greenwich Village to SoHo to TriBeCa to the Lower East Side. But Manhattan is a narrow island, and the portion of it dense enough to sustain the feeling of self-enclosure that Bohemia requires is quite small. And so, starting in the 1980's, as rents skyrocketed, downtown began to migrate across the East River to Brooklyn.
By now, those portions of Brooklyn first colonized by fleeing artists have almost completed the cycle of embourgeoisement. Williamsburg, the heart of Brooklyn's gallery scene, has been thoroughly tamed by brasseries and boutiques; the kind of artists who aren't yet showing in those galleries are now moving to deepest, darkest Queens. But the middle-class householder geography of Queens offers too barren a soil for the rooting of a new Bohemia. Fortunately, there is lots more Brooklyn available. 
 There is, of course, something wishful, or perhaps wistful, about this perpetual hunt for the urban El Dorado. A place that can shift around so easily sounds less like a neighborhood than a mentality, or a species of nostalgia. In most of America, after all, ''downtown'' simply means ''the city'' -- the place where things are close enough to one another that you can walk. But in New York, where every square inch feels urban, downtown is a refuge from -- a repudiation of -- the conventionality of Midtown, and mid-everything. Downtown is a concept, and perhaps an archaic one. 
 The idea of Bohemia arose with the bourgeois city, against which it defined itself. In the Paris of ''La Boheme'' -- the Latin Quarter, circa 1830 -- the artist willingly courts starvation and disease as the price of freedom. The poet Rodolfo may be giddy as he shovels his manuscript into the fire to keep warm, but it's still the only source of fuel he has. Life was scarcely less desperate -- or less delightful -- in the downtown Manhattan of 1910, when the poet and propagandist John Reed, according to one biographer, ''ate in obscure foreign restaurants, talked with the girls who walked the street in 'Satan's Circus''' and caroused with Spanish longshoremen.
 Reed's latter-day descendants are threatened not by penury but by gentrification. How can Bohemia contend with the twin baby stroller? The other day, walking around Fort Greene, one of Brooklyn's current claimants to downtown cultural status, I stopped at an office building called 80 Arts. In the Museum of Contemporary African Diaspora Arts, or MoCADA, which occupies the ground floor, an exhibition of major black artists had just come down. I picked up some fliers from the counter. One, issued by a company called Downtown Babies, advertised ''Creative Play and Music Classes'' and ''Themed Birthday Parties'' to be held at MoCADA. Downtown Babies -- the end of Bohemia as we know it.
 80 Arts had been gutted and renovated as part of a ''cultural district'' established by a ''local development corporation'' organized around the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the cultural mega-institution of Fort Greene. Here was a planned Bohemia -- surely a contradiction in terms. Indeed, many locals, and local organizations, had protested the development (as they are now even more loudly protesting the Atlantic Yards, a nearby mega-project featuring skyscrapers and a basketball stadium to be designed by Frank Gehry). But MoCADA owes its presence in Fort Greene to the cultural district; should the project be fully implemented, a new theater and public library will be built as well.
 In short, downtown, or the idea of downtown, has become thoroughly implicated in the cultural and economic forces that it once resisted with every ounce of its scruffy integrity. The misfits and longhairs and revolutionaries deemed unassimilable by mainstream culture in John Reed's day are now considered ''edgy''; and edge, in turn, attracts sneaker stores and bistros and cultural entrepreneurs and even young couples with strollers. The derriere-garde keeps catching up with the avant-garde; the avant-garde falls prey to its own lurid appeal. If Rodolfo's artist pal Marcello were around today, his gallery opening would be catered by Absolut.
 And so the Bohemias of yesteryear have gone the way of Reed's Spanish longshoremen. But is that so bad? Take a walk in Fort Greene, an ethnically and economically mixed neighborhood with tree-lined blocks of fine brick homes. A block away from 80 Arts, beyond the town house that the painter David Salle has lavishly rehabilitated, lies the lime-green Habana Outpost, an eco-friendly cafe where mothers push downtown babies on swings amid racks of folkloric skirts, priced to sell. And then, moving up Fulton Street, once a commercial swamp, there's the wine store and the soul-food restaurant and the beloved Cake Man Raven. A few blocks away stands the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which has been irreproachably avant-garde since long before there was any money in it. Fort Greene feels less like Bohemia than what the scholar Joel Kotkin calls an ''elite urban enclave'' -- a place suited to the sophisticated tastes of the ''knowledge workers'' who now propel New York's economy.
 But the wheel of development that brought in those young cosmopolites, and priced out a number of the area's longtime, predominantly black residents, has not stopped turning: the Atlantic Yards project threatens to disrupt Fort Greene's delicate ecology once again. We want to preserve our precious and beloved utopias like paperweight worlds; but the city -- at least this city -- will not permit it.

HEADLINE: THE PORK-BELLIES APPROACH TO HOUSING

BYLINE: By Noam Scheiber. 
Noam Scheiber, a senior editor at The New Republic, is writing a biography of Maurice Greenberg, the former head of the insurance company A.I.G.

 BODY:
Six years ago, the story goes, a young Maryland couple named Tom and Lisa Hanlon faced an important, if common, financial decision. Lisa worked for a management consulting firm in Washington, D.C.; Tom was a science teacher at a suburban high school. The Hanlons had spent the previous two years renting an apartment in Bethesda, but Lisa was eager to start building home equity, and Tom reluctantly agreed to test the local market.
The Hanlons' dilemma was as follows: On the one hand, the couple had refined tastes -- topping their list of assets was a $34,000 BMW 328Ci coupe. Tom and Lisa knew their first home wouldn't be their dream home, but they also didn't want to take a step down from their upscale rental. On the other hand, with a combined income of just under $150,000, the Hanlons worried about shouldering more debt than they could handle. Eventually they settled on a nearby development called Grosvenor Park, whose elegant 2,300-square-foot model met Lisa's exacting standards. But the Hanlons' selection came to an uncomfortable $405,000 after upgrades like skylights and a premium lot. To further complicate the picture, home prices in the Washington area were spiraling upward. The Hanlons worried that they could be priced out of the market if they didn't buy right away. 
 As it happens, the Hanlons are a fictional couple, but their home-buying experience is emblematic of a modern financial conundrum and is, in fact, the subject of a case study at Harvard Business School. For the last several years, students in the school's Real Property course have read about the Hanlons' situation, then scrupulously assessed the couple's options. How much would the home have to appreciate in four years to make it a good investment, assuming a 20 percent down payment? What about 5 percent down? Should the Hanlons settle for a more modest house? Should they take their time looking? 
 These are the questions Will Goetzmann, the course's most recent instructor, put to students on this year's final exam. But Goetzmann's exam added a twist that previous classes had not seen. For that matter, neither had any real estate agent, home buyer or most of Goetzmann's Harvard colleagues. Goetzmann's exam posed the following hypothetical about the Hanlons: ''Suppose that housing futures for the D.C. area were available and traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Would it affect their buy-versus-rent decision?'' 
 Housing futures? 
 To the extent that the average person has a mental image of a futures market, it probably involves burly Midwesterners exchanging pork-belly orders in a frenzied trading pit. That picture isn't entirely off base. A futures contract is basically a commitment to buy or sell a product at some prearranged point in time for some prearranged price. So, for example, I might agree to sell you one ton of pork bellies for $2,000 next May. Why would I do that? Suppose I'm a hog farmer and you make bacon. The going rate for a ton of pork bellies today is, say, $1,950, but we both expect it to rise over the next year. Not wanting to push my luck, I might be happy to lock in a gain of $50 per ton. Similarly, you're probably happy to lock in a $50 price increase, given that prices could rise much higher. In a sense, the futures contract allows both of us to buy a little insurance. 
 There's another thing futures markets make possible: speculation. Suppose I'm an investor who thinks the price of pork bellies will rise significantly higher than $2,000 next year. Then maybe I agree to buy at $2,000 so that, when the time comes, I can turn around and sell for well above that amount. (This is known as ''going long.'') Conversely, if I think the price of pork bellies is going to plummet, I can agree to sell them for $2,000 a ton next year, reckoning that at some point before then, I'll be able to buy them much cheaper and pocket the difference. (This is known as ''going short.'')
 Up until about 30 years ago, most futures markets dealt in commodities -- agricultural products and precious metals -- which are susceptible to large price swings. But during the 1970's, futures began to proliferate in progressively more exotic areas, so that today investors can bet on everything from the value of certain economic statistics (like interest rates and inflation) to the weather (say, the likelihood of a snowy winter). As of last May, they can also bet on housing. In principle, the way housing futures work is similar to the way pork-belly futures do, except that investors aren't betting on the prices of individual houses per se but the value of a price index that's updated every month. If I think housing prices in Washington are likely to rise by 10 percent next year, I can place a bet that earns me a profit if I'm right. If I think housing prices are likely to fall, I can place that bet, too. 
 Which brings us back to Tom and Lisa, and Goetzmann's curious exam question. In an ideal world, a couple in the Hanlons' situation might choose not to buy a home for a few more years. Perhaps they can't actually afford to live in Grosvenor Park. Or maybe it isn't a place they plan on staying for very long. The problem is that in order to be able to trade up later on, such a couple would need to parlay the appreciation on their starter home into a down payment on the next one. Hence the urge to buy quickly. 
 The beauty of the futures market is that people like the Hanlons can achieve almost precisely the same outcome without buying the starter home. That is, they can simply take the money they had set aside for a down payment and invest it in housing futures. If Washington-area housing then appreciated, their investment would, too, and by close to the same amount. If housing prices stayed flat or declined, then they would be no worse off, since the same would likely be true of any house they bought. Unlike stocks, which can move down as housing prices move up, an investment in futures will more or less mimic buying a house. 
 In fact, once you start chewing over the benefits of housing futures, the world starts to look a little different. For example, you don't have to live in Washington to invest in the local housing market. You can be in some chronically unsexy market -- a place like Des Moines or Indianapolis -- that would have normally make you a bystander to the recent housing boom. Or conversely, suppose you're one of those Manhattanites who have seen the value of your brownstone triple in the last decade. You'll be retiring soon, and the last thing you need is to have the bottom fall out before you move to Florida. Now, like a risk-averse hog farmer, you can lock in your profits by betting on prices to fall. Or maybe you're a builder in California worried that a new development won't fill up. Suddenly you can hedge your risk and not worry about losing your shirt if the market turns. 
 Of course, if the point of housing futures was to help the odd homeowner in Iowa, or the developer in California, it would be a clever but unremarkable innovation. The real hope is that housing futures will one day make the entire boom-bust cycle of American real estate a thing of the past. But for that to happen, housing futures will have to evolve from a financial novelty into something approaching a household name. And that may be a lot to ask of a market that didn't exist until four months ago. 
 The two men who have made it possible to trade housing on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange -- Sam Masucci, a former Wall Street trader, and Robert Shiller, an eminent Yale economist -- have spent more than a decade laboring to open the residential real estate market to investors. In 2002, they started a small company called MacroMarkets with the aim of creating a futures market.
 For the market to succeed, it needs to become liquid -- which is to say it needs tens of thousands of traders, so that for every buyer there is a seller, and vice versa. Naturally, Shiller and Masucci believe there will be plenty of interest. On the so-called long side (that is, people who bet on home prices rising), they expect a brisk trade from large institutions like pension funds, which have never had a chance to invest in residential real estate before. On the opposite side of the equation, the so-called short side, MacroMarkets expects that any number of institutions, from developers to banks to mortgage lenders, will bet on home prices to sag. 
 Down the road, Masucci and Shiller also hope to entice individual homeowners into the market. That would most likely happen through financial intermediaries, like insurance companies or banks. Those worried about getting priced out of a particular metropolitan area -- the Tom and Lisa Hanlons of the world -- could essentially bet long, buying a product that would pay them a dividend when housing prices appreciated. Other products would pay a dividend when housing prices fell, essentially a short position. 
 A few weeks after housing futures started trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Masucci talked to representatives of major Wall Street banks, among them Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley, and reported that ''95 percent of them were excited'' about housing futures. Only two months later, MacroMarkets was in discussions with roughly a dozen large institutions, mostly investment banks, about licensing the right to sell a host of housing-based financial products. But new futures markets tend to start slowly -- the Mercantile Exchange's weather futures saw only 87 trades in 2000, the first full year, versus close to a million in 2005 -- and housing futures are no different. As of mid-August, only about 2,700 housing contracts had traded, and the market consisted mostly of speculators placing small bets. Fritz Siebel, a broker with Tradition Financial Services, which handles some of the housing-futures business, says the early traders tend to be sophisticated financial service industry professionals who are dabbling in the market.
 This trend could prove troubling. One benefit of futures markets is that they can foreshadow prices months in advance. The hope is that buyers and sellers armed with this information will avoid costly mistakes, like irrationally expecting ever-rising home values, which can lead to real estate bubbles. But a futures market where people make only rapid-fire trades can experience wild swings, potentially unsettling the housing market itself. 
 Still, speculators do serve an important function, and if the housing futures experiment is going to succeed, it will need as many of them as it will longer-term investors and hedgers, who exert a more calming influence. One of the early speculators is a Long Island accountant named Mark Grappel. Grappel says he read about the debut of the housing futures market, and by the second week of trading had begun to monitor the activity. 
 Right now investors can bet on the price of housing in 10 American cities, as well as on a composite index that combines all 10 into a single number. After selecting a city, the next step is to decide on the length of the contract you would like to trade -- 3, 6, 9 or 12 months. Grappel owns a condominium in Fort Lauderdale and has several friends who live in South Florida. He was particularly interested in the Miami market -- in fact, he was convinced it was heading for a fall. So, on June 8, he placed a bet that the Miami index would show a decline by the time his contract came up in November. Over the next two weeks, pessimism about Miami real estate weighed on the city's November contract, putting Grappel up $12,500. But Grappel was nervous. A new reading of the index was due out the following day. It would be the latest measurement of actual prices in Miami, and he wasn't sure what it would show -- prices can rise in a given month even if the long-term trend is down -- let alone how the thinly traded market would react. He decided to liquidate the position and take his profit.
 Grappel may sound like a riverboat gambler, but he illustrates the promise of housing futures. Grappel says he reads widely about Miami real estate -- consulting blogs, local publications, even local data on prices and inventories. He occupies his Fort Lauderdale condo several times a year, and when he's not around, friends serve as his eyes and ears. (Recently a friend in Palm Beach County told Grappel that a nearby house went on the market last year for $890,000 and that the owners rejected an early bid of $830,000; six months later the friend heard the best they could do was $650,000.) Which is to say, when Grappel makes a bet about the direction of housing prices, it's based on an aggregation of a lot of valuable but otherwise diffuse information. Now consider that a fully liquid market would bring together thousands of Mark Grappels -- people with intimate knowledge of a local market and a financial incentive to bet wisely -- and you begin to understand how a futures market could one day forecast price movements with considerable precision. 
 In fact, even though the market is still in its infancy, it has already begun to throw off valuable information. Over the last several weeks, Siebel reports, prices for the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month contracts for most cities have begun to trace out discernible curves, known as forward curves, laying out a plausible path for the direction of home prices over the next year. (As of early August, San Francisco typically had the most pronounced downward curve; Denver was more or less flat. The rest of the cities -- like New York and Washington -- tended to lie somewhere in between.) Benson Durham, a research economist at the Federal Reserve Board, has begun tracking the futures to get a handle on the housing market. In a recent paper, Durham notes that following the futures market has become, in terms of reliability, at least as useful as another common method: analyzing the stock prices of companies in the homebuilding sector. 
 The germ of the idea for housing futures dates back to the late 1980's, when Shiller first began collaborating with a Wellesley economist named Karl Case. Case had pioneered an unusually precise method of measuring home prices by comparing back-to-back sales of the same house. Over the next few years, he and Shiller used this data to demonstrate that contrary to popular opinion, home ownership could be a risky proposition, and that home prices could move down for several years at a time, at least in inflation-adjusted terms. (That real estate began to hemorrhage value in several major cities during the early 90's didn't hurt their credibility.) Shiller would later seal his reputation with the book ''Irrational Exuberance,'' which anticipated this decade's stock-market correction. But at the time, he was already preoccupied with the subject of financial risk. Wrestling with ways to alleviate the risk of homeownership naturally led him to consider a futures market. 
 In 1991, Case, Shiller and a former student of Shiller's named Allan Weiss founded a company whose primary objective was to create a futures market in housing. Case Shiller Weiss soon signed an agreement with the Chicago Board of Trade to explore the possibility. But board officials expressed concern about insufficient demand on the long side of the equation and eventually abandoned the idea. By that point, however, Case Shiller Weiss had already been producing housing price data for metropolitan areas all over the country. Selling the so-called Case-Shiller indexes became a multimillion-dollar business.
 Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Shiller and his partners, a small team at Merrill Lynch was kicking around some of the same housing market issues Shiller had identified a few years earlier. Except that they approached the problem from the perspective of Wall Street investors eager to bear some of the risks that average homeowners didn't want (in exchange for some of the rewards, of course). The idea was that Merrill would pay homeowners a small premium every year in exchange for a share of the profits on the eventual sale of their home. Merrill would then turn around and sell off to investors all the claims it had accumulated. To make the project work, the Merrill group realized that it needed ultrafine data on home prices. That's when one of the Merrill traders, Sam Masucci, struck up a relationship with Case Shiller Weiss.
 By 2002, the financial services giant Fiserv had bought Case Shiller Weiss. But Shiller retained the rights to develop financial products based on the company's indexes. Masucci had left Merrill and was contemplating his next move when Shiller suggested that the two give housing futures another shot. The idea of developing housing futures appealed to the real estate man in Masucci. He had worked for his father's homebuilding company during the bear market of the 1980's and figured that developers in those days would have jumped at the chance to hedge their projects. In any case, Masucci had never gotten over his impulse to plant a flag in what, at over $20 trillion, is the economy's largest unexploited asset. MacroMarkets was born.
 This time the futures exchanges were more receptive. In the more than a decade since the Chicago Board of Trade passed on the original proposal, real estate had moved to the front of the country's consciousness. And no one was more eager to highlight this than MacroMarkets. In a PowerPoint presentation that Terry Loebs, one of the company's executives, delivers to potential futures investors, he includes a slide cataloging the number of television shows devoted to real estate. ''There's actually one show called 'Flip This House,' and another show called 'Flip That House,''' Loebs marvels. In mid-2004, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange agreed to partner with Shiller and Masucci and create the country's first housing futures exchange. MacroMarkets would get a tiny cut of every trade.
 Some economists question whether housing futures are really so critical, at least for individuals. Todd Sinai of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School points out that homeownership serves two functions: it provides a flow of services -- that is, a roof over your head -- and it serves as an investment, generating a return on your savings. True, he says, a steep drop in housing prices would hurt the value of your investment. But as long as you stay in the same city, this drop would be more or less offset by the fact that housing, over all, had just become cheaper. A similar logic applies to price increases. As the Harvard economist Edward L. Glaeser notes, ''Owning a house is itself a hedge'' against rising home prices. Though the skeptics concede that futures-based products might attract the occasional small-time customer, they question the scale of the appeal. 
 Even if the product never catches on with individual investors, the futures market could still thrive on business from bigger players, like mortgage lenders and developers. But here, too, there are potential snags. Perhaps the biggest is that housing isn't a commodity the way oil or soybeans are. The price of a house in one neighborhood can fall while the same house in another neighborhood appreciates, to say nothing of the next town over. Because the Mercantile Exchange futures only trade at the metropolitan level, there's no way to deal with these narrower fluctuations. When pressed on this, Shiller and Masucci observed that metro-level price changes do explain roughly half the variation in price for a typical house. Whether that's good enough for hedging purposes remains to be seen. 
 In the end, the way you feel about futures may come down to how much you worry about housing market bubbles. Most economists scream ''bubble'' when buyers bid up prices simply because they expect prices to rise further, not because those increases are justified by supply and demand. Unlike a run-of-the-mill price drop, the popping of a bubble can be a brutally painful affair, creating a domino effect of mortgage defaults, bankruptcies, tight credit and, ultimately, a regionwide recession. 
 Economists like Sinai and Chris Mayer of Columbia concede that housing prices might look inflated in many parts of the country. But, they argue, the cost of housing in cities like Boston and San Francisco is more or less in line with those cities' historical patterns once you factor in today's low interest rates. ''People in San Francisco have legitimate reasons to believe prices will grow faster than people in the Midwest do, because they have for the last 60 years,'' Mayer says. 
 On the other hand, Shiller's research suggests that the rise in home prices should basically track inflation, and that the aggressive buying of real estate is simply the product of our most recent cultural obsession -- supercharged by the Internet, cable television and bloggers. This may sound extreme, but even such leading lights as Alan Greenspan are beginning to agree. At a speech before the Economic Club of New York in 2005, Greenspan allowed that there may well be a lot of local real estate bubbles, even if there is no national bubble. 
 If you're someone who shares this view, it's not hard to appreciate the wisdom of hedging your home. One such person is an economist named Dean Baker, the co-director of a liberal Washington policy institute called the Center for Economic and Policy Research. As early as 2002, Baker began cranking out memo after memo warning that the country was flirting with a housing bubble. Then, in 2004, Baker took his own advice and sold his condominium in Washington's trendy Adams Morgan neighborhood. Baker and his wife had purchased the condo for $160,000 in 1997 and had seen its value almost triple. ''I would have felt like a fool sitting on it,'' he says, though he now figures he could have made another $10,000 or $20,000 by waiting another year. (Prices have since moderated.) These days the couple lives in a rented apartment only a few blocks from the old place. Occasionally, he gets wistful. I asked Baker if he would have stayed in the apartment and hedged the risk had the option been available. His response: ''We would have done it, absolutely.'' 
 If the ultimate goal of a housing futures market is to dampen the boom-and-bust cycle of the real estate market, then the most important players may not be individual home buyers but developers, home builders and banks. Which is to say, not people who buy homes but the people in the business of supplying them. The big problem with real estate, after all, is that it takes so long for supply to respond to rising prices. Given the lag in data, it's hard to know if prices have changed until months after the fact. It then takes several more months to complete construction on a new development -- years when you factor in the time it takes to purchase land and nail down a permit. By the time a developer is ready to sell, the housing market may have cooled. That several-hundred-unit development -- not to mention all the houses and condos that rivals are building -- may end up flooding the market. 
 As it happens, this is a problem that bedeviled farmers for decades. Prior to the creation of futures markets, the market for hogs was prone to disastrous boom-bust cycles. When hog prices were high, farmers would breed more hogs. But this led to a massive oversupply by the time the hogs were fattened up and taken to market, at which point prices would collapse. It wasn't until the introduction of pork-belly futures in the early 1960's that the wild swings of the economic hog cycle largely disappeared. After that, a hog farmer could consult the market about where prices were most likely headed when he was actually ready to sell. If the futures price was high, he could lock in that price and step up production. If the futures price was low, he could slow production to a trickle and bide his time. The market stabilized because everyone could look ahead and plan production accordingly. 
 Similarly, in the real estate market, developers may soon be consulting futures prices when planning upcoming projects. If the price is high, a developer could move ahead while shorting the futures market as a kind of insurance policy. If the price is low, he might put a few projects on hold. 
 At least one large homebuilder has already entered the futures market. In mid-June, to test how amenable others might be to this arrangement, I met with Lou Minicucci, who runs Northpoint Realty Development with his son-in-law, Eric Loth, and another longtime partner. Northpoint builds middle- and upper-middle-class homes in the Boston suburb of North Andover, about a 30-minute drive from downtown. The company also has a Florida branch that handles projects in Palm Beach County and Fort Lauderdale. 
 I met Minicucci and Loth in a wood-paneled conference room at the company's North Andover headquarters. Around the room's periphery were 8 or 10 scale drawings of developments the company had either recently completed or was in the middle of building. One red-hued rendering depicted a development in downtown Andover, about a mile from the prep school that produced George W. Bush and his father. Loth, a trim blond man with a slight Boston accent, sighed that it took Northpoint six years just to win permits for the site. Another picture showed a 269-unit development abutting a state forest off nearby Route 114. The development still has about 60 unsold units, roughly $19 million worth of housing. But Minicucci, barrel-chested and thick-fingered, pointed out that the project has proceeded in phases. If demand dries up, Northpoint can always put the final phase on hold. 
 When it comes to South Florida, on the other hand, the anxiety is somewhat more palpable. Unlike in Boston, many of the developments in Florida are high-rise buildings that can't be phased in. ''Once you start, you build the whole thing,'' Loth said. And whereas the Boston area's convoluted permitting process tends to scare off large national builders -- who other than a local wants to spend six years haggling with the Andover planning board? -- many parts of South Florida have comparatively few constraints, meaning that the supply of housing can expand seemingly without limit. Even Mayer and Sinai, the bubble skeptics, think the local market might be overvalued.
 On the wall as you enter the Northpoint conference room is a 3-by-4-foot computer-generated drawing of a 21-story tower. This is Strada, a development of about 100 one- and two-bedroom condos three blocks from the major thoroughfare connecting downtown Fort Lauderdale to the Atlantic Ocean. Strada is now almost completely sold out, even though it's still under construction. But across the street, Northpoint has planned a similar, 24-story high-rise building, on which it has yet to break ground. Up until about 2005, Loth says, prices in South Florida moved up almost week to week. But over the last year, ''things have cooled off from the hyperkinetic pace,'' he says, adding, ''Things are sitting a little longer.'' The concern is that overbuilding in the area could begin to drag down prices. 
 Loth is a former bond trader with Charles Schwab in Denver. He recently read about the housing futures market and has suggested that Northpoint hedge its second development. Minicucci admitted that he didn't fully understand the concept yet but listened intently as Loth riffed on the possibilities: What if you had a development with a $10 million projected profit? Is there some amount you would be willing to give up to ensure that the profit would be there in five years? 
 ''Does it become an expense line item?'' Minicucci chimed in, warming to the idea. ''Like any other kind of insurance?'' But then Loth interjected, briefly stifling the chatter, ''Or if you're so uncertain about the project that you have to hedge it, do you still go ahead and do it?'' If the market in housing futures causes builders to ask more of these questions, that may be the best outcome of all.

HEADLINE: MANHATTAN ON THE MOSKVA 

BYLINE: By Brett Forrest. 
Brett Forrest lives in Moscow and has written for Vanity Fair, Fortune and ESPN magazine.

 BODY:
Sergei Polonsky was short 900 tons of concrete, and he wasn't interested in excuses. It was a sweaty July morning at a construction site just outside central Moscow, and several contractors were arguing over whom to blame. The air-conditioned office overlooked hard-hatted workers scrambling through the dust several stories below, cranes swinging into position high above their heads.
A Russian real estate developer, Polonsky is building Moscow's first genuine modern skyscraper, the Federation Tower. When it reaches its full height, perhaps as early as next year, and at a cost of some $740 million, the tower will be the tallest building in Europe. It forms the centerpiece of Moscow City, a sprawling financial district that will inject a new modern character into this ancient, frenetic city.
 From across the meeting table, Polonsky focused on the deputy director of his company's concrete division, a middle-aged man with white hair and reading glasses that hung off the tip of his nose. The entire inner structure of the Federation Tower is composed of concrete, so the shortfall presented no small jam. ''You have three days to solve this problem,'' Polonsky told him, ''or you can submit your resignation.'' 
 Polonsky is 6-foot-6 and has a head of curly sandy hair that assumes various odd shapes depending on the humidity. His smooth rounded face makes him seem approachable. But in this notoriously tough town, no one achieves Polonsky's success by being everybody's best friend, least of all someone who is, like him, just 33. 
 Following the meeting with the contractors, Polonsky and Artur Aleksandrov, the project's perpetually hassled chief of construction, grabbed their hard hats and headed out for an inspection walk of the looming tower, already 50 stories high. The Federation Tower is not the only building making visible progress around Moscow City. Several office complexes rise into the air in various states of completion in what many Russians are calling the Moscow Manhattan. It is a sweeping space -- 250 riverside acres that will consist of 18 buildings and 43 million square feet of new real estate from 13 developers. At a projected cost of $10 billion to $12 billion, Moscow City is promoted by its developers as the largest investment and construction project in Europe. 
 The Federation Tower is the showpiece. It will actually be two towers, the taller one with 93 floors and a height of 1,161 feet, and the other with 63 floors. A 1,470-foot spire will rise between the monoliths, with glass elevators running up its core, offering a panoramic view and entry into the buildings. The towers will have 4.5 million square feet of high-end office space, luxury apartments, shops, restaurants and a 44-story Grand Hyatt hotel. The overall impression of the architect's rendering of these slightly bowed, glass-sheathed towers and central mast is that of a mammoth sailboat rising above the Moskva River. A blue banner hugging one side of the smaller tower reads, ''This is only the beginning.'' 
 As Russia regains its economic and political clout, Polonsky and other young developers are building architectural icons on an enormous scale, visible symbols of the nation's new wealth. The Russian state is now flush with cash. High prices for the country's largely renationalized natural resources -- oil, gas and metals, especially -- and President Vladimir V. Putin's efforts to tighten the screws on government agencies have given investors, foreign and domestic alike, reason to believe that the risk of doing business here has greatly diminished. Last year, Moscow real estate values soared, the Russian stock market grew by 90 percent and Standard & Poor's upgraded its rating on Russia (its evaluation of the viability of doing business in the country). Foreign investment in Moscow grew 67 percent in 2005 from the previous year, to $25 billion. And while there are many critics of the Kremlin's aggressive control of big business, Putin has created a measure of economic stability. And that is what investors want.
 City leaders first began discussing the Moscow City concept in the 1980's. The idea was to create a commercial district along the lines of La Defense in Paris or Lower Manhattan in New York. Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov and his deputies fixed on a site on the Moskva River embankment, two and a half miles from the Kremlin. There were 22 factories and warehouses at that location, along with several dilapidated apartment buildings, a typical Moscow hodgepodge. The city demolished the structures and began soliciting investment. Then came the country's economic crisis in the summer of 1998, which stalled development but didn't keep the mayor's office from campaigning for the new business district. ''We spent 10 years marketing Moscow City,'' says Iosif Ordzhonikidze, the deputy mayor for foreign affairs and economic relations. ''We were doing it when the stores had nothing in them.'' 
 Now Moscow is booming. It's the biggest city in Europe, with more than 10 million people, and as the cultural and financial capital of the Continent's eastern half, it is striving to live up to its status. Cranes twist across the skyline, great dust clouds billow from countless digs: roughly 80 million square feet of real estate will be built this year. But Moscow's transformation goes beyond the mere number of structures. It is the nature of these new developments that matters most, as modernization and image enhancement have become just as important to the civic leaders as the supply of basic services. 
 The Kremlin's towers and palaces and the gargantuan structures of Stalin's era have long symbolized Moscow, distinct emblems of czarist and Communist authority. The skyscrapers now going up, however, would fit into the urban plan of any Western capital. And in this way, the Moscow planners and developers are trying to prove to the rest of the world -- and to Russians themselves -- that this country can compete with anyone.
 One workday evening, Polonsky summoned a dozen of the top managers of Mirax, his company, to one of his residences, a 16th-floor penthouse in the Golden Keys high-rise. A medieval warrior, it seemed, had handled the furnishings. A couple of crossbows, nicked and well used, dangled from the ceiling beams. In one corner stood a dummy dressed in samurai armor. In the bedroom was a king-size mattress attached to motorized chains and capable of traveling 10 feet into the air. A boa constrictor, as swollen as a fire hose, was coiled in a terrarium, his split tongue testing the air. 
 Polonsky had invited his managers over to play Mafia, a parlor game of bluff and strategy. Once everyone was seated around a long wooden table, Polonsky and two others were secretly designated as a criminal enterprise that then went about eliminating the other players. Polonsky regards this exercise, involving blindfolds, accusations and deception, as a kind of instructive corporate bonding. Learning to think like a member of an organized crime syndicate, apparently, can have its advantages.
 Polonsky frequently plays Mafia into the early morning hours. But on this evening, he concluded the session well before midnight, with an admonition that suggested he had some insight into the insidiousness of both work and play. ''You must remember, it's just a game,'' he told his employees. ''You shouldn't remember, 'Oh, I played with this guy and he kicked me out.' It's just a game.'' 
 Having sent his managers home, Polonsky made his way out to the balcony where he lighted a cigarillo and looked out over Moscow's great spread. Polonsky himself is a transplant. He was raised in St. Petersburg, where his mother worked in a post office and his father was a professional student, collecting one degree after another. Polonsky entered the armed forces after high school, joining an airborne division and serving in the Caucasus, an experience that he says ''forged'' him. ''In the army there is no such thing as no,'' he offers as an explanation of what he gained from the experience. Regarding other aspects of his military career, he chose to say very little. 
 Polonsky returned to St. Petersburg in 1994 after leaving the army, and, with a friend, Artur Kirilenko, started a business finishing apartments in public and private buildings. When hard times struck and building owners ran into money trouble, they began paying Polonsky and Kirilenko in apartments instead of cash. The turning point for the partners came when they took possession of an entire building, not just individual apartments. The structure was unfinished, and when Polonsky and Kirilenko added a few floors and sold the building, they had unwittingly become builders. It was one small step to becoming developers. 
 The two friends were like many people who profited in the early post-Soviet days: businessmen who appeared out of nowhere, able to adapt in a time of upheaval, capitalizing on circumstance. The 1998 financial crisis that swept the country was devastating to most but proved a boon to Polonsky and Kirilenko. Their company paid for construction costs in rubles, then turned around and sold apartments and offices to those who had dollars. With the ruble in free fall, they profited in the lag time between construction and sale. Dollars in hand, Polonsky and Kirilenko had placed themselves on the right side of the inflation catastrophe, and they quickly became wealthy. 
 Polonsky set about enjoying himself, indulging his taste for vigorous activity: hunting, parasailing, bungee-jumping, snowboarding, skiing, mountain biking, snowmobiling, off-road racing, piloting aircraft, even driving tanks and firing A-K 47's into the sky. This was all a prelude to his ultimate adventure. Polonsky spent several months in Star City, the headquarters of Russia's space program, where he trained to become a space tourist, just the third ever. He arranged to pay $8 million, but, Polonsky says, when engineers designed his spacesuit, they determined that he was too tall -- that his legs, jammed against a control panel, were sure to break on landing. The space agency returned all but $500,000 of his money, which he says was well spent, the disappointment of rejection outweighed by the thrill of belonging to the program. ''If you go to Star City, it's impossible not to want to do it,'' he says. He notes, with some pride, that the cosmonauts who trained with him phoned him from the International Space Station with New Year's salutations. 
 During all of this time, Polonsky's company was growing into one of the largest developers in St. Petersburg, eventually building Petrovsky Fort, a 540,000-square-foot complex that became the standard for business centers in the former capital. Polonsky opened an office in Moscow in 2000, after graduating from St. Petersburg State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering. Two years later Mayor Luzkhov appointed him as an adviser. He was not yet 30. 
 Such a quick rise to prominence in a place where cozy government relations have been a prerequisite to getting anything done has led people to assume that Polonsky is just another beneficiary of the crony system. But he would have you believe his success stems purely from his ability and willingness to be held accountable, from being, in other words, a professional, where professionals can be hard to find. ''I arrived in Moscow six years ago and I knew nobody,'' he says. ''In my first three months here I had 200 meetings, and I was surprised how unprofessional people were. Builders thought they were economists and vice versa.'' 
 No matter what he says, however, Polonsky can't shake speculation of high-level associations and sweetheart deals. ''There are all sorts of legends,'' he says. ''I'm the illegitimate son of Valentina Matvienko,'' the governor of St. Petersburg. ''Or I studied in the same university as Putin.''
 Putin, who is also from St. Petersburg, has surrounded himself with advisers who, like Polonsky, are from his hometown. Over Polonsky's desk hangs a lovingly rendered painting of Putin, the president's arm lazing over the back of his chair, a teasing grin on his face. Dangling idly in Putin's right hand is a pen, with which he may or may not ink his approval. When Putin traveled to China in March, Polonsky went along with him. 
 But Putin also favors the talented and accomplished, and Polonsky has a gift for attracting investment, making it stick and seeing a project to completion. In 2000, Mirax started on the one-million-square-foot Corona apartment complex in western Moscow; the company is now building 42 million square feet in the city. Mirax has become an emblem not just of Moscow's rapid development, but also of how the style of building there is changing. ''Polonsky and the Federation Tower are like a brand for us,'' says Nikolai Koshman, president of the Association of the Builders of Russia.
 In 2003, Polonsky won the bidding to build a tower on a particular parcel of Moscow City. He welcomed the publicity that went along with it, as well as the attention generated by his bid to travel in space. He is a frequent topic of discussion in the local press, sometimes drawing notice with ill-advised public statements. During one press conference, Polonsky claimed that the Federation Tower was designed to be impervious to terrorist attack by airplane. ''Regardless of how many planes hit it,'' he said, ''it won't fall down.'' Several of the project's engineers looked on in shock, aware of no such design. Nor did it hurt Polonsky's public profile that he was at one time palling around with Anastasia Volochkova, a ballerina with the Bolshoi Ballet. Polonsky has since married Natalya Stepanova, the president of a construction consulting company. But he has not given up his relationship with the limelight. ''He can attract attention to himself,'' Koshman says. ''Other developers are more modest.''
 In Moscow, a professional can find it rough going, surrounded on all sides by insularity, ineptitude, corruption and the persistent after effects of a command economy. ''It's very difficult to find suppliers who will sell goods to you,'' says Zhao Xiangqian, an executive manager with the China State Construction and Engineering Company, which Mirax hired to build the concrete structure of the Federation Tower. ''And they always want to change something at the last minute.'' (Polonsky did eventually get his concrete, but construction was delayed for several days.) 
 For Polonsky, these details are the least of his worries. The main difficulty in building the Federation Tower is that such a building has never been attempted in Moscow. The complexity and height of this structure bring into sharp relief the inadequacies of the current system. For one thing, there is no comprehensive building code in Russia that dictates how the tower should be built. Moreover, Mirax has never attempted a structure on this scale. ''We have mass experience building 35-floor buildings,'' says Aleksandrov, the chief of construction. ''But 90 floors is a totally different task.'' As a precautionary measure, Aleksandrov says, Mirax chose to erect the smaller tower first, to ''test our technology.'' Europe's tallest building, it turns out, is also Europe's tallest training exercise. 
 The Federation Tower started out on a shaky financial footing as well. When Polonsky broke ground, he had no outside financing for the skyscrapers. In Manhattan, for example, it is customary to secure 80 percent or more of the financing on a building before construction begins. ''In Moscow, you won't find a single investor who will give you money without seeing the building,'' Aleksandrov says. ''Not everyone has the ability to build in Moscow. Moscow can be very capricious.'' Polonsky began the project with his and Mirax's own money -- how much he will not disclose. As progress on the Federation Tower has become visible, investment has poured in. The major share of financing has come from Vneshtorgbank, the country's second-largest bank, which has extended a $250 million line of credit. The Kremlin owns 99.9 percent of Vneshtorgbank, meaning that the Russian government serves as the Federation Tower's primary financial sponsor. 
 Since there is very limited skyscraper-construction expertise in Russia, Polonsky hired the Chinese contractors as well as Turner International, a firm based in New York. Turner and the Chinese firm have worked together on several high-profile tall buildings, and on the Federation Tower they are essentially acting as their own regulators, making decisions as they go along. 
 This is how things work in Russia, where laws are often variably applied and where the only real rule for getting things done -- at least on this scale -- is to have government support. ''Much of what you see here is because of Polonsky's relationship with the Kremlin and the city government,'' says Thomas J. McCool, Turner's European manager, who works out of an office on the Federation Tower site. ''It's very Russian.'' 
 The new Russia is, in some ways, not so different from the old. The Soviets tore down thousands of buildings in Moscow, replacing them with monuments to their own way of thinking. A similar situation revisits the city now, as government authorities do as they please, obliterating any number of historical structures in the pursuit of unfettered development. ''We have too much money in Moscow,'' says Marina Khrustaleva, an architectural historian who is the chairwoman of the Moscow Architecture Preservation Society. She says that the city is losing as many as 300 historical buildings a year. ''Some people say it is too late,'' she says, that ''Moscow is already lost.'' While Khrustaleva does not object to Moscow's overall modernization, she does view Polonsky's towers as one more example of the unchecked loss of the city's traditional character. ''It's so simple,'' she says of the structure. ''It has no idea. This is speculative architecture.'' 
 The architects of the Federation Tower, Sergei Tchoban and Peter Schweger, are known for building solid, respectable buildings in Germany, where they are based. ''They're not superstars, but they have a good reputation,'' says David Sarkisyan, the director of Moscow's Shchusev State Museum of Architecture. ''They're not trying to jump out of their trousers, as we like to say, but they do stylish things.'' The tower is their opportunity for a grand showcase.
 Polonsky, too, is chasing big aspirations with this building. He is hesitant to discuss his vision of Moscow's future, if indeed he has one. Talk is still cheap in Russia, if not in fact hazardous, and Polonsky won't engage in philosophical testimonials. Still, he is clearly after something more, as he could earn a more certain profit by continuing to build the 35-story apartment blocks that have made him wealthy. ''I have never had such a powerful, creative client,'' says Tchoban, who was born and educated in St. Petersburg. ''Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of clients don't like to create anything new.'' 
 Trying to do something new, and especially to be the first one to reach a new marketplace can rattle the nerves. You might arrive too soon, before the market is ready to receive you. Right now, Polonsky has only a few confirmed commercial tenants, including Grand Hyatt and Vneshtorgbank, for the Federation Tower. The narrow distribution of Russia's wealth, as well as the sheer volume of commercial and residential space now under construction, raises doubts about how much demand there will be for high-price real estate. And that is Polonsky's biggest gamble. He doesn't know yet if he has hit the moment exactly, or whether he has judged incorrectly, and whether the tower will be an empty monument, or a flourishing emblem of a thriving country. 
 Polonsky, relaxed on his balcony over-looking the city, said that he had difficulty imagining how it had all come to pass, how he had gone from outfitting interiors to building Russia's first world-class skyscraper. ''Your eyes are afraid of a job, but your hands do it,'' he said. ''The propulsive power is the lack of knowledge. If I had known how difficult it would be, I never would have opened my own office.'' 
 He stubbed out his cigarillo and walked inside, having tired of discussing business. Polonsky preferred to talk about the thrill of Star City, and he played a DVD montage of his cosmonaut training sessions to illustrate the point. An anti-gravity plane takes him for a whirl. A centrifuge whips around, pushing him through eight G's. He climbs into a spacesuit and tinkers on a capsule that was submerged in a large swimming pool. 
 Then there is a shot from the launching pad. A handful of military brass and aerospace engineers gather around, as three cosmonauts prepare for the journey to the International Space Station. The cosmonauts climb the stairs into their capsule, a dense early-morning mist hanging thick and lighted by dreamy yellow lamps. The video then cuts to a shot of the rocket punching into space. The rocket grows smaller and smaller as it reaches into pure black. Polonsky watched, unable to turn away.

HEADLINE: ALL THIS USELESS BEAUTY

BYLINE: By Randall Patterson. 
Randall Patterson, who lives in Asheville, N.C., has written for The New York Times Magazine, New York and Mother Jones.

 BODY:
The road to paradise is lined with real estate companies and grading contractors, and if you don't get stuck behind a cement truck, you can get there from Asheville, N.C., in about an hour and a half. Highway 64 twists and climbs through the Nantahala National Forest, the temperature dropping about five degrees with every thousand feet. By the time you reach the Highlands Plateau, and the town of Cashiers, summer is about 15 degrees cooler. Six rivers flow from here, with hundreds of waterfalls, and people come to this place from all over the South to spend their summers. Since Cashiers is located in the middle of 800,000 acres of protected national forest, there's limited space to put them. William McKee, a real estate broker, explained how a beautiful environment becomes an economic one -- ''simple supply and demand.'' 
Most of the old family estates, including his, have been converted into gated golf communities, but about two miles east of town, he said, there's a canyon that has been owned by the Jennings family for more than a hundred years. He spoke of it with longing: one of the few box canyons in the eastern United States, a green mountain rising along one side, and on the other, a wall of ''huge rock cliffs not unlike Yosemite.'' Between them lie hundreds of acres of woods and streams -- all this right off Highway 64. ''From a marketing perspective,'' McKee said, ''it's just obviously a one-of-a-kind jewel.''
 I turned into the driveway, came over the rise and looked out over a rolling valley and what appeared to be an ancient, untouched Shangri-La. McKee had not exaggerated the grandeur at all. Lonesome Valley -- that was the name -- was owned by three siblings, who spoke of the land as of themselves. Sally Eason, a tall, equine redhead, 54 years old now, says she still imagines herself as that kid who grew up among the wet pine needles, the sound of katydids, frogs and whippoorwills. ''Emotionally,'' she says, ''Lonesome Valley is my soul.''
 Binford Sievers -- shorter, younger, hobbling on a cane -- describes it as ''this God-given mystical place,'' this ''center of the universe.'' She says, ''I love it as much as I do my children.''
 And then there is Richard Jennings III -- Dickie, as he is known -- who is stout and gentle and concealed behind a moustache. The land speaks most eloquently for itself, he says, but probably means more to him than it does to ''those two.'' The problem was, it was also worth a lot on the open market. Lonesome Valley was like the farm animal they loved as a pet. It was time for the slaughter but they didn't want to kill it.
 Dickie and his sisters agreed that a subdivision was the way to go. Binford, especially, admired the difficulty of the task. ''It's easy to safeguard the land when you don't do anything with it,'' she says, ''when you just pass it down and say, 'Here you go.''' What Dickie was trying to do -- preserve Lonesome Valley while developing it -- was another feat altogether.
 Lonesome Valley was the last valley, the end of a vast kingdom. Before the Jenningses came to the Highlands Plateau, Dickie's father has been told, ''the woods were so dark you couldn't read in them.'' Dickie's great-grandfather, a Pittsburgh oilman, showed up around 1895 with a few industrialist friends, and they bought the land for next to nothing, brought in the railroad and began hauling out the timber. E.H. Jennings owned more than 30,000 acres at one point, but most was sold for development. Ten thousand he left for his son -- Richard the First, if you will -- and his siblings, who in turn logged the land and sold it until only 600 acres remained, the last, best 600, which fell into the hands of Richard the Second, who did not easily let them go.
 Pa is a white-haired, square-jawed old statue of a man now. His children describe him as a maverick, a pioneer, and he seems to like that. ''I was born into relative comfort,'' he explains. ''The world was waiting in the industrial sector for me, and I elected to go 180 degrees in the opposite direction. A lot of people thought I was crazy. I didn't care.'' He grew up in a posh suburb of Pittsburgh and might have raised his own children there if, as a boy, he had not ventured each summer into these woods. Richard the Second rode his horse, hunted and fished -- developed, he says, ''a romantic streak.'' Also, he saw lumber companies transform the forests into ''a barren desert, and I hated that because I loved to be in them.'' By the time he was of age, he had decided he didn't want ''a handout from the country club'' and ''damn well didn't want to go back to that atmosphere of soot and industry and boardrooms and bookkeeping.'' In 1947, he quit Yale and set off for the woods ''to do something different, that hadn't been done.'' 
 Frances, the daughter of a stockbroker, ran into him four years later, loitering at a Junior League party in Asheville. She noticed he was wearing a white dinner jacket in February; the man obviously ''doesn't give a damn what anyone thinks of him,'' she concluded. Deeply attracted, she soon married him.
 As details of their family history come out, it appears that life in Lonesome Valley was not such an idyll after all. When Richard the Second took his bride home, she found his pioneer dream in full swing. His castle was little more than a cabin, what Binford calls ''the plainest house on earth.'' Three children arrived within four years, and Pa quickly let them know where they were -- that he had not come to the woods to indulge himself or, in any way, them. Lonesome Valley, in fact, was about 180 degrees from that sort of thing.
 ''Daddy said basically that privileged children are wrought with difficulty their entire lives,'' Binford remembers. ''And his opinion was that if a person was handed life on a silver platter, they have no backbone or character or, in some cases, a raison d'etre. And people who work for a living and earn what they own have a joie de vivre.''
 The dream he developed, he says, was to work for a living and ''not ravage the forest as I do it and not louse up the beautiful streams.'' The valley is situated in a temperate rain forest, and because there was no developed land nearby, it could rain and rain without sullying the streams. Pa began farming trout and breeding mink -- ''just a total departure'' from Jenningses past, Dickie says. He clearly enjoyed it. All day he would be gone in the sperm shed, mixing and mingling to create new colors, coming home in the evening to share the freshly stripped skins with Frances.
 Frances once made the mistake of inviting friends to Lonesome Valley, but Richard the Second disapproved and referred her instead to his friends, ''the mountain people,'' whom he found so self-reliant and inventive -- with ''plenty of brains hidden beneath their outward surface.'' She found them difficult to meet, but never invited her own friends back. With skins to clean and children to raise, Frances settled into the work of a pioneer wife. The house was surrounded by deep woods with dense undergrowth, and she could see nothing beyond. In the woods was a garbage pit. ''That's as far as I ever walked,'' she says.
 Dickie generally discerned between his parents as ''the warm one'' and ''the gruff, short one.'' The children defined themselves according to birth order, Binford says, which ''means a lot in determining who you are.'' Sally, as eldest, was always the gang leader. Binford says that as youngest, she has been the follower, to which Sally adds that babies are also typically ''bratty and want their way.'' It is Binford, in any case, who remembers asking for a soda, at age 6, and hearing Pa say he couldn't waste the dime -- but she could work for it. And it's also Binford who recalls receiving in their Christmas stockings only nuts, with shells on -- ''the kind you had to work to get.''
 The three children fitted together like ''a perfect puzzle,'' Sally says, and never argued, ''except one time, I pushed Dickie into the heater because I wanted the first bath.'' She felt ''real bad about that'' and thinks he's probably still scarred. The sisters agree that Pa's lessons were toughest on Dickie. Binford explains that her brother suffered typical ''middle-child angst,'' which was compounded by the fact that ''he was also Richard the Third, so he had this burden.''
 Shoveling manure for 25 cents an hour, Binford learned well that she was not privileged. Dickie, though, received additional ''manly jobs'' that were ''more example-giving,'' Sally says. As the boy changed the oil in the tractor, hammered nails straight, Pa stood by telling Dickie not to mess it up, and when he messed it up, to do it again. Dickie often messed up and says he was generally known as lazy and careless, always in the bottom of his class. His stories about Lonesome Valley are mainly about being alone.
 Pa took them into the woods and taught them what they could and couldn't eat, which snakes were poisonous and which weren't. Sally says they ''were raised to think: Watch where you are. Just be aware of your environment and don't mess up something that was created for you.'' It was difficult, though, not to be aware that Pa had messed up the woods a little himself. He admits to bringing some Pittsburgh into the mountains. ''You have to cling to those concepts,'' Pa says, ''if you're going to stay in business.'' So he had worn out a bulldozer leveling the land to build his trout farm, and he had brought in an unnatural number of mink. They have the same glands as skunks, Binford explains, ''and we had 6,000 of them.'' The woods were clotted with mink stink. ''The stench was overwhelming.''
 The greatest problem with the woods, though, was the woods. The Jenningses could get no television reception, had no telephone. ''We didn't have anything,'' Sally says.''We had no stimuli of any kind.'' ''There was a loneliness here,'' Binford says, and everyone said so, except Dickie. Even Pa had to confess that the mountain people were not ideal companions, that they were suspicious of anything new, which was just about everything -- including blacks, Jews, Yankees and Frances. The mountain people suffered from isolation, and the Jenningses did, too, until the children began assuming the outward surface of mountain people. When Sally was 8, their grandmother visited from Pittsburgh and shrieked, as soon as Sally opened her mouth, ''Oh my God, my granddaughter's turning into a little redneck!''
 As Binford tells it, ''My parents realized we would be limited our whole lives if we grew up speaking like that.'' Sally was sent to school in Asheville. Dickie and Binford followed, and before long -- for the better schools, of course -- everyone was living in ''the city'' most of the time. 
 Pa kept commuting to Lonesome Valley. On his way, as though to prevent them from getting airs, he dropped the children off at their private schools, among the Cadillacs and Benzes, in his manure-encrusted farm truck. ''God Almighty,'' Dickie remembers, ''talk about humiliation.''
 Back on the farm, Pa refused to admit defeat, but the mink stink grew so intense and the gnats so thick that, just for airflow, he finally cleared the forest around the house for 20 acres.
 As for that house, it's hard to explain -- something to do with the boiler -- but around 1970, Binford says, ''It really sort of blew up.''
 The children were in their 20's when Pa announced that he was going to give them Lonesome Valley. Sally saw the gift as a rite of passage, believing the patriarch had recognized that his children had learned what he had to teach. Pa explains, though, that just the opposite was true.
 Sally at the time was struggling in the trout business. Binford had married the first boy she ever kissed and had gone wandering the country, teaching transcendental meditation. (''Damn near penniless'' was Pa's view of her situation.) And Dickie seemed the most hopeless of all; he had dropped out of college, was also working at the trout farm and had developed, he admits, an addiction to cocaine.
 ''None of them had any prospects of supporting themselves,'' Pa says now. ''None of them.''
 And he had not fared so well, either. Until this point, his experiment in self-reliance had held no real consequences, for he had gone into the woods with about $400,000 -- ''a hell of a lot of money back then,'' he says. But since the mink and the trout farms had never amounted to anything but rather had been kept afloat only by the inheritance, and since the inheritance was virtually gone, consequences now loomed. Pa had nothing to give but the land. He gave it to them in annual installments, so they wouldn't lose the land to estate taxes when he died and couldn't convert it to cash, he says, until they matured and ''got their heads together and knew what they wanted to do.''
 Thirty years passed; the land changed, and the children did, too. In clearing the trees, Pa had opened up a view of the forest, and everyone could see, from a distance, that Lonesome Valley was beautiful. Dickie, from the ashes of the pioneer cabin, helped to construct a finer home, and Binford, bringing classmates to Lonesome Valley, recalls being told how lucky she was to have a summer home. Sally remembers a school friend, looking out over the backyard, asking with awe, Where's your property line? And Sally announcing: ''This is it. We don't have one.''
 ''Out here alone,'' Binford explains, they had never compared their gifts with any friends. ''We just got busy cracking nuts.'' But leaving the valley, the siblings understood what they had and what they didn't, that the world was much larger than Lonesome Valley, but that nearly everyone lived in smaller spaces. They came to view the scene of so much labor as others saw it, and exactly as Pa had not wanted -- as a privilege.
 Everyone adapted the teachings of Pa to become who he or she was born to be. Having followed her father into trout farming, Sally helped determine, first, that Lonesome Valley didn't have enough water to expand the company, and second, that the company needed a more ''cosmopolitan'' image. She took over operations in Waynesville, a nearby town, and started packaging the fish in more elegant wrappers and selling trout caviar. For the first time in 50 years, the trout farm is in the black.
 Binford divorced the first boy she ever kissed, outgrew the T.M. lifestyle, married a doctor and settled in Dayton, Ohio. She found a friendliness in the city she never knew in the country and was pleased that her urban children ''have much more diversity in their lives.'' She then divorced the doctor and got laid off from her job, and now she wants to come home to her family. They always made her feel 12 years old, she says, and ''it's a wonderful thing to feel 12 when you're 50.''
 ''Binford is the one who ended up in a tough way,'' Dickie says. He knows at least that it wasn't him. The lesson Dickie finally learned from Pa is that ''if you are financially dependent on him, it is a bear.'' Dickie quit the $1.10-an-hour job that Pa gave him on the trout farm in the mid-1970's, and at the entrance to Lonesome Valley, he opened a building supply store. He did it just in time for the building boom and was soon able to pay off the note Pa had co-signed and get him ''out of my hair.'' ''And I have not looked back,'' he says. He owns five building supply stores now. Dickie's rich. 
 Just as Sally came to regard the land as her soul and Binford to love it as she did her children, the three siblings grew ''incredibly close,'' Binford says. Their childhood feelings had evolved, according to Sally, into ''a profound respect and love for each other.'' Then about eight years ago, Lonesome Valley became finally and completely theirs, and it was as if Pa had set a cake down among them and left the room. 
 The sisters say they intended to keep it in the family, never to sell or change it, but then others began loving Lonesome Valley, too, and the tax obligation rose to about $20,000 a year. At the same time, the sisters began weighing the privileges of owning Lonesome Valley against others that money could buy. Sally considered that she would be able to purchase trout machinery without borrowing; she also liked ''the idea of having a nest egg that will be there when trout isn't.'' Binford had more basic needs and a lust for travel. She knew her father thought that money ruined a person. ''I want it, though,'' she says, ''just to try it out.''
 Thus, ''tears have been shed -- oh yes!'' says Binford, but the sisters decided to sell.
 Then their telephones rang. It was their brother, Dickie. ''Listen,'' Binford remembers him saying, ''if I could buy you guys out, I'd like to.''
 Dickie has been the caretaker of Lonesome Valley for 20 years, paying the taxes from his own funds. He says his plan was to pass the land on to his children intact, as it had been given to him and his siblings. His offer was to have the land appraised and to buy his sisters out over time, but they never even got to the appraisal.
 Binford was shocked that Dickie had the means to make such an offer; ''None of us has ever had money,'' she says. Sally seems to have been startled by his audacity; middle children, in her belief, are usually subservient and reticent. Binford's first reaction was ''Yeah!'' but then she talked to her big sister, who explained that while Dickie has a ''heart as big as the planet,'' she thought he was hogging. Sally imagined her brother and his four children in beautiful, spacious homes at Lonesome Valley, and herself and her three children having only a small, spare home there. ''And maybe not even that,'' Sally says. ''Maybe Binford and I would just be out of the loop. I was in no way interested.''
 Binford saw what she meant. She says she and Sally asked themselves, if Dickie later sold Lonesome Valley for more than he paid them: ''Will we resent him? And the answer was, Yes, we will.''
 ''It sounds selfish,'' Binford says, ''like I don't want him to have more than me, but the answer is more, I wouldn't want there ever to be anything to come between us'' -- like her brother having a bigger slice of Lonesome Valley than she does.
 The sisters told him they were sorry, but they couldn't crown him king. They would rather sell Lonesome Valley to a stranger. ''Our bottom line has always been, avoid disputes,'' says Binford, so Dickie knew not to make a scene. He says he was just glad they felt close enough to be honest with him, and claims not to have had a problem until the offers began to arrive.
 ''The money was ridiculous,'' Dickie says. But he knew that he had his grandparents and great-grandparents ''looking down,'' and also that his parents were watching. According to their terms of ownership, Lonesome Valley could be disposed of only by unanimous consent. And Dickie couldn't convince himself, even after the last bid came in at $35 million, that other developers ''would create something our family would be particularly proud of.'' He told his sisters he couldn't sleep imagining Lonesome Valley being developed by a stranger. If it had to be done, he wanted to do it himself.
 The sisters understood. They couldn't grant Dickie the full privileges of a king, but if he wanted to do the work, that was as it should be. Binford explains that men are ''the responsible party,'' and that her brother probably does feel a greater need ''to do the right thing here,'' just being the man that he is. ''He's Richard the Third, and he's been given the responsibility of being the Richard to change Lonesome Valley,'' Binford says. ''It's a huge burden, a huge burden. It's up to him to carry on with dignity and honor.''
 Dickie had never developed anything before. His grandfather had loved money; his father, the land. He was the strange amalgam who would complain how ''these developers'' and ''this influx of new people'' had changed his town, even as he sold those developers the concrete.
 Returning to Lonesome Valley, he wanted, as his father had, to do things differently -- to make a lot of money without destroying the land. ''What we're trying to do,'' he says, ''is to create a community within this gorgeous setting and disrupt it as little as possible.'' He seemed almost to believe that he could install people in the woods without the creatures of the woods even noticing. Dickie was loath to disturb the animals, but as a developer, his chief responsibility was to people -- to transform the scene of his childhood into a comfortable place for people to live.
 The first step, begun about two years ago, was a vast wilderness beautification program. Binford had dreamed of this sort of thing for years. The valley had been rather untidy, and ''I've always thought we should clean the place up,'' she says -- get rid of the dead wood and just have it be ''more pristine and fields of grass.'' Pa began the program when he cleared the meadow. Now Dickie and his men imported hundreds of loads of fill dirt to create the meadow's rolling effect. For the green, they brought in sod. The view of the green rolling meadow has also been improved by trees that have been planted -- a willow, a dogwood, some apple trees -- to look as though they ''just grew there,'' Sally says. In other places, to open a window onto the view, trees that did just grow there have been removed.
 Dickie stands before this view of nature as he describes to visitors the added value. Already, gravel roads push through the trees to the farthest reaches of Lonesome Valley, and before they are paved, water, sewer and power lines will go coursing through them, with high-speed Internet and cable TV. Dickie's woods will be wired, and he will add all of the pleasures the Jennings children never enjoyed. There will be a pool that looks like a lake, sports fields that look like pastures, a ropes course on Cow Rock and a fitness center, says Dickie, positioned so that ''when you're in there on your treadmill, you've got the opportunity to stare at that view.''
 Cow Rock, Dickie explains, is ''the one that's got our logo on it'' -- an ancient mineral deposit in the form of a cow that has been appropriated as the corporate seal. Dickie's intent is to create in the wilderness ''a relaxed, laid-back atmosphere where when you drive in, you sort of throw away your watch and cellphone.'' Since he and his sisters were raised here together, he assumes that they share the same vision for Lonesome Valley, but everyone, it seems, looks from a different angle. Sally's desire is to have a five-star culinary establishment, serving a lot of trout. She says it's part of the plan; Dickie says it won't be that fancy. Binford dreams of a spa in Lonesome Valley, with a main building offering massages and salt and mud baths, and ''spa outposts'' with masseuses situated near the waterfalls. ''Doesn't it sound heavenly?'' she asks. The effect of spa treatment, she says, can be compared only to ''the deepest meditation,'' and the three of them have definitely seen the spa as a main attraction. But of the spa, Dickie says only that there will be ''a very small one.''
 All of Lonesome Valley's amenities will be tucked away inside old barns. Binford has imagined flattening the ''ugly mink farm buildings,'' the ''primitive shacks,'' but has come to accept her brother's preference for ''Southern Appalachian vernacular.'' If Lonesome Valley cannot remain purely a natural setting, Dickie explains, then it ought to look like an old farm and every house like an old farmhouse. He points for example to the rebuilt Jennings family home, which is now the clubhouse. Inside, the house is strictly deluxe, all granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances. The exterior, though -- with its tin roof ''pre-rusted so it looks old-timey,'' he says, and its salvaged barn siding painted a hue called Spanish Moss, ''a color we feel is acceptable here'' -- is a study in modesty. Binford understands that by constructing what looks like an old house, Dickie made it appear almost as if ''it sprung from the earth a long time ago.'' By allowing new construction of only old-timey buildings, and only on large, wooded lots, and not at all in the meadow or on the mountainsides, Dickie is trying to hide the evidence that Lonesome Valley has been developed at all. He knows that the woods -- and not the spa or the restaurant -- are still the main attraction for people and that their appearance, at least, must be preserved. Buildings ''must fit quietly into the existing landscape,'' the design guidelines decree. ''Shiny finishes are not allowed.''
 Arranging Lonesome Valley just so, Dickie intends to set it in amber with land conservancy grants, deed restrictions and architectural guidelines so that future generations will never be able to make the decisions about their lots that the Jenningses have made about their valley. Lonesome Valley becomes the master-planned nature community, and even better, as a canyon, the natural gated community. Dickie and his sisters do not say they are developing their land, but instead prefer to call it ''sharing our home.'' Binford explains that she doesn't feel the least bit guilty ''about giving people the opportunity to come into contact with God's nature.'' God may be, in fact, thanked for making them caretakers of Lonesome Valley, she says, ''because we want to share it.''
 They divided the valley into 210 lots, of which about a fifth have been taken. With land alone ranging, Dickie says, from $450,000 to more than $3 million, the new residents won't be Pa's mountain people, but rather more in line with great-grandpa's crowd. Dickie thinks of them, he says, as ''like-minded people,'' and Sally pictures them almost as those creatures of the forest -- retiring sorts slipping into camouflaged summer homes. Maybe the Jenningses will hardly notice them. Binford, though, hopes to embrace the new arrivals, for ''the more people there are,'' she says, ''the more heart there is, the more spirit, the more joy.'' In sharing their home, ''we're welcoming them into our family.'' And, she adds, ''by sharing it, we can still live there.'' 
 Here is the crux of the matter: While sharing their home is a generous act, Sally explains that it is also ''a way for everyone,'' and not just Dickie, ''to have a beautiful home.'' Binford, who hopes to realize $5 million from the deal, sees it additionally as a means to avoid working ''50 hours behind some desk.'' Except for Ma and Pa, who are safely nestled in their Asheville rest home, the whole family plans to live together again in Lonesome Valley, this time in comfort and leisure. And is this better than just letting Dickie own and preserve it? Let's be realistic here, Sally says. Dickie was going to do this anyway. ''Dickie not developing Lonesome Valley,'' she adds, ''would be a little like Einstein deciding not to share his theory of relativity. It's almost too much to hold in.''
 Dickie admits now that after he ''got through the emotional part'' of accepting that Lonesome Valley would have to be developed, he proceeded directly to another emotional part -- zeal for working in such a beautiful place. It should be a masterpiece, he says, ''the neatest development in western North Carolina.''
 Perhaps they'll profit less than they would have by just selling it, but Dickie figures they'll make enough. He expects to be reimbursed for all the taxes paid, and to benefit from the business his subdivision should bring to his building supply store at the entrance and from a nice deal he has worked with his sisters. Sally had complained that he was developing at a ''snail's pace''; Dickie bought a chunk of their shares, quieting them while entitling himself to half their proceeds. ''We're trying to do the right thing here,'' he says. ''The thing I've learned is that if you're doing the right thing, you'll probably make money.''
 At the end of June, the family gathered again at Lonesome Valley for the wedding of Sally's son Ben. The couple stood before the heirloom view, with clouds lingering above them from a storm the night before, and something of an ominous note, too, when they were joined for ''richer or poorer.''
 Afterward, the family portraits. ''Get real close to one another,'' the photographer said. ''A little closer, a little closer.. . .'' And Sally, as mother, stood proud and beaming, and Binford, behind the groom, could barely be seen, and Dickie was making jokes, and Pa was glowering at Dickie for not taking the task seriously.
 In the clubhouse later, Pa sank into one of Dickie's soft chairs and said he was pleased to have been able to give his children something of value. ''It's a compromise, is what it is,'' he said. You should never erase ''the original primeval quality'' of the forest, but also, when you have your family to support, he has learned, you can't cling to a dream about the land. ''I can't help it that one's been a moneymaker, one's been a survivor and one's been in trouble,'' Pa said. ''I can't help that.'' But with the development of Lonesome Valley, ''I'll leave the world thinking they all benefit from this land.'' Dickie will come out with the most, of course. ''But what the hell,'' he said. He's providing for his sisters. He deserves it.
 The boy is just ''superb,'' said Pa. ''He's taken hold in a way I never anticipated. It's almost unfathomable.''

INSIDE
 Life Behind Bars in America.
 By Michael G. Santos.
 299 pp. St. Martin's Press. $24.95.
Michael G. Santos hardly seems like a reliable narrator. As a middle-class kid in Seattle, he was ''a mediocre student'' in high school, and then, three years after graduation, he chose drug trafficking as a profession. He lived ''arrogantly,'' driving Porsches and wearing Cartier diamonds, and he owned an offshore race boat called the Outlaw. He was eventually charged with distributing cocaine and, in 1987, sentenced to 45 years in prison. In his book, he presents accounts of the sex, violence and drugs found behind bars. Yet he knows that a man like him -- ''a long-term prisoner'' -- is seen as ''prone to prevarication or exaggeration.'' Few would have believed the Abu Ghraib stories if they'd come from the prisoners, he points out. It was the pictures that made them real. 
 Santos deserves a hearing. More than 6 percent of Americans will find themselves behind bars at some point in their lives, according to the Justice Department. Nobody knows better than he does what it's like. ''Inside'' is a quasi-sociological treatise, with sections on the prison economy (it features smuggling and prostitution), educational system (one library specializes in ''westerns and romance novels'') and labor conditions (prisoners work in a dairy, a slaughterhouse and ''a rock patch,'' raking ''parallel lines''). Marx and Maxim both make an appearance. 
 Mainly, though, it's a diary of ''a gladiator school,'' ''a walled city of madness.'' Guards act savagely -- a natural outcome in a culture where ''the only thing lower than an inmate is an 'inmate lover,' a 'hug-a-thug.' '' They can also be infuriatingly petty. ''Guards are the only people I see throwing cigarettes on the ground,'' one prisoner says. ''They walk across lawns and then order inmates to rake up behind them.'' Meanwhile, prisoners stab and rape one another and make weapons out of everything from a heavy pipe to a tube sock filled with combination locks. Violence, or the threat of it, permeates Santos's life. When he runs into an old buddy, ''a hard-core gang leader'' named Crip Tank, he calls out a friendly greeting: ''The last time I saw you, you were leaving a guy's guts hanging out of his stomach in the corridor.'' Santos survives among the thugs by acting as a jailhouse lawyer for Crip Tank's friend and others, and he backs up stories of brutality by citing federal cases.
 His writing is stilted (he's no Jean Genet), and the narrative jumps, jarringly, from prison to prison (he's been held in at least six). With all the blood and gore, it's hard to know where we are. Also, the book hits some false notes. Santos shows only a crude understanding of female psychology. His spicy accounts of encounters between prisoners and hot women -- including an educator, a business manager and a lawyer, all with their skirts hiked up -- seem based more on prison-porn fantasy than on empirical evidence: ''Wendy cannot help herself,'' he writes, unconvincingly.
 Nevertheless, he lays out a strong case for prison reform. Most inmates focus on survival, not rehabilitation. And the flaws in the system seem to create a steady stream of prisoners -- namely, those who are released and then end up back behind bars. Even worse, ''neither those in corrections, nor those benefiting from the enormous capital disbursements -- like prison towns, suppliers, contractors, etc. -- want to see material changes. Why would they? Doing so would be akin to those in Las Vegas making a call for an end to gambling.'' Despite a breathless style, Santos provides more than just a seamy look at prison life. He also offers a chilling, timely portrayal of a place where, as one man says, all you need to survive is ''a steel ball of hate and a knife.''

REDEMPTION
 The Last Battle 
 of the Civil War.
 By Nicholas Lemann.
 257 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $24.
Ten years after Appomattox, Northern support for the newly enfranchised ex-slaves and their white allies had faded. Recalcitrant Southern whites, whose Ku Klux Klan night-riding had been aggressively repressed by the federal government in the early 1870's, regrouped under the political aegis of the Democratic Party. By mid-decade, most of the Reconstruction state governments had fallen at the ballot box to the forces of white supremacy, the self-proclaimed ''redeemers.'' 
 Mississippi, with a large black voting majority, resisted longer than other states, but redemption finally came there too, in 1875, sealed by a new frenzy of paramilitary carnage and intimidation. Two years later, after a disputed national election, the Republican Rutherford B. Hayes finally won the White House by agreeing to remove from the South the last of the federal troops who had upheld Reconstruction at the points of their bayonets. The troubled effort to build a Southern interracial democracy out of the ashes of the Civil War was over. 
 The story of Reconstruction's demise in Mississippi is familiar to historians, and Nicholas Lemann, in ''Redemption,'' retells it in all its terrible gore. His account squares with recent scholarship, which has challenged both the traditional ''Birth of a Nation'' view (of Reconstruction as a tragic era of black plunder and white degradation) and the skeptical scholarship of the 1960's and after that questioned the reformers' commitment. Lemann, the dean of the School of Journalism at Columbia and the author of ''The Promised Land,'' among other books, affirms Reconstruction as a noble, thwarted experiment, the nation's ''unfinished revolution,'' in the words of the era's current leading historian, Eric Foner. This book strives to burn that academic re-evaluation into the minds of nonacademic readers. 
 Written on a dramatic human scale, and leavened by some fresh research and analysis, it is an arresting piece of popular history. Lemann is a responsible writer who aims to convey what he calls ''the feeling of history unfolding, not of history considered in retrospect.'' But ''Redemption'' inevitably speaks to the present as well as about the past. In focusing on Reconstruction Mississippi, Lemann, a native of New Orleans, stirs living memories of the murderous Southern resistance to the civil rights movement 90 years later. And he writes at a time when neo-Confederate sympathies have cropped up again in Southern politics, amid reports about the suppression of minority voting throughout the country. We are still living with the consequences of what Lemann presents as the ''last battle of the Civil War.'' 
 The book opens not in Mississippi but with an extended prologue about the notorious 1873 massacre in Colfax, La., the bloodiest episode of racial violence during the Reconstruction era. The Colfax events -- in which more than 70 mostly black militiamen were killed by white supremacists after a disputed election -- sparked immediate Northern outrage but led three years later to the landmark Supreme Court ruling United States v. Cruikshank, which upheld states' rights against federal authority to protect the freedmen from white terrorists.
 These changing circumstances made the situation almost impossible for Lemann's chief protagonist, Mississippi's Reconstruction governor, Adelbert Ames. Ames was a paragon of Yankee gallantry who blended ambition and idealism, Lemann writes, ''almost to the point of aspiring to sainthood.'' The son of a sea captain from Rockland, Me., he had graduated from West Point just in time to fight courageously in numerous major Civil War battles, for which he received the Medal of Honor. In 1868, Ames was appointed provisional military governor of conquered Mississippi. Deeply moved by the plight of local blacks, he cast his lot with the state's fledgling Republican Party. Elected by the Reconstruction legislature to the United States Senate in 1870, he ran for governor three years later on a biracial Republican slate and, with enthusiastic support from ex-slaves, easily defeated his more conservative rival. Although disparaged as a ''carpetbagger'' by anti-Reconstruction whites, Ames took pride in his conviction that, as he later wrote, he ''had a Mission with a large M.'' The new governor called for ambitious reforms, including the creation of a credible public school system, hoping to benefit all the state's citizens while lifting the freedmen out of their abject poverty and illiteracy.
 Lemann presents Ames's political rise in counterpoint with his courtship of Blanche Butler of Massachusetts, whom he married in 1870. Their loving correspondence reveals to Lemann ''a subtle dynamic of mutual adjustment.'' But the Ameses' marriage also had important political implications. Blanche's father was the Radical Republican congressman Benjamin F. Butler, whose intransigent command of the Union Army occupation of New Orleans caused white Southerners to nickname him ''Beast'' Butler, and who now stood, Lemann writes, ''at the very top of the South's pantheon of resentment.'' By the early 1870's, Butler was a confidant of President Grant and one of his staunchest supporters on Capitol Hill, especially when it came to crushing Southern white resistance to Reconstruction. As Beast Butler's son-in-law, Ames had a line to the highest levels of the federal government -- and appeared all the more evil to Mississippi's reorganizing white supremacists.
 The counterrevolution began in Vicksburg during the summer of 1874. In anticipation of local elections, a group of whites infiltrated a Negro Republican Fourth of July celebration and began shooting, which touched off an anti-black rampage. At the end of the month, Ames sent Grant a long telegram, pleading for federal military intervention, but Grant, relying on an inconclusive report from his secretary of war, William W. Belknap, refused. In August, the Democrats swept the Vicksburg municipal elections, although Republican blacks, including Sheriff Peter Crosby, a Union Army veteran, still held key countywide positions. Only in September, after receiving horrifying letters from ordinary citizens, did Grant authorize sending troops wherever local officials were losing control. 
 Emboldened by the election returns, Mississippi's white supremacists organized their own paramilitary group, the White Line. In Vicksburg, they forced the resignation of Sheriff Crosby, who countered by forming a temporary black militia, and the two sides squared off in armed battles. Ames once again alerted the president, who dispatched Gen. Philip Sheridan to restore order to the entire Gulf region. 
 Sheridan's troops, as part of their general operations, returned Crosby to his elected office; and Sheridan sent a fierce telegram to Secretary Belknap, calling the white resisters ''terrorists'' and ''banditti,'' and bidding the president to denounce them as such. But Sheridan's message struck most Northern Republicans as excessive, and now exhausted by the endless violence, they publicly deplored renewed federal intervention. Grant issued a proclamation strongly defending Sheridan, but the document hedged on the question of the limits of federal power. Reconstruction's opponents, Lemann writes, ''would not have been wrong in detecting a wobble'' in the administration's position.
 The wobbling worsened over the following year. White Line violence against Republican gatherings and individual black political leaders reached a fever pitch. Efforts by stalwart pro-Reconstruction Republicans in Congress to pass tougher enforcement legislation failed, partly because of the machinations of a shrewd and articulate Mississippi Democrat, Congressman Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar. Grant's recently appointed attorney general, the conservative Edwards Pierrepont, deftly muffled the president's impulses to send additional military support. 
 The embittered Ames decided to reorganize, augment and activate Mississippi's mostly black militia, and thereby forced a peace conference with the Democrats. In exchange for Ames's order to send the militia home, the Democrats agreed to respect black voting rights in the fall elections. But the paramilitary White Liners would not be denied. After a brief pause, they resumed their intimidation, which culminated in a massive show of force on Election Day. Democrats did not hide their approval. In some heavily black districts, Republican totals dwindled almost to zero, and the Democrats took control of the state legislature. In January, the newly elected lawmakers assembled in Jackson, listened to Ames denounce the violence and, a few weeks later, geared up to impeach him.
 At the end of March, Ames agreed to resign in exchange for the charges' being dropped, and left Mississippi. A Senate select committee investigated over the summer and issued a damning report on the White Line outrages. But by then, a fresh round of terror and intimidation had begun around the presidential campaign that would ultimately end all of Reconstruction.
 Lemann's interpretation of the politics behind these events is uneven. By depicting Reconstruction as the final phase of the Civil War, he suggests that the Confederates actually won, which diminishes the epochal importance of emancipation and secession's defeat. Lemann does write astutely about the white supremacists and their coordinated multi-track political strategy, whereby respectable conservative Democrats like Lamar kept to the high road (and attacked the Republicans as profligate tax-and-spenders) while leaving the dirty work to the White Line. But the black participants in the story remain mostly obscure, and often come across more as victims than as political actors militantly defending their rights. Lemann also slights the political shrewdness of local black politicians (who had engineered Ames's run for the governorship in the first place), while failing to convey fully the governor's political naivete in dealing with his opponents. 
 Lemann shows far less indulgence toward Grant, who appears mainly as a confused, politically expedient sellout. In fact, the president, whose father had been strongly antislavery and who had crushed the Klan in 1871, risked considerable political capital on behalf of the ex-slaves. His stance concerning Reconstruction became politically untenable after 1874, when he faced opposition from the Supreme Court, a newly elected Democratic House and even his own cabinet -- yet Grant still did the best he could more often than not. Lemann considers the extenuating circumstances but also describes Grant as, by turns, dour, cryptic, callous and malignly opportunistic -- thus making it difficult to comprehend why his friend Frederick Douglass said that ''in the matter of the protection of the freedman from violence his moral courage surpassed that of his party.''
 Lemann's accounts of the racial mayhem in Mississippi in some ways contradict his pitting of Ames the idealist against Grant the pol. Given the vicious hostility among Southern whites to Reconstruction, success would have required far more patience and willpower than the North possessed, and many more resources than the pro-Reconstruction Southerners could muster on their own, even in states with largely black populations. Numerous factors outside Grant's direct control -- including a devastating national economic panic in 1873; Republican bribery scandals; and the convulsive electoral realignment in 1874, which produced the Democratic House majority -- tragically made matters even worse for the ex-slaves and their radical allies.
 In reaching for the attention of general readers with a brief, highly concentrated narrative, ''Redemption'' simplifies too much. But it offers a vigorous, necessary reminder of how racist reaction bred an American terrorism that suppressed black political activity and crushed Reconstruction in the South. And it illuminates the often bloody fights over black voting rights that would recur for a century to come -- and remain, even today, a source of partisan strife, albeit without paramilitary gunfire and with the party labels reversed.

HEADLINE: Wartime Heroism With an Arab Face 

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
UNDERSTANDABLY, French cinema has not dwelled too much on World War II. And when doing so, all too often it has either inflated the role of the Resistance or, more courageously, confronted the shadow of French collaboration with the German occupiers. For military heroism on screen, though, it has usually turned to swashbuckling American and British imports.
 Yet there is one uplifting war story that France has chosen to ignore. In August 1944, when some 200,000 French soldiers landed with other Allied forces on the Cote d'Azur to liberate southern and eastern France, 65 percent of the ''French'' soldiers were from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal and other French colonies. And this, it seems, is why the story was forgotten.
Six decades later, Rachid Bouchareb's new movie, ''Indigenes'' (its English title is ''Days of Glory''), sets out to make amends. The film, which was given an early boost when its four lead actors shared the best-actor prize in May at Cannes, will be released here on Sept. 27 and has been sold in more than 20 countries, including the United States. It is set to be shown this month at the Toronto International Film Festival. 
 But while ''Indigenes'' -- literally ''Natives'' -- will be judged outside France simply as a movie, here it carries a clear political agenda: at a time of simmering distrust between France's white majority and its Muslim minority, Mr. Bouchareb, who was born in France to Algerian immigrants, wants both to spotlight how Arabs contributed to French freedom and to assure the children and grandchildren of North African immigrants of their rightful place in today's France.
 ''The French need to know their own history,'' he said in a telephone interview from his vacation hideaway. ''And I hope that children of immigrants will find the film bolsters their dignity and perhaps eliminates some of their frustration so that they can walk with their heads held a little bit higher.''
 That's a lot to ask of a two-hour movie.
 ''Be proud to serve France and France will be proud of you,'' a French officer declares in an early scene as Algerian villagers are recruited to save the ''mother country.'' Soon, they are doing just that, engaged in a fierce hillside battle with German troops in Provence and then being mobbed by crowds in the first French town they liberate. There, one soldier, Messaoud, is rewarded, to his astonishment, with the affection of a beautiful young French woman.
 The regiment heads north up the Rhone Valley, then into Alsace, which Germany had annexed in 1940. By now, with dialogue in both French and Arabic, ''Indigenes'' is focusing on four soldiers -- Said (Jamel Debbouze), a shy peasant; Yassir (Samy Naceri), a mercenary; Messaoud (Roschdy Zem), now love-struck; and Abdelkader (Sami Bouajila), a corporal -- as well as Martinez (Bernard Blancan), their Algerian-born French platoon sergeant.
 Occasionally the cultural gap between the soldiers and the ''mother country'' surfaces: once, when Abdelkader complains loudly that ''liberte, egalite, fraternite'' are only for the French; another time, more amusingly, when entertainment for the troops involves a pair of classical ballet dancers and prompts bored Arab infantrymen to exit hurriedly.
 But when it comes to fighting, they prove their worth. And in the end it is left to Said, Yassir, Messaoud and Abdelkader to carry the flag for the ''indigenes'' -- and for France.
 ''I had this film in my head for 10 years,'' said Mr. Bouchareb, 47. ''I wanted above all to resolve my own history and that of some of my family, like my great-grandfather, who fought for France in World War I, and an uncle, who was in the French army in Indochina. All this formed part of the history of my family and the history of France.''
 But he found it difficult to gather material for the movie because there was no film of the North African contingent in official film archives. So instead, for two years he tracked down and interviewed surviving Arab veterans, most now well into their 80's. Receiving smaller war pensions than French veterans but still proud of what they did, many shared their memories of the war for the first time.
 ''They are my witnesses,'' said Mr. Bouchareb, whose previous movies include ''Little Senegal'' and ''Dust of Life.'' ''Many of their stories are in the film.''
 Even before completing the screenplay with Olivier Lorelle, he also sought out Mr. Debbouze, 30, a French-born actor of Moroccan extraction who was raised in a poor immigrant family and is now France's most popular comedian (he was the grocer's assistant in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's 2001 romantic comedy, ''Amelie''). And when he agreed to appear in ''Indigenes'' as Said, the movie's box-office appeal here seemed guaranteed.
 Enthusiastic about the project, Mr. Debbouze came on board as co-producer, and this too proved important: his high profile across North Africa as well as in France helped smooth the way for units of the Moroccan Army to serve as extras for battle scenes near the southern Moroccan city of Ouarzazate. The rest of the movie was shot in studios in Ouarzazate and on location in Provence and Alsace.
 Still more crucial, though, was the idealism that apparently surrounded the production, with Mr. Debbouze and his colleagues sharing Mr. Bouchareb's vision of the movie's aims: to rescue their own history (several lead actors learned from military records that they too had forebears who fought for France), and to offer a message of reconciliation in the hope of easing some of the social, ethnic and religious tensions straining France.
 ''If at some moment de Gaulle had recognized the contribution of Algerians, Moroccans, Senegalese and others in the war, there would now be less racism here,'' Mr. Debbouze said in an interview. ''The film can't change everything. It is just a Post-it in the history of France, but a Post-it is also a way of remembering things.'' 
 But Mr. Debbouze, like Mr. Bouchareb, is most concerned about how the film will be received by French-born youths of immigrant extraction: many feel excluded from French society by unemployment and discrimination and, as a group, they were largely blamed for riots last fall in the banlieues, or suburbs, of Paris and other cities.
 ''I think through this film they will become more aware of their history,'' Mr. Debbouze said. ''They live a terrible crisis of identity: they don't know where they've come from and they don't know where they are going. But when they see their grandparents fought the Nazis, that they were heroes, they will feel they have some worth.''
 Mr. Zem, 40, the French-born actor who plays Messaoud, said he shared that hope. ''They need role models,'' he said, ''and if they see a film in which the main roles are acted by people like themselves and it talks of their ancestors who fought for France, it may give them a certain pride.''
 And as if to remind audiences that France and North Africa remain inextricably linked, ''Indigenes'' has been chosen as Algeria's -- not France's -- candidate for nomination as best foreign-language film at next year's Oscars.
 ''And why not?'' asked Mr. Bouchareb, who has dual French and Algerian nationality. ''I am Algerian, the composer is Algerian, some actors are Algerian, it's an Algerian co-production, Algerian Arabic is used in the film -- and French is also an Algerian language.'' 
 Well, yes. But rarely has a movie been more tailored to address France. And, in this case, Mr. Bouchareb clearly does so as a Frenchman.

HEADLINE: Behind That Sense Of Job Insecurity

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS

 BODY:
JOBS today seem as long-lasting as the petals of a flower. Virtually every week brings news of large-scale corporate layoffs. On Tuesday, the day after Labor Day, Intel said it would reduce its work force by 10,500, or about 10 percent.
 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the United States economy -- a giant job-churning machine -- each quarter destroys nearly 7 percent of existing jobs and creates a roughly equivalent percentage. Even for those at the top rungs of the labor ladder, job stability isn't what it used to be. Burson-Marsteller, the public relations firm, reported earlier this year that 470 of the Fortune 1000 companies have changed C.E.O.'s since 2000. 
Yet labor economists, who prefer sifting through reams of yesterday's data to parsing today's headlines, detect a seemingly counterintuitive trend. During the last few decades, job stability and job tenure for the typical worker don't seem to have changed much, if at all. 
 Ann Stevens, an associate professor of economics at the University of California, Davis, has looked through a time series -- interviews with men between the ages of 58 and 62 conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other research groups at intervals from 1969 to 2002. 
 She found that in 1969, the average tenure of the longest job a man had held in his career was 21.9 years. In 2002, the figure was only marginally smaller: 21.4 years. In both 1969 and 2002, about half of those interviewed had spent more than two decades with a single employer. 
 ''I'm not convinced there has been a dramatic change,'' said Professor Stevens, who presented her findings in a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper. 
 That conclusion may seem surprising, given the heightened media and political attention to outsourcing, corporate overhauls and layoffs -- and given the peculiar dynamics of the late 1990's, when low unemployment, significant job growth and technological advances led many people to switch jobs voluntarily. 
 ''In those years, companies couldn't hold on to workers,'' said David Neumark, a professor of economics at the University of California, Irvine. 
 Recent evidence indicates that jobs aren't any more or less disposable than they were in the past. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median job tenure for all workers at their current jobs rose to 4 years in January 2004 from 3.5 years in 1983. In the same period, the percentage of workers older than 25 with job tenure of more than 10 years fell only modestly, to 30.6 percent from 31.9 percent.
 But there are subtle shifts underneath the headline numbers, says Steven J. Davis, the William H. Abbott professor of international business and economics at the University of Chicago. As they have become more entrenched in the work force, women have seen their average job tenure rise, to 3.8 years in 2004 from 3.1 years in 1983. In the same period, the figure declined for men -- particularly for those ages 45 to 54, whose average tenure in 2004 was 9.67 years, down from 12.8 years in 1983. 
 Job tenure has declined ''among both blue-collar and white-collar male workers,'' Professor Davis said. ''White-collar jobs, which were historically dominated by college-educated men, are no longer quite as secure as they were a generation ago.''
 So what accounts for the public concern over job instability? Professor Davis notes that job stability at publicly held companies -- large, brand-name businesses like Intel that make news when they restructure -- has decreased markedly. ''But such companies only account for about one-third of all business employment,'' he said. Among privately held companies -- a much larger sector -- job stability has actually been on the rise in recent years.
 What's more, workers have plenty of reason to feel anxious about their prospects. ''Job stability isn't the same as job security,'' said Jacob S. Hacker, a professor of political science at Yale and author of ''The Great Risk Shift'' (Oxford University Press). The consequences of losing a job are far more severe today than they were in previous generations, as laid-off employees tend to see their compensation and benefits fall sharply when they find new employment. As a result, ''people are more likely today to worry about what will happen if they lose their job,'' Professor Hacker said.
 CLEARLY, in today's economy, workers have to prepare for the possibility that their jobs won't last as long as they once expected. ''It was and still is the case that roughly a quarter of jobs end within a year,'' said Professor Neumark of U.C. Irvine. Americans today should expect to have many different jobs over the course of their working lifetime, especially when they are starting out. 
 ''But that doesn't mean you won't eventually find an employer with whom you'll have a long-term attachment,'' said Professor Stevens, who has been at U.C. Davis for three years, her third job since receiving her Ph.D. in 1995.

MUSICIANS FOR HARMONY Ordinarily a fifth anniversary would be something to cheer about, but this series, born in response to the events of 9/11, invites reflection, not celebration. The pianist Leon Fleisher, the violinist and composer Mark O'Connor, the Orion String Quartet and others present a fifth annual concert for peace. Monday. Merkin Concert Hall. musicians4harmony.org. 


MOZART'S REQUIEM If your needs for the 9/11 anniversary are more activist than contemplative, here is a chance to get involved musically, as Judith Clurman conducts a sing-in with the Juilliard Orchestra and Choral Union. It starts at 12:30 and is free, but tickets are required. Musical scores will be provided. The event is sponsored by the New York Mets, who have found any number of ways to make themselves lovable this season. (The team itself will be otherwise occupied, with the Marlins in Florida.) Monday. Carnegie Hall.

CANADIAN OPERA COMPANY This troupe wastes no time in putting its new house to the ultimate test, with three performances of Wagner's four-opera cycle, ''Der Ring des Nibelungen.'' The novelty here is that each opera has a different director. Three have already appeared; ''Das Rheingold,'' directed by Michael Levine, who also supplies the unifying set design, is new. Atom Agoyan directs ''Die Walkure''; Francois Girard, ''Siegfried''; Tim Albery, ''Gotterdammerung.'' Tuesday-Oct. 1. Four Seasons Center for the Performing Arts, Toronto, (416) 363-8231, ringcycle.ca.

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC In keeping with recent tradition, Lorin Maazel's gala opening concert will rock no party boats: just the ubiquitous Mozart (the Two-Piano Concerto, with Emanuel Ax and Yefim Bronfman) and Beethoven (the ''Egmont'' Overture and the ''Eroica'' Symphony). The first subscription concerts open with a touch of adventure: Hans Werner Henze's ''Sebastian im Traum,'' a Philharmonic co-commission with other orchestras. But the plaguing problem for new music at the Philharmonic: How many listeners will manage to arrive late, just in time for Itzhak Perlman's performance of Bruch's First Violin Concerto? Wednesday; Thursday-Saturday, Sept. 19. Avery Fisher Hall.

'SEMELE' Since Paul Kellogg became general director of the New York City Opera a decade ago, Handel has become the company's calling card. So it is appropriate that ''Semele'' is the first new production of the final season of Mr. Kellogg's distinguished tenure. Stephen Lawless is the director, and Elizabeth Futral and Vivica Genaux should provide plenty of vocal sparkle. (Further on the Handel front, ''Flavio'' returns on April 4 with the countertenor David Walker in the title role.) Opens Wednesday. New York State Theater.

NASHVILLE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA This newly energized ensemble presents its first subscription series in its new home, which just opened with a gala concert. The hall is named for Kenneth Schermerhorn, who was the orchestra's music director during a period of intense growth, from 1983 until his death last year: as proficient an orchestra builder in Nashville, evidently, as he had been at the Milwaukee Symphony through the 1970's. He was also a composer, and his ''Jubilee: A Tennessee Quilting Party for Orchestra'' opens the program, which will feature the pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet and be conducted by Andrew Litton. Thursday-Saturday. Schermerhorn Symphony Center, (615) 687-6400, nashvillesymphony.org.

PACIFIC SYMPHONY This solid but relatively unrecognized ensemble hopes to add to its stature with a new home, the Renee and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall (not to be confused with the present Segerstrom Hall, named for the same donor), no matter that it lies more or less in the shadow of Disney Hall in Los Angeles. Carl St. Clair, the orchestra's music director, conducts the two opening concerts, each featuring a premiere: William Bolcom's ''Canciones de Lorca'' (sung by Placido Domingo) in the first and Philip Glass's ''Passion of Ramakrishna'' in the second. In addition Midori plays Beethoven's Violin Concerto on Saturday. Friday-Saturday. Orange County Performing Arts Center, Costa Mesa, Calif., (714) 556-2787, ocpac.org.

'THE PEONY PAVILION' Even abridged, Kenneth Pai's production of Tang Xianzu's 1598 opera runs some nine hours, and it holds great promise. Among other attractions, a press release says, Mr. Pai uses young stars, ''countering tradition that has older veteran performers in the leading roles.'' That's a good idea, as Chen Shi-Zheng showed in his presentation of this work in all its 19-hour glory at the Lincoln Center Festival in 1999 (which the release refers to merely as ''a previous production''). Mr. Pai's version with the Suzhou Kun Opera Theater of Jiangsu Province can only be welcomed, and we on the East Coast are left to lament that it is not coming here, at least not anytime soon. Friday-next Sunday, Zellerbach Hall, University of California, Berkeley, (510) 642-9988, calperfs.berkeley.edu. (The production moves on to the University of California, Irvine, Sept. 22-24; the University of California, Los Angeles, Sept. 29-Oct. 1; and the University of California, Santa Barbara, Oct. 6-8.)

SILK ROAD ENSEMBLE A must-hear for musical adventurers, and a must-see, if only as a rare opportunity to experience Zankel Hall in a different stage configuration. Before the hall opened, in 2003, a big selling point was that it would be able to change shape to suit various types of performances. Not so easily done, it turns out, and the only departure from the conventional stage setup so far has been a kind of surround audience seating for the culminating concerts of a Silk Road Project workshop two years ago. The same is promised for this second workshop. Yo-Yo Ma, the project's godfather, will again oversee the festivities with, you may be sure, his typical exuberance. Saturday-next Sunday.

'DAYS OF AWE' The 92nd Street Y's annual concert for the Jewish High Holy Days, ''Days of Awe: Who Shall Live and Who Shall Die,'' takes an ecumenical turn with performances by the choir of Trinity Church on Wall Street, conducted by Owen Burdick. The sensitive and thoughtful baritone Sanford Sylvan is the artistic director of the event, which combines performances of works by Josquin, Lassus and Arvo Part with readings and commentaries. Next Sunday.

JANINE JANSEN This young Dutch violinist has been called the Queen of the Downloads in some quarters, as much for her cheesecake image, one suspects, as for the quality of her recordings. She seems intent on challenging her German counterpart Anne-Sophie Mutter at her own glamorous game, but to judge from those recordings, Ms. Jansen, too, has the musical goods, and she has the respect of seasoned and serious musicians. Here she performs excerpts from Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons'' and Bach's E major Concerto and (joined by the lively Eriko Sato) Concerto for Two Violins with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra in the Great Hall to open the Metropolitan Museum's concert season. Sept. 18.

ST. LUKE'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE This respected and versatile New York institution, which was quick to take its place among the lively attractions at the intimate Zankel Hall at Carnegie in recent years, now becomes a cornerstone in the programming of an even newer and more intimate auditorium, the Gilder Lehrman Hall of the Morgan Library, opened last May. When the three concerts originally scheduled sold out on subscription well before the start of the season, the Morgan added a series of repeat concerts, and those too sold out quickly. You can catch the same programs at the Brooklyn Museum, or you can cultivate a friendship with a generous ticketholder. The series kicks off with music of Vivaldi, Handel and Bach. Sept. 20, 23 (also Feb. 6, 8; April 24-25). Morgan Library and Museum.

CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER So begins the society's first season fully planned by its new artistic directors, the cellist David Finckel and the pianist Wu Han, and its last for now in Alice Tully Hall, soon to be renovated. On paper the opening program looks like a mishmash, with works by no fewer than 10 composers, ranging from Vivaldi to Nicholas Maw, Leon Kirchner and Bright Sheng. But it sounds themes to be developed later in the season, in series called ''Through Brahms: A Path From Schubert to Kirchner'' (Oct. 20-Nov. 7), ''Baroque Festival'' (Dec. 8-19), ''An English Musical Renaissance, 1900-30'' (Feb. 11-25) and ''Premiere Program'' (April 27-May 22), and in individual programs. The season, one trusts, will sort itself out in fascinating ways. The opening program still looks like a mishmash. Sept. 21. chambermusicsociety.org.

'SOPHIE'S CHOICE' Meryl Streep may seem to be everywhere at the moment, onstage as well as on film, singing as well (well, almost as well) as acting, but don't expect her to reprise the leading role she played in the 1982 film version of William Styron's novel in the American premiere of this opera by Nicholas Maw. Not that the production at the Washington National Opera will lack star power, with the mezzo-soprano Angelika Kirchschlager singing the title role. Marin Alsop conducts. Opens Sept. 21. Kennedy Center Opera House, (800) 876-7372, dc-opera.org.

MET OPEN HOUSE Huh? What ever happened to the secretive and exclusionary old Metropolitan Opera? Peter Gelb arrives as general manager firing from both barrels, and here, even before the season starts, he is throwing the doors open to the public. Visitors (or at least a houseful of them) can acquire free tickets to the dress rehearsal of the season-opening ''Madama Butterfly,'' observe set changes, attend panel discussions and walk across the stage (probably not during the rehearsal). Sept. 22. Metropolitan Opera House.

'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' As planned by Joseph Volpe, Peter Gelb's predecessor as general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, the season was to begin in typical fashion with a gala presentation of opera excerpts. Mr. Gelb decided instead to kick things off in dead earnest, with a new production of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' directed by Anthony Minghella (of film fame) and picked up from the English National Opera, where it created something of a sensation last season. Cristina Gallardo-Domas, acclaimed for her interpretation of Butterfly, takes the role here, and Marcello Giordani is Pinkerton. The production treats the work as a Japanese play and, among other innovations, uses bunraku-style puppets. The ever restless Mr. Gelb has done other tinkering with Mr. Volpe's season as well. Opens Sept. 25.

NORTON LECTURES With his amassing of high-profile positions around the world (most recently at La Scala in Milan), Daniel Barenboim brings to mind Herbert von Karajan when he was widely called Generalmusikdirektor of Europe. But in delivering the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard, Mr. Barenboim calls to mind Leonard Bernstein, whose lectures ''The Unanswered Question'' of 1973 are the association most music lovers have with the annual series. Mr. Barenboim's six talks are titled ''Sound and Thought'' (though can politics be far behind?). And about those Bernstein associations? Don't discount Mr. Barenboim's chances of becoming the next music director of the New York Philharmonic, should he want such a thing. Sept. 25-29, Oct. 3. Sanders Theater, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass., (617) 495-2791, music.fas.harvard.edu.

VLADIMIR FELTSMAN When Mr. Feltsman arrived from the Soviet Union in 1987 to great expectations, he told skeptical reporters that he was not an old-school Russian pianist eager to flex his muscles, that he was as much interested in music of the Classical era as in the big Romantic war horses. And here, perhaps, is the ultimate demonstration: five evenings covering all the Mozart piano sonatas and other keyboard works, played on a fortepiano. Sept. 28, Oct. 12, New School, 66 West 12th Street. Sept. 30; Oct. 3, 10, Mannes College, 150 West 85th Street, (212) 496-8524, mannes.newschool.edu.

BALTIMORE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Yuri Temirkanov bade the orchestra farewell as music director in June. But now -- as the orchestra awaits the installation of his successor, Marin Alsop, next year -- Mr. Temirkanov is back to open its new season, something he did not always manage even when he was acting as music director, because of his competing commitments at the St. Petersburg Philharmonic in Russia. Here he observes the Shostakovich centenary with a minifestival, demonstrating his mastery of that composer's music with the Symphony No. 5 in the first week and No. 10 in the second. Sept. 29-Oct. 1; Oct. 5-7. Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, Baltimore; Music Center at Strathmore (Sept. 28), North Bethesda, Md.; (410) 783-8000, baltimoresymphony.org.

SILK ROAD CHICAGO After its Carnegie Hall workshop and Zankel concerts, the Silk Road Project returns to its yearlong residency in Chicago. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra, in its opening-night gala, features Yo-Yo Ma, the project's spearhead, in Dvorak's Cello Concerto. But more to the point, it performs ''Night Music: Voices in the Leaves,'' by the Uzbek composer Dmitri Yanov-Yanovsky, and vaguely Oriental works by Rossini (''Italian Girl in Algiers'' Overture) and Stravinsky (''Song of the Nightingale''). Miguel Harth-Bedoya conducts. Silk Road Chicago continues through June. Sept. 30. Symphony Center, (800) 223-7114, cso.org.

October

STEVE REICH @ 70 One of the most encouraging developments in New York concert life in recent years has been the collaborative spirit that has arisen among presenting institutions. Here the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center join to celebrate the 70th birthday of the innovative and influential composer Steve Reich. The academy offers dance in the opera house (Oct. 3, 5-7). Carnegie has a professional training workshop and young artists concert in Zankel Hall (Oct. 13-19); concerts with Steve Reich and Musicians in the Stern Auditorium and Zankel Hall (Oct. 21-22); and an afternoon of discussion and performance in Weill Recital Hall (Oct. 22). Lincoln Center presents a concert by the Los Angeles Master Chorale in Alice Tully Hall (Oct. 28) and performances of ''The Cage'' at John Jay College, 899 10th Avenue, at 59th Street, Manhattan (Nov. 2-4).

CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA If the verdict is still out on Franz Welser-Most in his fifth season as music director of the orchestra -- as, in some quarters, it seems to be -- this high-profile engagement, opening Carnegie Hall's season, should tell some tales. The pianist Leif Ove Andsnes, playing Mozart, and the bass-baritone Thomas Quasthoff, singing Mozart and Mahler, are high-powered guest artists. The modern (''Un Sourire'' by Messiaen) mingles with the freshly minted (''Touche'' by Hanspeter Kyburz). The Johann Strauss overture and waltzes in the first program should be delicious, and Bruckner's Fifth Symphony in the last could be revelatory. As for Carnegie, although this is the first season in which Clive Gillinson has had substantial input as executive and artistic director, no changes of direction are yet apparent. Oct. 4-5, 7.

'L'ENFANT ET LES SORTILEGES' Ravel's charming little opera, performed in concert by Lorin Maazel and the New York Philharmonic, should be a delight. But Saint-Saens's mighty ''Organ'' Symphony, which fills out the program, will -- with some dreadful-sounding electronic instrument -- inevitably serve as a reminder of the desperate need for a pipe organ in Avery Fisher Hall. With wonderful new or restored organs at Symphony Hall in Boston, Severance Hall in Cleveland, Disney Hall in Los Angeles, the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia and even the Overture Center in Madison, Wis., is it too much to hope that plans for the reconstruction of Avery Fisher will include the pipe organ that Kurt Masur always lusted after and helped raise money for? Oct. 5-6.

MARYINSKY FESTIVAL Are Valery Gergiev and the forces of the Maryinsky Theater spreading themselves too thin, with extended visits this season to Orange County, Calif.; Lincoln Center; and the Kennedy Center in Washington? They seem to be spending as much time in the West these days as at their home in St. Petersburg, Russia. A trip to London this summer met with mixed critical reactions, and the advance word on the Kirov Opera's Wagner ''Ring'' cycle, which is the opener and main attraction here (Oct. 7-11) on its way to the Lincoln Center Festival next summer, is iffy. In addition the Kirov Opera presents ''Boris Godunov,'' the Kirov Ballet offers ''Romeo and Juliet'' and ''Swan Lake,'' and the Kirov Orchestra performs two concerts in the new Segerstrom Concert Hall. Oct. 6-22. Orange County Performing Arts Center, Costa Mesa, Calif., (714) 556-2787, ocpac.org.

LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Roll over, Mozart, and tell Chuck Berry the news. Although the Mozart year remains very much in play, this season amounts to a Beethoven festival. (Like every other, some would say, but this one more than most.) For openers Bernard Haitink and the London Symphony bring their recently recorded survey of the nine symphonies to life. And life is the operative word, to judge from the vitality and the quick tempos on some of those recordings. Elder statesman though Mr. Haitink may be, his approach to these overfamiliar masterpieces remains fresh and energetic. Oct. 7-8, 10-11, 13. Avery Fisher Hall.

'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' Wasn't it just two years ago, when he was directing Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale'' at the Royal Opera in London, that Jonathan Miller was making noises about quitting opera altogether? It would have been a shame for the field to lose his teeming and irreverent imagination, but not to worry: he directed Janacek's ''Jenufa'' at Glimmerglass this summer, and here he is, directing another Donizetti work at the New York City Opera. The production, originally created for the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm and set in the American Southwest of the 1950's, promises soda jerks, Ford Fairlanes and pompadours. Opens Oct. 7. New York State Theater.

EARLY MUSIC AMERICA A highlight of the first New York Early Music Celebration in 2004 was the final round of this organization's medieval and Renaissance competition for North American artists. The return of the celebration, promised for this fall, has been put off at least a year, but here is another installment of the competition, featuring three groups from Canada and two from the United States. Incidentally, what ever happened to Asteria, the vocal duo that won in a walk two years ago? Those two would light up any season. Oct. 11. Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (888) 722-5288, earlymusic.org.

BEN HEPPNER The burly baritone Thomas Hampson tested the walls and rafters of the intimate new Gilder Lehrman Hall at its opening in May, and the auditorium seems destined, improbably, to become a home for big voices. Here the leading Wagner tenor of the day lets loose (alongside Wendy Bryn Harmer, a soprano), to open a series sponsored by the George London Foundation, which includes the soprano Andrea Gruber and others. Oct. 12 (also Jan. 14, March 18). Morgan Library and Museum.

'MOZART AT 250' Such, at least, is the working title of an exhibition of Mozart manuscripts, letters and first editions at the Morgan Library, which is otherwise doing such fine service to classical music this season with its new concert hall. The exhibition culminates in a rare first edition of the Requiem. Oct. 13-Jan. 7. Morgan Library and Museum.

GLIMMERGLASS OPERA This summer operation gives a precis of its coming season with excerpts from works based on the Orpheus legend by Monteverdi, Gluck, Offenbach and others. Oct. 13. Morgan Library and Museum.

BALTIMORE OPERA The songbirds of the New York City Opera's ''Semele'' migrate south for a production of Rossini's ''Assedio di Corinto'' (''The Siege of Corinth''). Elizabeth Futral sings the high-flying Pamira; Vivica Genaux, Neocle. Steven White will conduct, and Elizabeth Bachman will direct. Opens Oct. 14. Lyric Opera House, (410) 727-6000, baltimoreopera.com.

PIETER WISPELWEY Great Performers at Lincoln Center moves from the grand Beethoven of the symphonies to the intimate Beethoven of the works for cello and piano. But intimate as they are, they are not small in number or length. This excellent cellist is joined by the pianist Dejan Lazic in a journey lasting three hours (with two intermissions). Oct. 15. Alice Tully Hall.

CAPPELLA ANDREA BARCA That would be Italian for Andras Schiff. Mr. Schiff, pianist and fledgling conductor, and his hand-picked ensemble pick up where they left off last season, with Mozart: the Concertos Nos. 22-25 and the ''Linz'' and ''Jupiter'' Symphonies. Oct. 18-19. Alice Tully Hall.

ANNE-MARIE McDERMOTT Taking its cue from the success of its late-night concerts in recent Mostly Mozart festivals, Great Performers at Lincoln Center is introducing them into the regular season. Here, at 10:30, Ms. McDermott, a pianist, plays Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations. The pianists Jeremy Denk and Sergey Schepkin follow with Bach recitals of their own. Oct. 19 (also Oct. 20-21). Kaplan Penthouse, 165 West 54th Street, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org.

'ALEXANDER NEVSKY' Better late than never (though that seems a paltry goal for an orchestra that aspires to leadership in the field, or should come by it naturally). Here, at long last, the New York Philharmonic catches up with a show that has been circulating for some two decades, a presentation of Eisenstein's classic 1938 film with Prokofiev's score performed live. The orchestra's dynamic young associate conductor, Xian Zhang, takes up the tricky challenge of pulling it all together. Oct. 19-21. Avery Fisher Hall.

NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA To open the orchestra's season and its season-long survey of the Beethoven symphonies, Neeme Jarvi conducts the First and the Ninth. Oct. 20, 22, 24. Halls in Newark and New Brunswick, (800) 255-3476, njsymphony.org.

'COSI FAN TUTTE' Pamela Armstrong and James Maddalena join other singers in a new production by Tim Albery at the New York City Opera (imported from the Glimmerglass Opera). But the biggest news is in the pit, with the return of Julius Rudel to the City Opera podium after a 25-year absence. Mr. Rudel, one of the company's founders, directed City Opera from 1957 to 1979. Opens Oct. 21. New York State Theater.

'SALOME' There is considerably less of Deborah Voigt to see since her gastric bypass surgery two years ago, but to judge from the vampy photograph in a season brochure for the Lyric Opera, Chicago operagoers will see much of what remains in her stage debut in the title role of Strauss's ''Salome.'' The new production, by Francesca Zambello, also features Kim Begley and Alan Held. Andrew Davis is to conduct, barring complications from his arterial surgery last month. Opens Oct. 21. Civic Opera House, (312) 332-2244, lyricopera.org.

KIROV ORCHESTRA Valery Gergiev's four concerts of Shostakovich symphonies with the Kirov Orchestra and the Rotterdam Philharmonic last season as part of the Great Performers series at Lincoln Center left audiences hungry for more, and here it is: Nos. 6, 8 and 11 to 14, completing the cycle. Oct. 23-24, 29. Avery Fisher Hall.

NHK SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA This may well be the world's most famous orchestra you've never heard. Though it is widely known by reputation and by recordings, its visits from Tokyo have been infrequent. (It appeared last at Carnegie in 1999; before that, in 1969.) And this appearance is all too brief: a lone concert of works by Takemitsu, Bartok and Ravel, conducted by the orchestra's music director, Vladimir Ashkenazy. Oct 23. Carnegie Hall.

IVO POGORELICH The first question is: Will he show up? Like his early supporter Martha Argerich, this Croatian pianist is given to cancellations, and he recently dropped all of his European appearances this year except for the American tour, citing his health. We are assured that he will appear here. Thus the second question: How weird will it be? Mr. Pogorelich, while endlessly gifted, has often put his gifts to eccentric if not perverse uses. If it comes off, this recital of Chopin and Schumann is sure to be one of the most scrutinized and talked-about events of the season. Oct. 26. Metropolitan Museum.

TOKYO STRING QUARTET With the blockbuster anniversaries of Mozart and Shostakovich this year, it has been hard to focus on lesser ones. But it is also the 150th anniversary of Schumann's death, as this group points out, stealing a march on the Schumann bicentenary in 2010. Here are three concerts of Schumann chamber, vocal and piano works, culminating in May with the great Piano Quintet. Alexander Lonquich is the pianist there; Alon Goldstein is the pianist in the first concert. Oct. 28 (also Jan. 20, May 12). 92nd Street Y.

RENE JACOBS This conductor's record label, Harmonia Mundi France, celebrates him throughout the season, as well it might. He has made a number of the most acclaimed recordings of early music over the last decade and more, and his series of Mozart operas has been a particular success. (''La Clemenza di Tito'' is just appearing.) Here is a new version of Handel's ''Messiah'' sure to be unconventional, by new as well as old standards, with the Choir of Clare College, Cambridge, and the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra. His recording of ''La Calisto,'' by Cavalli, will be reissued alongside the release of a new DVD of the production. October. (Other releases follow, including a DVD of a production of Monteverdi's ''Orfeo.'')

STING What is a rock star doing on the cover of the journal Early Music America? Performing music of John Dowland on a new album, ''Songs From the Labyrinth,'' with the lutenist Edin Karamazov. It's touching, in a way, that he wants to come to terms with this plaintive and refined music. It remains to be seen whether he should. October. Deutsche Grammophon.

GIDON KREMER Or should it be Krystian Zimerman? It is hard to know which of these supremely gifted artists to give top billing. Mr. Zimerman, who recently showed again what a superb Brahms pianist he is in a Deutsche Grammophon recording of the First Concerto with Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic, joins the incisive Mr. Kremer on equal terms in performances of the three Brahms violin sonatas. Nov. 1. Carnegie Hall.

EARLY MUSIC IN GILDER LEHRMAN HALL Lovers of early music have to hope that the intimate and inviting new hall in the Morgan Library will give the antiquarian scene in New York the shot in the arm it always seems to need. Here, at least, is a modest start: the Flanders Recorder Quartet, in the first of three concerts presented in collaboration with the Boston Early Music Festival. Nov. 1 (also, Kristian Bezuidenhout, fortepianist, Jan. 25; Paul O'Dette and Ellen Hargis, May 15).

'NEW MUSIC IN THE ROSE' In this series the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center gives more concentrated treatment to contemporary music, otherwise spotted throughout its season: here, works by Avner Dorman, Stuart S. Smith, Kevin Puts and Huang Ruo. Nov. 2 (also Feb. 1, May 10). Rose Rehearsal Studio, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org.

MUSICA ANTIQUA KOLN Any early-music group with a name referring to the city of Cologne (in whatever language) is a good bet. But here is the group that more or less set the standard, directed by Reinhard Goebel in a program of mostly German Baroque repertory, including music of several Bachs. Nov. 2. Zankel Hall.

MSTISLAV ROSTROPOVICH The former music director of the National Symphony Orchestra returns to conduct music by his friend Dmitri Shostakovich: the Symphonies No. 10 the first week and No. 8 the second. The surrounding concertos in this little festival are variously populated by the violinist Maxim Vengerov, the pianist Martha Argerich and the cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Nov. 2-4, 9-11. Kennedy Center, Washington, (800) 444-1324, kennedy-center.org.

BAVARIAN RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Mariss Jansons visited Carnegie Hall last season with one of the two great European orchestras he directs, the Royal Concertgebouw of Amsterdam. Here he brings the other one, from Munich, with top-tier soloists: the soprano Karita Mattila in Strauss's ''Four Last Songs'' (an obvious choice), the violinist Gidon Kremer in Bartok's First Concerto (ditto) and the pianist Lang Lang in Beethoven's First Concerto (not at all an obvious choice for him). Nov. 3-5.

ZUKERMAN CHAMBER PLAYERS This group made news indirectly last season, when Pinchas Zukerman, the music director of the National Arts Center Orchestra in Ottawa, and his wife, Amanda Forsyth, its principal cellist, took abrupt leave and diverted their attention to chamber concerts. Having apparently made peace with the orchestra musicians in the meantime, Mr. Zukerman and Ms. Forsyth form the backbone of the players here in three programs devoted largely to Mozart. F. Murray Abraham is part of the first, delivering Salieri's great soliloquy from Peter Shaffer's ''Amadeus''; he is perhaps more to be trusted in that role than when he hammed up a narration of Mozart's ''Thamos'' with the Brooklyn Philharmonic last season. Nov. 5 (also Dec. 17, March 25). 92nd Street Y.

HELENE GRIMAUD This fine pianist, especially strong in the Romantic repertory, makes her Carnegie Hall recital debut, playing Bach, Chopin, Brahms and Rachmaninoff. It shapes up as a big autumn for her, with the publication of her memoir in English translation, ''Wild Harmonies: A Life of Music and Wolves'' (yes, those would be her pet wolves), by Riverhead Books and the release of a new album, ''Reflections'' (with music of Robert and Clara Schumann and Brahms), by Deutsche Grammophon. Nov. 8.

'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' Remarkably, it has been a quarter of a century since the Metropolitan Opera mounted a new production of Rossini's perennial favorite. And this one, by Bartlett Sher (who directed ''The Light in the Piazza'' on Broadway), promises to be new indeed, somehow carrying the action into the audience. The Met audience? (These reality checks may be required for years to come.) One reason for the delay, undoubtedly, is that great Rossini singers have not exactly abounded. Here is one of the best in the title role, Juan Diego Florez. Opens Nov. 10.

ANNE-SOPHIE MUTTER Ms. Mutter and the pianist Lambert Orkis do for Mozart what they did so well for Beethoven in 1998, playing all the violin sonatas at Carnegie Hall. The problem is, Mozart wrote more of them, and the quality is not as uniformly high. Nov. 15, 17, 19. (The artists' recording of the works is to be released on Tuesday by Deutsche Grammophon.)

TRIO MEDIAEVAL The characteristic sound of these charming and gifted women is that of two sopranos soaring over a stable, velvety mezzo: as remarkable in its diversity as, when appropriate, in its unanimity, and always tightly knitted. The group, based in Oslo, plies two of its specialties here, medieval music and Norwegian songs, in what promises to be a delectable outing in the highly regarded series Music Before 1800. Nov. 19. Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266, mb1800.org. (The trio also appears at Merkin Concert Hall on March 28 in a program featuring music by Donnacha Dennehy.)

LONDON PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA Here's wishing Kurt Masur, now 79, the best of health and a fond return to New York. As this orchestra's principal conductor, he missed its American tour in the spring because of illness, and he recently canceled performances in Europe as well on his doctor's advice. These programs, including Brahms's Second Symphony and Beethoven's Third, will not surprise any who followed Mr. Masur's work at the New York Philharmonic from 1991 to 2002, but they promise much, with Elisabeth Leonskaja as soloist in Prokofiev's Second Piano Concerto and Sarah Chang in Sibelius's Violin Concerto. Nov. 27-28. Carnegie Hall.

'DON CARLO' Verdi's dark drama returns to the Metropolitan Opera with a starry array of singers. Nov. 30. [Article, Page 76.]

 December

HOUSTON GRAND OPERA Basil Twist and his puppets take over the house for Humperdinck's ''Hansel and Gretel,'' and all the talk is of the Witch, standing 12 feet tall and to be sung by a tenor, John Easterlin, doubling as puppeteer. Opens Dec. 1. Wortham Theater Center, (800) 626-7372, houstongrandopera.org.

ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA A ''Brandenburg'' Concerto No. 7? Or No. 1a? In a program of Bachiana, Orpheus presents Bach's ''Brandenburg'' Concertos Nos. 1 and 2, along with a new work by Stephen Hartke inspired by the First and using its instrumentation. It was not yet titled at press time; you see the problem. In addition, the pianist Jeremy Denk will perform Bach's Keyboard Concerto in D minor (BWV 1052). Dec. 2. Carnegie Hall.

NEW YORK COLLEGIUM In its ninth season, the collegium presents its first performance of Handel's ''Messiah.'' Don't expect a Victorian-scale inflation of forces from its fastidious English music director Andrew Parrott, but neither should there be any ideological tinge, like that stemming from Mr. Parrott's theories about the size (or lack of it) of Bach's choruses. More to the point, you have to hope that the group is in its best musical form, which was not the case at the end of last season. Dec. 6, 8. Church of St. Vincent Ferrer, Lexington Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 717-9246, nycollegium.org.

ANONYMOUS 4 In what may be one of the hottest tickets of the season, this superb female vocal quartet, which disbanded in 2004 after 18 years of splendid service to medieval repertory, reunites to further its work in rustic Americana, begun belatedly with the hit album ''American Angels,'' also in 2004. Here the singers are joined by the folksy instrumentalists Darol Anger and Scott Nygaard. For those who can't beg, borrow or steal their way into the small hall, the brunt of this program will already have appeared on the quartet's CD ''Gloryland,'' from Harmonia Mundi France. Dec. 7. Merkin Concert Hall.

AMSTERDAM BAROQUE ORCHESTRA When the Baroque specialist Ton Koopman collaborated with Carnegie Hall in a choral workshop last season, they had a hard time finding enough aspiring period instrumentalists of sufficient quality to produce really professional performances. No such problem here, as Mr. Koopman brings his own forces, first in a program of Christmas music by Buxtehude, Corelli and Bach with the Amsterdam Baroque Choir in the Stern Auditorium at Carnegie, then in Bach's ''Musical Offering'' and ''Coffee'' Cantata in the closer confines of Zankel Hall. Dec. 7, 12.

ORCHESTRA OF THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT In a program devoted to Bach and his heirs, Britain's elite period-instrument band seizes a last opportunity to salute Mozart in his anniversary year, and the tribute goes right to the heart with the sublime Serenade for 13 Winds (''Gran Partita''). Dec. 8. Miller Theater.

CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Pierre Boulez conducts, opening with Mahler's Seventh Symphony and ending with Bartok's ''Miraculous Mandarin.'' In a ''discovery'' program on the night between the full concerts, Mr. Boulez will put the Bartok on the dissecting table and analyze it before leading a performance of it. As another prime attraction, Pierre-Laurent Aimard plays Gyorgy Ligeti's Piano Concerto in the final concert, part of his Perspectives series. Dec. 8-10. Carnegie Hall.

'DON JUAN IN PRAGUE' Leave it to the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy to have the last word (more or less) on the Mozart year. The multifaceted avant-gardiste Iva Bittova sings Donna Elvira, evidently the lead character in David Chambers's ''recontextualized'' version of ''Don Giovanni,'' advertised as a digital media extravaganza. For all of that, the production is said to remain ''true to Mozart's music.'' (Tell it to Matthew Suttor, who is credited for musical arrangement and digital composition.) Dec. 13-16. BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org.

KAIJA SAARIAHO Her ''Adriana Songs'' are performed with works by Debussy and Sibelius. The mezzo-soprano Patricia Bardon joins David Robertson and the New York Philharmonic. Dec. 14-16. Avery Fisher Hall. [Article, Page 78.]

ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S This versatile group does its various jobs so well and faithfully that it tends to be taken for granted. It shouldn't be. It opens its all-too-brief Carnegie Hall series with an intriguing program centering on British music, conducted by Donald Runnicles. Arvo Part's ''Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten'' leads into Britten's Violin Concerto, with Midori as soloist, and the famous Purcell Chaconne in G minor introduces Elgar's ''Enigma'' Variations. Dec. 14 (also Feb. 15, March 15).

WEST-EASTERN DIVAN ORCHESTRA As conductor, pianist, lecturer and would-be diplomat (or is it provocateur?), Daniel Barenboim is everywhere this season. Here he conducts his orchestra made up mostly of gifted young Arabs and Israelis. The night before, they perform at the United Nations in honor of Kofi Annan on his departure as secretary general. Dec. 19. Carnegie Hall.

'THE FIRST EMPEROR' Tan Dun's new work appears at the Metropolitan Opera. Opens Dec. 21. [Article, Page 73.]

'THE MAGIC FLUTE' Julie Taymor's circuslike production of Mozart's ''Zauberflote'' at the Metropolitan Opera in 2004 was more a popular than a critical success. The Met is banking on that popularity with this abridged version in English, presented on afternoons during the holiday season at ''family-friendly'' prices (all things being relative). The full German version, which opens on Oct. 7, will be running at the same time: twice, in fact, on the same day. (Stage changes, after all, are expensive.) Dec. 29-31, Jan. 1-2, 4.

January

MARIN ALSOP This is the first of several weeks of Baltimore Symphony concerts that Ms. Alsop will conduct before taking over as music director next season. Her community spirit is already in place: this program celebrates the 100th anniversary of the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, and Peabody students join the orchestra in performances of Strauss's ''Alpine Symphony'' and Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring.'' Jan. 11-14. Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, Baltimore; Music Center at Strathmore (Jan. 13), North Bethesda, Md.; (410) 783-8000, baltimoresymphony.org.

'RUSSIAN ROMANTICS' The New Jersey Symphony Orchestra presents its annual winter festival, this one right up the alley of its music director, Neeme Jarvi (unlike the Mozart festival last season, which he mostly sat out). He presents programs centering on Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky and the Mighty Five (a k a the Mighty Handful: Balakirev, Borodin, Cui, Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov). Jan. 12-28. Halls in Newark, Trenton, Red Bank and New Brunswick, (800) 255-3476, njsymphony.org.

'ST. MATTHEW PASSION' Carnegie Hall's annual choral workshop split into two segments last year: one Baroque, one contemporary. Here it reverts to form with an intensive study of a single masterpiece capped by a public concert. The Bach specialist Helmuth Rilling conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's. Jan. 13.

RICCARDO MUTI Even before his acrimonious parting with La Scala in 2005 left him with time on his hands, Mr. Muti had agreed to conduct the New York Philharmonic in four weeks of concerts this season. He likes the orchestra; the orchestra likes him. Are there broader implications in the search for Lorin Maazel's successor as music director? Probably not. As for likes, Mr. Muti surely likes the Russian works he is conducting in the first of these two programs: Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto (with Vadim Repin) and Scriabin's ''Divin Poeme.'' But he loves the Italian works in the second week: Giuseppe Martucci's Piano Concerto in B flat (with Gerhard Oppitz), the ballet music from Verdi's ''Macbeth'' and Respighi's ''Feste Romane.'' Jan. 18-20; Jan. 25-27. Avery Fisher Hall.

CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA RESIDENCY It's a win-win situation, right? Miami gets to hear the Cleveland Orchestra in a concentrated way in its new concert hall, and the Cleveland -- strapped, like most other American orchestras -- gets a solid paying gig. It's that pay that has produced controversy: money that, an influential Miami constituency has argued, would be better spent resuscitating the defunct Florida Philharmonic (which was to have inhabited the new hall), supporting the Miami Symphony or otherwise cultivating indigenous resources. But hearing Franz Welser-Most conduct Beethoven's Ninth Symphony or Mahler's First on a good night in the new hall may ease whatever discontentment remains. Jan. 19-20, 26-27 (also March 16-17). John S. and James L. Knight Concert Hall, (305) 949-6722, clevelandorch.com or carnivalcenter.org.

EDGARD VARESE Alarm Will Sound presents a composer portrait. Jan. 20. Miller Theater. [Article, Page 75.]

DANIEL BARENBOIM In his original guise as pianist, Mr. Barenboim celebrates the 50th anniversary of his Carnegie Hall debut in grand fashion, with the two books of Bach's ''Well-Tempered Clavier'' on consecutive evenings. Jan. 20-21.

'THE SONG CONTINUES ' Or at least let's hope it does for Marilyn Horne, who has been battling pancreatic cancer. In any case, the Marilyn Horne Foundation and Carnegie Hall present their annual workshop and series of recitals. Jan. 23-26. Zankel Hall, Weill Recital Hall.

FOCUS! 2007 Although Joel Sachs, the director, and the Juilliard School undoubtedly began planning this year's contemporary-music festival, ''The Magyar Legacy: Hungarian Music After Bartok,'' long before the death of Gyorgy Ligeti in June, that landmark passing gives it added point. Other composers represented include some well known in the West (Gyorgy Kurtag and Peter Eotvos) and some not (Laszlo Tihany, Laszlo Vidovsky and Zoltan Jeney). Jan. 26, Jan. 29-Feb. 2. Peter J. Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu.

KIROV OPERA Having weighed in heavily on Wagner in Orange County, Calif., and on Shostakovich in New York, the Kirov forces turn their attention toward Italy with Rossini's ''Viaggio a Reims'' and Verdi's ''Falstaff'' at the Kennedy Center in Washington. The residency ends with a concert performance of Shostakovich's ''Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District.'' Jan. 27-Feb. 4. (800) 444-1324, kennedy-center.org.

GARRICK OHLSSON And here is a further retreat toward intimacy in Lincoln Center's Beethoven celebration, after the symphonies and the cello sonatas. Mr. Ohlsson plays the first of three programs of piano sonatas, including a couple of favorites: the ''Pathetique'' and the ''Appassionata.'' Jan. 28. Alice Tully Hall (also Feb. 25 at Tully, April 1 at Avery Fisher Hall).

February

ESA-PEKKA SALONEN Mr. Salonen conducts the New York Philharmonic in the premiere of his Piano Concerto, with Yefim Bronfman as soloist, and works by Mussorgsky and Ravel. Feb. 1-3. Avery Fisher Hall. [Article, Page 73.]

MINNESOTA ORCHESTRA In the constant search for ideal chemistry between music director and orchestra, this ensemble seems to have hit on just the right formula with Osmo Vanska, and to have embarked on a renaissance. Mr. Vanska, Finnish himself, is a master of Sibelius, who is amply represented here, and an absolute master of the Fifth Symphony, which ends the first program. And since he and the orchestra are recording all the Beethoven symphonies as their first major project, it is only to be expected that they trot out the Fourth and Fifth here. Feb. 13-14. Carnegie Hall.

BRAHMS FESTIVAL Well, at least it's not the waning Mozart for Lorin Maazel and the New York Philharmonic; that was last season. Or the waxing Beethoven; they did that in 2003. But Mr. Maazel also conducted all the Brahms symphonies and concertos in 2003, with the Bavarian Radio Symphony at Carnegie Hall. True, there is more here: the ''German Requiem'' and the underperformed serenades. Still, the idea is not exactly fresh, and the bigger problem is this: If you had to define Brahms in a word, it would probably be warmth. And if Mr. Maazel, whose conducting often seems antithetical to warmth, cannot muster some here, this could be a long, frustrating slog. That said, the first two programs look great on paper: the two piano concertos, with Emanuel Ax as soloist, and the two serenades. Feb. 14-15; Feb 17, 20 (also April 18-21; May 31-June 1; June 2, 5). Avery Fisher Hall.

'LOST HIGHWAY' Having opened its season with dance, not its usual activity, the Miller Theater now turns to another sideline: opera, though -- with its electronics and video -- not a conventional one. By all accounts, this work by Olga Neuwirth, a composer trained in the Boulez circle, is as inscrutable as the David Lynch film on which it is based. It is performed by the Oberlin Contemporary Music Ensemble. Feb. 23-24.

March

VIENNA PHILHARMONIC With these superbly accomplished and strong-willed players, a conductor's job most of the time is to stay out of the way. Daniel Barenboim knows them well and undoubtedly knows his role just as well. Though inevitably, the repertory is rooted solidly in the Germanic (Schubert, Schumann, Bruckner, Wagner), a Bartok program comes as a nice surprise (with Lang Lang in the Second Piano Concerto). March 2-4. Carnegie Hall.

'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' Now that Paul Kellogg has left as general director of the Glimmerglass Opera and is soon to leave the New York City Opera, it will be fascinating to see whether the two companies maintain their close, almost incestuous, ties. Here, at any rate, is a new production of a Gilbert and Sullivan staple by Lillian Groag, fresh from the summer season at Glimmerglass, where it met with slightly modified rapture. Opens March 3. New York State Theater.

LEIPZIG GEWANDHAUS ORCHESTRA This ensemble, as ancient and venerable as they come, nevertheless has something to prove to New York audiences after subpar performances of Brahms two years ago, led by its former music director, Herbert Blomstedt. It returns with more of its central repertory -- Schumann, Liszt, Strauss and Mahler -- conducted by its new music director, Riccardo Chailly. March 5-6. Carnegie Hall.

THOMAS QUASTHOFF Mr. Quasthoff, a bass-baritone firmly rooted in the Germanic repertory, might seem an unlikely choice to perform American songs. But no one who has heard him do ''Ol' Man River'' or ''Swing Low, Sweet Chariot'' -- or for that matter, the Sinatra-owned ''My Way'' -- as an encore will want to miss Mr. Quasthoff's ''American Songbook'' concert, part of his season-long Perspectives series. March 7. Carnegie Hall.

LEON KIRCHNER The Orion String Quartet performs all of his works in the genre, including the premiere of the Fourth, commissioned in part by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. March 7. Alice Tully Hall. chambermusicsociety.org. [Article, Page 73.]

'DIE AGYPTISCHE HELENA' Deborah Voigt follows Salome with another showy Strauss role -- the most beautiful woman in the world, no less, Helen of Troy -- in this rarely performed opera. She sang the role in New York a few years ago and recorded it with Leon Botstein and the American Symphony Orchestra, and now the Metropolitan Opera mounts a production for her, directed by David Fielding. (The brochure describes it as postmodern and fanciful; what isn't, these days?) Opens March 15.

BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Bostonians will undoubtedly -- understandably -- be looking forward to the program a week later: a concert performance of Beethoven's opera, ''Fidelio,'' starring Karita Mattila and Johan Botha and conducted by James Levine. But they should not discount this performance of Mahler's Third Symphony, also conducted by Mr. Levine. As New York operagoers well know from his performances of ''Parsifal'' at the Met, the works Mr. Levine loves most, he tends to love to death, clinging desperately to every last note; they become slower and slower, and more and more enthralling and satisfying. The Mahler Third is another of those long, warm baths. March 15-17. Symphony Hall, (888) 266-1200, bso.org.

INGRID FLITER This Argentine pianist's reputation precedes her, as the winner of the $300,000 Gilmore Artist Award this year, from recordings and from a concert at the Caramoor International Music Festival last month. She plays works of Beethoven, Schubert and Chopin. March 21. Zankel Hall.

COLIN DAVIS Concertos, especially Mozart concertos, are not generally seen as showcases for conductors. But that is much of what Sir Colin is about in his programs with the New York Philharmonic this season. In the first week, he conducts Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 19 with Mitsuko Uchida; in the second, No. 27 with Radu Lupu. And on March 28 he conducts both of those works, the Two-Piano Concerto with Ms. Uchida and Mr. Lupu, and Mozart's Symphony No. 32. For the rest he wedges in works by Haydn, Schubert and Sibelius. March 22-24; March 29-31. Avery Fisher Hall.

'LA DONNA DEL LAGO' For this venture into unfamiliar Rossini, the New York City Opera returns to the stars of its highly praised 2004 production of Rossini's ''Ermione,'' Alexandrina Pendatchanska and Barry Banks. Chas Rader-Shieber directs. Opens March 22. New York State Theater.

ARILD REMMEREIT This little-known Norwegian conductor made a mild sensation two seasons ago as a last-minute replacement first for Riccardo Muti with the Filarmonico Della Scala in Milan and then for Christoph von Dohnanyi with the Pittsburgh Symphony. Now New York-area listeners will hear what he can do when he actually has time to rehearse properly. He conducts the New Jersey Symphony in a program of Schumann, Grieg and Stravinsky. March 22-25, 27. Halls in Englewood, Princeton, Red Bank, Morristown and Newark, (800) 255-3476, njsymphony.org.

ST. THOMAS CHOIR OF MEN AND BOYS By now New Yorkers should know to look for this group's presentation of Handel's ''Messiah'' during the holiday season, perennially one of the best. (The dates this year are Dec. 12 and 14.) But an additional highlight is Bach's towering ''St. Matthew Passion,'' with the choir joined by the Musica Angelica Baroque Orchestra of Los Angeles and the Vienna Academy Orchestra, conducted by the noted early-music specialist Martin Haselbock. (This follows a performance on March 20 in Los Angeles.) March 23. St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360, saintthomaschurch.org.

'DIE WALKURE' The Washington National Opera adds the second installment of its ''American Ring'' to the ''Rheingold'' of last season. Francesca Zambello directs with an eye toward, in her words, ''American history, mythology, iconography and landscape.'' Placido Domingo, the general director of the company if not the opera world, sings Siegmund, and Heinz Fricke conducts. Opens March 24. Kennedy Center Opera House, (800) 876-7372, dc-opera.org.

NDR SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Christoph von Dohnanyi, who was just what the doctor ordered as music director of the Cleveland Orchestra in the 1980's and 90's, has appeared in the United States mostly as a guest conductor in recent years. But here he shows off the orchestra of North German Radio, which he now directs, in works by Alfred Schnittke and Gyorgy Ligeti as well as in standard Germanic fare. March 26-27. Carnegie Hall.

ST. LOUIS SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA David Robertson conducts two programs with, in the second, the New York premiere of John Adams's ''Doctor Atomic'' Symphony. March 30-31. Carnegie Hall. [Article, Page 73.]

'TURANDOT' No one ever mistook the imperious Turandot for sweet Cinderella. But two sopranos with Cinderella stories of their own -- Andrea Gruber, who made her triumphant return to the Met last year after an extended period of drug abuse, and Erika Sunnegardh, who got her big break at the Met in the spring after long years of waiting on tables -- alternate in the title role in this revival of the Franco Zeffirelli overproduction. Opens March 30. Metropolitan Opera House.

April

'ST. JOHN PASSION' There is a lot of big Bach in the spring, none more promising than this performance by Philippe Herreweghe and the splendid Collegium Vocal Gent Choir and Orchestra. April 8. Alice Tully Hall.

MIKLOS PERENYI If you missed Pieter Wispelwey's performances of Beethoven's complete works for cello and piano in October, or even if you caught it, you will not want to miss these versions by the fine Hungarian cellist Mr. Perenyi and his friend the formidable pianist Andras Schiff, who has been devoting himself largely to Beethoven in recent years. Unlike Mr. Wispelwey, Mr. Perenyi is doing the survey over two nights. April 11-12. 92nd Street Y.

'DER FERNE KLANG' Leon Botstein and the American Symphony Orchestra have a good record of setting operatic agendas with their concert performances. They resurrected Dukas's ''Ariane et Barbe-Bleue'' six years before the New York City Opera staged it in 2005 (with Mr. Botstein conducting). And in 2002 they presented Deborah Voigt in Strauss's ''Agyptische Helena,'' as the Met is doing this season. Does this history bode well in New York for the operas of Franz Schreker, which are already making headway in Europe? It may depend on how persuasive a case Mr. Botstein can make for ''Der Ferne Klang.'' April 15. Avery Fisher Hall.

NETHERLANDS BACH SOCIETY The Netherlands has been a hotbed of the modern early-music movement from the start, and this group, founded in 1921, claims to be the oldest early-music ensemble still performing there. Jos van Veldhoven leads it in Bach's Mass in B minor at the Metropolitan Museum. April 18.

'IL TRITTICO' Broadway directors continue to make major inroads at the Met (and this before the Peter Gelb regime has actually taken hold), as Jack O'Brien directs a new production of Puccini's triptych: ''Il Tabarro,'' ''Suor Angelica'' and ''Gianni Schicchi.'' James Levine conducts, and the stars include Maria Guleghina, Salvatore Licitra, Barbara Frittoli, Stephanie Blythe and Alessandro Corbelli. Opens April 20. Metropolitan Opera House.

SACRED MUSIC IN A SACRED SPACE You should by no means wait until this late in the season to check out Kent Tritle's invaluable series at St. Ignatius. But Mr. Tritle ends the season with the church's choir and orchestra in a particularly delightful work by Handel seldom heard in concert, the ''Ode to St. Cecilia,'' to a text by Dryden. Cecilia being the patron saint of music, this is also a celebration of sound, with Handel making the most of ''the trumpet's loud clangor'' and ''the double double double beat of the thundering drum.'' The program also offers a Handel organ concerto and Bach's ''Brandenburg'' Concerto No. 2. April 25. Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue at 84th Street, (212) 288-2520, saintignatiusloyola.org.

'LA FINTA GIARDINIERA' You might think that after a year bursting at the seams with Mozart, opera presenters would want to pack away at least the early works for a time. But here is a late flowering of interest from the Juilliard Opera Center. The work should benefit from the youthful good spirits that the students are sure to put into it. April 25, 27, 29. Peter J. Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu.

CHANTICLEER Ecumenism meets globalism in the premiere of ''And on Earth, Peace,'' a Mass commissioned for this male chorus. The Kyrie is by the Canadian film composer Mychael Danna; the Gloria by the Turkish-American Kamran Ince, to a Sufi text; the Credo by the Israeli-American Shulamit Ran, to a Hebrew text; the Sanctus by the British-born Ivan Moody, in Greek Orthodox style; and the Agnus Dei by the Irishman Michael McGlynn, the composer of ''Riverdance.'' April 26. Metropolitan Museum.

JOHN ADAMS With all the attention focused on Steve Reich's 70th birthday this season, the American Composers Orchestra has happily noticed that Mr. Adams will turn 60 in February. He conducts his own works: ''My Father Knew Charles Ives,'' ''The Wound Dresser'' (with the bass-baritone Eric Owens) and the Violin Concerto (with Leila Josefowicz). April 27. Carnegie Hall.

LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC In two concerts interspersed with the imminent ''Tristan Project,'' Esa-Pekka Salonen conducts the New York premiere of his ''Helix,'' Jean-Yves Thibaudet plays Ravel's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, and Renee Fleming sings songs of Strauss. April 29, May 3. Avery Fisher Hall.

'GOODNIGHT, ALICE' And good luck. Finally, the years of talk give way to action in the renovation of Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall is the first to go under the knife, but before it does, David Robertson leads the Juilliard Orchestra in a serenade evening, ending, appropriately, with Haydn's ''Farewell'' Symphony. April 30.

May

'The TRISTAN PROJECT' A pity. This venture by Great Performers at Lincoln Center was to have brought the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue into the New York concert whirl, but the building's audience amenities have been deemed not ready for prime time. Instead, the project has been wedged into the busy schedule of the hapless Avery Fisher Hall, losing in the process much of its reason for being: three evenings juxtaposing separate acts of Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' with music of Debussy. So it boils down to two semistaged performances of the opera, directed by Peter Sellars and with video by Bill Viola. Esa-Pekka Salonen conducts the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and Alan Woodrow and Christine Brewer sing the title roles. Here's hoping that Lincoln Center (or someone) will persist in bringing the armory into musical play sooner rather than later. May 2, 5.

'ORFEO ED EURIDICE' As if to acknowledge that Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, who died at the height of her vocal and dramatic powers in July, is irreplaceable, the Metropolitan Opera has turned over her role of Orfeo in a new production of Gluck's opera not to another mezzo-soprano but to a countertenor, David Daniels. The production, directed and choreographed by Mark Morris, with costumes by Isaac Mizrahi, is now dedicated to Ms. Hunt Lieberson. The cast also includes Lisa Milne as Euridice and Heidi Grant Murphy as Amor. James Levine conducts. But all of that for only four performances? Happily, one of them, on May 5, is on the radio. Opens May 2.

BETHLEHEM BACH FESTIVAL The Bach Choir of Bethlehem, Pa., which presents a festival every spring, celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1998. Now comes the centennial of the festival itself, with Bach's Mass in B minor and ''St. Matthew Passion,'' and special features including an appearance by the Paul Taylor Dance Company. You may hear better Bach performances, but you won't hear more heartfelt ones. May 3-13. Packer Memorial Church and other locations, (888) 743-3100, bach.org.

JORDI SAVALL Mr. Savall, who has built a wide-ranging career on an unlikely virtuoso vehicle, the viola da gamba, returns to his roots in two programs centering on that instrument. His New York concerts with expanded forces have been highlights of recent seasons. The programs here, though smaller in scale, promise to be no less compelling. May 9-10. Metropolitan Museum.

DEBORAH VOIGT There wasn't much information for this recital at press time: simply, works by Bernstein, Mozart, Respighi, Strauss and Verdi. It won't matter to Ms. Voigt's many fans. Brian Zeger is the pianist. May 11. Carnegie Hall.

'ELIJAH' Since Robert Spano and now Michael Christie have revolutionized the Brooklyn Philharmonic, hardly anything comes as a surprise -- except that is, for anything mildly reactionary. Mendelssohn's ''Elijah'' has long suffered a bad rap for the wave of fusty oratorios it inspired in Victorian England. It remains a great work, and if anyone can bring it to life for a trendy modern audience, it should be Mr. Christie. May 12. Brooklyn Academy of Music.

CHARLES ROSEN The venerable pianist, lecturer, critic and scholar celebrates his 80th birthday (May 5) several days late with his idea of a good time: grappling with Beethoven's last three piano sonatas in performance and discussion. Formidable party fare indeed. May 13. 92nd Street Y.

SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Michael Tilson Thomas's first concert is a felicitous mix: the Tchaikovsky-Stravinsky ''Baiser de la Fee,'' Stravinsky's Symphony in Three Movements and Tchaikovsky's underestimated First Symphony. The second, with works of Copland, Mahler and Strauss, works less well as a program, but the performances should carry the day. May 17-18. Carnegie Hall.

'WALL TO WALL OPERA: 1607-2007' Usually it is a single composer who gets the marathon treatment, and many of the musical choices are predictable. But here it is an entire art form, which could occupy days, weeks, months. Where to start? The event runs from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and is free. May 19. Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org.

FORT WORTH OPERA FESTIVAL The Fort Worth Opera has changed its spots: it is now an annual festival, and the highlight of the first outing is the premiere of Thomas Pasatieri's ''Frau Margot,'' opening on June 2 and starring Lauren Flanigan. May 19-June 10. Bass Performance Hall, (877) 396-7372, fwopera.org.

EMERSON STRING QUARTET For the Beethoven season, the grandest of grand finales: having led an 11-day professional training workshop on the Beethoven string quartets as part of their Perspectives series, the Emerson players go on to perform all 16 of them in programs larded with works by other composers, from Bach, Haydn and Mozart to Ives, Wolfgang Rihm and Kaija Saariaho. And for an encore? May 31; June 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17. Carnegie Hall.

June

BOSTON EARLY MUSIC FESTIVAL Paul O'Dette and Stephen Stubbs are the artistic directors of this granddaddy of American early-music festivals, a teeming biennial event now in its 14th season. The centerpiece consists of five performances of a new production of Lully's opera ''Psyche,'' with stage direction by Gilbert Blin. Carolyn Sampson sings the title role, and Karina Gauvin sings Venus. June 11-17. Cutler Majestic Theater at Emerson College and elsewhere, (617) 661-1812, bemf.org.

HEADLINE: Antiques That Seem New Again

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
THEATER has always been in the business of recycling and renovation. Even ye olde Greeks were retelling oft-told tales. But these days, as revivals seem to outnumber new plays, at least on Broadway, it is easy to point to their preponderance as evidence of the business's superannuated condition. And yet the ability to revisit classic -- or even just old -- works is one of the major glories of the theater. 
 Admit too that even stuffy old Broadway has a better track record when it comes to ''remakes'' than Hollywood, which cannot manage even to improve on cheesy sitcoms when it goes foraging in the past. Three notable productions this fall exemplify different approaches to the craft of theatrical restoration. 
The Roundabout Theater Company tends to play it sensibly, safely and respectably. The formula is simple: Take a classic, add a few stars and a director of stature, and mix. 
 This fall the company's slate includes a welcome revival of Shaw's twilight comedy-drama ''Heartbreak House,'' with a cast of reliable names like Philip Bosco, Laila Robins and Swoosie Kurtz as well as Lily Rabe, the daughter of David Rabe and Jill Clayburgh, who is displaying an impressive devotion to the stage at a time when most young actors have their sights set elsewhere. The director is Robin Lefevre. And the Roundabout deserves credit for its allegiance to Shaw, particularly as the 150th anniversary of his birth year comes to a close.
 Another season, another Stephen Sondheim revival? No reason to complain when they are exhilarating reconsiderations like John Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd'' from last year, which boiled the ghoulish musical down to its firm bones and rattled them beautifully. The satisfying partnership of Mr. Doyle and Mr. Sondheim returns this season with a new look at ''Company,'' from 1970. 
 Mr. Doyle, who won a Tony for directing ''Sweeney,'' is once again using an economy of means to unearth new riches in a much-revived musical. In literal terms that means that once again the cast is doubling as the orchestra.
 But the presumption that Mr. Doyle's unique musical methodology is merely a gimmick is refuted by this sleek, compelling production, which I saw at its premiere last season at the Playhouse in the Park in Cincinnati. Despite its treasured score, the rap on ''Company,'' in which the roving eye of a bachelor turning 30 traces the fault lines in the marriages of his friends, is that it has been permanently stuck in its period, as a sort of musical comedy answer to ''That 70's Show.'' But Mr. Doyle's production, which stars a magnetic Raul Esparza as the chronically unattached Bobby, cleanly ushers it into a timeless present tense without playing fast and loose with George Furth's book.
 ''My Deah,'' a new comedy by John Epperson, better known as the voiceless drag diva Lypsinka, typifies the reliable theatrical appeal of taking a fiendishly irreverent approach to a piece of antique dramaturgy -- in this case, Euripides' revered ''Medea.'' 
 I attended a reading of Mr. Epperson's spoof sometime around 210 B.C., it seems to me, and have been baffled by its failure to be produced in New York. Treading confidently a path forged by the respected auteurs Charles Ludlam and Charles Busch (possibly in similar heels), Mr. Epperson sends up the original by transplanting it to the Deep South. 
 Lypsinka herself will not be appearing -- a voiceless Medea is inconceivable -- but Nancy Opel, a dab hand at low-down comedy, should be perfect casting for the title role, a woman who makes your garden-variety steel magnolia look like a shrinking violet. The production, directed by Mark Waldrop, comes courtesy of the Abingdon Theater Company.

 BODY:
LUNAR PARK, by Bret Easton Ellis. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.95.) Ellis's phantasmagorical tale is narrated by a writer -- named Bret Easton Ellis -- whose first novel, ''Less Than Zero,'' made him a literary celebrity in the 1980's. Leaving behind the shallow glitter of Manhattan, Bret strikes out for the suburbs, marries the movie-star mother of his son and plods through a teaching job at a local college. But bourgeois malaise turns to terror when Bret is stalked by the ghost of his alcoholic father and by his infamous creation, the deranged Patrick Bateman of ''American Psycho.'' In the Book Review, A. O. Scott called ''Lunar Park'' a ''tale of wild chemical and sexual excess'' that is ''shot through with longing.''
JOHN KENNETH GALBRAITH: His Life, His Politics, His Economics, by Richard Parker. (University of Chicago, $22.50.) Parker's comprehensive biography describes how Galbraith (1908-2006), once the most famous economist in America, became a public intellectual, honing his famously aphoristic style. It is also, thanks to Galbraith's longevity and his battles with so many other economic thinkers, a fine one-volume history of economic thought in the 20th century. 
 GOD'S GYM, by John Edgar Wideman. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.95.) The 10 stories in this challenging collection push the boundaries of narrative and form, as Wideman wrestles with big-deal subjects: love and death and the mysteries of time. In ''The Silence of Thelonius Monk,'' the author imagines Monk speaking to him from beyond the grave: ''Who said I retreated to silence? Retreat hell. I was attacking in another direction.''
 GARBAGE LAND: On the Secret Trail of Trash, by Elizabeth Royte. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.99.) Royte, whose previous book, ''The Tapir's Morning Bath,'' followed researchers in the tropical rain forest, here tracks an assortment of garbage collectors, recyclers and sewage treaters, beginning with the men who pick up the stuff at her curb in Brooklyn on trash day. Why? To see how much damage she is personally doing in the grand scheme of things and how she might minimize it. As she makes her rounds, Royte encounters colorful characters and cites a blizzard of studies, statistics and experts to corroborate the assessment of a former New York sanitation commissioner: ''In the end, the garbage will win.''
 HALF BROKEN THINGS, by Morag Joss. (Delta, $13.) The 2003 winner of the British Crime Writers Association's Silver Dagger Award, Joss's story of psychological suspense revolves around a gracious country home left in the care of a professional housesitter, 64-year-old Jean Wade. Without realizing she has suffered a psychotic break, Jean plays lady of the manor, ensnaring two equally lost souls -- a clever thief and a pregnant teenager -- in her fantasy.
 PORNIFIED: How Pornography Is Damaging Our Lives, Our Relationships, and Our Families, by Pamela Paul. (Owl/Holt, $15.) Paul, a journalist and the author of ''The Starter Marriage and the Future of Matrimony,'' argues that an increased supply of pornography -- fueled by the often violent porn on the Internet -- is creating sex addicts and splintering families.
 THE PAINTED DRUM, by Louise Erdrich. (Harper Perennial, $13.95.) A ceremonial drum magically linked to children and death is the centerpiece of Erdrich's latest novel set among the Ojibwa. While appraising the estate of a family descended from an Indian trader, Faye Travers, herself one-quarter Ojibwa, discovers the object and vows to return it to the North Dakota reservation where it was created. The novel, told from various perspectives, follows the drum's multigenerational history. Our reviewer, Benjamin Markovits, said Erdrich's ''fictionalized version of the real Ojibwa tribe is a brilliant creation: it possesses the instantly persuasive strangeness of something faithful to life.''
 THE SHAME OF THE NATION: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America, by Jonathan Kozol. (Three Rivers, $14.95.) Over a five-year period, Kozol visited approximately 60 schools in 11 states, finding children of the poor and minorities trapped, almost uniformly, in old schools that are overcrowded, in poor repair, with scanty teaching materials, and staffed by generally underqualified teachers.
 TRUE STORY: Murder, Memoir, Mea Culpa, by Michael Finkel. (Harper Perennial, $14.95.) Finkel, a disgraced freelance journalist, recounts the bizarre story of the murderer who assumed his identity, and comes to terms with his own career (in 2002 he was caught inventing a character in an article for The New York Times Magazine).

Approximately 20 percent of all American homeowners now own second houses, according to the National Association of Realtors. This does not include the number of second homes abroad; that figure has yet to be calculated. But Delores Conway, director of the Casden Real Estate Economics Forecast at the University of Southern California's Lusk Center for Real Estate, says it's significant and increasing. ''There is a very broad trend that shows that Americans, especially baby boomers, are pursuing unique living experiences,'' she says, ''and vacation homes outside the country are part of that trend.'' Still, prospective buyers need to be aware of local laws, customs and real estate regulations. Here is a guide to some of the most dynamic foreign second-home markets.
BAHAMAS
 Vital stats: 
 The Bahamas is a 100,000-square-mile archipelago with 700 islands, including uninhabited cays and large rocks. Approximately 20 percent of the islands' homes are foreign owned, and the majority of foreign owners are Americans. Available properties range from a condo in the casino haven of Paradise Island to a remote island bungalow on Eleuthera. 
 Travel time: 
 To Nassau by air, 3 hours from New York, 312 hours from Chicago, 7 hours from Los Angeles.
 Types of ownership: 
 Leasehold estates, where a buyer does not actually own property but obtains a recorded long-term lease, and freehold titles, where a buyer owns property, with a title in his or her name. 
 Financials:
 Foreign buyers can make transactions in American dollars but must register with the Central Bank of the Bahamas. In the event of a sale in Bahamian dollars, only those owners who registered their initial purchase can convert money back to American dollars to take out 
 of the country. Local homeowners' insurance is recommended. There are no capital gains or inheritance taxes on homes. But income made on a rental property in the Bahamas will be taxed in the United States. 
 Restrictions:
 There are no restrictions on buying residential homes, but if you are buying an investment property with the intention of developing or leasing it, you must apply for government approval.
 PANAMA 
 Vital stats:
 Panama has an area of about 30,000 square miles, and it borders Costa Rica and Colombia. The foreign-homeowner market is dominated by Americans, especially retirees, but lately a younger American demographic is investing in everything from pieds-a-terre in Panama City to beachfront condos on the coast and single-family homes in the highlands.
 Travel time: 
 To Panama City by air: 5 hours from New York, 712 hours from Chicago (via Atlanta), 612 hours from Los Angeles.
 Types of ownership: 
 Foreign buyers are able to purchase only property that is titled (the majority of Panamanian residences are). Foreign homeowners are 
 granted the same rights as Panamanian homeowners to transfer and develop property. 
 Financials:
 Though local mortgages are available, many foreign purchases of residences are all-cash American-dollar deals. Local homeowners' insurance is recommended. There is a capital gains tax on the sale of a home, but property taxes are low (about 2 percent). There is also a territorial tax on income made from a rental property.
 Restrictions:
 Foreign buyers are not eligible to purchase the property on many of Panama's islands. And foreign-owned property must be at least 6.2 miles inland from Panama's borders. 
 MEXICO
 Vital stats:
 Mexico has long been a second-home market for Americans, primarily from the Southwest and California, who invest in properties like renovated colonial homes in central Mexico, condos on the Mayan Riviera and villas in the rapidly developing high-end resort communities of the Pacific Coast. 
 Travel time: 
 To Mexico City by air: 5 hours from New York, 4 hours from Chicago, 312 hours from Los Angeles. 
 Types of ownership: 
 Mexico's Constitution stipulates two kinds of ownership: freehold title ownership and a fideicomiso, or long-term trust that lasts for 50 years and is renewable in perpetuity. 
 Financials:
 Though local mortgages are becoming more readily available to foreigners, foreign purchase of Mexican residential property is typically done in all-cash American-dollar deals. There is generally no inheritance tax, and compared with the United States, Mexico's property taxes are very low (about 0.3 percent). 
 Restrictions:
 Mexico's Constitution bans foreigners from freehold ownership within 30 miles of the coastline or 60 miles of any border. 
 BRITISH COLUMBIA
 Vital stats:
 Canada's westernmost province is made up of nearly 370,000 square miles of rivers, lakes, mountains, beaches, plains and islands, with a climate temperate enough for a visitor to golf and ski on the same day. American buyers -- especially from the Northwest, California, Texas and Florida -- have increasingly been looking here for second homes, ranging from a family retreat on Okanagan 
 Lake, in British Columbia's wine 
 country, to a town house in Victoria, 
 on Vancouver Island.
 Travel time: 
 To Vancouver by air: 512 hours from New York, 412 hours from Chicago, 212 hours from Los Angeles.
 Types of ownership: 
 Freehold is the most common type of ownership. 
 Financials:
 Typically, a foreigner will either pay all cash in Canadian dollars or obtain a local mortgage on the property requiring an average down payment of 30 to 35 percent. There are taxes on buying real estate, as well as on property, capital gains, inheritance and income earned on a property. 
 Restrictions:
 There are no significant restrictions on what foreigners can buy in British Columbia. 
 ITALY
 Vital stats:
 Italy has long been a popular vacation destination for both Europeans and Americans. More recently, it has also become a popular second-home locale for Americans, particularly Tuscany, Liguria and Lombardy, along with the lake district, the Alps, the Isle of Capri, the Amalfi coast, Sardinia and Sicily. 
 Travel time:
 To Rome by air: 8 hours from New York, 9 hours from Chicago, 1512 hours from Los Angeles.
 Types of ownership:
 Most Italian properties are freehold.
 Financials:
 A 10 percent down payment is typically required for the purchase of a 
 property, and a preliminary contract must be signed and overseen by a notary. Mortgages are available through local institutions, but generally foreign lenders will offer better terms. A sale is complete when the full payment is made and a final deed or conveyance of transfer is signed before a notary. Currency other than euros used in a sale must be officially documented should a seller wish to repatriate the proceeds. Income tax from a rental property is high in Italy (from 10 to 60 percent). There are also property taxes, inheritance taxes and,in some cases, capital gains taxes.
 Restrictions:
 There are no restrictions on foreign ownership.
 Dubai
 Vital stats:
 Dubai is the second-largest of the seven states that make up the United Arab Emirates. With an area of 1,500 square miles, Dubai is a business hub of the Middle East situated on the banks of the Dubai Creek, an inlet of the Persian Gulf. Recently, it has also become a high-end exotic destination for Europeans and Americans. Residential development is brisk. 
 Travel time: 
 To Dubai: 13 hours from New York, 
 1612 hours from Chicago, 18 hours from Los Angeles. 
 Types of ownership: 
 Earlier this year, new laws were announced that allow foreigners full ownership of freehold land and property. 
 Financials:
 Investments can be made using a United States bank account with funds transferred directly to the developer. But it is generally recommended that 
 buyers have a foreign exchange account to get the best rates on money transfers. Owning a property in Dubai entitles you and a spouse to residency visas, which allow you to have bank accounts and to incorporate in Dubai, where there is no income tax. 
 Restrictions:
 There are still certain freehold zones where only nationals can own property. Camille Sweeney

HEADLINE: THE MATCH MAKER

BYLINE: By Mimi Swartz. 
Mimi Swartz, who lives in Houston, is an executive editor at Texas Monthly.

 BODY:
There are many reasons why, when you meet Janie Miller, you might be baffled by her 40-year success as a high-end real estate agent and, particularly, as a high-end agent in Houston. She owns but does not use a cellphone. (''I never turn it on,'' she explains. Her daughter Beth Rivera, who is sometimes her assistant, says, ''She's not good at electronics.'') Though Miller is 72, she has not had any cosmetic surgery; in fact, she doesn't really like to wear makeup. She does not go out to lunch at tony places with tony people so that her name will appear in the society columns; she rarely eats lunch at all, unless you count the sandwiches and cookies she cadges while touring open houses. Miller knows how to wear a proper St. John suit, but she prefers to work in a bright red Mexican wedding dress worn with scarlet patent-leather driving flats. She does live in one of Houston's most expensive neighborhoods, but in one of the few houses with a market value of less than $1 million. 
Despite these proclivities, Miller is something of a local phenomenon, partly because she has been selling homes in this city's most storied (and expensive) neighborhood, River Oaks, since the mid-1960's, and also because, in the process, she has been ranked one of the city's top real estate agents countless times. Not coincidentally, she has also maintained a reputation among her competitors as one of the city's most relentless sellers of fine homes. There are potential clients who say they don't want to do ''the Janie thing,'' a nice way of saying they don't want to put up with her. When you sign on with Miller, you don't just buy or sell a house so much as you buy into her vision of the world. ''I've always been the best-kept secret in River Oaks,'' she tells me in a lilting Southern accent, a vestige of her Memphis upbringing. ''I don't sell; I help people find things. But when I do have something to sell, I pull out all the stops.''
 A fairly typical example of Miller pulling out all the stops involves a client named Melissa Kean, who first encountered Miller in 1996. Kean was then a Rice University graduate student, and her husband, Steve, was an energy company executive. The Keans had two young daughters and were living in a Houston neighborhood known as Memorial, a prosperous suburb of large, pine-shaded lots and good public schools, the kind of place where the mothers play tennis instead of working and most of the residents are wealthy and intensely loyal supporters of George W. Bush. The Keans had landed in Memorial directly from Omaha, and Melissa, a historian who likes nothing more than heated intellectual debates, had never felt comfortable there. The traffic-clogged commute was also a problem. In her spare time, she had taken to exploring open houses closer to Rice, particularly in River Oaks. It was out of her price range, but, she told herself, she was only looking.
 One day, Kean followed a trail of balloons to an open house. (For-sale signs are not allowed in River Oaks; this was Janie Miller's way of bending the rules.) Built during one of Houston's early oil booms in the 1920's, the neighborhood is home to swashbucklers like Oscar Wyatt Jr., the recently indicted oil and gas mogul, as well as descendants of many of the first oil families. Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay, the infamous leaders of Enron, settled there as well. (Andrew Fastow was in the process of building a tidy mansion there when the company collapsed.) Despite its glitzy reputation, River Oaks is largely a neighborhood of quiet, well-heeled people -- doctors, lawyers and hedge-fund operators -- who travel extensively, read books, send their kids to the better private schools and simply like being close to the center of things, including downtown businesses, the high-toned shopping mall called the Galleria, Rice University and the Texas Medical Center. In other words, River Oaks was a better fit for the Kean family than Memorial. 
 Kean entered a two-story, redbrick neo-Georgian, a staple of River Oaks housing stock, and encountered a small, peppy woman with deep dimples and twinkling eyes who wanted to know all about her. Within a few minutes, Miller, for that's who the woman was, cut her off. ''You can't have this house,'' she said bluntly. Miller thought -- actually, she knew -- that this particular house was too small for the Keans and that there weren't enough children around for her girls to play with. The house she would buy, Miller said, was just a few streets over. It was a somewhat larger neo-Georgian, with a bigger yard and lots of kids nearby. It cost around $600,000. ''But I can't afford to live in River Oaks,'' Kean protested. ''You will,'' Miller answered. 
 That this house was next door to Miller's is germane to the story; so, too, that she had a client who wanted the house but intended to redo it to the tune of $300,000, a big waste of money in Miller's book. Fortuitously, that client changed her mind -- how that happened is anyone's guess -- and Miller called Melissa Kean one day after they had met and ordered, ''Get over here and buy this house.'' One reason for the rush, she says, was that she couldn't bear the thought of Kean spending one more night in Memorial -- $(3$)You are not a Memorial person,$(2$) she decreed. But more important, Miller had taken an instant liking to Kean and wanted her as her next-door neighbor. 
 Kean protested that her husband was out of town. No problem. Miller said she would contact the bank and help Kean arrange a bridge loan. ''I just signed my life over to her with my husband out of town,'' Kean says today. ''She was so sure, I never argued with her.''
 Miller continued to manage Kean's River Oaks life, telling her where to buy groceries and suggesting where she might send her daughters to school. She even found people to put the Keans up for admission to what she considered the right country club. ''She did exactly what I told her to do,'' Miller says proudly, dispensing her highest compliment with a brilliant, accomplished smile. 
 ''River Oaks is a state of mind,'' Miller told me. ''You are selling ethereal things.'' Certainly some of those things are identical to the ethereals attached to addresses in Bel Air, Georgetown or the Upper East Side of Manhattan; as Miller says, ''There's no place to go up from River Oaks.'' The neighborhood communicates all sorts of information about residents' places in the world, their ambitions, their successes, even their prejudices. (For the longest time, deed restrictions prohibited owners from selling to blacks and Jews, for instance.) The Web site for John Daugherty, an old-line real estate firm, speaks to this fantasy in describing this neighborhood of gargantuan Tudors, Taras, Mediterraneans and mini-Versailles: ''Experience a way of life as beautifully crafted and carefully guarded as heirloom silver. Here is an exceptional collection of splendid mansions, secluded estates and fine homes in all price ranges.''
 But getting in to River Oaks has become much more difficult than it used to be. As recently as two years ago, a striver could buy a decent three-bedroom, two-bath house for under $1 million. That is scarcely possible these days, a fact that may not impress wealthy immigrants from the East and West Coasts but stuns most Houstonians, who are not accustomed to breathtaking real estate prices. During the oil bust of the 1980's, many people in River Oaks had to sell their mansions, and some of the best homes went begging. But now the Houston economy has rebounded. The wealthy who settled in far-flung suburbs now want to be closer to the center of town again. So a large number of very wealthy people are now battling for the same houses: River Oaks covers only two square miles and contains only 1,600 or so homes. And no one is moving out. Hence the hysteria: last summer, there were only 34 houses on the market, which translates locally as ''no inventory.'' It also means, as Cliff Helmcamp of Greenwood King Properties puts it, that ''the asking price is the starting price.'' 
 This is where a person like Janie Miller comes in. It is her job to know what a house is worth and who might want to buy it, preferably before the owners even know they want to sell. To accomplish that goal, she has to play, in her words, ''psychiatrist, marriage counselor and child rearer.'' If there are psychological issues facing every home buyer and seller -- Am I worthy of this mega-mansion? Is 20,000 square feet really big enough? -- it is up to Miller to keep things pragmatic and, above all, moving forward. To do so, she has adopted the persona of a classic River Oaks type, only more so. She's a cross between a Larry McMurtry heroine -- think Aurora Greenway in ''Terms of Endearment'' -- and the despot of a small, elite country. Somehow, in the rapaciously ambitious but perpetually needy world of upper-class Houston, this works spectacularly. Last year Miller sold 33 properties with an average selling price of more than $1 million, at her standard 6 percent commission, which is divided between the sellers' and buyers' brokers and agents. ''And I don't cut,'' she says.
 One day this summer I drove through River Oaks with Miller in her late-model silver Lexus. Touring the shaded, winding roads, she raked her gaze across the streets like a hungry tiger, in search of the increasingly scarce housing stock that might suit her clients. Many of the homes either built or restored by the newest rich make her unhappy. ''That one has been fauxed to death,'' she complained. ''This one was painted to look like the Place des Vosges in Paris, but they missed it a little bit.'' 
 ''Know the market'' is the first rule of all accomplished real estate agents, and this means knowing not only what homes should cost but who might sell or buy if prodded. Miller's River Oaks chronicles mostly involve people who did or did not buy or sell a house when she told them to. She started concentrating almost exclusively on this turf several decades ago; people who sell all over the city, Miller says, lack the expertise to sell any one locale well. She knows which mansion was bought for a local prostitute in the 1960's and she knows whose marriage is currently rocky, who was recently widowed, who is being transferred, whose business is struggling and who has, in her opinion, simply stayed too long at the fair. ''She needs to sell that house because her husband died a long time ago,'' Miller said, indicating one home that seemed in serious need of renovation. Pointing to another, she said, ''I talked to someone today about selling that house, but I don't think she should sell it.'' She has a mental hard drive on which she stores decades of prices, and she remembers bad paint choices and clunky additions as if they were crimes against humanity. 
 Passing by one stone manse, Miller recalled that the owner rejected her constant pleas to sell. (Miller has a reputation for strolling through River Oaks and asking unsuspecting owners to name their price.) ''This man turned down $5 million from me because he couldn't find another place to go,'' she said, still exasperated. ''And his house is worth $4 million at the most.''
 Warren Strauss, a colleague of Miller's, says that the broker who caters to the truly wealthy has to be on call ''24/7/365.'' It is also true that today's rich home buyers and sellers are better informed than their predecessors, using the Internet to keep abreast of prices and availability. ''People are educated, so they are not going to overpay,'' says Joan Murphy, of Greenwood King Properties. The wives of very rich men also have a lot of time on their hands and, when it comes to house hunting, are always on the lookout for the most elusive prize, the house no one else knows is for sale. That house, along with being at least 6,000 square feet and filled with light, must contain: a kitchen stocked with restaurant-quality equipment and fitted with white marble countertops, a saltwater swimming pool, a private bathroom for every inhabitant, his and hers offices, a media room, a catering kitchen/butler's pantry, a wine cellar or cave (pronounced ''cahv''), a three-car garage and a sprawling kids' playroom, preferably on its own floor. 
 In other words, the high-end agent who wants to remain a high-end agent has to stay one step ahead of the people she caters to. Miller spends nights at her cluttered desk scouring the Web for new listings that might come up in the middle of the night, so that she can be ready with fresh news to bestow upon her clients. For the serious ones, the 15 or 20 who at any given time ''can be there in five minutes with a check, '' she says, she keeps a list of about 250 houses that might come on the market in any given week.
 While many real estate agents indulge and placate, Miller practices her own form of tough love. ''I don't tell people what they want to hear; I tell them what they need to know,'' she says. Hire her to sell your house, and you get orders; she knows that almost everyone sets prices for their homes that are too high, and she won't go along. She keeps a printed maxim over her desk that says, ''Having it all doesn't necessarily mean having it all at once,'' and it's pretty clear she isn't talking about herself. 
 Once Miller does agree to take on a listing, the rest of her world falls away. She and her assistant Betty Perrier are willing to give a house a total makeover before anyone sees it. (Miller won't even look at a house until the owner has cleaned out all the closets.) Other firms might suggest a paint job and probably hire ''stagers'' to rearrange furniture or set out fresh flowers and hot cookies. That's just the beginning for Miller. ''Get aspidistra, liriope, etc. from Janie's yard or clean out from somebody else's yard and fill bare spots'' is one item on her ''new-listing checklist.'' Miller's own home often looks somewhat threadbare, because she is forever dispatching her antiques and artwork to spruce up the houses for sale. ''One client had a balcony with old AstroTurf,'' she said, shuddering at the memory.
 Miller also spends about $100,000 a year on newspaper ads that she writes herself for the houses she sells. These are gems of subliminal persuasion, far longer than the usual real estate ads, and are filled with the names of noted local architects, the best schools and, generally, the folkways of River Oaks. She employs the patois of neighborhood moms -- Miller uses the word ''super'' a lot -- but also knows how to appeal to the idealized notion of a ''man of the house.'' One home had a ''great room'' she described as having ''hand-hewn beams, a vaulted ceiling, wide-plank floors, a wall of bookcases, plenty of space for hunting trophies.'' After Hurricane Katrina, Miller reached out to well-heeled refugees: ''The whole backyard could have been transplanted from the Garden District!''
 If you are house hunting instead of house selling with Miller, she really has only one rule: You do exactly as she says. Taste is important, but not as important as whether or not the family will be happy in a given house, and Miller insists she knows better than her clients what will make them happy. Client satisfaction is important, because that is how Miller builds repeat business; they call her again when they decide to sell for reasons like job relocation, divorce or retirement. Miller categorically refuses to let young families buy beautiful homes on lovely streets where there are no children, for instance; she tells potential buyers to ''grab a kid in each hand and walk around the neighborhood at 5 p.m.'' She won't let busy executives buy in the newer, lavish neighborhoods outside Houston's Loop 610. When they have their hearts set, she orders them to drive the route to and from work during both morning and evening rush hour for three days straight. Putting a client in the right home boils down to just a few questions. ''I want to know what he does and what she does,'' she said. ''And whose time is worth the most money.'' If, for instance, one spouse makes $50,000 and the other makes $2 million, Miller tries to get the $2 million wage earner closer to work. But if children and carpooling are involved, she might change her calculus to suit the parent with the most child-rearing duties. 
 The most important thing, however, is to move fast. If you are sleeping, at dinner or at the rodeo with your kids when Miller calls -- the true life situation of one client -- you must stop whatever you are doing and meet Miller to sign a contract. One repeat client joked that when his phone rings in the middle of the night he should simply ask, ''Where do I go and how much earnest money should I bring?'' She writes letters to owners, telling them why her clients would be the best new owners for their home. (This is particularly effective when she is competing against builders, and the house might be torn down.) Above all, Miller has no tolerance for ditherers. ''When you see something you want, buy it,'' she says. ''Don't call your Realtor's best friend or your husband's secretary for advice. Just buy it, because six other people will want it too.'' 
 Miller had substantial exposure to real estate as a child, largely because her father, a Memphis entrepreneur who worked in Mexico and Cuba, had his financial ups and downs during her Depression-era upbringing. Her mother worked as a medical writer, but the family moved frequently because of economic turbulence, sometimes to bigger houses, sometimes to smaller ones, but always in fine neighborhoods. 
 After college, in 1959, she skipped off to Europe, alone -- ''Memphis didn't have much charm,'' she says. Miller wasn't a conventional beauty, but she had a pixieish, insouciant, decidedly Southern charm and soon talked her way into a job with the United States government. She returned to the United States in 1962, intending to make enough money in San Francisco to return swiftly to Europe, but instead ended up stopping over in Houston, where her brother had attended Rice and her mother now lived. Miller was in desperate need of work when a real estate agent suggested she give that business a try. She was appalled at the suggestion. ''Real estate was full of old ladies with black dresses and black hats,'' she says. ''They were crones.'' On the other hand, the agent pointed out, Miller could sleep as late as she wanted to and work her own hours. It took Miller six months to sell her first house, and a few years later she married Ralph Miller, a successful commercial architect. She continued to sell real estate while her two daughters were growing up, and if she was the only mom with multiple phone lines in the house, she was able to give her daughters the stability she lacked as a child, the same steadiness she enforces on her clients. 
 ''I want to show you something,'' Miller told me, pulling into one of the most secluded streets in a far corner of River Oaks, where the light was perfectly dappled and the birds sang in the trees. Miller rounded a bend and pulled into a driveway where a 60's-era wooden ranch house looked as if it might collapse at any minute. It had belonged to the wealthy widow of one of Houston's great benefactors but was subsequently sold to someone who never moved in -- not uncommon among the compulsively acquisitive -- and so was left to rot for 10 years on a street where other houses are now valued in the millions. Miller listed the house, for lot value only, at $1.9 million.
 She turned a key in the back door beside the garage, and we entered, passing a handwritten sign that said ''Danger! Rotted Wood!'' Despite Miller's $1,500 cleaning expenditure, the place still smelled pungently of mold. Gingerly, she guided me through a darkened hallway, undaunted and keeping up a stream of happy chatter.
 Finally, we reached an enormous room that was flooded with light, thanks to multiple sliding doors opening onto a perilous deck. Beyond that was surely the most magical view in Houston: in a city that is unrelentingly flat, the house sat on a secret cliff that overlooks Buffalo Bayou, a deeply forested ravine filled with towering pines. There was not a single skyscraper in sight. Miller watched my face as I broke into a grin at this rarest of views, and she, in turn, grinned wider, happy that I was so happy.
 ''I want people to see what they are going to see,'' Miller said, meaning that, thanks to her, they will see themselves sipping cocktails on their new deck or in their infinity pool, secure in the knowledge that they had something no one else in all of Houston had. That, in short, they would be happy.
 Miller looked pretty happy herself when she told me that she had two offers in the first 30 minutes that the place was put on the market. ''And that,'' she said, ''is how you market a house.''

HEADLINE: Making All Stops, From Reasonable to Ritzy 

BYLINE: By CLAIRE WILSON

 BODY:
FIVE years ago, no one would have bet on a housing renaissance in East Harlem, or on the farthest reaches of the Upper East Side as the next hot neighborhood. 
 Well, it's not exactly on fire just yet, and the hipster element hasn't discovered it. But more people are finding their way every day to the wealth of apartments springing up on the banks of the East River between 96th and 125th Streets and along tree-shaded blocks between the river and Fifth Avenue.
The city has set aside some new units for people of low and moderate income, but outside of those, there is a vast selection of rental apartments, condos and co-ops.
 They run the gamut from spacious no-frills units without amenities like doormen or gyms, to One Carnegie Hill, a half-condominium, half-rental tower with a pool, pet spa, people spa, outdoor barbecue pits, roof deck and children's playroom. 
 With two-bedroom, two-bath units priced at $1.32 million to $1.495 million, One Carnegie Hill is at the top of the market. Also, it is at 96th Street -- more Upper East Side than East Harlem. 
 But farther north, prices can be as reasonable as $400,000 for a one-bedroom condo or $699,000 for a 1,345-square foot, three-bedroom, three-bath unit with 500 square feet of outdoor space. 
 Price, above all, is the driving force for change in the neighborhood, which has long been considered one of the city's poorest and is still very short on services like retail shops and restaurants. 
 According to Valerie Dominguez, a broker with the Corcoran Group, East Harlem buyers are willing to trade those things, and building luxuries, for bargains on extra space. ''They will give up the doormen and gem amenities and buy just the apartment,'' she said. ''People are coming up here for value.'' 

What You'll Find
 East Harlem has 13 public housing projects, one of the largest concentrations in the city, with a population of 35,000. Among these are blocks of former tenements and brownstones, some refurbished, like the row declared a landmark on the north side of East 118th Street between Pleasant Avenue and First Avenue. 
 Few are as grand as their West Harlem counterparts, but they are much cheaper to buy when they come onto the market, and fixer-uppers are still available. Buildable vacant lots are disappearing quickly. Many of the remaining ones have been turned into gardens which, at this time of the year, are filled with tomatoes, basil and sunflowers. 
 A majority of East Harlem residents are young Hispanic families, many of them immigrants. New strictly regulated housing built by private developers with city-assisted financing offers both rental and purchase options.
 Town houses on East 118th Street between Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue, for instance, are for sale as part of this arrangement. Apartments in the Hampton Court, a 230-unit complex built by Glenwood Management, or the 238-unit Aspen, built by BFC Partners and L & M Equity, are for rent. Twenty percent of these rental units are reserved for low-income tenants; in exchange for these, the developer gets either a parcel of city-owned land free of charge, or state- or city-issued bonds to finance low-interest loans. 
 Sonya O. Pua Scott, a broker with Citi Habitats, says newcomers represent a cross section of city workers, court officers, artists of all kinds and young professionals. ''Most people are singles,'' said Ms. Scott, who lives in the neighborhood. ''Or they are young couples with newborns.'' 
 At the Palm and the Rio, two new subsidized middle-income co-op buildings on East 119th Street built by the Briarwood Organization, 52 of the 110 units sold by lottery went to single professional women, said Vincent Riso, president of the company. 
 Singles also abound at luxury rental buildings like the Stamford, said Ms. Dominguez of Corcoran, adding, ''We have three Ivy League attorneys, a surgeon and a doctor, all in their 20's.'' 
 Being fresh out of college or graduate school, with high incomes but no credit history, some end up in East Harlem by default after being rejected by buildings downtown, Ms. Dominguez explained. 
 Michelle Gabriele-Plaia and her husband, Leonardo Plaia, looked for a year before buying a $560,000, 1,250-square foot one-bedroom duplex condo on East 112th Street earlier this year. They had rented nearby for three years and liked the neighborhood, deciding to stay because of the easy commute by car for Ms. Gabriele-Plaia, a fitness trainer in Scarsdale, and Mr. Plaia, who manages a restaurant in Manhasset, on Long Island. 
 ''There is always a parking spot when I come home,'' she said. 

What You'll Pay
 There are four apartments still available at the Crown, a nine-story, 30-unit condominium complex at Second Avenue and East 110th Street. According to Christopher Halliburton, executive vice president of Warburg Realty Harlem, they include a 2,800-square-foot four-bedroom, four-bath triplex with 1,100 square feet of outdoor space and two parking spaces for $3.5 million, and a 900-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath unit for $600,000. 
 Town houses on the market include a four-story, nine-room brownstone on East 101st Street listed by the West Harlem broker Willie Kathryn Suggs for about $1.3 million. 
 Two-bedroom, two-bath units in most new buildings rent for $2,500 to $3,000 a month. Of the new regulated town houses for rent, two-bedrooms cost $1,700 to $2,000 a month, according to Ms. Scott of Citi Habitats.

The Commute
 Easy access to subway express trains makes East Harlem convenient for commuters to all Manhattan business districts and downtown Brooklyn. The Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 express trains stop at 125th Street, and the No. 6 train offers local service along Lexington Avenue.
 Crosstown buses along 96th, 106th, 116th and 125th Streets meet buses running north and south along the avenues, and there is a Metro-North Railroad station at 125th Street and Park Avenue. Some new buildings offer shuttle buses to the subway. There is also a direct bus, the M60, to LaGuardia Airport.

What to Do
 The 18-month-old Harlem Tea Room, in a new apartment building at the corner of Madison Avenue and 118th Street, is one of a growing number of new restaurants and bars catering to changing tastes in the neighborhood. The cuisine scene had until recently been dominated by small ethnic restaurants and legendary Italian eateries like Patsy's Pizzeria and the exclusive Rao's, where nobody who isn't somebody ever gets a table. 
 Patricia Clayton, who owns the tea shop and lives in the neighborhood, serves light fare like sandwiches and pastry. Other alternatives include Camarades, which serves tapas; Orbit East Harlem, which has an eclectic menu; Ricardo Steak House; Piatto d'Oro, with its Italian specialties; and MoBay, which offers Caribbean food. 
 Shoppers in the area will have a Target close at hand when it opens in the 475,000-square-foot East River Plaza in 2008 -- on a site originally considered by Costco. The Home Depot will also open at the center, a joint venture of the Blumenfeld Development Group and Forest City Ratner.
 (Plans to build a 220-room Marriott Courtyard hotel at 125th Street and Park Avenue have been scrapped, according to a company spokeswoman.) 
 Besides Central Park spread out at its feet, East Harlem has the 20-acre Marcus Garvey Memorial Park on Madison Avenue between 120th and 124th Streets, as well as the 15-acre Thomas Jefferson Park, which is bounded by First Avenue, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Drive, 111th and 114th Streets. 
 Both parks have pools and recreation centers with fully equipped gyms, weight rooms, computer rooms, basketball and volleyball courts, tracks, soccer fields and dance instruction, among other things. The Pelham Fritz Recreational Center at Marcus Garvey also has a senior center. 

The Schools
 East Harlem parents have an array of public schools for children in the lower grades and middle school but fewer choices at the high school level. Many of these schools have fewer than 500 students, and some have fewer than 300. 
 A number are new charter schools and some are specialized, like the TAG Young Scholars School on East 109th Street, which teaches kindergarten through Grade 8 and has about 430 students. Of fourth graders there, 100 percent scored at or above grade level in both math and English. Among eighth graders, 91 percent scored at or above grade level in math, 73.5 percent scored at or above grade level in English and 98.5 percent scored at or above grade level in science.
 Another specialized school is the Manhattan Center for Science and Math, on Pleasant Avenue, which teaches Grades 7 through 12. Students there taking the SAT in 2005 scored an average of 455 on the verbal section, compared with 497 statewide, and 508 on the math section, compared with 511 statewide. 
 Roman Catholic schools include two that teach kindergarten through Grade 8. They are St. Bernard's School on East 98th Street and St. Ann's School on East 110th Street. 

The History
 City lore most often ties East Harlem to its thriving Puerto Rican population, from which came the familiar name El Barrio.
 But according to the Encyclopedia of New York City, all of Harlem, East and West, was once home to a Jewish community second in size only to the Lower East Side's. In about 1917, there were some 90,000 Jewish residents living uptown, side by side with Italian immigrants who started arriving in the late 1880's.
 The Puerto Rican influence grew most rapidly in the 1920's through the 1950's. The area now has a large Mexican population, although it is becoming more mixed. 

What We Like
 The wide streets, broad sidewalks and low-rise buildings, including a great deal of the new construction, make the neighborhood feel much less crowded than some other places in a densely populated borough. 

Going Forward
 East Harlem will be more desirable to live in once the retail and restaurant scene starts to catch up with residential development and the tastes of an ethnically and economically diverse population.

HEADLINE: When a Sweet Deal Turns Sour

BYLINE: By TERI KARUSH ROGERS

 BODY:
THOSE who bought an apartment in the last dozen years or so -- and who may well have fought to get it -- may be shocked and very likely offended to learn that they are actually living in a lemon. They are hardly alone.
 ''The concept of anything being hard to sell is completely unfamiliar at this point to a whole generation who have grown up in the market since around 1992,'' said Frederick W. Peters, the president of Warburg Realty, referring to the fact that in a rising market, buyers are more likely to snatch up flawed properties. ''A 20 percent increase in your value of real estate was like a constitutional guarantee, kind of like life, liberty and happiness. But buyers are more anxious in a slower market.''
That anxiety is creating a more expansive crop of so-called lemons, Mr. Peters explained. Defects like airshaft views are becoming deal killers as buyers agonize about how such shortcomings will affect price when it's time to sell. And with so much more on the market to choose from, buyers are favoring blue-chip properties over cubic zirconia or even diamonds in the rough. 
 So what is a lemon these days? Rising construction costs and more onerous construction rules in some co-ops have made a lemon out of anything that needs a gut renovation, once a mainstay of up and down markets alike. But many problems -- like impaired views, lack of light and high maintenance or common charges -- retain their repellent qualities in any slow market.
 Other immutable lemons include properties with extraordinary flip taxes, which may limit sellers' ability to negotiate, and buildings that don't own the ground beneath them.
 Consider the young couple who bought an apartment in an Upper East Side postwar building with a land lease in April 2004. They thought they had negotiated a good deal, paying around $600,000 for a two-bedroom, two-bath unit on the 11th floor with open city views and a full dining room. 
 Then they executed ''the perfect renovation for this kind of apartment,'' said Audrey F. Ruden, the Prudential Douglas Elliman broker who recently attempted to sell it. ''They didn't overimprove it -- they paid a lot of attention to the details that matter, installing a washer/dryer, a great kitchen and bathrooms, and windows with extra insulation in the master bedroom so it was soundproofed.''
 The couple listed it in April for $1.15 million. The apartment sparked intense interest from the 40 or so buyers who saw it, Ms. Ruden said. But the building itself sat on leased land scheduled to be revalued in December and every six years thereafter, an unusually short period for land leases, which are normally recalibrated every 20 or 30 years, or even longer. 
 Because of rocketing real estate values in recent years, much higher land-lease costs could increase the apartment's monthly maintenance of $2,170 by nearly $1,000. The apartment's only bid, for slightly under its asking price, failed to go forward. 
 Meanwhile, the remaining would-be buyers drifted away wistfully as they -- or their lawyers -- noted the likely spike in maintenance, Ms. Ruden said. The sellers took the apartment off the market in June; they plan to try again once the land lease is recalibrated in December.
 As with any citrus-y drawbacks, often the best strategy for a stricken seller is to offset flaws with a lower price. ''There is a lid for every pot,'' said Barbara Fox, the president of the Fox Residential Group. ''Everything is salable for a price.'' 
 Last year, Ms. Fox herself bought what she described as a lemon: a two-bedroom East 70's penthouse with a wraparound terrace, owned by a 50-ish Austrian bachelor, that had been on the market for more than a year. 
 ''Every wall had either some sort of gun or saber,'' she recalled. ''Also, every book on the bookshelves was about Adolf Hitler or the Third Reich. The apartment had not sold because the vibes were so negative.'' 
 The asking price for the prewar co-op plunged from $4.3 million, to $3.99 million, to $3.650 million. Ms. Fox and her husband, James Freund, an author, mediator and retired lawyer, bought it for $3.3 million in June 2005. ''We gutted every single interior wall,'' she said. ''We just purged it all.'' 
 But pointing to a major turnabout in the market, Ms. Fox and other brokers say that fewer buyers are willing to shoulder increasingly grueling gut renovations. The shifting attitude toward fixer-uppers seems to contradict the proliferation of home-improvement shows on television over the past decade.
 ''In the early 90's, during the recession, there was a whole cottage industry of people buying apartments, renovating and flipping,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the Miller Samuel appraisal company. Next, during the housing boom, ''there was such tight supply that people would buy anything,'' he said. 
 One reason for the growing disinclination toward renovation is that while the discount for a wreck has remained steady at around 20 to 25 percent, the cost of construction has soared, Mr. Miller said. 
 Mr. Peters of Warburg Realty blamed Hurricane Katrina for the spike in the price of building materials. ''It's hard to do a decent renovation in New York now for much less than $200 a square foot,'' he said, ''and even that's relatively low.'' 
 But cultural change may also be forcing the fixer-upper's fall from grace.
 ''In New York, every year it seems people work longer hours, so the truth of the matter is that the number of people prepared to undertake renovation seems to grow smaller and smaller,'' Mr. Peters said. ''They don't want to devote their leisure time to supervising a renovation.'' 
 Also, the intensive marketing sparked by thousands of new condominiums may have stoked a desire for immediate gratification and a tropism toward brand-new apartments. ''I don't know if all those new condos were built in response to a new demographic that just had no patience for renovation or if the new condos created the culture,'' Mr. Peters said. ''I don't know if it's the chicken or the egg.''
 Ray Kiswani, a senior vice president of Bellmarc, faced a double whammy when he was hired to market ''an absolutely unlivable'' wreck, a 500-square-foot junior one-bedroom in a prewar co-op on West 86th Street. The sponsor had tried to sell it for almost a year. 
 ''There was no kitchen, only a sink, and the wires were hanging from the ceilings,'' Mr. Kiswani said. ''There were no hardwood floors, just cracked concrete.'' 
 In addition, he said, maintenance was more than $2 per square foot ''because when the building was converted to a co-op, the attorney who did the offering plan thought that the attached terrace belonged to the apartment.'' Standard maintenance charges run about $1.50 a square foot.
 Mr. Kiswani asked an architect to create a set of renovation plans so that buyers could see past the dismemberment, and also persuaded the sponsor to offer a $300 per month rebate on the maintenance for three years. Two weeks after the apartment was listed for around $400,000, it sold in a two-way bidding war to Javier Frias, 27.
 Mr. Frias is negotiating to buy the terrace from the building so that he can create a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment. But it's taking months longer than he expected, which is another reason wrecks are less popular than ever.
 Another reason is that building boards are taking a dim view of renovations. ''The boards and the buildings have gotten so much tougher on their alteration agreements,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, president of Halstead Property. ''It's almost like one building will think of something'' -- yet another rule -- ''and another will add it. On the top of the list is 'summer renovations only.' What if you buy an apartment in June? 
 ''You have to wait till the next summer. So added to the cost of the apartment is a year's worth of carrying charges. And if there is a renovation following yours, you sometimes have to go to the back of the list again to finish up.''
 Just like apartments that need extensive renovations, a dreadful view can scare buyers away. The price penalty could be ''10 to 20 percent if you're looking at an airshaft or in very close proximity to a building, as compared to clearing the roofline of the adjacent building,'' Mr. Miller said.
 So how close is too close? ''If you're looking out the window and can read the headlines in the person's paper across the way, it's going to be tough to sell,'' said Marc G. Windheuser, an associate broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman.
 Jorden Tepper, a vice president and a managing director of Manhattan Apartments Inc. and of Manhattan Lofts Inc., said: ''It's not views especially but having some kind of openness. If you're looking into a brick wall, it will take a lot longer to sell.''
 Or not, with the right spin or the right buyer. 
 ''I used to hold my breath and say, 'This would make a great media room,' '' said Harriet M. Norris, a sales agent at Prudential Douglas Elliman, who was referring to a bedroom that faced a wall in a $4.5 million Central Park West apartment she marketed last year. She eventually sold the apartment to a banker who planned to use the view-challenged bedroom for a small child. 
 Dim rooms have also been pitched as photographer's darkrooms or meditation spaces. ''Frequently you can compensate if you decorate well and have clever lighting,'' said Mr. Peters, who suggested installing sheer curtains backed by small light bulbs that mimic daylight. ''It improves the situation enormously. You're less aware of something ugly outside the window, and you create the illusion of light coming in.''
 Other properties prone to purgatory include walk-ups -- particularly those on the upper floors, which are typically coveted by only a narrow subset of buyers. ''Usually it's a younger person who's just out of school who's maybe already lived in a walk-up building,'' said Jill Sloane, a senior vice president of Halstead. But buyers accustomed to living in an elevator building or those with young children are much less interested.
 The problem posed by a different sort of walk-up -- the penthouse apartment, often one added later, that must be reached by a flight of stairs after an elevator ride -- can occasionally be surmounted, literally: ''Sometimes with rich people, what happens is they figure out a way to bring the elevator up to their apartment,'' said Ms. Ruden of Prudential Douglas Elliman. 
 Brokers say apartments with tenants living in them, particularly messy tenants, are hard to sell, as are those owned by divorcing couples when one spouse is not in favor of moving and attempts to sabotage everything from showings (like canceling them at the last minute or loitering on the premises) to appraisals (pointing out the apartment's every fault). 
 Overly customized apartments (''I've seen stuff like bathroom tiles bearing the faces of the owner's kids,'' Mr. Miller said) or overly improved apartments (a glorious renovation in a rundown building) do not fare well.
 Maintenance much higher than $1.50 per square foot in a full-service building can also dull a buyer's appetite, as can a prohibitively high flip tax that handicaps a seller's willingness or ability to negotiate. A flip tax is money collected by a co-op board from a seller; it can be based on the number of shares held, although it is often a percentage of the sale price or of the seller's profit. Although very high flip taxes can have a negative impact on a sale, the opposite could be true for a more modest flip tax, Mr. Miller pointed out, because it helps the building finance future capital improvements. 
 Ms. Sloane is currently listing a $499,000 one-bedroom co-op in move-in condition in a brownstone on West 88th Street. It has 12-foot ceilings, a $521 maintenance and a whopping 33 percent flip tax. It was on the market for eight months with two other brokers and after a $100,000 price reduction, has been listed with Ms. Sloane since June. She said it has received no offers.
 Fortunately for sellers, it's tougher nowadays to be disqualified on the basis of location. ''There are no neighborhoods anymore -- it's just Manhattan,'' said Ms. Ramirez of Halstead. ''People have their preferences, but it's just, 'Find me a great apartment.' Whereas in the past everything was advertised 'East of Lexington.' ''
 While brokers contend that the one sure way to make lemonade is to lower an apartment's price, sellers beg to differ. Much like parents who are blind to their children's double chins, owners who were grateful to lay their hands on an apartment -- any apartment -- during the recent boom resist the notion that today's buyers may be less willing to overlook its drawbacks.
 ''I have an apartment I absolutely love,'' said Caroline Dawson, 30, who paid $379,000 two years ago for a duplex in a walk-up building on West 49th Street between Ninth and 10th Avenues. The 700-square-foot apartment has two full baths, high ceilings on the second level and a bedroom and sitting area in the partly-below-ground basement. 
 Ms. Dawson, who certifies fitness instructors, is moving to New England and has put the apartment on the market in May for $499,000. Her broker, Ms. Sloane, cited its ground-floor location as a turnoff for many buyers. ''There's been lots of interest,'' she said, ''but no one has pulled the trigger.''
 Ms. Dawson said she didn't look beyond the low maintenance (now $490 a month) and certain aspects of the apartment's aesthetic appeal when she bought it, failing to consider how the ground-floor issue might downgrade the duplex's charm.
 ''I never once considered the resale value of the apartment,'' she said, pointing out the positive aspects of a basement bedroom insulated against the summer heat and winter chill. ''Maybe I should have.''

HEADLINE: Performance Reviews: Many Need Improvement

BYLINE: By KELLEY HOLLAND

 BODY:
AH, September. Time to return from the beach, stow the pool toys, hunker down at work -- and, at many big companies, to prepare for annual performance reviews. But just how effective are those evaluations?
 The uncomfortable truth, in the opinion of many managers and employees, is this: not very. Performance reviews often serve so many purposes -- delivery of sensitive news, setting of compensation, legal protection if a fired employee sues -- that the discussions can be intensely uncomfortable and managers may rush through them.
''I don't think a lot of people enjoy getting negative feedback, and there aren't a lot of managers who enjoy giving negative feedback,'' said Edward E. Lawler III, a professor at the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California and the director of its Center for Effective Organizations. 
 Even when managers and employees do have sincere discussions, both parties often resent the time required to write about and discuss touchy subjects. And some companies use vague rating standards, so employees get few clues about how to improve. 
 According to one study by Watson Wyatt, the human resources consulting firm, only 3 in 10 employees believed that their companies' performance review system actually improved performance. In another study by the firm, almost half of the employers surveyed thought that their managers were at best only slightly effective in helping underperforming employees to improve.
 Some companies have tried to fix such problems by instituting forced performance rankings, also known as forced distribution or, less subtly, as rank-and-yank. Under this system, made famous by John F. Welch Jr. during his tenure at General Electric, managers sort fixed percentages of their employees into categories like ''superior'' or ''needing improvement''; those in the top group typically receive the best compensation, training and promotions while those at the bottom may be denied raises or promotions, or even fired. The idea is that all employees understand where they rank, managers face up to personnel problems in their groups and the best employees are motivated to continue to excel.
 While forced ranking systems have been used at some companies for years, their popularity increased rapidly in the late 1990's and thereafter as companies sought to slim down as the economy weakened. By some estimates, one in five of the largest companies had them in place.
 Almost as swift, though, was the backlash from critics who contended that rating -- and even firing -- employees by using a statistical curve hurt morale and teamwork, and that vague standards opened the door to bias. Several large companies, including Ford Motor and Capital One, settled class-action suits in which former employees contended that , among other things, disproportionate numbers of employees of a particular sex, age group or race had been laid off.
 ''A number of people who had not gotten a bad performance review throughout a long career all of a sudden found themselves at the bottom of this ranking,'' said Thomas Osborne, a senior attorney at AARP Foundation Litigation in Washington, which has participated in several of the cases.
 Empirical evidence is mixed on the effectiveness of forced rankings. A study last year by Steven Scullen, an associate professor of management at Drake University in Des Moines, and two other researchers found that if a company used the ranking system and fired 10 percent of lower-ranked employees, that company's performance improved markedly, but the gains shrank rapidly in successive years as the overall quality of the work force increased.
 ''It doesn't seem to us that you could expect it to continue to help you improve continuously,'' Mr. Scullen said.
 Not surprisingly, the combination of complaints and a lack of hard support for forced rankings has led many companies to change their forced-ranking systems. Some are adding more objective performance measures, like increases in calls on customers or sales, to give employees a clearer sense of how they are being evaluated. And many companies are simply eliminating the ''forced'' in forced rankings -- instead just rating individual employees on a scale without requiring that a certain percentage fall anywhere on that scale. 
 Ilene Gochman, the practice director in charge of organization effectiveness at Watson Wyatt, said she had seen a shift away from forced rankings and similar systems. ''Over the last three years, companies have stopped racing to do this,'' she said. ''It wasn't for everybody and I think that's what companies found out.''
 Microsoft, which is in the midst of its annual performance reviews, is one of them. The company began re-examining its evaluation system last year after Lisa E. Brummel became the senior vice president in charge of human resources. In her previous job, as vice president for the home and retail division, she had been evaluating employees by using Microsoft's longstanding ranking system, and she said her impression as a manager was that ''people were beginning to feel like their placement in one of the buckets was a larger part of the evaluation than the work the person actually did.''
 Sure enough, a posting in June 2005 on MiniMicrosoft, an anonymous Microsoft employee's blog, read, ''I LOVE this company, but I hate The Curve.''
 At the same time as that posting, though, Ms. Brummel was starting to hold meetings with groups of Microsoft employees in Redmond, Wash., and around the world, soliciting feedback on performance rankings and other management and workplace issues. She estimated that she met with more than 5,000 workers. ''Historically, we've been a company with a strong employee voice,'' she said. ''As we've grown it's been harder to find that unified voice. I can tell you that employees are finding their voice again.''
 Then, last May, the company announced an initiative called myMicrosoft, which increases stock awards to some employees, improves manager training and career development, makes a variety of workplace changes -- and revamps Microsoft's performance appraisals. Managers will sort fixed percentages of employees into categories rating their potential to rise at Microsoft, but the company will not make forced rankings of actual performance.
 Some skeptics question whether those companies that eliminate forced rankings can make reviews more effective. They challenge the basic concept of performance reviews by managers. 
 MARY JENKINS, a co-author of ''Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead'' (Berrett-Koehler, 2000) advocates a system in which employees themselves seek feedback from people they work with or who have skills they seek, then review a self-designed growth plan with their supervisor. She is using this approach at Genesys Health System in Michigan, where she is vice president for organizational learning and development.
 But performance reviews are unlikely to disappear. Many companies believe that a paper trail of reviews can protect them against lawsuits from former employees, and many consultants and human resources executives contend that well-designed reviews, along with frequent conversations about performance, can truly help employees improve and develop.
 It is instructive to note that critics of performance reviews have been around for a very, very long time. When the Wei dynasty in China rated the performance of its household members in the third century A.D., the philosopher Sin Yu noted that ''an imperial rater of nine grades seldom rates men according to their merits, but always according to his likes and dislikes.''

HEADLINE: What If The Economy Doesn't Land?

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
INVESTORS have been placing their bets on whether the economy will experience a hard or soft landing. One Wall Street veteran suggests a third possible outcome -- no landing at all -- and he will be looking at data this week to help weigh the odds of its occurrence. 
 Edward E. Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Oak Associates, expects reports on consumer prices and retail sales to be tame enough to persuade the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady when its policy makers meet on Sept. 20. That may just give the economy the breathing room it needs, he said, to avoid an appreciable slowdown, let alone the recession that some commentators have said is a serious possibility.
Mr. Yardeni foresees a 0.2 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index, excluding food and energy items, for August and an increase of 0.4 percent or so in August retail sales. A Bloomberg News poll of economists predicts increases of 0.2 percent for the C.P.I., to be announced on Friday, and 0.3 percent for retail sales, to be reported the previous day.
 If the price index comes in ''somewhere between a disturbing 0.3 and a happier 0.1,'' he said, ''the Fed will look at it in the context of an economy that is still growing, although with significant weakness in housing, and that is behaving itself in a way that the Fed anticipated when it paused at the last meeting.''
 It may not happen often in Washington, but the central bank appears to be two for two in achieving its policy aims.
 ''One of the Fed's objectives a year ago was to take the froth out of housing, and it has significantly done that,'' Mr. Yardeni said. ''It also set out to keep energy from affecting core inflation. There is evidence that that's the case.''
 The benign numbers that he expects are consistent with 3.5 percent annual growth in economic output and 2 percent core inflation, which he described as ''the kind of growth you get when the economy is expanding at trend pace.'' It is a set of conditions that should be good for the stock market, he said.
 In fact, the talk among traders may soon turn to the next Fed rate cut, Mr. Yardeni said, and he pointed out how soothing that topic of conversation would be, compared with others in recent months that have produced ''one anxiety attack after another.''
 ''We've spent the whole year going through a litany of fears, from bird flu to monetary overkill to bursting the housing bubble,'' he recalled. ''I'm exhausted listing all the things to worry about, but none of these things has affected the economy or corporate earnings.''

DATA WATCH -- The first key report of the week, on Tuesday, will examine the nation's trade account. In the Bloomberg poll, imports are expected to have exceeded exports by $65.5 billion in July, compared with $64.8 billion in June.

HEADLINE: A Few Bad Apples, And Everybody's Sauce

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Directorship magazine.

 BODY:
BY treating all companies as ''black sheep,'' American regulators may eventually discourage fresh foreign investment in the United States, says Klaus Kleinfeld, chief executive of Siemens, the engineering and electronics company based in Munich. Here are excerpts from a conversation:

Q. Is it true that you and other European multinational companies remain enthusiastic about investing in the United States? 


A. That is very true. The United States accounts for 35 percent of the world market, but only about 22 percent of our sales are here. So we can still grow. Secondly, there are a lot of industries we're in where the U.S. plays a lead role not only in terms of key customers but also innovation. We have about 70,000 employees in the United States and a little more than $20 billion in sales.

Q. Are you concerned about recent political moves, like not allowing a Dubai group to operate ports or the drive by Congress to insert itself into the foreign investment approval process?

A. It's always a matter of concern to see the impacts of globalization and the reactions from governments. But we are very much a business-to-business company catering to different infrastructures. Even in the difficult times after Sept. 11, we have been able to win significant contracts. We bid together with Boeing for the first big airport security contract, and built it out in record time. And here in New York, we have been awarded the build-out of the subway infrastructure.

Q. Do you feel that you contribute to American innovation, or are you a competitor?

A. We contribute. We spend about $1 billion a year on innovation in the U.S. In Princeton, we have one of our four corporate technology centers. It is the worldwide competence center for pattern recognition. That technology started out from the medical side. We all grew up with X-rays on film, but you could never find them and they had to be redone. I remember the first time I saw a three-dimensional reconstruction of a CT image. Suddenly you can look at it and say: ''Wow, this is a kidney. Or a lung. Or a beating heart.'' Bringing those images together is what this team does. They understand the patterns.
They applied that know-how after Sept. 11 in the security area. We provide security for the long shorefront at the NASA launch site at Cape Canaveral in Florida. The problem was distinguishing between frogmen coming out of the water and the tide coming in or some changes in the sun and clouds. We have installed an automatic system that can make the distinction.

Q. Do you worry about the operating climate here, created by class-action lawsuits, the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules imposed by the stock exchanges?

A. Not really. What will help us is that we are a true international company. We have 470,000 people worldwide. Out of that, 160,000 are in Germany. We have 40,000 in China. We're in 190 countries. That doesn't happen overnight. It only happens when there is something in the gene code of this company that is very international. We've always had a philosophy that we want to be ingrained in the local society. We need to have an understanding of local requirements and we need to be able to cater to public and private infrastructures. We have to understand the public policies. That's why we've always worked very hard to weave ourselves into the society. I was very happy that when I left New York, where I was head of Siemens in North America, my successor, George Nolen, was an American.

Q. You're listed on three stock exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange. Haven't the reporting requirements complicated your life?

A. I think it has complicated everyone's life. The amount of bureaucracy that has come along with that has been applied in a very undifferentiated way to companies large and small. That has certainly added an additional cost.
 We know there are always black sheep. The question is, Do you want to establish a principle in which you say, ''We assume from the start that everyone is a black sheep and therefore everyone has to be treated like a black sheep''? Or do you want a system where you can go very heavily after the black sheep but also have a climate in which 90 or 95 percent of companies that are behaving can develop themselves and are not overburdened by bureaucracy?

Q. When you sit in Munich thinking about where you will invest, does this climate affect your opinion about whether you should invest in the United States or, say, China?

A. We are a long-term investor. It is not like we are heavily influenced by short-term hiccups.
 The fundamentals for the United States are very strong. Even if Asia continues to grow at a double-digit pace, the United States will continue to be our most important country for years.
 Look at health care. We just made two large acquisitions, one in in-vitro diagnostics, the other in molecular diagnostics. Those areas are defining part of the future of health care, and it's happening in the United States. We want to be where the action is. That's why we spent $5.3 billion and almost $1.9 billion to acquire those companies. 

Q. Many American chief executives complain about the business climate. Can you envision that it would ever affect your investment decisions?

A. Yes. It absolutely plays a role in decisions, but not if it's a short-term thing, almost like a fashion.

Q. In the German governance model, you have a management board and then a supervisory board. You are in charge of the management board, but you report to the supervisory board. How does that work?

A. This is one of the debates that you've been having after Enron and WorldCom. There's been research. The data I've seen is that you cannot boil it down to the structure. You have to basically go to the individuals who are involved. If the individuals can work very well together, if the chemistry is right, if there's a good operational mode, it can be done in a very positive way. I would not overplay the structure. Bear in mind, Enron had split the role of chairman and C.E.O., which at that time was the exception.

Q. What are your observations from a European perspective about the fluidity here among C.E.O.'s, boards and shareholders?

A. It boils down to having a great management team that can act fast, because today's world market is a fast, competitive environment. My mantra has always been: nobody's perfect, but a team can be.

Q. Is there a risk that if American C.E.O.'s are engaged in hostile relationships with boards or shareholders, they may not be able to respond quickly enough?

A. My impression is that if American C.E.O.'s don't have good relations with their boards, they aren't going to last. In today's world, the alignment between the board and the C.E.O. is absolutely crucial, independent of exactly how it's structured. One fundamental issue for people on boards today is to be able to judge what is truly in the interest of the shareholder.
 Some shareholders are getting very verbal and frankly don't have a track record to support their claims, so it's more crucial than ever for directors to understand what they are responsible for when it comes to value for the shareholder. Which shareholders are we really catering to? What's in the best interests of those shareholders?
