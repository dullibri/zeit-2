HEADLINE: U.S. Maps Ways to Assist Russia, Though Roadblocks May Remain

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
Almost since Boris N. Yeltsin climbed atop a tank in 1991 and hastened the end of the Soviet Union, Western nations have been talking about sending money to help him create a democratic Russia.
But in dollars and cents, the aid offered has never been as big as the talk of support. And the amount delivered has been even smaller, by far. 
 Now Mr. Yeltsin faces his biggest crisis since the failed coup of 1991, and the Clinton Administration is pushing an aid program from the major industrial countries of perhaps $30 billion that is considerably larger than last year's package and goes off in a different direction.
 
Past, Alas, May Be Prologue
 This approach, however, could go awry for many of the same reasons that last year's aid package did. The principal problems then -- chaos in the Russian Government and Moscow's hesitance about pushing through painful austerity measures -- persist.
To overcome those obstacles, the Administration is combining two types of aid: symbolic and financial.
The first involves some small concrete ideas that have been floated for years, like sending American farmers to teach about private agriculture and retired executives to teach about management. The point is to provide visible support for Mr. Yeltsin and show the Russians the benefits of working with the West.
But the Administration also wants to expand the big-money side, including a $6 billion fund to stabilize the value of the ruble against western currencies, a prerequisite ift Russia is to increase trade and foreign investment.
Also contemplated is a program to supply billions of dollars to protect Russians from economic hardship, and vastly increased loans by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to help pay for imports, modernize industry, repair deteriorating oil wells and shore up Russia's hard-currency reserves.
The new approach aims at making Russia's economy less dependent on foreign aid in the long run.
Administration officials say the program last year did not help nearly enough. Not only did Russia receive just two-thirds of the $24 billion promised, but much of that involved grain credits. While helping to feed hungry Russians, the credits increased the country's mountain of debt without fostering long-term solutions.
Administration officials say President Clinton wants Mr. Yeltsin to explain Russia's financial needs in detail when the two leaders meet in Vancouver, British Columbia, this weekend.
Mr. Clinton plans to present a $400 million package of direct aid from the United States, officials say. This would include food grants, housing-loan guarantees and financing to help new business, and it would expand to $700 million or more in the next fiscal year.
 
The International Effort
 The far larger commitment -- perhaps $30 billion -- will be sought from the leaders of the major industrial powers known as the Group of Seven. Foreign and finance ministers from the group are to meet April 14 and 15 in Tokyo.
The international package focuses on these items:
*$11 billion in credits for imports of food, machinery and spare parts.
*More than $9 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
*A $6 billion fund to stabilize the ruble, contingent on Russia's bringing down inflation.
*Deferral of more than $4 billion in debt payments due in the next year by rescheduling some of the $80 billion that Russia owes to banks and governments.
Much of this aid may never arrive for many of the reasons that aid fell short of promises last year: Russia's Central Bank may not be any more successful in cutting inflation, now running at 25 percent a month. Graft and poor coordination between Moscow and local governments could recur.
For example, Germany said it would provide $3 billion in direct bilateral credits last year, but officials in Bonn said they provided less than half that, mainly because Russia's bureaucracy and enterprises were so disorganized.
The Administration's new approach is intended to some extent to bypass bureaucrats and provide aid directly to the people, for example, by setting up a fund run by foreign officials to provide seed money for new businesses.
 
A More Willing I.M.F.
 The Administration is also planning to pressure the I.M.F. to act more like an engaged partner than a conservative banker. The hope is that the fund will work harder -- and be somewhat less strict -- in negotiating an accord in which Russia would receive billions of dollars in exchange for agreeing to tame inflation and make other reforms.
Part of the Administration's vision is a grand pact in which the fund promises billions of dollars in aid, perhaps more than $10 billion, and in exchange Russia's central bank stops printing so many rubles, the main cause of the current inflation.
Such aid could help finance industrial restructuring and a social safety net, which would reduce pressure on the central bank to churn out new rubles to help the poor and keep foundering enterprises afloat.
"Aid is not a reward," said Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard professor advising Russia. "It's one of the things that makes reforms possible. There's no way to have the aid come only after stabilization."
Professor Sachs, a strong critic of the bilateral aid programs in the last year, said most export credits failed to help because they have to be repaid too quickly and were poorly coordinated. He said credits often were for the purchase of equipment that Western companies wanted to sell but Russia often did not need.
In a letter to the other Group of Seven nations, Lawrence H. Summers, Under Secretary-designate of the Treasury, set out a list of options under which the I.M.F. might provide up to $7.5 billion in aid in addition to the $6 billion ruble fund.
The options include $4 billion more in loans, contingent upon Russia's making certain economic reforms. Then the I.M.F. might lend another $3 billion under an emergency program for nations hurt by unexpected declines in exports.
In addition, the World Bank might provide close to $2 billion this year. It has approved -- but not disbursed -- $760 million in loans to finance imports, help privatization and strengthen the welfare system.
World Bank officials are also expected to approve a $500 million loan for the energy industry and a $500 million loan to help Russian agriculture.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is planning to provide more than $500 million in aid.
 
Reducing Debt Repayments
 In addition to the $16 billion that might come from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions, Western officials say the Group of Seven will promise about the same amount of bilateral aid as last year -- $11 billion -- in grants, and credits to buy grain, machinery or spare parts.
The final part of the package would involve setting easier terms for the repayment of Russia's $80 billion in debts. According to the Institute for International Finance, a group of international banks, Russia is supposed to make $15 billion in debt payments this year, including about $4.2 billion in interest and $10.7 billion in principal.
Many officials say that after a rescheduling agreement, Russia will probably pay only a few billion dollars this year; such rescheduling, some Western officials say, could push this year's financial aid to Russia to over $30 billion.

Here is the $24 billion in aid for Russia announced by the Group of Seven on April 1, 1992, and the amount delivered in 1992.
 
WHAT WAS PROMISED: $11 billion in direct aid from the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
 
WHAT RUSSIA GOT: Western governments say they provided $12.2 billion in direct aid, but a study of international financial flows by the Institute for International Finance found that only about $8 billion in such credits were received.
 
WHAT WAS PROMISED: $4.5 billion from International Monetary Fund, World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
 
WHAT RUSSIA GOT: $1 billion from I.M.F. was sent, falling $3.5 billion short of plans.
 
WHAT WAS PROMISED: $2.5 billion in relief by allowing Russia to defer interest payments on its debt.
 
WHAT RUSSIA GOT: $2.5 billion in missed interest payments. Some Western officials say $4.7 billion in missed payments on proncipal shoiuld also be counted as part of the $24 billion aid package, but Clinton Administration officials say deferred principal payments were never part of the package.
 
WHAT WAS PROMISED: $6 billion fund to stabilize the value of the ruble in relation to Western currencies.
 
WHAT RUSSIA GOT: The fund was not established. (pg. A10)

HEADLINE: U.N. Approves Plan to Enforce Bosnia Flight Ban

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 31

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council stepped up its campaign to force Bosnia's Serbs to end their war in Bosnia and Herzegovina today by authorizing NATO to shoot down any planes violating its ban on flying over that country.
This means that NATO radar planes and fighters will soon begin patrolling Bosnian airspace looking for aircraft or helicopters violating the no-flights zone the Security Council imposed over Bosnia and Herzegovina in October. 
 The move has little military significance, diplomats say, since the United Nations says there has been only one verified combat violation of the ban since it was enacted.
But the enforcement decision today, supported by all Council members except China, which abstained, is seen as a warning to Bosnia's Serbs that the Council is now determined to put increasing pressure on them to agree to the peace settlement that an international mediation team headed by Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen has persuaded Bosnia's Croatian and Muslim leaders to accept.
 
'Should Send a Message'
 "The resolution should send a message that if the Bosnian Serbs want to rejoin the family of nations their behavior must conform to international norms," the deputy United States representative here, Edward S. Walker, told the Council after today's vote. Britain's representative, Sir David Hannay, said the prospects of the Serbs would be "grim indeed" unless they make peace.
The next step in the campaign to press the Serbs into making peace is expected to come early next week when the Council plans to adopt a resolution giving them 15 days to accept the Vance-Owen plan. If they still refuse, the new resolution would sharply tighten the trade embargo the Council has already imposed on the Yugoslav federation, which is composed of Serbia and Montenegro.
The calculation is that the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, is the only person capable of making Bosnia's Serbs capitulate by threatening to cut off the vital supplies of fuel, food and military equipment he sends them, and that the prospect of Serbia's virtually total economic and political isolation will force Mr. Milosevic to use that influence.
While the resolution clearly threatens the Serbs with new sanctions if they refuse to make peace, France and Britain wanted it to endorse the Vance-Owen proposals unambiguously. But the United States objected and the resolution merely "commends" the peace plan. France and Britain say this risks encouraging the Serbs to think the Council is not fully committed to the plan.
American officials say the Clinton Administration does not want to get into a position where it is asked to enforce a Bosnian settlement that is being imposed on the parties to the dispute instead of being accepted by them voluntarily. The Americans say they also want to give the mediators some flexibility in their dealings with the Serbs by making clear that the plan is not yet cast in concrete.
But Mr. Vance and Lord Owen made clear today that they would have preferred a ringing endorsement of their proposals by the Security Council. And some diplomats suspect that one of the reasons the Clinton Administration does not want the Council to demand that the Serbs accept the Vance-Owen plan is because this might create a precedent that could be applied to Israel.
The draft resolution would ban transshipment of supplies through Yugoslavia to other countries without Security Council permission. It would also ban all movements of goods along the Yugoslav part of the Danube River unless captains obtain Security Council permission and an observer is stationed on each vessel.
It would freeze overseas Yugoslav financial assets, and it would order countries to impound all Yugoslav ships, aircraft, trucks and rolling stock on their territory.
The new resolution comes at an awkward time for President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, who is locked in a power struggle with a strongly nationalistic parliament that sides with the Serbs and that has already asked him to use Russia's veto to stop the Security Council fromo punishing them any further.
But a senior American officials predicted that Moscow would go along with the resolution in the end in return for some minor changes in the text making it clear that the trade embargo will be relaxed as Bosnia's Serbs comply with the Vance-Owen peace proposal.
The leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, has convened his parliament this Friday to discuss his rejection of the Vance-Owen plan in New York last week after the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government finally accepted it in its entirety.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Hits New Low Versus Yen

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The dollar fell to record lows against the Japanese yen yesterday as traders tested how far the currency would fall while the United States put pressure on Tokyo to cut its bloated trade surplus.
In late New York trading, the yen was at 114.79 to the dollar, slightly above its low of 114.55 reached earlier in the day but well below its Tuesday close of 116.55. The dollar fell to a similar level today in Tokyo. 
 The dollar also fell against other leading currencies, including the British pound and the German mark.
The dollar began its decline in Tokyo early yesterday -- the end of the quarter and Japan's fiscal year -- and the rush to sell dollars to buy yen was probably exaggerated by traders seeking to balance their books.
But the sharp drop in the dollar served only to accelerate a trend: over the last three months, the dollar has fallen more than 8 percent against the Japanese currency.
 
'Repatriation of Yen'
 "I think much of what happened yesterday was due to a fairly dramatic repatriation of yen," said Robert A. White, a senior vice president at Standard Chartered Bank in Los Angeles, "But I am inclined to believe the overall downward direction has to get down to trade."
Since President Clinton took office, Japan has come under increasing pressure to cut its trade surplus with the United States. Various Administration officials -- most notably Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen -- have said they would like to see the yen rise to make American exports cheaper in Japan and Japanese imports more expensive.
Given the continuing problems in the Japanese economy, the yen's current value against the dollar is difficult to justify on a fundamental basis even with Tokyo's huge trade surplus, Mr. White and other analysts said.
At the same time, they acknowledged that market and political pressures were likely to push up the yen even further against the dollar.
"From a purely fundamental viewpoint, it is hard to understand why the yen is doing so well," said Liliana Nealon, an executive vice president at FX Concepts Capital Market, a research and fund management firm in New York.
"But we could go to 113, or the psychologically critical level of 110," she said, referring to the number of yen to the dollar. "And even if it falls below that level, with all this trade friction, I don't think the Bank of Japan would make much of an effort to support their currency."
Ms. Nealon and others said a decline in the dollar to 110 yen or lower would elicit heavy protests from Japanese exporters, who would likely try to pressure the Bank of Japan to stem the yen's rise.
The Bank of Japan could accomplish that by buying huge amounts of dollars in the foreign exchange market or, less overtly, by pushing down Japanese interest rates.
 
 
Talks With Clinton
 But with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa due in Washington this month for talks with President Clinton, pursuing either course seems highly unlikely.
"The Japanese want the dollar to be in a better position against the yen when he comes," said Simon Fischer, a yen trader at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
An appreciating yen is not only justified but also represents the best, "least difficult step" for Japanese authorities to cut their huge trade surplus, said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
"Every 1 percent rise in the trade-weighted value of the yen cuts $4 billion to $5 billion off their current account surplus," Mr. Bergsten said. "To my knowledge, none of the Japanese authorities have opposed a considerably stronger yen. They have objected to the pace of the rise, but not the magnitude."
Mr. Bergsten, noting that Japan's global trade surplus would approach $150 billion this year, said that the dollar could fall another 10 percent percent in value against the yen and that the yen could appreciate against other major currencies.
"The yen is undervalued against everybody," he said. "The Japanese trade surplus sticks out like a sore thumb, because every other major industrialized country's trade account is in deficit."

Gold Prices Rise Again
By The Associated Press
Gold prices gained more ground yesterday following Tuesday's surge. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery -- which jumped $4.80 an ounce Tuesday -- rose another 60 cents to settle at $337.60. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $336.75 an ounce, up 40 cents from Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Called Stronger After Congress Showdown

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 31

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin will be leaving for his weekend summit talks with President Clinton in Vancouver in a stronger position after his showdown with the Congress of People's Deputies, the Russian Foreign Minister said in an interview today.
The minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, who took his share of political heat at the turbulent four-day session, said Mr. Yeltsin faced "no problem" in leaving the country at this stage in its political crisis. "The situation is firmly under control," he said. 
 "What really happened at the Congress was a showdown, and it clarified things," Mr. Kozyrev said. "What is important is to clearly see who stands for what and where is democracy. This is much better position for Yeltsin, especially before a referendum."
Mr. Kozyrev, speaking in his office on the seventh floor of the Foreign Ministry, said the events of the last week, which culminated in a vote that narrowly failed to oust Mr. Yeltsin from office, showed that at this stage in the battle over economic and political change in Russia there was no middle ground. "Unfortunately there is no center in those who pretended to be centrist forces," he said.
Until now, the majority in the Congress, which opposes Mr. Yeltsin, could argue that it only wanted to "make corrections on the path to reform," he said.
"This kind of mythology was there before the Congress," he said. "Now it is absolutely clear that the alternative to Yeltsin's policy is really a reversal, something very dark and frightening."
In the current political atmosphere, Mr. Kozyrev said, the chances are practically nonexistent any time soon for a ratification in the Russian Parliament of the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -- a sweeping agreement signed here with great fanfare last January by President Bush and Mr. Yeltsin. But, he said, if the results of the referendum on April 25 give Mr. Yeltsin a solid victory, then the parliament, which is made up of members of the larger Congress, may swing back toward a more conciliatory position, both toward the Government and the West.
"After the referendum, there will be a new political situation in the country," he predicted. "Until the deputies realize they were led further to the reactionary side than society itself, it will be very difficult to persuade them to ratify anything positive."
Before the referendum, Mr. Kozyrev said, factions that support Mr. Yeltsin and reforms will regroup either as a political movement or even as a party to try to refashion the coalition of forces that elected him President in June 1991.
Since the Congress adjourned Monday, its battle against Mr. Yeltsin has gone into a holding pattern, as his top aides decide their strategy in what one called "a war of referendums." Sergei M. Shakhrai, a top Yeltsin adviser, told journalists on Tuesday that the referendum rules approved by the Congress, which would require the President to win with a majority of eligible, as opposed to participating, voters, left the President with no choice but to hold his own national vote of confidence.
"The Congress resolution envisages conditions for the referendum which make its results negative for the President before the voting even starts," Mr. Shakhrai said.
Mr. Kozyrev said today that the summit meeting in Vancouver should reinforce Mr. Yeltsin's image back home at a time when he is representing himself as a democratic leader doing battle with "red-browns," as Mr. Kozyrev habitually refers to the Communist-nationalist opposition.
"It is important that the democratic, first popularly elected leader of Russia, who reiterates his power not through tanks, but by again appealing to the people, meets with the democratically elected leader of one of the greatest democracies of the world," he said.
Mr. Kozyrev, who was in Washington recently to prepare for the summit meeting, said he had told officials that Moscow was not looking for more foreign assistance but for more cooperation, on trade issues as well as debt relief.

HEADLINE: Nasdaq Share Prices Show Renewed Spirit

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Over-the-counter stocks, having languished behind the Dow stalwarts for the last two months, finished the quarter yesterday with renewed spirit.
The Nasdaq biotechnology and computer issues, normally the most flighty growth stocks, now seem to represent firmer values than the weighty industrial shares, some money managers said. The American Stock Exchange, also the province of secondary stocks, rose to a record. 
 At the end of each quarterly reporting period, money managers normally point to window-dressing -- the buying of winners and selling of losers (by other money managers, never the one speaking). In recent days, however, investors have tossed out some of the recent favorites -- deep cyclicals especially -- and bought such previous outcasts as the biotechs.
According to David Evans, research director for the Robertson, Stephens Emerging Growth fund, "There's less of, 'I want to buy this because it will make me look au courant.' "
The Nasdaq composite index continued its recent advance yesterday by gaining 3.88 points, to 690.13, even as the Dow Jones industrial average lost 22.16 points to end at 3,435.11. For the quarter, the Dow finished up 4 percent and the Nasdaq up 2 percent.
Big Board volume of 279.2 million shares yesterday was up substantially from the halting pace of recent days.
Microsoft, the largest Nasdaq issue, added another 1 1/2 yesterday to a gain of 4 on Tuesday, closing at 92 1/2. Several other computer technology stocks followed, with Cisco Systems up 1, to 44 3/4; Autodesk up 2 1/4, to 43 1/2, and Synoptics up 2 1/8, to 90 5/8. Apple Computer and Intel retreated.
Nasdaq medical stocks also generally advanced, although not with Tuesday's broad strides. US Healthcare added 1 1/2, to 46 1/4, and Stryker gained 1 1/2, to 26 3/4.
The biotechnology issues have fallen to levels that even attracted some buyers who look to buy earnings potential on the cheap, said Peter J. DaPuzzo, who manages over-the-counter trading at Cantor Fitzgerald. "I know it's amazing, but they are very close to being value stocks," he said.
The flashiest arrival at the Nasdaq market party was Gymboree, the chain of children's clothing stores. The company's initial public offering, first set to come out at 13 to 15 a share, instead hit the market at 20, then soared to close at 31 1/2.
The Dow list showed no such cheer, as General Electric, Alcoa, Caterpillar and Du Pont each lost at least a point. Stocks most sensitive to the economy, among the market's leaders this year, have faltered in recent days on evidence that growth has slowed. The Government reported a healthy rise in its chief forecasting index yesterday, but this index seldom moves the stock market since most of its components are known in advance.
Lawrence P. Keblusek, director of investment counseling at the Northern Trust Company, said that the economy was not strong enough to sustain the deep cyclicals at their present prices.
The broader market, as reflected in the Standard & Poor's 500, finished nearly even yesterday, with losses among cyclical stocks balanced by gains among medical and retailing issues.

HEADLINE: Aide Pleads Guilty in House Post Office Case

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
In what may be a breakthrough in the long-running investigation of the House post office, a Congressional aide pleaded guilty today to three felony counts and agreed to cooperate with Federal investigators.
The aide, Gerald W. Weaver 2d, who had worked for former Representative Joe Kolter, Democrat of Pennsylvania, for more than four years, pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice, conspiracy, and possession and distribution of cocaine. 
 Under today's plea agreement, Mr. Weaver promised to provide information and testimony about his work as administrative assistant to Mr. Kolter, "including information he may have on the embezzlement of Government property, misappropriation of stamps and misuse of campaign funds."
 
Improprieties Denied
 Mr. Kolter has been under investigation along with two other Democrats, Representatives Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois and Austin J. Murphy of Pennsylvania. Mr. Kolter, a member of the House committee that supervised the post office, was defeated last year in a primary. He has said he did nothing improper.
In a Federal courthouse here today, the 37-year-old Mr. Weaver acknowledged that he had obstructed justice by impeding a Federal grand jury. He said he had asked a former business associate, who was not identified, to write a letter that maintained that $2,900 worth of checks he wrote to the Postmaster from 1989 to 1991 were for postage. In fact the checks were used to buy cocaine from a post office employee, who deposited the checks and then took the equivalent amount in cash from the post office.
Mr. Weaver also admitted that he had sold cocaine from 1987 to 1992 to other Congressional aides and lobbyists whom he did not identify. His main supplier was Wendell Magruder, a former clerk in the post office who has pleaded guilty to drug charges.
Mr. Weaver had been scheduled to be tried next week on 21 criminal counts and today became the first Congressional official outside the post office to be convicted. Six employees of the post office have already been convicted of criminal charges stemming from the scandal.
 
Reduced Sentence Possible
 Mr. Weaver will be sentenced on June 28. The charges he pleaded guilty to carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison and $250,000 in fines on the obstruction count, and 20 years and $1 million in fines on each of the two drug charges. A Federal judge may reduce the sentence if Mr. Weaver provides significant assistance in other related criminal cases.
People involved in the investigation said today's plea agreement was intended to serve two purposes: to gain the cooperation of Mr. Weaver in possibly building a case against Mr. Kolter, who has been subpoenaed and has refused to testify before a grand jury, and to send a signal to other Congressional aides under investigation that it would be to their benefit to reach similar arrangements.
The most closely watched part of the yearlong investigation is the possible indictment of Mr. Rostenkowski, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee whose help is crucial for President Clinton to get his economic package through Congress. If he were indicted, Mr. Rostenkowski would have to step aside as head of the committee.
Today's action shed no light on the case against Mr. Rostenkowski; accusations that he improperly took Federal funds and violated Federal election and tax laws have been under investigation. He has denied any wrongdoing and accused prosecutors of conducting a political witch hunt.
United States Attorney Jay B. Stephens, the Republican appointee who is heading the investigation, has been forced by the Clinton Administration to step down. He said today that he would leave office on Friday.
Mr. Stephens has said that the Justice Department had denied him a four-week extension to make the crucial decision about whether to prosecute Mr. Rostenkowski.
Mr. Stephens's successor has not been named, and some officials involved in the post office investigation said today that they could not say when it could reach a conclusion.
"Because we don't know who Jay's replacement will be, all bets are off," said one official.

HEADLINE: Freshman Democrats in House Make a Modest Proposal to Reform Congress

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
Charging that special interests wield undue influence on Congress, the freshman class of House Democrats issued its long-awaited reform package today, proposing to trim the wings of lobbyists and toughen campaign finance laws.
The recommendations of the 63 freshmen culminated a three-month effort to stage what critics of Congress hoped would be a rebellion against pork and perks. 
 After two nights of debate, negotiations and some well-timed lobbying by Congressional leaders, the class pulled back from some of the strongest proposals and couched those it passed in broad and modest language.
But the freshmen did call for a 25 percent cut in the budget for the legislative branch over five years, a position resisted mightily by the Democratic leadership, and they presented a long list of proposed restrictions on lobbyists and fund raising that could improve the chances of campaign reform legislation passing this year.
 
A Different Drummer
 "This may not be a revolution," said Representative Nathan Deal, Democrat of Georgia. "But at least we're marching to our own drummer and not necessarily to that of the leadership."
Among the bold ideas that were dropped were some that had inspired derisive resistance from their elders, including term limits on committee chairmen, the abolition of free parking at Washington National Airport and a limit of $50 on gifts that members can receive each year.
Mr. Deal and a few other freshmen had also wanted to challenge the seniority system. But their efforts were resisted by a coalition of minority members and lawmakers from strongly Democratic districts who hope to become chairmen someday. In the end, most freshmen were more concerned with pushing the Clinton economic program than causing divisions within the Democratic caucus.
At crucial moments in the last few weeks, Democratic leaders took freshmen members aside one by one to lobby against certain proposals, like one eventually dropped that would have linked Congressional pay increases to cuts in the deficit.
"Our job is to strengthen, not weaken, to build up, not tear down, to empower, not erode," said Representative Karen Shepherd of Utah, co-leader of the freshman reform task force, trying to distance her class from Republican freshmen who consistently attack the House as an effete institution.
Still, the Democratic reform package offered some stinging criticism of the way politics is conducted on Capitol Hill. "In election campaigns and in the halls of Congress, special-interest money consistently undermines representative government," the freshman manifesto states. "Well-financed special interests use their considerable clout to distort the message or drown out the voices of the people."
 
Crackdown on Lobbyists
 To alleviate the abuses of special interests, the freshmen called for legislation to require lobbyists to itemize expenses on their taxes and eliminate tax deductions of lobbying expenses.
On campaign finance, they stopped short of calling for public financing because more than 20 Democratic freshmen opposed the concept or were undecided on the issue. But they called for voluntary spending limits on campaigns, limitations on contributions from political action committees and tight restrictions on money that individuals give to party organizations, known as "soft money."
The freshman proposals received a lukewarm response from the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington. "All of them will not be rejected," he said, "and probably all of them will not be accepted."
The recommendations will first be considered by the Organization and Review Study Committee, a Democratic leadership group that considers procedural matters, and will then face a vote by the Democratic caucus and full House in the next two months.
As modest as the freshman reforms may be, the backbenchers hope that their package will finally galvanize them into an effective caucus.
During the new lawmakers' efforts to iron out their statement on Tuesday, their leaders confronted Mr. Foley with the demand that he consider making sweeping cuts in the legislative budget later this year. They backed up their plea with the threat that the class would desert the leadership on a bill authorizing a meager 5 percent cut in committee spending.
Congresswoman Shepherd said six freshmen told the Speaker that "we can't support this unless we get a serious crack" at a 25 percent cut in spending over five years. Mr. Foley reluctantly agreed, and the bill passed Tuesday by a mere 28 votes with the support of all but nine of the freshmen.
Senior lawmakers have not gotten accustomed to such freshman arm-twisting. Representative Tony P. Hall of Ohio, the Democratic chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, which was abolished this week under heavy freshman pressure, went on a fast today in protest.
"A lot of the freshmen don't know of the work we have done," he said, referring to his panel's efforts to publicize famines in Africa and alleviate hunger in Appalachia. "And they don't care."

HEADLINE: HOUSE APPROVES BUDGET PACKAGE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
Its eye on a spring recess that starts Friday, the House began tying up the loose ends of President Clinton's budget package this evening with a final vote to approve the five-year proposal. The Senate was simply tied up.
Snarled by a long string of mostly Republican amendments, the Senate spent most of the day arguing over the final piece of Mr. Clinton's budget, a plan to spend $16.3 billion on unemployment benefits and jobs programs. 
 Republicans, who contend that the spending is both unneeded and laden with pork-barrel projects, were threatening to delay the Senate's scheduled vacation in hopes of forcing Democratic leaders to scale back the package.
"It's a giant game of chicken," said one Senate Republican aide.
The House, by contrast, voted nearly along party lines, 240 to 184, to approve the final broad outline of Mr. Clinton's budget, a melding of almost identical measures passed earlier by both the House and the Senate.
 
Boundaries on Spending
 The outline, called a budget resolution, sets the general boundaries of spending throughout the Government, allotting $1.5 trillion next year and a total of about $8 trillion through 1998. If it is put into effect as planned, the measure would be an attempt to cut the annual Federal deficit by a total of about $500 billion over the next five years, from the current figure of about $300 billion to about $200 billion in 1997.
About $300 billion of the deficit reduction would result from higher taxes, and about $200 billion would come from reduced Federal spending, mostly for the military.
The Senate interrupted its dispute over the jobs bill tonight to begin debating the measure, and is expected to approve the budget package on Thursday, probably on a party-line vote.
Senate Democratic leaders used parliamentary tactics today to skirt another political fracas with Republicans over another measure that must be passed before the spring break: an increase in the Federal debt limit.
The increase in the debt limit would allow the Government to raise enough money, through sales of bonds, to keep operating through the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
Republicans have promised to load that measure with controversial amendments, including one calling for a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. But Democratic leaders structured the measure in a way that prevents it from being hamstrung either by a filibuster or by amendments, insuring that it will be brought to a quick vote by week's end.

HEADLINE: Off-the-Books Advisers Giving Clinton a Big Lift

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
When Bill Clinton took his show on the road, pitching his economic plan to audiences from Atlanta to Santa Monica, Calif., Paul Begala rode along on Air Force One to polish speeches and advise the President on the tactics of persuasion.
Mandy Grunwald, another political consultant, selected the East Room setting for the President's first formal news conference. She helped brief members of the Cabinet the night before the President presented his economic plan to Congress. 
 Stan Greenberg, a poll taker, has been tracking the allegiances of people who voted for Ross Perot and advising the President on how to bring them into his fold. And James Carville, who is Mr. Begala's partner, has been playing attack dog, threatening Democrats who do not fall in line with the President's plan.
All four have especially close relationships with Mr. Clinton and enjoy frequent and easy access to the White House. None are Government employees.
 
Veterans of the Campaign
 Instead, they are part of a tightly knit group of campaign veterans who work at the White House without portfolio, without Government pay and without the legally binding inconvenience of being forced to abide by Government ethics rules.
Mr. Greenberg said recently that the informal arrangement allowed them to advise the President without being "bureaucratically bound."
"We don't have day-to-day responsibility for making the Government work, which is extraordinarily time-consuming," Mr. Greenberg said.
But their link to the White House, forged when they were campaign strategists in Little Rock, Ark., and cemented when they stepped in to rescue the President after his first stumbling weeks in office, has raised eyebrows among some ethicists here.
"A President is entitled to have people come in and advise him," said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit group. "But if you're going to bring in people and have them act as de facto public officials, than you should have full disclosure."
Federal ethics rules require high-level officials to disclose much personal and business financial information and restrict their business activities after they leave the Government.
Other Presidents have also retained outside advisers as political consultants. Charles Black and James Lake, both Washington lobbyists, did that for President George Bush and were heavily involved in Republican Party politics and campaigns.
 
Contracts Reported Rejected
 But Mr. Begala and his counterparts nervously and voluntarily draw a distinction between their work and that of their Republican predecessors. All four have pledged to forsake corporate clients and they say they have collectively turned down millions of dollars in contracts from groups seeking to hire them for White House access.
"A lot of clients I would have taken in the past, environmental or women's groups," Ms. Grunwald said. "Because they have a specific agenda or point of view they want communicated to influence the President, now we just turn down that work."
Mr. Black and Mr. Lake continued to work actively for corporate clients and foreign entities while advising the White House and earned millions of dollars doing it. Patrick J. Buchanan, who challenged Mr. Bush in Republican primaries last year, ran television commercials citing the work Mr. Black and Mr. Lake did for the foreign companies.
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director and the main point of West Wing entry for the outside consultants, said the distinction for the Clinton consultants is important. "They don't lobby," he said. "That's a huge difference. That's all the difference in the world."
All four are working for the Democratic National Committee or soon will be under contracts that do not prohibit corporate or foreign lobbying, party officials said. "It would be an insult" to include such language in the contract, one party official said.
Mr. Begala said, "I distinguish a lot between helping the President pass his economic plan and helping a private interest advance their private agenda." He added that he considered his usefulness to be limited to politics and communications, not policy.
"Frankly, I don't think the President of the Bundesbank is waiting on pins and needles to hear from me," he said. "Neither is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, for that matter."
 
Other Adviser Arrangements
 The White House counsel's office has not formally prohibited any of the political consultants from exploiting their relationships with the White House in the future. Other, looser arrangements also exist at the White House.
Susan Thomases, a close friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton's who had an active role in personnel and scheduling matters in the campaign and transition, has special ty access to the second-floor West Wing offices where the First Lady does her work.
Unlike the politicos, who attend almost every critical meeting on speeches, public appearances and sales strategy, Ms. Thomases is now nearly invisible to the public. She continues to work at her New York office, where she is a partner in the law firm of Wilkie, Farr & Gallagher.
But it is unclear what direct influence Ms. Thomases has over policy, and it would be a difficult task to regulate a personal friendship in any case. "She is not a consultant," said Neel Lattimore, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. "She's a longtime personal friend of both the President and the First Lady."
 
Performing Special Projects
 Another friend of the Administration is Skip Rutherford, an Arkansan who worked for Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff, when he ran Arkla Inc., an energy concern. Officially, Mr. Rutherford is a new senior vice president for Cranford, Johnson, Robinson & Woods, an advertising agency in Little Rock. Less officially, he travels to Washington to perform special projects for Mr. McLarty and is paid by the Democratic National Committee.
Seventeen consultants and 82 temporary employees are also assisting Mrs. Clinton's health care task force. The work of the political consultants overshadows the work of the people who are formally employed to run the White House political operation. Although Rahm Emanuel, the political director, runs the daily 5 P.M. political meeting, both he and David C. Wilhelm, the Democratic national chairman, focus on political outreach more than on daily strategy.
"We're not legislative affairs and we're not communications, so there's this overlap," Mr. Emanuel said. "We're wedged, or snuggled, within these two departments."
While Mr. Wilhelm speaks at state party dinners and Mr. Emanuel schedules appearances for members of the Cabinet or determines White House involvement in affairs like the upcoming Gay Rights March in Washington, the outside consultants handle a range of other decisions.
How should the President counteract the expected negative reaction to new military base closings? What are the most salable parts of Mr. Clinton's health care plan? Of his economic plan?
Whatever the critics might say of the partnership between the consultants and Mr. Clinton, Mr. Begala, for one, is not losing sleep over it.
"He's the President of the United States," said Mr. Begala, who was designated during the first two months of the Administration as a temporary employee, complete with desk and telephone. "I'm a citizen of the United States. I'm giddy about it."

In a reversal of the Bush Administration policy that opposed steps by Southeast Asian countries to solve their regional security problems, the Clinton Administration will both encourage and take part in such efforts, Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State-designate for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said today.
The new approach reflects a realization that as the United States reduces its military presence in the region, there is an increased need for the Asian countries to solve their diverse security problems on their own. 
 "We must develop new mechanisms to manage or prevent emerging concerns," Mr. Lord told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during his confirmation hearings. He added that planned security talks by the Association of South East Asian Nations can help the members to "share information, convey intentions, ease tensions, resolve disputes and foster confidence."
 
Baker Rejected an Umbrella
 In an effort to keep a degree of control over Asian security goals, the Bush Administration strongly opposed regional arrangements for Asia. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d wrote in Foreign Affairs in late 1991 that Washington preferred a "loose network of bilateral alliances," not an overarching security umbrella.
But Mr. Lord said today that Asian nations need their own security structure and that the United States now is "open minded" on how to best help. As an illustration of Mr. Clinton's commitment to help, Mr. Lord said he would participate in regional security talks in Singapore in May.
"I don't see us coming up with a grand scheme or master plan for Asia," a senior Administration official said. "On the other hand, we are less worried than the Bush Administration about an alternate security system without an organizational relationship to the United States."
Mr. Lord dodged repeated questions on the policy toward Vietnam, saying no decisions had been made.
Even some of the most conservative members of Congress have urged the Administration to make a concrete gesture toward Hanoi, by ending the economic embargo and a ban on international bank lending, even by normalizing diplomatic relations.

HEADLINE: Eye on Ball For Israel;
Peace and Terror: Search for Balance

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 31

 BODY:
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has repeatedly said since he took office last July that talking peace with the Arabs is one thing and fighting Arabs who shoot and stab Israelis is something else entirely. His slogan is "We shall fight terrorism as if there is no peace process, and pursue the peace process as if there is no terrorism."
To Mr. Rabin, Israelis have to keep their eye on the ball, which means not letting bursts of Arab violence get them so hysterical that they lose sight of the bigger objective they have pursued for years: a peace treaty. 
 But that ball has been awfully elusive for many here after a violent March that came in like a lion and went out the same way, with 15 Israeli soldiers, policemen and civilians killed by Palestinian assailants -- the highest monthly toll in several years. About twice as many were wounded.
It does Israelis no good to hear that, by the traumatic standards of American big cities, 15 deaths in a month may not seem startling for a population of 5 million. New York City, with a population of about 7 million, often has 10 homicides in a single weekend. It certainly does them no good at all to hear that many more Palestinians, at least 26 in March, died in conflicts with Israeli soldiers.
 
Sense of Vulnerability
 There is an easily inflamed sense of vulnerability in this country born of the Nazi Holocaust, and with the press and television showing vivid images of spilled Jewish blood, no national leader could let the death count rise as it has without doing something.
On Tuesday, Mr. Rabin acted. He was not nearly as dramatic as in December, when he responded to another spurt of killings by expelling more than 400 accused Islamic militants from the territories to Lebanon. But he did enough so that, despite his own slogan, he may have wrapped the fight against terrorism and the Middle East peace talks into a tighter bundle.
Starting today, for an indefinite period, the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip are closed, meaning that military checkpoints have been set up to turn Palestinian vehicles around, including those carrying the 120,000 Arab workers with jobs in Israel. Jewish settlers in the territories and other Israelis, whose cars bear different license plates from those of Arabs, can drive past the checkpoints.
Even for Palestinians, however, the West Bank borders are porous, and the police today rounded up several hundred of them who were found to be in Israel in violation of the new orders.
 
Tightening Controls
 Military operations and hunts for wanted fugitives are to be intensified, Mr. Rabin said, and loosened regulations permit soldiers now to shoot at any armed Palestinian, whether or not he presents an immediate threat.
A main goal, the Prime Minister said, is to separate the two populations for a while so that tensions can subside. Indeed, the policy appeals to many Israelis on both the political right and left: the right because it makes it more difficult for would-be Arab killers to maneuver, the left because it means de facto recognition of the line separating the territories from pre-1967 Israel.
When asked by a television interviewer how long the closing will last, Mr. Rabin replied that it is up to the Palestinians.
"Dear friends, if you want to solve the problem, the place is around the negotiation table," he told them. "It is permissible for me to keep the territories closed for as long as is required."
That response was an example of how Israelis and Palestinians listen with different ears. Many Israelis heard the call to the peace table, and sensed a reasonable gesture. To many Palestinians, it sounded like a threat: If you don't talk to us, the crackdown will continue.
"This is not going to be helpful," said Elias Freij, the Palestinian mayor of Bethlehem. "I don't think our people will go to the peace talks under duress." As it is, Palestinian delegates have been hesitant about going because the issue of the December deportations is still not resolved to their satisfaction. This latest Israeli action seems unlikely to soften their position.
 
Israel's Vietnam?
 Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and their families depend on Israel for their livelihood. Even without a curfew imposed on individual towns, residents of the northern part of the West Bank are effectively cut off from the southern sector because they must pass through Jerusalem, which is now off-limits to them. Rather than a cooling off, resentments could fester. And the only winners could be the militants on both sides who want the peace negotiations to fail.
The latest killings have also forced Israelis to begin rethinking some fundamental ideas that have shaped national policy since they captured Gaza and the West Bank in the 1967 war.
One question is how committed they are to holding on to the territories, especially turbulent Gaza, the source of much of the violence. When it comes to Gaza, the six-day triumph of 1967 is beginning to look to many uneasy Israelis like their Vietnam. A rising chorus says that the coastal strip should be given up, now.
Another issue is whether Israelis are prepared to change how they live. Despite high unemployment, veteran Israelis and new immigrants from the former Soviet Union are no more eager than, say, Germans to do back-breaking, low-paying work. Here, gastarbeitern are called Arabs.
And although Mr. Rabin wants to reduce the country's dependence on Palestinian labor, and although there are calls by others to bring in workers from Southeast Asia as replacements, forces in the Labor Party of Mr. Rabin oppose the idea.
More immediately, the Prime Minister must get past a crisis that may have limited his maneuvering room in the peace talks.
 
A Delicate Balance
 Given the present Israeli dark mood, it is hard to imagine, for example, how Mr. Rabin could bend much further on the December expulsions -- concessions demanded by the Palestinians as the price for resuming the talks.
In December, 5 Israelis were killed and Mr. Rabin deported 400 people. Now there are 15 dead, three times as many. What is he going to do? Expel 1,200? Fresh expulsions on any scale seem out of the question because they would be devastating not only to the peace talks but also to the good relations with the Clinton Administration that he has cultivated.
So Mr. Rabin's main hope is that the worst will blow over quickly, perhaps aided by the Passover and Easter holidays next week. What he has prescribed thus far is "extra-strength aspirin," the newspaper Maariv said today, adding, "Rabin has not yet declared 'Emergency.' "

HEADLINE: Mercedes Close to Selecting U.S. Site for Assembly Plant

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 31

 BODY:
Mercedes-Benz A.G., the German luxury auto maker, appears close to making a decision on building an assembly plant in the United States, where it would produce a new four-wheel-drive family car.
Mercedes would become the latest German auto maker to try to cut costs and expand by assembling vehicles in this country. Speculation had been strong in trade journals and among economic development officials in the Southeast that Mercedes has selected a site near Charlotte, N.C., but A. B. Shuman, a spokesman, said yesterday that "a decision hasn't been made yet." 
 Mercedes, based in Stuttgart, Germany, today scheduled a news conference for Monday in Detroit where top executives, including Werner Niefer, its chairman, will address automotive reporters.
In an interview last week, Edzard Reuter, the chairman of Daimler- Benz A.G., which owns Mercedes-Benz , said that "very concrete negotiations are under way on a plant site in the United States.
"One of the possibilities is the Carolinas, where we have an existing plant that belongs to our Freightliner subsidiary," Mr. Reuter said. "We are examining other places as well." Freightliner is the United States' largest producer of heavy trucks, and has three North Carolina plants, in Mount Holly, Cleveland and Gastonia.
The Carolinas are attractive because of lower levels of unionization and pay scales than in other parts of the country. It is also familiar turf for corporate Germany. More than 100 German companies already have subsidiaries in the two states, including the chemical giants Hoechst A.G. and BASF A.G.
Mr. Reuter said that several company objectives argued for a plant in the United States: "It ranges from our plans to broaden our product palette with a new vehicle, a fun car that will find a market in the United States, to wanting to not to be dependent on unstable exchange rates."
Mr. Reuter said Mercedes planned a new sport utility vehicle or station wagon-type vehicle, possibly with four-wheel drive. Production would be between 50,000 and 100,000 units annually, he said; that would be about half or less than the output of a typical car plant. The vehicle would be produced for the American market but likely for export as well.
Last year BMW A.G. selected Greer, a suburb of Spartanburg, S.C., for an assembly plant that is scheduled to start production by 1995. Almost all Japanese auto makers already build cars or light trucks at one or more plants in North America. Volkswagen A.G., which built cars in New Stanton, Pa., until the mid-1980's is considering an American plant again for its Audi division.
Mercedes's review indicates how the dollar's weakness and soaring labor costs abroad -- and the competitive threat of Japanese auto makers -- have compelled car makers worldwide to consider the United States as a low-cost manufacturing venue.
The new assembly plants will add more automotive capacity to a North American market that is already oversaturated, putting additional pressure on the Big Three and the United Automobile Workers union to cut their own costs quickly. On Tuesday, construction unions demonstrated outside BMW's North American headquarters in Woodcliff Lake, N.J. to protest BMW's hiring of a non-union contractor to build its United States plant. BMW has also made clear that it does not want the U.A.W. to represent its workers.
The U.A.W. which has not organized any of the auto plants independently owned by Japanese auto makers, however, has scored a notable victory already against Daimler-Benz, having organized its Mount Holly plant in 1990 and won a contract for workers in 1991.
Automotive analysts believe that Mercedes would export aggressively from its American plant, a tactic that could help this nation's trade deficit as well as provide employment for thousands in a region hit by cuts in military spending.
Mercedes's worldwide sales fell to about 530,000 in 1992 from 580,000 in 1991. But in the United States the company was able to reverse a downward trend of the last few years, raising sales to 63,312 from 58,868.

HEADLINE: Companies Issued Securities At Record Pace in Quarter

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
With interest rates at their lowest levels in 20 years and stock prices near record highs, corporations issued new securities at a record rate in the first three months of 1993, according to figures released yesterday.
The lower rates also caused homeowners to refinance mortgages, keeping Wall Street firms well supplied with new issues of mortgage-backed securities. 
 The heavy activity kept Wall Street firms busy and profitable, collecting nearly $2.1 billion of fees from new corporate securities issues in the first quarter, compared with an average of about $1.7 billion a quarter last year.
 
 
High Stock Prices
 Corporations have benefited as high stock prices have helped them sell new equity issues to strengthen their financial condition, at the same time that low interest rates have helped them replace high-interest debt issued in the 1980's and early 1990's with lower-interest debt.
While the record pace of securities sales is well above the record rate of 1992, securities dealers say no letup is in sight -- at least as long as interest rates remain at current levels and stock prices stay high.
Richard B. Dubusc, a managing director at the First Boston Corporation, said that talks with large corporations showed that their desire to issue new securities remained high, despite the high amount of financing that had already occurred. With interest rates at current levels, he noted, companies "can profitably refund their old issues, or do strategic financings, at rates which are terrifically low" compared with recent years.
All kinds of domestic financings totaled $262.4 billion in the first quarter, up from last year's quarterly average of $213 billion, according to the Securities Data Company. Most of the increase was in bond offerings, which totaled $122.7 billion, up from last year's quarterly average of $77.4 billion.
New offerings of common stock in the American market totaled $22.2 billion, of which $11.5 billion were initial public offerings, or new issues for companies that did not have stock outstanding. Last year, an average of $18.1 billion of new stock was issued per quarter, of which $9.9 were initial public offerings.
 
 
Leading Underwriters
 Among the leading underwriters in the first quarter was Merrill Lynch, the leader, which has occupied that position for the last three years. It was followed by Lehman Brothers; Goldman, Sachs; First Boston; Salomon Brothers, and Kidder, Peabody, according to the Securities Data compilation.
While new stock and bond financings are generally beneficial to corporations, making it easier for them to finance new investments for growth, the benefits are not as great as lower interest rates, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The study, published earlier this month, said that in 1991 and 1992, the drop in interest rates reduced corporate interest payments by $27.3 billion, while new securities issuance saved only $2.8 billion. The Fed noted that many financings actually increased interest rates as companies sold bonds at interest rates of 5 percent to 8 percent to repay short-term borrowings costing as little as 3.25 percent.

HEADLINE: Suffolk Approves Extension Of 1 Increase in Sales Tax

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., March 31

 BODY:
A penny increase in the Suffolk County sales tax, adopted last year and scheduled to expire in December, would continue for two more years under a plan approved early this morning by county legislators.
The 10-to-7 vote was welcomed by County Executive Robert J. Gaffney, who boarded the 8:05 flight from Islip to Albany this morning to begin lobbying the State Legislature to approve the extension so the county can avoid a $120 million property-tax increase. 
 "As soon as some of the economic problems created by the recession are cleared away, we can remove the sales-tax increase," Mr. Gaffney said. "But right now, the economic times make that unrealistic."
The one-cent sales-tax increase, to 8.5 percent, was enacted by Albany temporarily last year to help Suffolk resolve a fiscal crisis.
 
Democrats Outvoted
 Faced with a choice between dropping the penny or raising property taxes at least 30 percent, Suffolk legislators voted early this morning to keep the sales tax at 8.5 percent through Dec. 31, 1995, rather than let it drop back to 7.5 percent.
The vote followed several hours of debate and behind-the-scenes maneuvering among Mr. Gaffney, a Republican, and legislators on both sides of the aisle. In the end, a majority Republican-Conservative coalition outvoted the Democratic minority, despite some last-minute defections.
This was a sharp reversal from last summer when Mr. Gaffney, after only a few months in office, was deserted by several Republicans and was forced to forge a fragile Republican-Democratic coalition to win initial approval of the sales-tax increase. his time around the Democrats refused to join him, complaining that he had not followed through with promised fiscal changes and spending cutbacks.
With the Legislature up for re-election this fall, they expect their vote on the sales tax to be a major issue in November. Michael J. Caracciolo, the only Republican to desert Mr. Gaffney and to vote against the extension, said he was not convinced that it was the only answer.
"We've talked in the past about restructuring county government and streamlining it, but it just hasn't happened," he said.
 
Revenues Called Needed
 Michael D. O'Donohoe, a Conservative who supported the tax extension, said the county could not afford to give up the revenues from the tax.
"We've been streamlining to where this county is at the point of absolutely collapsing," Mr. O'Donohoe said. "You can't streamline $120 million."
Before the vote, several speakers expressed their opinions during a public portion of the meeting. Some held signs that read, "It's the sales tax, stupid," indicating that voters would remember the issue in November.
Among them was Carol Cris, vice president of Tax-Pac, a citizens group against tax increases. "I don't favor the sales-tax extension and I don't believe for one minute you won't raise my property taxes.
Donald R. Blydenburg, presiding officer of the Legislature, and other Republican legislators have said they would roll back the sales tax when neighboring Nassau County rolls back its 8.5 percent sales tax, which has been in effect since 1977.
The debate over the sales-tax extension began in December when Suffolk legislators approved a 5.8 percent property-tax increase for 1993 to balance the county's $1.5 billion budget. Without the extension, the budgets for 1994 and 1995 would each be short $120 million and require additional property-tax increases.

Shake-Up in Underwriting Ranks

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The results of the first-quarter underwriting sweepstakes are in: Merrill Lynch toppled Goldman, Sachs & Company as the leading municipal bond underwriter, as its business jumped 49 percent from a year earlier, according to figures released yesterday. Goldman fell to No. 2, although its volume increased by 11 percent. The First Boston Corporation was third.
The battle for fourth place went down to the wire, as an aggressive bid by Lehman Brothers yesterday on a $780 million issue of California general obligation bonds moved it up from fifth place, edging out Smith Barney. 
 The California issue was a competitive bid deal and the results show that Lehman bid aggressively. Its bid averaged 5.640 percent for the entire issue.
The No. 2 bid, which came from Bank of America, was 5.677 percent, making it more than three basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, higher than Lehman's. But Stan Ciemniecki, managing director of the municipal syndicate desk, said the aggressive bidding had nothing to do with the rankings.
The California deal also pushed Lehman to No. 1 from No. 4 on the list of competitively bid deals, outdueling Prudential Securities. Competitively bid deals are one of the two procedures for selling new municipal bonds. The other, and more often used, is negotiated deals where the pricing is worked out between the underwriters and the issuer and by testing investor response.
Merrill Lynch had a substantial lead on all its competitors, according to the numbers compiled by the Securities Data Company. With the $758 million deal for the City of New York for which Merrill was lead manager on Tuesday, the company was the lead manager on $7.37 billion worth of new issues in the first quarter. That is 11.4 percent of the market, compared with a market share of 10.3 percent, or $6.66 billion, for Goldman and 10.2 percent, or $6.57 billion, for First Boston. Lehman had a 7.9 percent market share, or $5.12 billion, in lead manager credits, and Smith Barney, had a 7.2 percent share, or $4.63 billion.
While Goldman fell to No. 2, the situation could have been worse. Preliminary data through Monday had it third, behind First Boston. But deals in the last two days inched Goldman up, and it edged out First Boston by $93.4 million.
Securities Data also reported the final numbers for the total of new issues in the tax-exempt market in the first quarter. The total of the new issues was a record $64.6 billion, up 29 percent from $50.2 billion in the first quarter of 1992. Of this, a stunning $42.75 billion, or 66 percent, was new issues designed to pay off older, higher interest-rate debt.
 
Treasury Markets

Prices of Treasury notes and bonds were little changed yesterday in light trading as investors and traders continued to mark time until the March employment data are released tomorrow.
The price of the 30-year bond was down 7/32 as the yield rose to 6.93 percent, from 6.91 percent on Tuesday. The prices of Treasury notes were also off a little, but as has been the case all week, traders saw little significance in the price and yield moves.
Inflation seemed to be on investors' minds again. The Commodity Research Bureau index of commodities rose during the day and other data indicated that some prices were rising.
Although inflation has been the concern in the fall of the market in the last several weeks, it is not clear if the employment data will give a clear enough picture of the economy to enable investors to decide how much of an inflation problem there might be.
Late in the day a Treasury spokesman said that a decison on delaying the $14.25 billion one-year bill auction scheduled for today will be made this morning.
Last week, when the auction details were announced, the Treasury said that it would delay the auction if it did not have assurances that an increase in the Federal debt ceiling would be approved before Congress begins a two-week recess today.
The House and Senate were planning to act before the recess, but it was not clear late yesterday if there would be enough assurance of action for the Treasury to go ahead with the auction today.

HEADLINE: ABC Gains in Effort to Expand Upper West Side Studios

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Capital Cities/ABC won unanimous approval yesterday from the New York City Planning Commission for a major expansion of its studio complex on West End Avenue, a project that would be accompanied by two 33-story apartment towers.
The ABC proposal is the third large-scale project to be approved by city planners for the former Penn Yards site along the Hudson River, from 59th to 72d Street. The other two are Riverside South and Manhattan West. 
 Both Community Board 7 and the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, opposed the original ABC proposal, which called for 937 apartments. The network subsequently reduced the number to 507 units and made other concessions.
Ms. Messinger said yesterday that "the changes made in the proposal have clearly reduced many of the residential project's potential negative impacts."
And the chairwoman of the community board, Hope L. Mason, said the concessions had resulted in a project that "made a lot more sense."
The project goes next to the City Council, which has 50 days to review and vote on the matter.
At the northwest corner of West End Avenue and 64th Street, ABC would build two 15,000-square-foot television studios, designated Nos. 25 and 26. One would be used by the soap opera "All My Children." The other, which would accommodate an audience, could be used for a talk show, game show or situation comedy. The cost is estimated to be $100 million.
These new studios would adjoin two existing soap-opera studios, 23 and 24, at 320 West 66th Street, as well as ABC's 125 West End Avenue building, which houses its radio networks and scenery shops.
The network would sell development rights for the apartment complex, which would wrap around Studio 25 in an L shape. Structurally independent, it could be built before, during or after the development of the studios.
In negotiations with city planners, ABC eliminated one of the three apartment towers that it had proposed, reduced the height of the buildings from 39 stories and agreed to set aside at least 12 percent of the apartments for low- and middle-income occupants.
ABC is also to restore the outdoor pool in the municipal recreation center at 533 West 59th Street, as well as renovate the indoor lockers and replace filtration pumps.
No decision has been made yet about how the development will proceed, said Bruce E. Phillips, the vice president for design and development at Capital Cities/ABC. Under the approval granted yesterday, ABC would have up to six years to begin.
"Our studios are driven by our business," Mr. Phillips said yesterday, "and the residential portion is driven by the market. Both are difficult to predict."
Mr. Phillips said that the network was happy to have reached an agreement and that the negotiations had yielded a "good project -- in part because of City Planning, in part because of us."
Richard L. Schaffer, the chairman of the City Planning Commission, said "ABC was responsive to the concerns of the commission" and had "earned our support."
"We made a very substantial cut in the density," he said, "we reaffirmed the importance of affordable housing and we also got their commitment for a significant amount of work on the 59th Street recreational center."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Towns Report Drop in Crime

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 31

 BODY:
Most Connecticut towns have reported decreases in crime for the last quarter of 1992, defying projections that the recession would create a surge in crime, the state police said today.
Hartford recorded a 13.3 percent drop, the state's biggest decrease. The number of homicides in the city dropped by almost half to 13 in 1992. There was a slight increase in burglaries, larcenies and automobile thefts. 
 Crime in New Haven dropped by 8.2 percent, followed by a 4.1 percent drop in Bridgeport, a 3.5 percent dip in Stamford and a 3.3 percent drop in Waterbury.

Nestle to Sell Its Stouffer Hotel Unit

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Nestle S.A., the giant Swiss food manufacturer, said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its Stouffer Hotel Holdings Inc. for an undisclosed amount to a private Hong Kong company.
Stouffer, with headquarters in Solon, Ohio, owns or operates 39 hotels and resorts in North America and one in St. Thomas, in the United States Virgin Islands. Most of the properties are upscale and several, including resorts in California, Hawaii and Mexico, are in the luxury category. 
 Nestle, which had 1992 sales of $36.5 billion, acquired Stouffer Hotels in 1973 as part of the acquisition of the Stouffer Corporation, a maker of frozen foods. It said yesterday that selling the hotels was part of its strategy to focus on its food business.
Toward that end, Nestle had withdrawn from a hotel joint venture with Swissair in 1989, explaining that it did not fit into its future business plans. Earlier this month, Nestle purchased Perrier for $2.8 billion, and last week it increased its stake in Italy's San Pellegrino mineral water company from 20 to 25 percent.
Michael J. Branca, the food and beverage analyst for NatWest Securities, said that by agreeing last week to publish operating profits by major product divisions and by geographical region, Nestle was positioning itself for its shares to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
"Publication of its results in that format," Mr. Branca said, "clears one of the last hurdles that had been holding back an N.Y.S.E. listing."
Stouffer is considered an industry anomaly. Although it has grown from five hotels in 1981, it has focused on the high-end market, eschewing the industry's trend of adding properties in several price niches.
 
Scattering of Its Properties
 Instead, Stouffer has segmented by location, scattering its properties in downtowns in suburbs like White Plains, at airports in gateway cities like Atlanta and in resorts. It has six Presidente hotels in Mexico, including ones in the resorts of Cancun and Cozumel.
Stouffer also bucked the industry trend by growing largely through outright ownership or joint ventures, rather than by franchising properties and managing them. Two-thirds of the 15,000 rooms marketed under the Stouffer and Presidente names are wholly or partly owned by the company.
But hotels in most price levels have been hard hit by the recession. And although Stouffer has hotels in 19 states, it does not have any in New York City or Boston, cities that are especially important to hotel companies that cater primarily to business travelers.

HEADLINE: Slow Recovery Seen in Two Reports

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31

 BODY:
The Government today reported gains for February in two key economic barometers, fresh evidence that a slow but sustainable recovery was under way.
The Commerce Department said its chief forecasting index rose five-tenths of 1 percent, the fifth advance in six months, and that orders to factories increased 1.4 percent, to a new record. 
 The leading indicators index is designed to forecast the overall economy six to nine months in advance. Factory orders are a key gauge of future manufacturing activity.
 
 
'All Systems Are Go'
 "In a sense, all systems are go" for continued, but modest growth, said David Jones, economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York securities dealer.
But the economy has grown slowly following the end of the recession in March 1991, and most economists predict growth of just 3 percent this year, half that of previous recoveries.
Only 6 of the 11 forward-looking statistics in the predictive index were positive in February. Four pointed down and another was virtually neutral.
Although the index showed an improvement from January, when it was unchanged, the rise was far less than a 1.7 percent surge in December.
Stephen S. Roach, an economist with Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, said the report confirmed that the rapid pace of growth in late 1992 was one that could not be sustained. "The combination of the two reports say the recovery is still intact, but the rate of advance is likely to slow," he said.
 
 
Backlog of Unfilled Orders
 Among the statistics contributing to the rise in the leading index was a growing backlog of unfilled orders, which meant current production facilities and manpower were unable to keep up with demand, suggesting the possibility of hiring.
Other positive contributors were an increase in orders for new plants and equipment, fewer new claims for unemployment insurance, rising prices for raw materials -- which suggested growing demand -- rising stock prices and a longer average workweek.
Offsetting the advance were a smaller money supply, a decline in building permits, falling consumer confidence and a drop in new orders to factories for consumer goods.
Virtually unchanged were product delivery times, a measure of business ability to meet demand.
The various changes left the index at a seasonally adjusted 153.6, up 4.3 percent from a year ago and 2.3 percent from three months ago.
 
 
Record Level of Factory Orders
 In its other report, the Commerce Department said factory orders totaled a seasonally adjusted $258.6 billion, up from $255.0 billion in January and breaking the previous record of $258.3 billion set last December. It was the fourth increase in the last six months. Orders dropped 1.3 percent in January.
Orders for durable goods -- items like aircraft and appliances expected to last more than three years -- rose 2.4 percent, to a record $135.3 billion, even more than the 2.2 percent in the department's initial estimate last week.
Transportation orders shot up 10.8 percent, erasing an 8.3 percent drop a month earlier. The department said commercial aircraft orders represented more than half of the 10.8 percent advance.
But if this volatile category were excluded, orders would have been unchanged from January.
Factory inventories inched up one-tenth of 1 percent, the first increase since last August. Smaller inventories mean factories may have to step up production to meet new orders.

Yields of Money Funds Up As Investor Demand Sags

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by tax-exempt and taxable money market funds rose smartly in the latest week, according to the most recent survey by IBC's Money Fund Report.
And as in the previous three reporting periods, tax-exempt yields were up sharply in the seven-day period ended Tuesday. Analysts note that the supply of new municipal issues continues to outpace investor demand, but with a difference. While yields had been pushed up earlier by a heavy supply of new issues, they are now rising as a result of weak investor demand. 
 Assets of the tax-exempt funds grew to $102.2 billion this week. The flow of new cash into the tax-exempt money funds this week totaled $33 million, which did little to recoup the $546 million that flowed out of the funds the week before.
"Usually when yields move up, you'll see some flow of new cash come into the funds, but yields may still be too low to stir investor interest yet," said Walter S. Frank, chief economist at the Money Fund Report.
The IBC/Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a tax-exempt fund rose 10 basis points, to 2.02 percent, with the average seven-day simple yield up by 10 basis points, to 2 percent. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) Over a 30-day period, the compounded yield is averaging 1.87 percent and the simple yield 1.85 percent.
Among the tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, the Money Fund Report said that the Dreyfus Basic Municipal Money Market Fund outperformed other funds in its group with a yield of 2.75 percent, 7 basis points higher than its yield last week.
 
Taxable Assets Drop
 For the week ended yesterday, assets of taxable money market funds fell by $18.9 billion, to $470.1 billion, with institutional fund assets accounting for $15.2 billion of the drop, to $156.4 billion, and retail assets down $3.7 billion, to $313.7 billion.
"The bulk of the outflow from large institutional investors was due in part to the stock market stabilizing and again attracting investment money," Mr. Frank said.
IBC/Donoghue's average seven-day compounded yield on a taxable fund rose 2 basis points, to 2.70 percent, with the seven-day simple yield up a basis point, to 2.66 percent.
Money Fund Report analysts think that yields will now bounce around at this level until the Federal Reserve Board changes its monetary policy, which is not expected anytime soon.
The Dreyfus Basic Money Market Fund had the highest return among general-purpose taxable money funds, with a yield of 3.50 percent, up a basis point from last week.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Pacific timber industry isn't really on the endangered list.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WILL the northern spotted owl drive Pacific timber cutters to ruin and housing prices into the stratosphere?
Give the bird a break. Reports of the industry's imminent demise, Topic A at tomorrow's timber meeting in Portland, have been much exaggerated. But the owl, immortalized by President Bush as the "little furry-feathery guy," has become a symbol of a conflict with no obvious middle ground. 
 The issue, as Jeff Olson of the Wilderness Society puts it, is whether Federal forests "will be managed as tree farms or ecosystems." And since environmentalists hold most of the political cards, lumber prices are unlikely to return to 1980's levels anytime soon.
In February 1991 the 15,800 board feet of lumber used to frame the average house cost $3,200 at the sawmill gate. Today, the same quantity costs $7,000. What happened?
Ross Gorte of the Congressional Research Service notes that lumber prices typically rise by 30 percent during economic upswings. Add bad weather in timber regions along with a possible accumulation of logs in anticipation of rising demand from Japan, and you can explain some of the price increase.
Some, but not much. Al Goetzl, an economist for the American Forest and Paper Association, points out that the recovery in home building has been modest. Sales of lumber are not even close to the 1987 peak, when the price was half what it is today.
The smoking gun, Mr. Goetzl argues, is the decline in harvests from Federal forests. In 1987, 35 percent of America's softwood lumber came courtesy of Uncle Sam. Five years later, the figure was down to 25 percent. Annual Western production from Federal lands plummeted from 11.4 million board feet to just 5.7 million, the loss of enough timber to build 400,000 average-size houses.
Harvests have collapsed because legal complaints about casual environmental management of Federal forests -- especially old-growth forests with the biggest, most valuable trees -- have begun to receive a sympathetic hearing.
The courts have virtually stopped Federal timber sales. And the inventory of trees awaiting the chain saw is rapidly depleting: Federal timber under contract fell from 27 million board feet in 1987 to 11 million in 1992.
The little furry-feathery guy has certainly played a part in forest gridlock. Logging is barred within cursing range of the owls' nests, blocking access to millions of acres.
But Michael J. Bean of the Environmental Defense Fund notes the owl is just the leading edge of a legal assault based on broad forestry management statutes requiring full environmental disclosure and protection of species balance. A return to harvesting as usual in Western old-growth forests, he argues, would damage the habitat of a variety of animals ranging from the salmon to the marbled murrelet, a sea bird.
The industry might yet soften the Endangered Species Act, but it does not have the political muscle to overturn the statutes setting standards for public land. And while President Clinton might be in a mood for compromise, environmentalists are not: "The sustainable harvest from Federal forests, said Brock Evans of the National Audubon Society, "is less than the harvest now."
Canada will not fill the gap: British Columbia is under pressure to reduce harvests from forests that on average, have been more aggressively cut than their American counterparts. Siberia could. However, it would take billions of dollars' worth of roads and sawmill capacity -- and a stable business environment -- to make Russia a major producer.
Fast-growing pine from private lands in the American Southeast may eventually replace declining output from old-growth Pacific forests. And a variety of "engineered wood" products -- composites made from wood scraps and smaller trees -- are just now gaining market acceptance. But nobody expects these substitutes to ever sell for as little as the old-growth timber harvested in the 1980's.
Apocalypse? No. The Northwest, with its growing, diversified economy, is better poised than other regions to absorb displaced timber workers. Many lumber companies will actually end up winners, since their losses from smaller public harvests are more than offset by the higher value of trees on their own land: the giant Weyerhaeuser is posting near-record profits. And although there is no comparable silver lining for the construction industry, the damage begs for perspective.
Lumber represents just 10 to 15 percent of the cost of building a house, and construction represents just half the cost of the total retail package. Thus the near doubling of lumber prices should add only about 5 percent to housing costs. The Congressional Research Service figures this would increase the typical monthly mortgage payment by about $40 -- less than the impact of a one percentage point increase in interest rates.
Of course, $40 a month here, there and everywhere adds up to real money. But there are intangible values that some people think are worth every penny: "We're deciding the fate of our ancient forests," Mr. Evans said.

HEADLINE: She May Be Decorating The White House. Shh!

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

 BODY:
WEDGED among the coffee-table magazines in Kaki Hockersmith's decorating shop is a Newsweek cover story that asks, "Hillary's Role: How Much Clout?"
Ms. Hockersmith should know. Although it has yet to be announced and has been shrouded in a swag of secrecy here and in Washington, the identity of the Little Rock decorator's latest clients can be gleaned from a big cardboard box in the back of her office labeled "WHITE HOUSE." 
 Ms. Hockersmith isn't talking about the work she is supposedly doing on the private quarters of the White House. Neither is the White House, which will not confirm anything. According to Lisa Caputo, Hillary Rodham Clinton's press secretary, the First Lady is planning to make an announcement about her mystery decorator and the work she may or may not be doing at the White House when the project that-isn't-really happening is completed any day now, not before.
But other people are talking. "It's the job of a lifetime," said Edwin W. Bitter, the chairman of Scalamandre, the New York fabric house, who has worked Ms. Hockersmith in the past. "But I can't say anything. Remember, you're dealing with two lawyers at the White House. One word and poof! She'll be gone like a pumpkin."
In conversations with more than a dozen of her friends and clients last week, a portrait emerged of a 42-year-old decorator with Gidget-like effervescence and a penchant for unusual accessories, like the lamp stand with whole tortoise shells at her shop.
One thing that seems to distinguish Ms. Hockersmith's work is that she does not come with a distinctive "look," a quality that some rivals criticize but her clients see as a plus. "You can't tell a Kaki interior," said Lee Moore, a longtime client. "Many times you can go into a wonderful house and know immediately who the decorator was. Kaki isn't like that. She tries to get a clear fix on the person she's working for. My house feels like mine."
Ms. Hockersmith herself has fended off requests for interviews -- albeit reluctantly, friends say. The extent of her work at the White House, as well as the cost, is not clear, although it is said by one White House official to involve choosing paint colors, fabrics and wallpaper in the family's personal quarters on the second and third floors.
"It has been, in all honesty, intense," said Pat Pennebaker, "Kak's" assistant, while rearranging shelves in Ms. Hockersmith's shop last week, behind a sign that said "Pardon Our Mess." Choosing Ms. Hockersmith -- the latest Little Rock import to hit Washington -- fits in with the way the Clintons operate, she said. "She's someone who knows them who they can totally trust," she said. "They have more important things to do than decorating."
First families have access to a $50,000 appropriation from Congress for refurbishing the living quarters. That amount, which has to cover dozens of rooms, has often been supplemented with private donations, said Rex Scouten, the White House curator.
Trifling as it may appear, the politics of White House decorating is never trivial, as Nancy Reagan discovered upon ordering $209,508 worth of red Lenox china even though the purchase was privately financed.
"The redecoration of the White House has always been a flash point," said Lewis Gould, a historian on the Presidency at the University of Texas at Austin. "Whatever you do in the White House you are likely to offend somebody."
As explained by Ms. Caputo, it was Mrs. Clinton's desire to wait to unveil the designer's name and her plans until the project is finished, something "she is really looking forward to," she said. The announcement has been further delayed because of Mrs. Clinton's vigil at the bedside of her father, who had a stroke on March 19, a White House spokesman said.
But in decorating, as in politics, image and appearances -- as well as timing -- are important, particularly when the President is pushing his economic program and Mrs. Clinton is redefining the role of the First Lady. Remember the chocolate chip cookies and the headband.
Whatever is done at the White House, Professor Gould said, "is apt to raise questions of Arkansas culture versus the East Coast elite and whether the Clintons are bringing sufficient taste to the White House."
White House decor, like everything else, is also a way for first families to convey an image. "It shores up the traditional side of the First Lady," said Professor Gould. "When she is seen as too assertive on health care reform," he said, as in Mrs. Clinton's case, "they can balance it with pretty pictures of decorating."
Should Ms. Hockersmith indeed be the anointed one, she is a fairly logical choice. Her clients include Clinton cronies like Webster Hubbell, Mrs. Clinton's former law partner. She did extensive work on the Clinton's private quarters at the Governor's Mansion (although Betty Tucker, the wife of President Clinton's successor as Governor, Jim Guy Tucker, has already banished some of her paint colors, which, she said, "needed to be quieter" to accommodate their art collection).
Although not considered one of the society decorators, Ms. Hockersmith has a young-ish, voraciously devoted clientele, and her work has long been a mainstay of the Symphony Designer Showhouse, the Kips Bay of Little Rock.
For this year's showhouse, which opens April 16 at the Ragland House, a Queen Anne mansion, Ms. Hockersmith is designing a dining room with burgundy damask draperies, an Aubusson rug, and a papered ceiling with coffered medallion patterns. The sudden national interest in the showhouse has resulted in the un-Little Rock-like spectacle of organizers carrying beepers.
Ms. Hockersmith's nondescript storefront is next to Country Club Drugs in a mini-design district in the fashionable Pulaski Heights section. It is, to use a favorite decorator term, eclectic. The shop is filled with tasseled chintz footstools, silk calla lilies in urns and a mix of old oil paintings and lithographs by contemporary artists like Thomas McKnight, who, a label announces, "graduated cum laude from Wesleyan."
The adjoining "design room," where Ms. Hockersmith confers with clients, has whirring ceiling fans and is painted a deep, rubber plant green.
Ms. Hockersmith is no minimalist, preferring what Mrs. Moore calls a "busy look," often grouping a collection of silver picture frames together (or perhaps the Clintons collection of frog paperweights).
She likes bold floral patterns, vibrant colors and animal prints, according to those who know her work, and has been partial to crimson and deep green. Julie Newsum, a client, told Ms. Hockersmith that "I wanted my house to look like my yard and that's exactly what she did." For Mrs. Newsum's 1930's colonial, Ms. Hockersmith selected raspberry colors for the dining room and yellow draperies, playing off "the crape myrtles blooming and the strong southern light," Mrs. Newsum said.
It seems likely that Ms. Hockersmith will try to incorporate favorite Clinton objects -- like the throw pillow embroidered with 'Raise and Spend' -- into the White House decor and perhaps work with Mrs. Clinton's stated love of "big kitchens you can eat in."
Neither her shop nor the White House would release any biographical information. But according to close friends, who politely refused to show a reporter their Hockersmith interiors until her name is proclaimed by 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Ms. Hockersmith attended the University of Central Arkansas in Conway and is a former schoolteacher.
She got her start in design arranging furniture vignettes for Dillard's department store, and then opened her own decorating shop, originally in North Little Rock, about eight years ago. She is partial to outfits reminiscent of those in "Annie Hall," friends say, and favors bold accessories. She is an allied member of the American Society of Interior Designers. Her husband is Max Mehlburger, a lawyer and sailing enthusiast.
Described as "a real personable gal" by her friend Joyce Landgren, Ms. Hockersmith is perhaps best known in Little Rock as a creative party-giver, cooking every dish herself and giving each one -- "Hillary's Hibiscus" for instance -- a name.
At a fund-raising event she held for the Clinton campaign early in the primaries, when the name of Gennifer Flowers was in the air and things looked bleak, she decorated her house with red, white and blue flowers and picture frames draped with American flags, according to her friend Martha Markland, who attended. She was wearing a red, white and blue spangled sweater. Outside, patriotic music wafted from speakers hidden in the bushes.
It was the quintessential Little Rock event, with a beleaguered Bill Clinton on a telephone hookup from New Hampshire and the Arkansas Razorbacks on the television.
"You walked in wanting to sing 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' " said Mrs. Markland. "It's very hard to be down around Kaki."
In the gabby field of decorating, in which decorators get to know the intimate details of their clients' lives, Ms. Hockersmith's reputation for discretion may be her most important qualification.
"This is not a big town," explained Mrs. Newsum, echoing the opinion of many. "Kaki doesn't talk."

HEADLINE: Time to Play Fair on School Aid

 BODY:
New York State's Legislature lurches toward its budget deadline with one of the most contentious items, the state's grossly unfair system of school financing, unresolved.
To their credit, Gov. Mario Cuomo, the State Board of Regents and New York City officials are pushing for reform more aggressively than they have in years. It's time for the state's legislators to join the fight for fairness. 
 The state's needier school districts, including those in New York City, have long complained that Albany denies them their fair share of support. School aid is distributed on the basis of complex formulas that reflect each district's average attendance and relative wealth. Those formulas have been changed over the years in order to channel more operating aid to poor school districts and less aid to rich ones.
But in practice, wealthier districts still manipulate the system to secure a disproportionate share for themselves as suburban and upstate legislators wield political clout, particularly in the State Senate. Thus New York City, which educates 37 percent of the state's students, consistently receives about 34 percent of state aid.
The Board of Regents has called for an ambitious overhaul of state school funding that would gradually redress inequities. But the Regents' plan depends on a $500 million increase in school aid. That's probably unrealistic when the state is still so strapped economically.
Governor Cuomo offers a more promising plan that would consolidate complex school aid formulas and reallocate the state funds more fairly, giving New York City about 36 percent of the total. For the next school year, Mr. Cuomo officially proposes a decrease in state aid of $52 million. But the unofficial talk in Albany is of a $200 million to $300 million increase in aid, with about 40 percent of new money going to New York City.
The city, meanwhile, has taken an aggressive step of its own. It has filed a lawsuit charging that the school aid disparities favor districts with largely white enrollments over districts like New York City with largely non-white enrollments, in violation of Federal civil rights law.
But the outcome of the suit remains uncertain. The most likely solution is political. New York and other districts have to provide many more services, like remediation and teaching English as a second language, to give their students even a chance at success.
Having enriched their constituent districts over the years at the poor schools' expense, the legislators from wealthier communities can now well afford to play fair.

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton Heads for the Timber

 BODY:
A man of lofty aims, Bruce Babbitt began his tenure as Secretary of the Interior hoping to reverse a century of federally sponsored exploitation of public lands by striking a sensible balance between commerce and environmental stewardship. He knew he would face obstacles, but probably the last thing he expected was that one of them would turn out to be the man who gave him the job, President Clinton.
Mr. Babbitt wanted to raise the fees for grazing livestock on 280 million acres of public rangeland. He also wanted to charge royalties on gold, silver and other metals now mined from Federal land at no cost. The money would be used for a host of worthy purposes, like lowering the deficit, restoring damaged lands and improving the badly stressed national park system. 
 The proposals were tucked into the budget resolutions passed by the House and Senate. Then, however, a powerful cadre of Western senators had second thoughts about what they had done. They threatened to torpedo Mr. Clinton's entire economic package -- the centerpiece of his Presidency to date -- if the mining and grazing provisions survived. Mr. Clinton agreed to drop them.
His cave-in was reminiscent of his behavior as Governor of Arkansas, when he often favored the economic welfare of the chicken industry over strict regulation of its adverse effects on the environment. It also set many to wondering about his future commitment.
"I don't think I've ever seen a white flag get put up so fast," said an official at the Wilderness Society -- which, like other environmental groups, has invested high hopes in the new Administration.
The President's spokesmen say his retreat is purely tactical. The budget plan is so important, they say, that losing a few little skirmishes here and there is incidental to winning the larger war. For his part, Mr. Babbitt stoically insists that he can still get his grazing fees and mining royalties through administrative action and separate legislation.
Maybe so. But the President's stated determination not to yield to special interests suddenly seems negotiable. His reversal must surely send a frisson of pleasure through other influential opponents of Mr. Clinton's budget proposals, like farmers threatened with the loss of their cherished subsidies.
"This is absolutely spoon-feeding the special interests," complained Representative George Miller, a Democrat from California. "The decision to defer these reforms . . . sends the message that business as usual has lived to fight another day."
The timing of Mr. Clinton's volte-face is equally unsettling. It arrives fresh on the heels of his decision to accept a toxic waste incinerator in Ohio that Vice President Al Gore -- Mr. Clinton's putative conscience on environmental matters -- had pledged to keep closed pending further study.
It also arrives virtually on the eve of tomorrow's "forest summit" in Portland, Ore., a brief media extravaganza that seeks to address a very serious question: how to protect a treasured environmental resource (in this case the old-growth forests, where lives the spotted owl) without putting thousands of people on unemployment lines.
That, too, is a matter dear to Mr. Babbitt's heart. He hopes both to protect the forests and put thousands of loggers back to work restoring the land hit hardest by past logging practices -- by, for example, repairing watersheds and streams that nurture salmon, one of the forests' most valuable and commercially important species.
But it will not be easy to ram even that compromise past hostile lawmakers from the Pacific Northwest, and Mr. Clinton's retreat on grazing and mining has environmentalists wondering whether he has lost his will to fight for the forests as well.
Mr. Babbitt's cause is not wholly lost. Under the law, he can raise grazing fees by administrative order, which he intends to do after careful consultation with ranchers large and small. He also promises to protect smaller ranchers who might be vulnerable to a sharp rise in grazing costs. Imposing royalties on mining companies, however, will require new law and, probably, a bruising legislative struggle. He will need the support of his wavering boss to succeed.
Mr. Babbitt's chances of defeating influential lobbying interests were much better as long as his proposals were linked to the larger budget package. Now, according to Mr. Clinton, they aren't. Running for protective cover, the President has removed Mr. Babbitt's.

A New 'Red Menace' Scam

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
With the cold war won and gone, you thought you had heard the last of pols and policy experts using the Moscow menace to justify excessive military spending. Think again.
Many in Washington are now arguing that if Russian hard-liners topple President Yeltsin, they'll unearth their old military Frankenstein, quickly charge him up and dispatch him once again to terrorize the world. 
 The chances of the "bad" Russians being able to do this by the end of the century are, to be charitable, remote. Russia is in the poverty pits, and its military is in near-total disarray. It will take many years for even the nuttiest Russian nationalists to put the Monster together again.
Yet the argument about the new Russian threat goes largely unexamined in Washington for a very unusual reason: Conservatives and liberals both find it very useful, for very different ends.
Legislators, especially conservatives, love the argument because it gives them a brand new way to defend the defense budget and preserve jobs. Conservatives also like to feel muscular, just in case.
Liberals and moderates, especially in the Clinton Administration, embrace the argument because it's the easiest way to sell increased aid to Russia. They want to save Mr. Yeltsin (don't we all?) and are prepared to do so the old-fashioned way -- by scaring the hell out of the American people.
It's fine for Washington power brokers to warn about coming gas pains over Russia's foreign policy. The pains are already evident in places like the Balkans and Iraq. They will grow more severe as conservatives amass power in Moscow and force Mr. Yeltsin to assert traditional Russian interests. And if hard-liners actually take over, things could get tense in the United Nations and elsewhere.
But such foreign policy disputes are a far cry from military confrontations. In the first place, there's a good deal of evidence that many Russian military leaders desire good relations with the U.S.
And those looking for trouble would have a hard time making it. Air and naval crews can't train for lack of fuel. Draft-dodging has reached pandemic proportions. Much of the equipment from the old Red Army has been dispersed among the 12 new states of the ex-Soviet Union. Troops are far more concerned about a place to live than a war to fight.
As for nuclear weapons, there is a worry that Russian hard-liners might not carry out arms reduction treaties already signed. But let's not be crazy. Even these guys wouldn't dream of starting a nuclear war.
Defense Secretary Les Aspin, no dove himself, seems perfectly aware of the mountains Russian hard-liners would face. "The Warsaw Pact is gone -- there's no way that Humpty Dumpty's gonna be put back together again," he says. "The former Soviet Union is broken into lots of republics -- there's no way that's gonna be pulled back together again."
Yet he and others in the Administration are now starting to hedge on future U.S. defense cuts, even though they know quite well that the U.S. could gear up for battle far faster than Russia. And everyone in the Administration from President Clinton on down continues to drive home the argument that Mr. Yeltsin's political demise would require the U.S. to spend billions more on defense.
This help-Yeltsin-or-else argument is not only a gross exaggeration, but also self-destructive.
If Mr. Yeltsin fails or falls, Mr. Clinton will end up in a political trap he is setting for himself. Having cried wolf, he will have to forsake his precious domestic priorities and throw extra dollars at the Pentagon.
Most likely, he will be forced to keep the dumbest weapons, namely nuclear arms, just to show he's tough. He's already deferred decisions to cancel nuclear attack subs and to cut back on President Bush's missile defense programs.
And by hedging his nuclear bets he's bound to provoke the very nationalistic reaction in Russia he seeks to avoid. Russian hawks will use his hedges to scare up support for their own military demands.
The American people don't need phony arguments about new Russian military threats to justify more aid to Mr. Yeltsin. They are quite smart enough to support democracy in Russia for its own sake -- unless Bill Clinton is foolish enough to convince them otherwise.

Americans Wake Up To Toxic Pollution

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In my research on toxics for the Environmental Exchange, a national nonprofit group, I have discovered a "wave of environmentalism" different from the one you report in "New View Calls Environmental Policy Misguided" (front page, March 21). 
 The new environmentalism I have found is also made up of homeowners, farmers and local officials; it also sweeps through universities, city halls, state capitols and the highest levels of the Environmental Protection Agency, and parts of the business community as well. But this new environmentalism does not call for more expert verification of the dangers of toxics or more cost-benefit analysis of environmental protection measures. It calls for pollution prevention, to minimize the risk to ourselves and our children by looking for alternatives to toxic chemicals.
Your reporter spoke with "scientists, economists, and government officials," and representatives of companies like Monsanto -- a notorious polluter. I have been speaking with citizens, local and state officials, and representatives of companies that embrace pollution prevention.
These are not tree-hugging environmentalists. They are dentists, housewives, schoolteachers and managers, who believe it doesn't make sense to pollute our environment with substances we don't fully understand -- especially when the evidence indicates they are harmful.
Residents of Louisiana's Cancer Alley and Sumter County, Alabama (home of the largest hazardous waste landfill in the country), don't need scientists to tell them toxic pollution is harmful. They see it every day.
One Georgia resident put it well at a hearing on a proposed incinerator: "I may not be an expert in chemistry or hydrogeology, but there are two things in which I am an expert. From my experience, I know I need clean air to breathe and clean water to drink."

HEADLINE: Vance to Resign as U.N. Mediator on the Balkans

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 31

 BODY:
Cyrus R. Vance will step down in the next few days as the special United Nations mediator in the Balkan crisis.
His replacement is expected to be the Norwegian Foreign Minister, Thorvald Stoltenberg, who called on the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, this morning to discuss the appointment. Mr. Stoltenberg is now returning to Oslo to consult his Government about taking the post.
Mr. Vance, a former Secretary of State, turned 76 last Saturday. He told Mr. Boutros-Ghali last December that he could not continue indefinitely as the United Nations mediator on the Balkans, and in recent weeks he has indicated he would probably give up his post at the end of the round of peace talks that began here in February. 
 Mr. Vance and Lord Owen, the European Community's mediator, had put forward a peace plan to end the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina that called for dividing the republic into 10 ethnic-based semi-autonomous regions under a central government in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital.
The New York round of peace talks ended last week with President Alija Izetbegovic, the head of the Muslim-led Bosnian Government in Sarajevo, signing an amended version of their peace plan. Croatian leaders in Bosnia had already signed the plan and Mr. Izetbegovic's acceptance left only the Bosnian Serbs, under the leadership of Radovan Karadzic, refusing to agree to it.
The United Nations Security Council is now preparing to tighten the economic embargo it has already imposed on federal Yugoslavia, which now consists only of Serbia and Montenegro. The Council hopes this will persuade the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosovic, to bring pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to agree to the peace plan.
The likelihood that Mr. Stoltenberg will replace Mr. Vance surprised many diplomats who said today that they had not known of the Secretary General's intention to appoint him.
Several diplomats expressed disappointment with the choice, arguing that the joint peace effort of the United Nations and the European Community would have appeared more credible if the Secretary General had chosen another senior American statesman with ties to the Clinton Administration to work alongside Lord Owen, a former British Foreign Secretary.
Mr. Stoltenberg served for 10 months in 1990 as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees before abruptly resigning to become Foreign Minister in the Norwegian Government of Prime Minister Gro Harlem Bruntland, and knows the Balkans well. He has recently been conducting mediation efforts there on behalf of the Socialist International.
Mr. Vance, who has also represented the United Nations Secretary General on fact-finding missions to South Africa and the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia, has told the Secretary General he will remain available for other particular assignments but wants to base himself in New York and devote most of his time to his law firm of Simpson, Thacher and Bartlett.

HEADLINE: HURT IN EXPANSION, AIRLINES CUT BACK AND MAY SELL HUBS

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Hobbled by overcapacity, a slowdown in travel and bruising fare wars, the nation's leading airlines are laying off workers, delaying plane orders and, in the most drastic measures to date, taking steps to dismantle the elaborate hub systems they spent the last decade building.
Industry experts say their actions could alter air service substantially, opening the door for low-cost carriers to thrive and perhaps bringing back the price competition and no-frills service that existed when People Express packed planes with low fares in the early 80's. 
 It is unclear how the industry will ultimately be shaped. Even Robert L. Crandall, the visionary chairman of American Airlines, the largest American carrier, has drawn a blank on what to do about the largely unprofitable hub-and-spoke systems the airlines built after deregulation.
 
Huge Unrecovered Costs
 The hub systems, in which airlines built expensive regional terminals into which they could fly passengers for transfer to short flights to medium-size cities, were meant to protect against feisty low-cost regional carriers. But the big airlines, which eventually fought long fare wars that kept prices low at the same time passenger traffic declined, were never able recover the huge costs involved in building the systems. "I don't know my way out of this," Mr. Crandall said recently.
What may develop is a two-tier system under which the big airlines control heavily traveled international and national arteries while smaller carriers carve out regional niches and feed the broader systems. Southwest Airlines, one of the few no-frills upstarts not to be run out of business by its larger rivals, is emerging as a model regional carrier.
Such a two-tier system, in fact, may be helped by the Clinton Administration's seeming willingness to protect airline newcomers. In the first intervention into the industry since deregulation in 1978, Federico F. Pena, the Secretary of Transportation, last week forced Northwest Airlines to abandon plans to start new routes in competition with an upstart, Reno Air, which had complained that Northwest wanted to destroy it.
 
Encouraging New Carriers
 "This could encourage new entry," said Marvin Cohen, a former chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, who nevertheless worries about the potential danger of reregulation.
The costliness of the hub-and-spoke system was largely brought to light by the recession, which reversed the rise in travel the industry had counted on to pay for its expansion. In the downturn, companies began asking the airlines for steep discounts for business travel and increasingly relied on video conferences, faxes and electronic mail instead of meetings to communicate with their far-flung staffs.
To survive, American carriers have begun concentrating on solidifying their positions abroad, where competition is not yet as keen. The nation's two largest airlines, American and United Airlines, are expected to form closer alliances with big European lines and eventually Far Eastern carriers, just as some of their smaller counterparts have already done. Northwest has teamed with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, USAir with British Airways and Continental with Air Canada.
At the same time, airlines have begun cutting costs at home. American and United say they may soon go so far as to sell domestic hubs and turn over short routes that are unprofitable to lower-cost carriers or large commuter airlines. "We simply feel we have no choice," Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman of United, told analysts recently.
American Airlines, for instance, is considering the sale of its new terminal and hub serving Raleigh and Durham, N.C., which it spent $150 million to build just five years ago. Delta said on Monday that it would cut service on some domestic and international routes to help offset its overexpansion on international routes.
The changes could mean lower fares on international and short-haul routes. Because they lack the sprawling overheads and burdensome union contracts of their larger rivals, small carriers can undercut fares and still make a profit.
For instance, Southwest offers one-way fares of $59 between Cleveland and Chicago. Before it started service recently, the one-way fare on the same route among major carriers was $390. Yet Southwest is among the few airlines making money.
 
Fares May Go Up
 Still, fares on coast-to-coast routes dominated by the big airlines may continue to move higher. Some analysts predict that as airlines like United and American scale back plane deliveries, a shortage of seats could develop early in 1994, allowing them to push up fares.
"The low discount fares of today will be a memory," in most coast-to-coast and international flights, Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst at Salomon Brothers, predicted.
The turmoil in the industry is a direct outgrowth of the aggressive expansion strategies airlines devised to cope with deregulation. The big lines thought that by building elaborate hub systems they could make customers captive to their services, thereby suffocating upstarts. The free-market policies of the two previous Republican administrations encouraged these practices.
Under the hub-and-spoke system, the country was split into regions dominated by single carriers. USAir was king at Pittsburgh, Northwest at Minneapolis, American at Dallas and United at Chicago and Denver. Eventually these networks included international routes as the strong airlines bought operations of collapsing or weak international carriers like Pan American World Airways, Trans World Airlines and Eastern.
As a result, the nation's three largest carriers, American, United and Delta Air Lines, have doubled in size since deregulation. Unable to match the expansion and offer the range of alternatives to customers, new carriers died out in the early 1980's, defeating one of deregulation's goals. People Express, for instance, foundered when it sought to develop major hubs.
The airlines had counted on high fares they could command because of their dominance and steady growth in traffic to pay for this elaborate mass transit air system. For a while they did and the airlines flourished.
But rather than improving service by offering customers more options, the decentralization actually created more inconveniences, reducing the number of nonstop flights and increasing the chances for disruption and safety problems.
Hubs operate by having all flights arrive at two-hour periods in the mornings, afternoons and evenings, putting severe pressure on traffic controllers, ground crews and baggage handlers.
 
Shopping for Bargain Fares
 "It's become traumatic to travel," said Laurie Goulet, a sculptor who recently spent eight hours on USAir getting from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to La Guardia Airport by way of Charlottesville, Va. "The industry has lost sight of what they are supposed to be."
The increased options also put customers in a better position to bargain shop, leading to intense fare wars and behind-the-scenes negotiations by corporations for discounts. This has reduced the industry's fare structure to a jumble of rates and restrictions, which further alienated customers.
Passengers have begun voting with their feet, flocking to low-cost carriers like Southwest. "The American public is finding that Southwest is not only the least expensive way to fly but it is chic because it is financially prudent," Mr. Wolf of United said.
If the erosion of the fare structure was draining, two other factors were devastating. The recession choked off travel and forced corporations to permanently alter their spending habits, and the Persian Gulf war added to airline costs by increasing fuel prices.
Deep cuts in white-collar employees reduced the number of business travelers, who account for about 55 percent of the industry's traffic and 65 percent of its revenues. What's more, most companies now contract with travel agencies to find the lowest fares.
 
Biggest Loss Last Year
 Mr. Maldutis, the Salomon analyst, said the industry had seen almost no growth in travel since 1987. It had its biggest loss last year.
While fuel prices have moderated and traffic has recovered, profitablity has not. And the industry says an economic recovery will not be enough to bring back profits.
Mr. Crandall stressed in a recent meeting with reporters that the industry must shrink and shift its strategy to deliver lower-cost service. The question is how.
Corrective steps like scaling back on fleet expansions and abandoning unprofitable routes alone cannot turn the industry around. While this reduces costs, it cuts the base of revenue even more.
Unions are reluctant to grant further concessions without gaining a stake in the airlines and a role in management.
Selling off major hubs, many of which have new terminals and a base of customers, is also risky. New carriers like Kiwi International Air Lines at Newark have sprung up by hiring skilled workers who have been laid off, leasing planes at low rates and finding gates and slots open at airports where the big carriers have pulled back.

HEADLINE: Networks Gain Program Rights; Producers Lose

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
The Federal Communications Commission reversed itself today and said the television networks should be allowed to own the rerun rights to the prime-time shows they carry.
The decision, which infuriated Hollywood producers, was a victory for ABC, NBC and CBS. Putting aside its ruling of two years ago, the commission said the networks should not be restricted from owning a financial stake in programs they broadcast. 
 The commission also set the stage for eliminating rules that limit the networks' ability to actively market the rerun rights to hits like "The Cosby Show" and "Roseanne." These syndication rights are typically the most profitable part of television production, and have generated hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue for especially successful shows like "M*A*S*H."
 
 
Little Effect on Viewers
 The battle -- which has been called a struggle between the rich and the very wealthy -- has virtually no direct impact on television viewers.
But the decision could have big implications for the future of the television industry. The worldwide market for syndicated TV programming is roughly $5 billion -- a pot of money that the networks have long coveted. And beyond that, today's action could eventually clear the way for the networks to merge with or acquire some of the big movie studios.
The television networks buy most of their prime-time shows from outside producers, and much of the financing is provided by the studios. The money paid by the networks for the first showings of the programs is often not enough to cover production costs. Most producers derive their real profits from fees paid by individual stations for the right to show reruns of these programs.
Today's ruling is certain to be appealed by Hollywood interests, so its future remains in some doubt. In addition, the networks must receive approval from a Federal court in Los Angeles overseeing an antitrust decree involving the same restrictions.
The Justice Department has already asked the court to lift the restrictions, and a decision is expected within a few months.
The restrictions have been defended by a coalition of movie studios, producers, writers and independent television stations. Writers and producers say that the networks still monopolize access to prime-time audiences and can force them to make unfair financial concessions.
But the networks, supported by a growing number of economists and Government officials, argued that the rules were outdated and were being used by the studios to insulate themselves from competition.
 
 
Anger in Hollywood
 Hollywood lobbyists reacted angrily to today's action. "It's a travesty -- it's theater of the absurd," charged Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America. "The decision uncages the three networks. Now they'll own prime time as they once did before the U.S. Government charged them with anti-competitive behavior."
Network executives were elated, but added that they had not won everything they wanted. "It's a big step in the right direction," said Robert Wright, the president of NBC. "Nonetheless, I was surprised that some critical restrictions were kept intact and others were actually increased."
The F.C.C. regulations, known as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, were adopted in 1970 in the wake of an antitrust case against the three networks. At that time, ABC, CBS and NBC held more than 90 percent of the nightly prime-time audience, and the Justice Department documented a persistent pattern of anticompetitive behavior toward producers and independent stations.
But the three networks have seen their share of the prime-time audience drop to 59 percent in 1992, as competition has grown from cable television, independent television stations, the Fox Broadcasting's fledgling network and videocassette recorders. Meanwhile, some of the nation's biggest movie studios, including MCA and Columbia, have been acquired by foreign companies.
As such, the Justice Department, Commerce Department and Federal Trade Commission all argued in 1991 that the rules ought to be abandoned.
After one of the nastiest bouts of political lobbying and internal bickering in its history, a bitterly divided F.C.C. sided with Hollywood's forces in April 1991, voting to relax the rules but to keep many restrictions.
But that order was struck down late last year by the United States Court of Appeals in Chicago, in a verdict that assailed the F.C.C.'s action as unreasonable and unsupported by evidence. The court ordered the commission either to change the rule or justify it more thoroughly.
The acting chairman, James H. Quello, has long favored removing the restrictions entirely, but the two other commissioners voting today had favored continuing the restrictions. One of them, Andrew C. Barrett, said today that he had changed his mind. The other, Ervin S. Duggan, voted with his colleagues but said he would have preferred to argue the issue out in court again.
 
 
Eliminated 40% Rule
 That set the stage for the commission's unexpected 3-to-0 vote today to strike the most important restrictions. It eliminated a rule that prohibited television networks from producing more than 40 percent of their prime-time programming in-house. It also eliminated a rule that sharply restricted the networks' ability to negotiate a financial stake in shows developed by outside producers.
Under that provision, a network could not even begin discussing an investment until 30 days after it had signed a license agreement with the producer. Network executives argued that this rule effectively made it impossible to conduct any negotiations, because producers need to line up financing before they produce the pilot programs for new series.
But the commissioners did not give the networks everything they had sought. In a compromise that was worked out Wednesday, the agency continued to exclude the networks from participation in what are called "first-run syndications" -- shows like "Donahue" and "Oprah" that are developed only for use outside the networks' prime-time schedule.
The commission also expanded a rule that restricted the networks from selling or distributing shows themselves. Under today's action, the networks can act as syndicators in foreign markets but cannot do the same within the United States.

HEADLINE: F.C.C. ORDERS CUTS IN CABLE TV RATES; EASES RERUN RULE

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
In the Government's toughest single consumer-protection action in decades, the Federal Communications Commission today ordered sweeping cuts of cable television prices that could total well over $1 billion nationwide annually. The lower prices could show up in customer bills by this summer.
The cuts, whose depth stunned some industry analysts, will force about two-thirds of the nation's cable systems to reduce their prices for most services by 10 percent. In addition, the agency ordered cable companies to reverse any price increases they imposed since Congress passed a law last fall to regulate the industry. 
 The recent increases are estimated to average about 5 percent, and the combined rollbacks would add up to price cuts of 15 percent or more. They would affect the vast majority of cable television offerings -- from Cable News Network and the Discovery Channel to Nickelodeon and the Arts & Entertainment networks.
 
Premium Channels Unregulated
 The only services that would be entirely free of regulatory oversight would be "pay cable" channels like HBO that are sold individually rather than as part of packages.
The F.C.C. gave consumer groups, local governments and the cable industry 120 days to respond to its order, and said that prices would be frozen at current levels during this period.
The regulations affect about $16 billion of the cable industry's $20 billion in annual revenues. F.C.C. officials estimated that the 10 percent rollback would add up to about $1.2 billion a year nationwide. Beyond that, the industry will have to cancel rate increases adopted since last fall, which together would have totaled about $400 million.
 
Part of Broader Policy
 The rollbacks are only part of a much broader regulatory regime adopted today that could cut deeply into cable television profits for many years. The commission also left ample room for consumers and local governments to demand additional rate cuts in the future, put new restrictions on the prices for set-top boxes and remote-control devices and force the nation's biggest cable companies to change some basic business practices.
In one particularly big blow to the industry, the commission made it virtually impossible for a cable television operator to evade strict rate regulation by shifting basic programming to premium packages that would be more lightly governed. Defying industry pleas, the commission ruled that prices for a bare-bones package of services, like those including only local broadcast stations, would be regulated essentially the same as "enhanced" packages that include movie channels and CNN.
Today's actions did not go as far as many consumer advocates and local government officials had proposed. Since cable rates were deregulated in 1987, prices have risen twice as fast as the general inflation rate and have doubled or tripled in some cities. A wide range of government studies has indicated that prices of the few cable systems that face head-to-head competition are about a third cheaper than the vast majority of systems that have no competition.
"They have only given a slap on the wrist," Gene Kimmelman, legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America and one of the new law's principal supporters, said of the cable companies. "However, it is a savings and the commission left it open for people to bring more data and perhaps get bigger rate reductions."
Cable industry officials reacted to the F.C.C.'s orders with dismay.
"At minimum, it appears that these rules will make it very difficult for us to satisfy the expectations of our subscribers," said James P. Mooney, president of the National Cable Television Association. "If the commission's action exceeds the authority under the statute, I have no doubt these issues will ultimately end up in the courts."
 
Monthly Bills of $20 to $25
 On average, consumer groups estimate, customers spend $20 to $25 a month for the cable offerings that will be regulated, and most of these will probably receive a rate cut of $2 to $3 each month. In New York state, customers typically pay about $22 a month for basic cable service. New York City officials and state regulators said that they would immediately seek the reductions and that most cable customers in New York would probably be eligible for them.
Of potentially greater long-term impact to the industry, the F.C.C. also imposed unexpectedly tough rules that force large cable operators that also produce popular programming to make those shows available on the same prices and conditions to satellite and microwave systems that compete against local cable operators.
These new competitors to traditional cable television systems have argued that giant cable companies like Telecommunications Inc. of Denver have choked off competition because they own stakes in many of the most popular channels and discriminate against distributors that compete against traditional cable operators.
Today's action by the F.C.C. was in response to a law passed in October after a bruising, three-year battle in Congress and over a veto by President Bush. But the law itself was open to a wide range of interpretations, and the regulations adopted today provide the crucial fine print that determines what the actual impact on customers will actually be.
 
 
Details Not Disclosed
 The rate cuts are not automatic, however, and the F.C.C. refused to disclose several key details. Each local government must first ask the F.C.C. to certify it as a legitimate regulatory authority over its cable systems, and the local government will then be able to regulate the price of basic cable service using a benchmark for "reasonable" prices set by the commission. Under previous law, cities were not allowed to regulate prices.
For the broader packages of service, consumers or local government officials must complain to the commission and ask for a rollback and refund. In both cases, however, the commission will use the same benchmarks to determine "reasonable" prices.
The commission refused to say today just what those benchmarks were, though they will be published within a few weeks. But they said that based on price data accumulated during the last six months, from two-thirds to three-quarters of all systems would have to roll back rates at least 10 percent.
Under the law passed last fall, Congress said broadly that "reasonable" charges would be similar to those charged by the few cable systems that face head-to-head competition. More than 99 percent of cable operators enjoy exclusive franchises and are largely free from competition.
 
Systems 27% Cheaper
 Indeed, F.C.C. officials noted today that their data showed that systems facing head-to-head competition were on average 27 percent cheaper than those that have exclusive franchises.
But F.C.C. officials said they were constrained, because the law defines "effective competition" to include cable systems that have signed up fewer than 30 percent of the households in their region. Those systems typically do not face any competition and may simply be expensive. By including the prices of these systems in determining a benchmark for "competitive prices," the disparity between "competitive" and "uncompetitive" drops to only 10 percent.
But even some of those who had pushed for tougher measures praised the commission. "The F.C.C. did its part today on behalf of the nation's cable consumers," said William F. Squadron, Commissioner of Telecommunications and Energy in New York City. "They struck a good balance."

 BODY:
New York State's multi-billion dollar budget agreement, hammered out early this morning, would increase aid to New York City schools, scale back proposed cuts in medical care for the poor, raise cigarette taxes and keep the city's bus, subway and commuter railroad fares intact until 1995.
The deal, announced just after the midnight deadline and described by everyone involved as a "handshake" agreement, leaves many details unresolved, including the total spending for the next fiscal year, which began today. But for political reasons, it was critically important, particularly for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, to declare that at least the broad outline was in place by April 1. [News analysis, page B4.] 
 For the most part, the spending plan seems to follow the fiscal principles established by Mr. Cuomo in January.
 
School Aid Still Faulted
 Lawmakers said the roughly $32 billion budget agreement would increase school aid about $346 million over last year's levels, with about 42 percent of that going to New York City in the next school year. The increase would be paired with a refiguring of the complicated school-aid formula, and would funnel more money to schools with a higher concentration of poor students, including those in New York City.
But Steve Allinger, a lobbyist for the New York City Board of Education, said that the revised formula would not answer the complaint raised by the city in a recent lawsuit: Although it has 37 percent of the students, it receives just 34.9 percent of state aid to schools. The proposal would raise that figure just a few tenths of a percentage point. "The new formula is not earth-shattering," he said.
The budget would also eliminate a plan by Governor Cuomo to save $111 million by limiting personal care at home for Medicaid recipients to 120 hours a month. Instead, budget negotiators said they had settled on a plan to wrest close to $50 million in savings by requiring some patients to share personal-care services and by firming up guidelines to evaluate how much personal care patients really need.
 
M.T.A. Fare to Stay $1.25
 The spending plan would supply virtually all the five-year, $9.6 billion re-building plan that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has contended is critical to the health of the subway and bus system. And it would do so without increasing the $1.25 subway and bus fare.
The transportation money is to be spent on rebuilding subway stations and tracks, expanding an automated fare card system and buying a new fleet of city buses. But the agreement leaves unresolved $126 million in financing, intended to come from New York City, that the city says it cannot afford.
While Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders emerged from a meeting at 12:01 A.M. today to cheerfully announce that they had the broad outlines of a deal, negotiators admitted they had much to do and, indeed, had for the ninth year in a row failed to complete a budget by the start of the fiscal year. "There are still a lot of stray cats and dogs," said one top legislative aide.
 
Relies on Improving Business
 Even after all the details are known, it will be difficult to determine whether the budget is balanced. At first glance, it seems to spend more than the state is expected to receive. But if, as many officials anticipate, New York's economy improves faster than in recent projections, tax collections will increase and the extra revenue will help to avert a deficit.
The budget represents a rise of at least $810 million over Governor Cuomo's original $31.5 million spending plan, attributed in part to taxes the state received earlier than expected and to a one-time $200 million Medicaid payment from the Federal Government. The additions gave lawmakers an irresistable opportunity to restore aid to programs that had been severely cut in the Governor's plan.
And lawmakers, who have been roundly criticized in the past for the state's reliance on questionable borrowing practices to raise money, were also able to win agreement on a new plan to change the way the state does its borrowing.
Under the agreement, the state's voters would consider a constitutional amendment that would provide for a variety of measures: letting the state put more than one bond act on the ballot at a time, requiring a new method of reviewing capital projects and capping the amount of new revenue-backed debt to 5 percent of the state's total personal income.
The budget agreement would devote $100 million to a reserve fund that could be used toward the $311 million that New York might owe Delaware and several states after a Supreme Court ruling earlier this week. Lawmakers said that it was unclear when the bill would be due or what the total would be, but that more than $100 million more could be raised by refinancing the state's debt to obtain more favorable rates.
Some of the earlier tax and fee proposals fell by the wayside during the negotiations. Governor Cuomo had suggested rescinding the state's $70-million-a-year tax on hotel rooms that cost more than $100 a night; the tax stayed. He had also proposed starting a new state lottery game that would have generated $25 million this year, but that proposal was rejected.
Another Cuomo proposal, to raise $64 million by increasing taxes on hospitals and nursing homes and to raise $42 million more by imposing a new tax on pharmacies, was also rejected. But the state will continue to impose the existing taxes on the hospitals and nursing homes, which raise about $259 million a year.
The budget would also raise cigarette taxes by 17 cents a pack, to 56 cents, down from Governor Cuomo's original proposal of a 21-cent increase.
State legislators spent most of today digesting details of the budget, which they expect to vote on over the weekend unless something happens to derail the agreement. Many said that while they could live with the broad outlines of the plan, they were disappointed about individual pieces.
For instance, state leaders agreed to restore $10 million that was to be cut from drug prevention programs in New York City schools. But other drug treatment programs still face cuts of $20 million. And while some money has been restored to the state's probation department, the current cuts look to total about $14 million, mostly in New York City, leaving officials worried about a potential breakdown in the program.

HEADLINE: TOWARD THE SUMMIT;
PRESIDENT URGES AMERICA TO BACK HELP FOR MOSCOW

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANNAPOLIS, Md., April 1

 BODY:
Declaring that the United States "cannot stop investing in the peace now that we have obtained it," President Clinton today began the arduous task of convincing Americans preoccupied with domestic woes that it is also necessary to help restore the economy of Russia.
Mr. Clinton, in a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, laid the groundwork for the summit meeting he will hold with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia this weekend by signaling that he does not intend to neglect concerns at home. 
 The latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows that American support for aid to Russia is lukewarm at best, but Mr. Clinton asserted that helping Russia to regain its footing on the path to democratic reforms would ultimately benefit Americans.
 
'America's Broader Purposes'
 "In a time of dramatic global change, we must define America's broader purposes anew," he said. "And part of that purpose clearly consists of reviving economic growth here at home, for the opportunity to do well here at home is the ultimate basis of our influence abroad." [Excerpts, page A6.]
The President said democratic change in Russia would help the United States by reducing the chance of nuclear engagement, allowing Congress to reduce military spending and giving Western nations access to resources there through enhanced trading opportunities.
Such aid would not be charity, he said, but "an investment in our own future."
"Our ability to put people first at home requires that we put Russia and its neighbors first on our agenda abroad," he said.
But according to the poll results, Mr. Clinton may have a tough sell. In a telephone survey of 1,368 adults conducted Sunday through Wednesday, 52 percent of those polled said they were willing to support aid to Russia if it meant averting civil war there, but that support fell to 41 percent when the economic aid was intended to "help Russia reform its economy."
And only 29 percent favor offering such support if its aim is to keep Mr. Yeltsin, who is viewed uncertainly by many Americans, in power. Thirty percent of those polled said it was "very important" that Mr. Yeltsin remain in power. In 1990 and 1991, similar polls found that between 55 and 60 percent of respondents thought it "very important" for former President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to remain in charge.
The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Its results also demonstrate that Mr. Clinton has an opening to sell his plan to Americans. Among the distinct minority who said they have been following developments in Russia "very closely," one-seventh of the sample, many more favored giving aid to Russia than did the public at large.
Among these people, 66 percent favored aid to help Russia reform its economy, as against 41 percent of the sample generally. And they were 25 percentage points more in favor of aid to help Yeltsin remain in power than was the general public.
 
Case for Helping Yeltsin
 Such findings suggest that the more people learn about the situation in Russia the more likely they are to support greater American involvement. Mr. Clinton's goal, in today's speech and in the coming weeks, will be to make a compelling case that American self-interest is bound up in Russia's.
"During the cold war, our foreign policies largely focused on the relations among nations," Mr. Clinton said to the newspaper editors today. "Our strategies sought a balance to keep the peace."
"Today our policies must also focus on relations within nations, on a nation's form of governance, on its economic structure, on its ethnic tolerance," he continued. "These are of concern to us for they shape how these nations treat their neighbors as well as their own people, and whether they are reliable when they give their word."
In his address today, Mr. Clinton offered new and unequivocal support for Mr. Yeltsin, who has struggled in recent weeks to retain his grip on power in spite of the efforts of rebellious members of the Russian Parliament to oust him.
In his prepared remarks, Mr. Clinton said that America's "interests lie with Russian reform and Russian reformers." When he spoke he added, "Led by Boris Yeltsin."
 
Stormy Early History
 "We must be concerned over every retreat from democracy, but not every growing pain within democracy," Mr. Clinton said. "Let me remind you of our own early history. It was marked by a revision of our governing charter and fist fights in Congress."
"As long as there are reformers in the Russian Federation and the other states leading the journey toward democracy's horizon, our strategy must be to support them," he said. "And our place must be at their side. Moreover we and the Russian people must not give up on reform simply because of the slow pace of economic renewal."
Mr. Clinton and his aides have said that they plan to propose a package of aid that will focus less on the infusion of cash into the Russian economy and more on the exchange of goods, expertise and training. "Russia's economic vessel is too large and leaky for us to bail her out," he asserted.
Instead, the Clinton Administration has indicated that it will push other nations to join in a $30 billion package of aid that would be complemented by American efforts to help Russian farmers and entrepreneurs. White House officials have also said they would appeal to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to help stabilize Russian currency and curb inflation.
 
A Taste of Freedom
 "The burning question today is whether Russia's economic progress, whether Russia's democratic progress, will continue or be thwarted," Mr. Clinton said. "I believe that freedom, like anything sweet, is hard to take from people once they've had a taste of it. The human spirit is hard to bottle up again. And it will be hard to bottle up again in Russia."
Mr. Clinton acknowledged the difficulty he will have convincing Americans that aid to a volatile foreign nation would be money well spent at a time when the American economy is lagging in job creation.
"For most Americans these events, while dramatic, are still very remote from their immediate concerns," the President said.
But he added, "I would argue that we must -- that we must do what we can, and we must act now -- not out of charity, but because it is a wise investment, a wise investment building on what has already been done, and looking to our own future."

HEADLINE: Japan, Still in Slump, Plans 2d Public Works Program

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, April 2

 BODY:
Facing a stagnant economy and heavy pressure from the Clinton Administration to reduce Japan's yawning trade surplus, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has pledged to push for a huge new public works program to get the economy rolling again and to rescue a battered financial system.
Mr. Miyazawa said at a news conference Thursday that the new plan, which will include heavy spending on telecommunications "superhighways" and computers for schools, will be larger than last year's supplementary budget of 10.7 trillion yen, currently the equivalent of $93 billion. There has been speculation it will run as high as $130 billion. 
 The announcement helped send stock prices soaring. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 507.64 points, or 2.73 percent, at 19,099.09, on Thursday, the highest level in nearly a year. And stocks continued to advance today, rising 347.85 points, or 1.82 percent, to 19,446.94.
"At this point, you can't find anyone who is willing to bet against the Government," said Jesper Koll, an economist here with S. G. Warburg Securities
The timing of the announcement was excellent, since Mr. Miyazawa is planning to visit Washington in two weeks for a meeting with President Clinton at which he reportedly hopes to deliver evidence of a stronger economy. The United States has pressed Japan to revive domestic demand so the country will export less and import more, reducing its huge trade surpluses.
But some analysts warned that the prospects for an economic revival and a recovery in the deeply depressed stock market were still fragile.
"We still have some worries about the economy's recovery," said Yuichi Matsushita, a stock market strategist here with the Nikko Securities Company. "It is not certain yet. But psychologically there is some improvement."
Economists say that Japan's economy grew by 1 percent or less in the fiscal year that ended March 31 and that many indicators, like consumer spending and corporate investment, remain anemic. The Government is forecasting growth of 3.3 percent in the fiscal year that just began, but private forecasts range from less than 1 percent to 2.5 percent.
The outcome of the stimulus plan could have a major political impact on Japan because of the pressure being applied by the Clinton Administration. The President and various American officials have issued threats and exhortations to get Japan to reduce its record trade surpluses through any means, including retaliatory trade actions.
The two countries have permitted the dollar to decline in value against the yen, which makes Japan's exports more expensive and makes it less expensive for the Japanese to import American products. The dollar fell to 114.50 yen in Tokyo Thursday, a postwar low.
In addition, the Clinton Administration has encouraged the Japanese Government to take strong measures to end the recession here, which has been caused at least in part by a plunge in stock and real estate prices over the last three years.
 
Some Warnings
 Many economists warned that the new spending program was not as drastic as it seemed to be.
"It's always the same with these packages," said Susumu Kato, the chief economist here with CS First Boston (Japan). "The Government just includes everything, which makes the numbers look large."
Mr. Koll of S. G. Warburg said: "Once again, the Government is doing an excellent job of promoting their new package even before there's a formal package. They are giving the impression of a whole New Deal in Japan."

Sweeping cuts in cable television prices were ordered in the Government's toughest consumer-protection action in decades. The move will force most cable companies to reduce prices by 10 percent, which could total $1 billion nationwide. The lower prices could show up in customer bills by this summer. [Page A1.]
The television networks were allowed to own the rerun rights to their prime-time shows. In a victory for ABC, NBC and CBS and a defeat for Hollywood movie makers, the Government reversed a decision made two years ago. [A1.]

Sterling Software agreed to buy Systems Center in a stock swap valued at $185 million. The deal would make Sterling the nation's third-largest mainframe software maker. [D2.]
Intel plans a $1 billion expansion in New Mexico in what it called the largest investment in a U.S. chip plant. Production from the expansion, which will create 1,000 jobs, will start in 1995. [D2.]
A car alarm called Lasso warns thieves, in two languages, to "Pull over now, the engine is about to stop and loud sirens will start. Get out of my vehicle." [D2.]
Drug company executives said they might slow or stop development of new vaccines if the Administration goes ahead with its plan to have the Government buy vaccines for all children. [A20.]
 
The Economy
Congress should wait to act on the free-trade pact with Mexico until it completes work on the President's economic program in the fall, the Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, said. [D1.]
Senate Republicans decided to block President Clinton's $16.3 billion jobs program with a filibuster. Democrats pledged to keep the Senate in session until the hammerlock was broken. [A20.]
Stocks performed well in the first quarter, with most helped by the fall in interest rates and the economic recovery. But anyone who held medical-related stocks was badly hurt. [D1.]
Further signs that the economy is slowing were evident in data showing slackened corporate purchasing plans, slower construction spending and higher jobless benefit claims. [D3.]
The B.C.C.I. trial became a shouting match. The defense demanded a mistrial and the prosecution criticized the judge. [D3.]

HEADLINE: Thunder of Debate on Owls and Jobs Rings in Forests as Opponents Face Off

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., April 1

 BODY:
A propaganda frenzy, a lobbying blitz in the forest mist, has prevailed for days in anticipation of President Clinton's timber conference here on Friday.
On the ground and in the air, people in catalogue-fresh khaki pants and stiff boots have been hustled around the forests of the Northwest. They hop from chainsaw-ravaged ridge to shaggy-topped forest, escorted by timber representatives or environmentalists trying to show off the trees and stumps that make their political points. 
 For any of the President's four touring Cabinet members or other Federal officials who may still think "clearcut" describes a bad day at the barber, a fleet of helicopters, light planes and four-wheel-drive vehicles stand ready. Radio advertisements sponsored by the opposing sides fill the airwaves, aimed at influencing the visitors from the East.
Given all that is at stake, the bustle is understandable. The Federal courts have kept logging operations on millions of acres of national forests shut down for almost two years. The courts have acted under laws intended to protect the northern spotted owl and other threatened wildlife, but in doing so they have posed their own threat, to tens of thousands of timber workers who stand to lose their jobs if the restrictions continue.
Now, in his effort to break the impasse, Mr. Clinton is coming here for a round-table talk with the competing sides that is aimed at bringing peace to the woods and fulfilling his campaign assertion that it is possible to protect a rare natural resource like the forests of the Pacific Northwest without putting a lot of people out of work.
 
Lobbying With Help of Forest
 Little wonder that the Federal officials who have been touring the region in preparation for the President's arrival have had little trouble getting someone to keep them company. Or that at night, courtesy of the nation's major environmental groups, they can dine on cuisine featuring the bounty of the Northwest: venison, salmon, fiddlehead ferns, mushrooms, hazelnut biscotti, Oregon ale and pinor noir.
"Actually, the hazelnuts were grown near the forest, not in it," said Jim Middaugh, a spokesman for the Ancient Forest Alliance. "And the wine demonstrates what you can do by transforming low-value, cut-over private forest land to vineyards."
The rank and file of the timber industry is not being left out of the lobbying. On Friday, all the timber mills in Oregon are giving their workers the day off and busing them to Portland, where they will presumably mingle with an international gathering of environmentalists who are being entertained tonight by Neil Young, Bonnie Raitt and other singers.
At all hours, it seems, radio stations here are broadcasting advertisements. For some, pronunciation has been a problem. "In ORE-uh-gone . . ." went the voice-of-God announcer in one advertisement for a timber group. As any Northwesterner will tell you, it is pronounced "ORE-uh-gun." The advertisement was sponsored by the Oregon Lands Coalition, part of the New York-based Alliance for America.
The forests, usually lonely and rather wet, have been crowded with opinions this week.
 
Environment vs. Jobs
 Standing on a logging road in Oregon's Willamette National Forest, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt gazed over a patchwork of cut and replanted timberland.
"You see that ridge," said Lynn Burditt, a district ranger with the Forest Service, which manages the national forests. She pointed to a pair of weathered, dying trees left standing in an area that had been cleared of clear cut. "That is a radical concept, Mr. Secretary, the idea that you leave something behind for wildlife after a timber harvest."
Nearby, Representative Peter A. DeFazio, the Oregon Democrat whose district includes the Willamette forest, tried to keep from laughing. The two snags poking out of the cleared area were nothing to behold, he said in an aside.
Mr. DeFazio pointed to the erosion from the logging road, the blackened ground from a Forest Service "slash burn," and the snags. Then he rolled his eyes. "This is not a good example of the future of forestry," he said.
North, across the Columbia River, Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy took off in a plane that also carried Jim Pissot of the National Audubon Society and Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat of Washington. The plane banked over the log-loading docks of Longview, Wash., where a veritable forest of logs cut from private land are shipped overseas every day. Environmentalists say exports are the reason small mills are having trouble getting timber, while the industry blames efforts to save the spotted owl.
"Norm was trying to stand between the windows as we flew over the export docks," Mr. Pissot said, telling a version of the story that Mr. Dicks's staff members dispute. "I stepped to the front of the plane and pointed out that there were five ships loaded with logs -- all of them bypassing American mills."
When the group landed and visited a grove of 500-year-old cedar trees in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, Mr. Espy, who as Agriculture Secretary oversees the Forest Service, seemed sympathetic to environmental concerns. He said he was from the Mississippi Delta area and had never seen trees the size of the Northwest giants.
"This is God's hand," Mr. Espy said. "I don't think it should be touched except by God."
 
A Different Perspective
 But after a visit to a timber town and a helicopter tour of Weyerhaeuser Company lands, where corn rows of Douglas firs grow fast and straight, very much at the hand of man, Mr. Espy seemed to be leaning with the other side.
"I'm sitting with people who have lost their jobs," he said, sipping coffee at Duffy's Restaurant in the timber town of Aberdeen, Wash. "This is real life."
Mr. Pissot, of the Audubon Society, acknowledged that there was ample hyperbole from both sides in their efforts to influence the touring officials. "We want them to see the worst of the clearcuts; the other side wants them to go to a food bank in a mill town," he said. "That's the value of the summit."
Sometimes the tours can backfire. Recently Weyerhaeuser, the world's largest timber company, flew a helicopter loaded with journalists over its land, trying to show how the company can accommodate wildlife within its tree farms. But then the helicopter pilot buzzed right over an eagle's nest full of eaglets. The mother bird squawked; the Weyerhaeuser tour director frowned.
Lighthawk, a group that calls itself the environmental air force, has perhaps the greatest presence in the air. It has been using five planes and a helicopter to fly the powerful and influential over lands that had been stripped of trees.
"Most people have an incredible conversion experience, as we call it, after flying with us," said Les Welsh, the Northwest director of Lighthawk. "No matter what amount of information you get from the timber industry or the environmental community, nothing gives you a more precise view than seeing it with your own eyes."
Although Lighthawk was able to persuade Representative Thomas S. Foley, the Speaker of the House, to fly over the Colville National Forest in his eastern Washington district, it has been unsuccessful in its attempt to fly Katie McGinty, the White House director of environmental policy. A native of Philadelphia, Ms. McGinty is still trying to learn all the trees in the forest.
The view from the air is misleading, say logging advocates. "We are replanting six trees for every one harvested," said Evelyn Badger of the Oregon Lands Coalition. "There are more trees in the Pacific Northwest now than there were 40 years ago."
Environmentalists, of course, disagree on the last point. But then, such is the nature of the timber word war. Whole forests have been felled to print the competing assertions.
 
Hearing All Sides
 At times, the timber industry has contended that saving the forest in which the northern spotted owl lives would put 100,000 people out of work, a figure that is three times as large as the highest Government estimate.
On the other hand, environmental groups have left the impression that very little old forest is left, less than two million acres. The Forest Service counts six million acres, fragmented though it is.
Mr. Clinton says one reason for holding the forest conference is to bring all the competing voices into one room, so that truth, common ground or something in between can emerge from a day of round-table talk.
That, at least, is the hope of the President and his entourage, which includes Mr. Babbitt, Mr. Espy, Vice President Al Gore, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich. To keep exaggeration and spin doctors at bay, only "local" people from each side of the issue were invited to the table.
But already White House aides are despairing at reports that many of these unschooled local types spent Wednesday in an intensive course on how to speak in sound bites.
 
Poll Reflects Clinton Balancing Act
 In the public eye, President Clinton has managed to balance his concern for jobs and the environment. Americans think he cares about both, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
Asked whether Mr. Clinton preferred protecting jobs or protecting the environment, 47 percent said jobs, 33 percent said the environment and 5 percent said both. The nationwide poll, in which 1,368 adults were interviewed by telephone, was conducted from Sunday through Wednesday. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Respondents were also asked whether they agreed with the statement "We must protect the environment, even if it means jobs in your community are lost because of it." Sixty percent agreed, and 31 percent disagreed. When the same question was asked during the Presidential election, a time of public worry about the recession, 45 percent agreed and 45 percent disagreed. The question was also asked in April 1990 before the recession began, when 56 percent agreed that the environment must be protected, even at the cost of local jobs, and 36 percent disagreed.

HEADLINE: A Balancing Act for Haiti;
Developing the Plan for Aristide's Return Is Proving a Delicate and Complex Puzzle

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, April 1

 BODY:
For months, diplomats who have negotiated here say, close supporters of Haiti's ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, have focused on little beyond the legitimacy that comes from his having won 67 percent of the vote. Whenever ready, mediators have often heard, Washington could restore their President with a simple phone call.
Father Aristide's foes in the military and economic elite convinced themselves long ago, however, that Haiti's first democratically elected President is a populist demon bent on avenging his violent overthrow by soldiers 18 months ago. They had hoped that the outside world would come to accept their view and let them get on with their lives, unworried by the prospect of his return. 
 Now United Nations negotiations aimed at restoring Father Aristide are entering a decisive phase. Diplomats involved in the effort are working hard to convince all sides in this deeply fragmented society that rather than to persist in holding such starkly two-dimensional views of the situation, all must be prepared for dramatic give and take to find a solution that will save this country from an impending catastrophe.
 
Three-Dimensional Chess
 In a country where politics have traditionally been a brutal winner-take-all affair, diplomats have likened the complexity of fashioning the necessary compromises to three-dimensional chess. "It is like building a prefabricated house in which all the pieces must snap together simultaneously or the whole thing falls apart," one diplomat said.
In recent days, diplomats involved in the negotiating effort say, they have felt strongly that -- with the acceptance by most here of the principles that Father Aristide will return to power soon and that his bitterest foes in the army and Government will be removed from office -- resolution of the country's crisis is near.
Raising the many necessary buttresses, nearly all at once, diplomats close to the negotiations say, is the complicated trick required to complete the effort.
Guarantees for the safety of Father Aristide's foes must be put in place rapidly. Many say this will require not only some form of amnesty or pardon for army leaders to induce them to surrender their power, but also a quickly beefed-up international presence in the country to preserve the peace once they do so.
 
More Observers
 Already the United Nations has about 150 human rights observers in Haiti. Though negotiators are not yet saying so, it is widely believed here that their number could be rapidly increased or even supplemented by a highly visible peacekeeping contingent.
Almost simultaneously, diplomats say, a new Government must be formed that not only gives the ousted President a real sense of influence over the country's direction, but reassures others -- from outright opponents to political leaders who have supported his return -- that a true consensus is being forged for the first time in Haiti.
Furthermore, new leadership for the army and for a new civilian police force that is projected must be selected, most likely from a military corps that in the past has shown neither professionalism nor discipline.
 
A Time Line for Return
 Should all of these elements come together, supported by large-scale economic aid, Father Aristide's return to Haiti would occur within six months.
The daunting nature of carrying off so many objectives before the paralysis of political infighting -- almost a certainty here -- sets in, or mischief aimed at derailing the whole process takes over, is apparent to both diplomats and to Haitian political experts.
"There is tremendous pressure from the international community right now," said one mainstream businessman who supports Father Aristide's negotiated return. "For the last year and a half all we had was mixed signals. Now there is a clear path, and that is quite a change, but knowing my own country, I just don't know how it is all going to work out."
 
Little Sign of Consensus
 The difficulties are illustrated by the discord already apparent over the relatively limited task of choosing a new Prime Minister to head the next government. Although the process calls for Father Aristide to select a "consensus" figure, there is little sign of consensus building here, even among the ousted President's supporters.
Diplomats and Haitian political analysts have said that one of the factors that contributed to Father Aristide's ouster after nearly eight months in office was that the President, a political neophyte, failed to bring many of his pre-election allies into positions of responsibility. Even fewer attempts were made to build new alliances.
"They are going to have do a lot better than that this time," one diplomat said. "If they can't, this whole thing is going to take off like a lead balloon."

HEADLINE: TOWARD THE SUMMIT;
In Clinton's Words: We Need Yeltsin

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: ANNAPOLIS, Md., April 1

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's speech today to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, which met at the United States Naval Academy:
Russia's economic recovery may be slow, but it is in the interests of all who seek more robust global growth to insure that, aided by American business and trade, Russia rises to her great economic potential. 
 The burning question today is whether Russia's economic progress, whether Russia's democratic progress, will continue or be thwarted. I believe that freedom, like anything sweet, is hard to take from people once they've had a taste of it. The human spirit is hard to bottle up again. And it will be hard to bottle up again in Russia.
Yet if we cannot be certain of how Russia's affairs will proceed, we are nonetheless certain of our own interests: The interests of all Americans like with efforts that enhance our security and our prosperity. That's why our interests lie with Russian reform and with Russian reformers led by Boris Yeltsin.
 
Support Must Be Broad
 I won't describe today all the specific ideas that I plan to discuss with him, and of course I don't know all those that he will discuss with me. But I want to tell you the principles on which our efforts to assist reform will rest.
First, our investments in Russian reform must be tangible to the Russian people. Support for reform must come from the ground up, and that will only occur if our efforts are broadly dispersed and not focused just on Moscow.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Our goal must be to insure that the Russian people soon come to feel that they are the beneficiaries of reform, and not its victims. We must help them to recognize that their sufferings today are not the birth pangs of democracy and capitalism but the death throes of dictatorship and communism.
Second, our investments in Russian reform must be designed to have lasting impact. Russia's economic vessel is too large and leaky for us to bail it out; that's not what's at issue here. Our challenge is to provide some tools to help the Russians do things that work for themselves.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Third, our people must do what we can to have people-to-people initiatives, not just government-to-government ones.
 
Approach Must Be Personal
 We've entered a new era in which the best way to achieve many of our goals abroad is not through diplomats or dollars, but through private citizens who can impart the skills and habits that are the life blood of democracy and free markets.
We intend to expand efforts for retired American business executives to work with Russian entrepreneurs to start new businesses.
We intend to work so that our farmers can teach modern farming practices, so that our labor leaders can share the basics of trade unionism, so that Americans experienced in grass roots activities can impart the techniques that ensure responsive government, so that our armed forces can engage in more exchanges with the Russian military. And so that thousands and thousands of young Russians who are reform's primary beneficiaries and reform's primary constituency, so that they can come to our country and study our government, our economy, and our society -- not because it's perfect, but because it's a great example of a democracy at work.
And fourth, our investments in reform must be part of a partnership among all the newly independent states and the international community. They must be extended in concert with measures from our allies, many of whom have at least as much stake in the survival of Russian democracy as we do.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Fifth, we must emphasize investments in Russia that enhance our own security. I want to talk with President Yeltsin about steps we can take together to insure that denuclearization continues in Russia and her neighboring states.

 	 	 		. . .	 	And I'll suggest steps both of us can take to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, something that will be a major, major cause of concern for years to come.
 
Vision Must Be Long-Term
 Sixth, we must recognize that our policies toward Russia and the other states comprise a long-term strategy that may take years to work completely. That was the key to our success in the cold war. We were in it for the long run -- not to win every day, not to know what every development in every country would be. We had clear principles, clear interests, clear values, a clear strategy, and we were in it for the long run.

 	 	 		. . .	 	As long as there are reformers in the Russian federation and the other states leading the journey toward democracy's horizon, our strategy must be to support them. And our place must be at their side.

HEADLINE: Coca Output Stayed Level in '92 For the 3d Year, State Dept. Says

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
Last year, for the third year in a row, there was no significant increase in the cultivation of coca, the plant from which cocaine is derived, the State Department said today.
But it said the fight against narcotics trafficking was hampered by political instability, particularly in the Middle East, Asia, Peru and the republics of the former Soviet Union. 
 In its annual International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, the State Department said worldwide cultivation of coca rose about 3 percent in 1992. In the years up to 1989, production had been growing by 10 percent to 20 percent a year.
The report praised the efforts against drug trafficking in the Bahamas, which has been a major transit point for drugs flowing into the United States, and Mexico, which remains a major source of cheap brown heroin but has waged a concerted campaign to root out Government corruption related to drugs.
 
The Troubles That Remain
 But the report noted disturbing developments in the international fight against drug traffickers, including:
*The decision by President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru to suspend the judiciary and congress in April. This led to a cutoff of most United States economic assistance, including funds for programs to combat drug trafficking and to promote other crops. Peru's efforts to curb coca production was also hampered by Shining Path guerrillas.
*The diversion of manpower and money to combat Colombia's coca cultivation to the manhunt for Pablo Escobar, the drug lord whose escape from prison in July embarrassed the Government.
*The failure by the military Government of Burma to halt the cultivation of opium. Burma is estimated to account for more than 50 percent of illicit opium production worldwide.
*A 12 percent rise in cultivation in Afghanistan, the second-largest producer of opium, because political instability hindered anti-drug efforts.
State Department officials also expressed concern that the economic chaos that has accompanied the breakup of the Soviet Union is leading to an increase in opium-poppy production in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and is providing fertile ground for drug-trafficking rings in Russia.
The report was issued as the Clinton Administration is conducting a wide-ranging review of United States anti-drug policy and, according to reports, is consider diverting funds from drug-eradication programs in producing countries to efforts to reduce demand in the United States.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Filibuster Stalls Passage Of Clinton's $16 Billion Jobs Bill

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
Capping a week of cable-televised harangues and threats, the Senate's 43 Republicans got serious today and decided to block passage of President Clinton's $16.3 billion jobs program with a filibuster.
The Senate's 57 Democrats met privately, and then pledged to keep the Senate in session until the Republican hammerlock was broken, even if that meant delaying a two-week vacation and fund-raising opportunity set to begin Friday. 
Democrats filed a motion tonight to cut off debate on the bill, but there was little expectation that it would succeed. Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said the Senate would meet on Saturday and again on Monday to vote on ending the debate, and other lawmakers said they would not be surprised if the dispute stretched well into next week.
"I don't see any way out of this impasse," Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, said as the Senate recessed late tonight.
 
Bruising Political Animus
 Mr. Dole's comment ended a day of bruising political animus over the jobs measure, a comparatively small spending bill that has provoked an early test of wills between the two parties.
Democrats accused their opponents of plunging Congress back into a despised state of political gridlock, and suggested that the Republicans wanted to humiliate Mr. Clinton as he flew to Canada for a meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
"The problem is they're trying to embarrass the President, to pull the rug out from under him at a critical moment," Senator Mitchell said.
The Republicans denied the accusation and said they were taking a stand against adding another $16.3 billion to the Federal deficit -- much of it, they charged, in the form of pork-barrel payoffs to election-year backers. "Gridlock?" Senator Dole said on Wednesday. "Pork-lock, pork-lock!"
Today, Mr. Dole's aides brandished a letter, signed by all 42 of his Republican colleagues, stating that they would not allow a vote on the jobs bill because it is "contrary to demands from taxpayers all across America."
The Democrats need only 51 votes to pass the bill, but first they need 60 votes to end the debate over it, something they cannot muster without Republican help.
Mr. Mitchell vowed that there would be no compromise, but at least one Republican Senator, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said he had already been called by a White House official looking for suggestions to end the standoff. He declined to identify the official.
 
Willing to Bargain
 Several Republicans seemed willing to bargain, too, suggesting they might support a pared-down bill that retained about $6 billion of the most politically salable programs: jobless benefits, inner-city summer jobs and childhood immunizations. And a few Democrats, none rabid fans of Mr. Clinton's proposal, predicted that sooner or later that will happen.
"I think we're probably going to end up going back to where we started -- passing those things that are needed, delaying those that aren't," said Senator David L. Boren of Oklahoma, who tried but failed last week to put off spending about half the money the President is seeking. "The people want deficit reduction."
The President's proposal would create the equivalent of about 200,000 jobs by providing hundreds of programs to build sewer systems, repair dams, run inner-city summer schools and perform other public works. It also allots large sums to programs that would create few jobs, including $1.9 billion to make up a shortfall in a college-student loan program and about $700 million to buy computers and telephone switches for Federal agencies.
 
It's Power Politics
 Whatever the merits of the programs, the Senate debate is largely over power politics. Democrats want to preserve Mr. Clinton's series of legislative victories, and Republicans want to bring him down a notch.
Since last Thursday, Democrats have excoriated the Republicans daily on the C-Span cable network, saying they are strangling the economy and leaving the jobless empty-handed for political gain.
But the Republicans clearly feel they have gotten the best of the televised fight. They have repeatedly lambasted clauses they say would allot money for canoe-racing courses and warming huts at ice rinks.
"It's as close as we're going to get in the 103d Congress to a vote on the defining issue of government waste and pork," said Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas.

HEADLINE: NEWSPAPERS TOLD: SIMPLIFY, SIMPLIFY

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, April 1

 BODY:
American newspapers are dull and difficult to read. But different ways of writing news articles could help newspapers attract some of the readers they have lost.
That was the conclusion of a major study made public here this week at the annual convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. The study suggests that newspapers must challenge many of the rules that have governed journalism for generations. 
 The study was prepared by the group's literacy committee, which was formed partly because of growing alarm that young Americans do not read well enough to understand newspapers and are abandoning them.
The literacy panel challenged the fundamental form used for newspaper articles, the "inverted pyramid," in which the the top is heavy with important facts.
The panel's work is part of growing efforts by news professionals to grapple with the effect of limited literacy and to try to re-invigorate newspapers.
 
More Than Just Esthetics
 The study's conclusions appear to bolster efforts at some newspapers to increase the quality of writing and to vary the writing styles. But to the esthetic reasons that have been advanced in the past as reasons for these changes, the report adds an economic incentive: survival.
"The basic conservatism and frantic pace of our profession keep us from enlarging our repertoire of forms," the study said. "So year by year, we keep boring and confusing our readers and driving them away."
Experimenting with articles published in The St. Petersburg Times this January, researchers had reporters try four different writing approaches. Each of the four differently written articles about the same event was printed in some copies of the St. Petersburg newspaper and researchers then interviewed readers.
Younger and less frequent newspaper readers favored techniques other than the common inverted-pyramid style article, the study found, suggesting that newspaper writing could be altered to attract new readers.
 
Examples of Writing
 One form tried by the researchers was traditional style. ("Pets remain a popular gift despite the advice of animal advocates," one of the St. Petersburg Times articles began.)
Another tried to be more narrative, telling a tale. ("Just before Christmas three years ago, Lesly Stevens was forced to play Scrooge. But the result was a better life for Pumpkin, a 9-week-old kitten.")
A third type of article attempted to respond to what the study said was a typical newspaper reader's problem: that typical articles assume readers understand more than they do. In this writing approach, reporters attempted "radical clarity," arranging material in order and explaining everything. ("Imagine yourself in this situation: You get an adorable puppy as a holiday gift.")
The fourth approach to writing made the writer's point of view obvious. ("They are the little animals the holiday season purports to adore: The puppies with the big eyes and floppy ears.")
The study found that the articles with the writer's point of view were least effective to readers.

HEADLINE: Economy Stressed Over Trade

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1

 BODY:
The Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, said today that while the Clinton Administration was determined to win Congressional approval of the free-trade pact with Mexico this year, Congress should wait to act until it has completed work on the President's economic program in the fall.
In one of the first interviews he has granted since he took office, Mr. Bentsen said he did not want Congressional opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement to spill over onto the economic package. Mr. Bentsen is not only President Clinton's main spokesman on economic matters but also one of the Administration's chief political and legislative strategists.
 
 
'One Thing at a Time'
 "We must not be too diffuse in our effort," he said. "We really have to concentrate on one thing at a time in terms of legislative effort." 
 Still, at a time when the Administration sometimes seems to talk with several different voices on trade issues, Mr. Bentsen left no doubt that he stood behind the agreement with Mexico and also wanted to bring worldwide trade negotiations to a successful conclusion by the end of this year. The pact is scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1.
Over a fruit-salad lunch, the Treasury Secretary addressed these other matters:
*The Administration will continue to advocate a tax credit for new business investments, despite the lack of enthusiasm in Congress and among many business executives. "It gives you a big bang for the buck" in terms of creating jobs, he said.
*The United States must support Russia's offer to repay only $3.5 billion of the roughly $15 billion in interest and principal it owes this year to Western creditors. It is not realistic to expect larger payments this year, he said.
*The Administration is weighing various new taxes to pay for Mr. Clinton's health-care program. "People are willing to pay for health insurance reform," he said. "The questions are how much, how far you go and how fast you do it, and those decisions have sure not been made."
*The Administration will conduct "a very thorough investigation" into the operations of the Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as soon as the standoff in Waco, Tex., is resolved.
Mr. Bentsen is clearly relishing his new job, with a big office overlooking the White House and the opportunity to display executive skills that he said were honed during nearly 30 years in Congress and about 20 years in business.
He said he had not anticipated that the preliminary budget measures would be approved so quickly by Congress with such strong unity among Democrats.
So far, he said, "things are going damn well." But he said he understood that the honeymoon would end sooner or later and that dealing with Congress would become tougher when lawmakers had to vote on which taxes to raise and which ones to cut and on how much money to spend on each Government program.
 
 
Mexico's President a Factor
 On the matter of trade, Mr. Bentsen was asked why, given the political perils involved, the Administration did not want to delay even longer Congressional consideration of the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. Mr. Bentsen, a former Senator from Texas whose home is in the Rio Grande Valley, initially answered with one word: "Salinas."
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's term as President of Mexico ends next year, and he cannot run for re-election. "We don't know who his successor is going to be," Mr. Bentsen continued. "I grew up on that border. The United States was always the colossus of the North, and Mexican politicians got elected attacking the United States. Now the country wants to work with us, and that is an incredible change. We can't lose the opportunity."
While the Administration is asking Congress to delay acting on the agreement with Mexico, the President wants quicker action on renewed authorization for him to negotiate trade agreements under a procedure called "fast track." The current authorization, allowing trade pacts to be submitted to Congress for rapid consideration with no amendments allowed, is expiring.
Mr. Bentsen said the new authorization was important as a signal to America's main trading partners that the United States was serious about completing a worldwide trade agreement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

HEADLINE: TOWARD THE SUMMIT;
A Summit With an Ocean View, 3-Star Dining and Even a Woods to Walk In

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 1

 BODY:
Dr. David W. Strangway and his wife, Alice, had to give up their rambling, 7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style home on a magnificent promontory above the sea in western Vancouver this week. But they have no hard feelings.
"We're actually thrilled," said Dr. Strangway, an Ontario-born geophysicist who studied moon rocks for NASA and is now the president of the University of British Columbia. "What a privilege to be able to say it happened here." 
 Their tawny, stucco house with red-tile roof, surrounded by gardens of heather, cedar and ginko trees and rhododendrons, has been taken over by the advance parties from the White House and the Kremlin for President Clinton's first meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
The summit meeting is to be held on Saturday and Sunday in Canada's third largest city, a shimmering enclave tucked between mountain wilderness and the Pacific Ocean, and home for 1.6 million people.
For reasons of security as well as scenic majesty, the first lunch and talks will be in the city's more secluded western precincts, at the official residence for presidents of the 78-year-old provincial university. Later the two leaders will see some of the city center.
 
Yeltsin Gets the Penthouse
 Both men are sleeping downtown -- Mr. Yeltsin in the penthouse of the sparkling white Pan Pacific Hotel Vancouver with a panoramic view of the harbor and Mr. Clinton at the somewhat less prestigiously situated Hyatt Regency, about half a mile inland. A Canadian organizer said "the President insisted on staying at an American-owned, unionized hotel, and the Hyatt fit the bill."
Mr. Yeltsin not only will look out over the water but ride the waves as well. On Saturday he is to be the guest of skipper Jack Charles on the $3 million motor cruiser Hotei, named after the Buddhist god of happiness and laughter, for a tour of the harbor, Canada's largest port with its bustle of seaplanes, heli-jets, tugboats and freighters.
Practically all the grain Canada exports to Russia begins its sea journey from Vancouver. Mr. Charles, who is the chief executive officer of Arrow Transportation Systems, a local land and marine hauling company, said he was told by port authorities that Mr. Yeltsin "wants to see the harbor, and if there are any Russian freighters with Canadian wheat he'd like to stop and have a look."
The university residence is called the Norman MacKenzie House, but it was it was known as Dave's Bed and Breakfast this week on the Larry and Willy Show, a comedy interlude on one of the most popular rock stations, C-Fox FM 99.3.
 
Is Socks Coming?
 Someone impersonating President Clinton, but sounding more like Elvis Presley, called in to ask Dr. Strangway, who appeared as a guest on the show, whether there was a deep frier in the house and where the nearest McDonald's was. Dr. Strangway, playing along in the spoofing, asked whether the caller was bringing along Socks, the Clintons' cat. A painting of a golden saxophone, called Sax Inc. by Canadian artist Eric Metcalfe, hangs prominently in the house.
Mr. Clinton and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, who as the host of the meeting will welcome the visitors, are expected to announce new forms of economic aid to Russia this weekend and raise the possibility of rescheduling $80 billion of Moscow's debt. Canadian newspapers are saying an "alms race" has replaced the arms race.
 
Mounties Saddle Up
 For Vancouver, this is the biggest international event since Expo 86 drew 21 million visitors from more than 50 countries seven years ago. In terms of global political interest, nothing in the city's past can compare to the attention this meeting is likely to draw.
The huge harborfront Vancouver Trade and Convention Center, beneath the gleaming white sails that are the civic emblem, is preparing for a flood of 2,500 to 3,000 media personnel. The center has just been coverted into the press center and will be the site of a joint news conference Sunday afternoon.
Tactical squads of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are gearing up as well. "This will be the highest level of security the R.C.M.P. can provide," said Sgt. Peter Montague, a liaison officer for the Mounties. "We will be prepared for any possibility."
Between the Mounties and local Vancouver police, a force of 1,500 has been mobilized, together with several helicopters. In addition, special security personnel have come from Washington and Moscow, estimated at about 100 from each capital.
Police motorcycle escorts have been interrupting traffic almost daily as they go through dry runs for transportating the leaders to points within the city.
The summit meeting will cost Canadian taxpayers about $1 million, said Len Edwards, Canada's Ambassador to South Korea, who is acting as the summit coordinator. Canada pays for the accommodations of the two leaders and their delegations, for the special security and for the press sites.
According to the official summit program, most of the activity Saturday is at Dr. Strangway's house. The only scheduled break is an after-lunch digestive stroll, weather permitting, to the Museum of Anthropology, a place with towering totem poles and huge feast dishes and other objects from the aboriginal cultures of the northwest.
The museum is next door to the house and an easy walk in the woods.
Dinner on Saturday is to be at one of the stellar Vancouver restaurants, Seasons in the Park (three stars in Vancouver Magazine), which is in Queen Elizabeth Park, the highest point of land (500 feet) in the metropolitan area and affording spectacular views.
Pierre Delacote from Alsace, the executive chef of the restaurant, said he had been asked to prepare a "very Canadian" meal and would oblige with local Dungeness crabs, British Columbia salmon, a Romaine lettuce salad and blueberries with maple ice cream.
 
Jogging With the Owls
 Although it's not on the official schedule, a Canadian summit organizer said President Clinton may jog early Sunday morning in Stanley Park, a recreational area along Vancouver harbor and home of many sea birds and owls.
Several months ago Vancouver papers carried reports of joggers having to fend off assaults from young, hungry owls mistaking bobbing heads and pony tails for squirrels and other prey.
Dick Cannings, a naturalist who is curator of the university's Cowan Vertebrate Museum, said the incidents are a regular occurrence in late summer when the young birds are first out on their own away from their parents.
But he added they do not pose a serious security concern for the Secret Service because these birds live in the deep woods of Stanley Park, not along the sea wall where the President will likely jog.
Arrangements have also been made for Mr. Clinton to attend the 9:15 A.M. service Sunday at the First Baptist Church, several blocks from his hotel.
The Rev. Bruce Milne, the senior pastor, said he will stick with the regular Palm Sunday service because the President "is coming as a worshiper."

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
To Hear Stars, Pay $50 or Take Their Bus

BYLINE: By Glenn Collins

DATELINE: CLIFTON, N.J.

 BODY:
THE gentleman on the bus could be seriously disturbed. Warped, maybe. To be sure, he looks familiar enough, with his curly gray locks and moustache. It's a big, friendly face: avuncular, lovable. But he is muttering to himself. Gesticulating wildly, alone by the window. He's sitting toward the back of a half-full No. 66 bus that is booming through Clifton on its way toward Route 3, the concrete alley to the Lincoln Tunnel and the Big Apple.
Wait now. Isn't that a script in the man's hand? That face -- isn't it Louis Zorich, the actor, who starred as Jules Berger, the grandpa in "Brooklyn Bridge," the television series? 
 "People see me rehearsing," Mr. Zorich responded to a query, "and they think they're looking at a maniac." His voice was calm, buttery. "And they are. They're looking at an actor."
On any other form of public transportation just about anywhere, a muttering, gesticulating citizen in a secluded rear seat would be categorized as yet another inhabitant of the great American transit outpatient system. An object of pity. Or fear.
Not on the 66. On this DeCamp Bus Company line that travels 14 miles from West Orange to Manhattan, a mutterer is more likely to be asked for an autograph. Statistical science is sure to calculate soon that the 66 route has more actor patronage per paid passenger mile than any other suburban bus line in America. (The M104 in Manhattan, the Broadway line, surely must top the urban list.)
"Some riders pass me pieces of paper to sign, and there goes my concentration," said Olympia Dukakis, who was reached at home. Ms. Dukakis, who won an Oscar for playing the mother in "Moonstruck," has been Mr. Zorich's wife for 31 years and has lived in Montclair for 21 of them.
"I got so practiced through the years that I'd use the bus to have breakfast, put on my makeup and study my script," she said. "After 'Moonstruck,' people couldn't believe I still took the 66."
Anthony Heald, another player who uses the 66 as a rehearsal room, feels that actors are "the in-bus entertainment on the DeCamp lines." Mr. Heald (who starred in the play "Lips Together, Teeth Apart" and appeared in the film "The Silence of the Lambs" as the digestible doctor) was encountered recently in Montclair between jaunts to California for work.
"What I hate about L.A.," he said, "is that when you have to drive to an audition, you don't have as much chance to prepare. You can't focus, as you can on the 66."
Montclair has the 66 bus route's most sizable acting community, although a cry of players live in Clifton, West Orange and Glen Ridge. Among the others who have ridden the 66 to auditions in Manhattan are Tonya Pinkins (who won a Tony Award for her role in "Jelly's Last Jam"), Frederick Rolf, Frankie Faison, Elaine Bromka, W. B. Brydon, W. T. Martin, Ed Blake and Gordon Jacoby, the dialect coach.
There are professional hazards, to be sure. "You might be all ready to rehearse, and then you'll meet another actor," said Mr. Zorich. "Then you have too much fun gossiping, and you forget your lines."
And passengers are not always entertained. "Once I was rehearsing a script on the 66 with a good deal of profanity in it, and I kind of forgot where I was," said Tom Brennan, who recently appeared in "Salome" with Al Pacino at the Circle in the Square. "In the middle of a string of curses I suddenly realized that everyone on the bus was looking at me. Appalled."
Once in a while, "groups of actors in the back of the bus will rehearse pretty loudly, but no one ever complains about them," said Sal Siano, a DeCamp bus driver for 23 years who ought to have an Actors Equity card himself. He has been known to announce "Welcome to beautiful Cancun!" upon arrival at the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
Actors being actors, they can't help but think about the show-business capability of the 66. Mr. Heald wondered wistfully whether the bus company might be interested in compensating out-of-work actors for entertaining passengers. "And it would be nice if DeCamp would install a soundproof booth in the back of the 66," he said, deadpan, "so actors could really emote, and see how it sounds."
Louis Nigro, DeCamp's general manager, commented carefully, "It would be very interesting to try to justify that particular expense to my boss." Mr. Nigro has fielded quite enough furious calls lately from cost-conscious bus patrons who are incensed that DeCamp has raised its rates (yet again!) in a time of low inflation and stable gas prices.
So, before DeCamp gets the idea to impose an entertainment surcharge on the actors' bus line, just one more 66 story: The time the bus broke down on Route 3. Five actors -- all of whom had been so absorbed by their scripts they hadn't been aware of one another's presence -- found themselves stranded out on the shoulder of the highway, waiting to board a rescue 66.
Mr. Zorich, who was there, remembers a long silence. Then someone said: "Well, DeCamp has just managed to shut down Broadway."

Sliding U.S. Dollar Reaches Another Low Against Yen

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar sank to another record low against the yen yesterday as its two-month slide intensified amid signs that industrialized nations might seek a stronger yen to push down Japan's huge trade surplus.
News of a faltering American economic recovery contributed to the pessimism about the dollar. 
 Gold prices, meanwhile, continued to rise. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery gained $1.10 an ounce, to $338.70. The Republic National Bank quoted a late price for spot gold of $338.20 an ounce, up $1.45.
The dollar hit a post-World War II low of 113.70 yen in early New York dealings yesterday, but later firmed to close at 114.04 yen, down from 114.79 yen on Wednesday.
The dollar also fell to 1.5905 German marks in New York, down from 1.6085 marks on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the British pound rallied in New York to $1.5310, from $1.5123 on Wednesday.
Traders said the failure of central banks to support the dollar was a signal that the currency's fall had the approval of the Group of Seven industrialized nations.
Moreover, Japan is facing growing pressure from President Clinton to strengthen the yen to make American goods less costly abroad, thereby increasing American exports.
"Officials have basically given the go-ahead for a yen rally," said Siobahn Lakey, foreign exchange trader at Julius Baer.
In Tokyo, the Economic Planning Agency's minister, Hajime Funada, said the yen's recent rise against the dollar had been too rapid. But dealers said they did not think the Bank of Japan would actually move to halt the trend.
The dollar's first blow yesterday came when the latest weekly jobless claims rose unexpectedly. Further disappointment came when the National Association of Purchasing Management's March index fell to a five-month low, suggesting a slowing of economic growth. Moreover, the increase in February construction spending was below expectations.
"Some of the cozy assumptions about the recovery in the States will now be challenged," said David Coleman, Treasury adviser at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

HEADLINE: German Labor Police Round Up Illegal Workers

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRANKFURT

 BODY:
Ante Kundid, a 43-year-old refugee from Croatia, thought he had landed a job as an electrician on a housing construction site in Fechenheim on a Monday morning.
But the German labor office and the police took it away from him less than 24 hours later in a raid of a kind that is fast becoming a daily occurrence here. 
 "We're being encouraged to make these raids, but they usually don't turn up much," said Bernhard Gorg, an investigator of the Frankfurt labor office in charge of combating illegal employment.
Pressure to crack down on illegal employment is intense in a country racked by rising joblessness, frustrated by a steady influx of foreign asylum-seekers and refugees who are not supposed to take jobs at all, and angry at native Germans who cheat the welfare system out of an estimated $6.2 billion every year, politicians say.
 
Voters Are Angry
 Many German voters are angry at their politicians for being seemingly unable to do anything about these problems, and in local elections here in March the right-wing Republicans, who promised more effective action, won 9.3 percent of the vote.
So federal, state and local government authorities, following the election returns, are cracking down on welfare abuses. The crackdown, they say, will save the taxpayers billions of dollars that would otherwise come from income tax increases or budget cuts, for the reconstruction of the shattered economy of the formerly Communist eastern Germany.
But wage levels and fringe-benefit costs in Germany are among the highest in the world, driven up by decades of welfare-state expansion comfortably protected by the United States and other NATO allies during the cold war.
For the first two decades after World War II, Germany had a labor shortage, and invited hundreds of thousands of Italians, Yugoslavs and Turks to come and work, at German wage levels, as "guest workers." Recruitment stopped with the economic slowdown of 1973, but nearly three million people from these areas still live in Germany.
New pressures arose after the collapse of Communism and the rise of nationalism in eastern Europe. Nearly 100,000 workers from East Europe are legally employed in Germany, the labor authorities say, working for Romanian, Polish and Bulgarian subcontractors in the construction industry.
These subcontractors often underbid German companies, and suspicion is widespread that they can do it because they pay their workers less than minimum German wages, though they are not legally allowed to.
But there are also tens of thousands more workers from East Europe who come here ostensibly as tourists -- but who end up painting ceilings, repairing washing machines, and doing carpentry, charging far less money than German workers because they do not pay health or social security benefits.
 
Workers' Markets
 There are a workers' markets in many German cities. Here in Frankfurt, it is under a railroad bridge just past the wholesale food market, on the eastern fringes of the city near the Main River.
Mr. Gorg and his colleagues passed it on their way to the housing construction site -- a group of about 30 young men in jeans, waiting for people in cars to stop and hire them at four to six marks ($2.50 to $3.75) an hour, cash, to do gardening or repair jobs that would cost twice as much if anyone could find Germans willing to do the work.
According to the city authorities in Frankfurt, many of them are Poles. But Mr. Gorg was not concerned with them. His assignment was to check out the construction site.
"We know there are Romanian subcontractors on this job, and we just want to check the working papers of their employees to make sure they have employment permits," he said.
 
Raid by Job Police
 At the construction site on Konstanzer Strasse, a mile or two down the road from the Poles, Mr. Gorg and his colleagues donned plastic helmets and walked toward a group of men in blue overalls cleaning up debris.
"Frankfurt labor office," he addressed one of the men. "May we see your papers?"
None spoke German.
Mr. Gorg went in search of the office of the German contractor in charge of the project. Shortly after, Mr. Kundid came in. The only identification he could produce was a Croatian passport with no visa or work permit in it.
"Where is your work permit?" Mr. Gorg asked. "Where do you live?" Mr. Kundid did not speak German, either.
His supervisor, another Croat, did. Which subcontractor did Mr. Kundid work for? No clear answer emerged. Where does he live? The supervisor gave his own address, and said Mr. Kundid lived with him.
 
Police Make Arrest
 Two German policemen in green uniforms arrived and searched Mr. Kundid. They found a little over 100 marks (about $60) and took him away.
"He won't be under arrest for long," Mr. Gorg said. "They'll ask him for a cash bail deposit and tell him to go home and not to try to work again. If we can find out which company hired him, they'll be fined."
The fine would amount to about 1,000 marks, about $600.
Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the 1960's radical who is now the city official in charge of multicultural affairs, laughed at the labor office's raids.
"These are pathetic attempts to appear to be coming to grips with the situation," he said. "The politicians are afraid of seeming to be incapable with dealing with the situation, so they order actions like this."

HEADLINE: A Broad-Stroke Budget

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 1

 BODY:
Even for a place where the symbols of the trade are the press release and the closed door, the scene in the Capitol early this morning set new standards for both secrecy and spin.
It became clear in the dreary light after sunrise -- not that there was much question even in the darkness of midnight -- that the $32 billion budget deal that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proclaimed as a great "cause for celebration" at 12:01 A.M. was a deal in broad outline, with many details outstanding. 
 But none of that mattered at midnight. For political reasons, it had become critically important, particularly to the Governor, to declare that at least a "handshake deal" was in place by April 1.
 
The Measure of Leadership
 If Mr. Cuomo seeks re-election to a fourth four-year term next year, the measure of his leadership will be his stewardship of the state during some of its most difficult fiscal years.
To make an effective case, Mr. Cuomo must be able to showcase budgets that are on time and in balance. An increase in the state's credit rating during the 1994 election year would not hurt.
While state leaders agreed Wednesday on basic principles on issues like aid to schools, new debt practices and Medicaid, weary budget negotiators conceded today that there still was a great deal of work ahead.
They spent the day shuttling between meetings, just as they have every day for the last two weeks. Budget bills were still being written. Details were still hard to come by.
 
Still Selling the Package
 Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin and the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, still were trying to sell the budget package to disgruntled members. Even if things go smoothly, legislative aides said, they probably could not pass the budget before Sunday, four days after the April 1 start of the fiscal year.
The Legislature passed last year's budget only two days late. The state finished the year with a surplus tentatively estimated at $483 million, although some state officials believe the number will grow even higher after a final accounting. Now Mr. Cuomo needs a second year of such success to establish a record of consistency.
"I think that more than any year the Governor wanted timeliness this year," said one Cuomo aide. "The economic situation is strengthening and if you are on time you can go to the financial community and say we've really turned the corner. If you can get a bond upgrading next year, you can make a strong argument to the people that New York has come through a very tough time."
 
No Details
 So it was early this morning that Mr. Cuomo ushered reporters into the Red Room, his seldom-used ceremonial office, and announced that an agreement had been reached. He clasped hands with Mr. Weprin and Mr. Marino, declined to discuss details and went home.
Because Mr. Cuomo did not make his announcement until just after midnight -- reporters and lobbyists had already completed a Times Square-style countdown in the hallway outside his office -- the Governor's press secretary, Anne W. Crowley, maintained that an earlier handshake had taken place behind closed doors. The handshake in the Red Room apparently was just a re-enactment for the cameras.
By refusing to discuss details at the most dramatic moment in a long budget process, Mr. Cuomo may have passed up his best opportunity to promote the substance of the deal, which seems to follow the fiscal principles he established in January.
 
Cuomo's Victories
 Mr. Cuomo won his fight against increases in broad-based taxes, despite an effort by Mr. Weprin to raise income tax rates for the wealthy. He pushed through a heavy increase in cigarette taxes, despite opposition from Mr. Marino.
He apparently succeeded in changing the state's complicated school aid formula so that school districts with large proportions of poor children, like New York City, will receive more assistance. Negotiators were still ironing out details of the plan today, making it difficult to know how much real reform the Governor won.
Mr. Cuomo also persuaded the Legislature to help fill a $3 billion budget gap by diverting $516 million from a fund that was supposed to be dedicated to transportation.
He helped broker a compromise on a huge transportation financing plan, although it was larger than the plan he wanted. He successfully pushed through a package of measures aimed at giving the public greater control of state borrowing, although only after one final splurge of backdoor borrowing for the transportation plan.
 
The Issue of Soundness
 The issue of whether the budget is soundly balanced also remains. Many officials, both in the Legislature and the Cuomo administration, concede that at first glance the budget seems to spend more money than the state is projected to receive this year.
But there is a sense among some in Albany that the state's economy is improving faster than expected and that unanticipated revenues, both from this year and last year, will allow the state to avoid a deficit.
If Mr. Cuomo runs next year, the budget's balance will be as important as its timeliness. No candidate wants to face a budget deficit that might require tax increases or heavy spending cuts in a campaign year.

HEADLINE: Decline in Smoking Levels Off And Officials Urge a Tax Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, April 1

 BODY:
After 25 years of decline in the number of smokers compared with nonsmokers, the overall rate was virtually unchanged from 1990 to 1991 as more and more American blacks and women started smoking, Federal health officials reported today.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said discount cigarettes and tobacco advertising, which is about $3.9 billion a year, were to blame for the reversal and called for cigarette tax increases. 
 "We need to look at bold steps because we're not making the progress we need to make," said Dr. Michael Eriksen, director of the Centers for Disease Control's Office of Smoking and Health.
The figures for 1991, the latest statistics available, probably mean that the United States will not meet a goal of having only 15 percent of Americans smoking by the year 2000.
"It's taken us off our year 2000 pace," Dr. Eriksen said. "At the current rate, we'll only reach 19 percent."
Discount cigarettes, which can cost as much as $1 less a pack than national brands, and promotions like free samples and $5-off coupons for cartons make smoking more affordable, he said.
 
People Who Might Have Quit
 "That is contributing to people continuing to smoke who in the past otherwise would have quit," he said.
The agency based its figures on an annual national survey of about 43,000 people. It found that 25.7 percent of Americans, 46.3 million people, smoked in 1991. In 1990, 25.5 percent smoked, the lowest level since the Government began counting in 1955.
But more blacks smoked in 1991 (29.2 percent against 26.2 percent in 1990), and more women smoked (23.5 percent versus 22.8 percent), the agency said.
The agency said it could not explain the increase among women except to point to advertising that features slender models to aim at women's fears of weight gain if they stop smoking.
"This is particularly disturbing because more women today die of lung cancer than die of breast cancer," Dr. Eriksen said, "and lung cancer is totally preventable."
The agency said the increase among blacks could be related to the failed attempt in 1990 to market a cigarette, called Uptown, with advertising aimed specifically at blacks. A national outcry by black organizations that condemned the Uptown cigarette campaign was credited with helping to reduce the level of smoking among blacks to 26.2 percent that year.
The following year, some blacks who tried to quit during the Uptown uproar may have begun smoking again, Dr. Eriksen said. The agency is pursuing a separate study on the effects of the Uptown campaign.
The agency also found that smoking was most prevalent among people ages 25 to 44, Indians and Alaskan natives, those who live below the poverty line and people with less than a high school education.

HEADLINE: Wistfully, Fernandez Urges Budget

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
In his final budget request to Mayor David N. Dinkins, Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez yesterday asked for an extra $584 million for the school system, and said he wished he could be around next year to help spend it.
"Things are starting to turn around in terms of the budget," Mr. Fernandez said at a briefing for reporters that, in contrast to past years, was marked by optimism about the budget. "Quite honestly, I wish I were here next year." 
 Mr. Fernandez was denied a new contract by a divided Board of Education in February after he endured three years of fiscal austerity in which he was forced to devote much of his energy to cutting spending, rather than rebuilding the school system as he was hired to do.
 
Hope for Help
 But now, as he prepares to depart at the end of June while talking wistfully about his "legacy," he said the school system was poised to receive an infusion of extra money from both the city and the state, and perhaps from Washington as well.
School officials say they now hope to receive a substantial share of an extra $250 million in state education aid under negotiation in Albany, as well as extra money from the city, especially since Mayor Dinkins has promised to make education a top priority.
In the past, negotiations involving the Mayor, the City Council and the Board of Education over the school system's budget have been marked by bitter public spats, and it is not clear how Mr. Fernandez's lame-duck status will affect this year's talks.
 
M.A.C. and Its Money
 Last year, for instance, it was mid-summer, a month or so after the city budget was adopted, that Mr. Fernandez and city budget officials reached agreement on $250 million in spending that averted threatened cuts in the number of teachers.
One source of money that Mr. Fernandez is seeking to tap this year -- surpluses from the Municipal Assistance Corporation -- may simply be unavailable once he leaves office on June 30. Mr. Fernandez is seeking $70 million from the corporation.
Felix G. Rohatyn, the M.A.C. chairman, said the surpluses, which are to come from bond refinancings, would not be available to the schools unless the Mayor and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo agree on a plan to reorganize the Board of Education.
"I am convinced that it is impossible to run the system with this type of board," Mr. Rohatyn said.
 
Rise in Enrollment
 While spending on schools is politically popular, basic education spending often is shorted because it is so expensive. It is all but impossible to reduce average class size, for instance, without talking about hundred of millions of dollars of increases in the city's $7.6 billion Board of Education budget.
The spending increase proposed by Mr. Fernandez includes $345 million listed as mandatory increases to continue required programs amid a surge in enrollment and $169 million for new programs for school safety and repairs.
At least $63 million of the mandated increase was attributed to a projected enrollment increase of 20,000 that would push next fall's total above one million for the first time in 15 years.
Many of the new programs proposed by Mr. Fernandez are ones with which he has become closely identified, from a plan to spend $17.6 million to pay the start-up costs for 40 small high schools, to a system of limited school governance he introduced, and new math and science curriculum initiatives.
In recent speeches and statements, Mr. Fernandez has appeared to lay out his legacy as he sees it in the New York City school system. In a cover letter included with his budget requests, Mr. Fernandez discussed his accomplishments, and said "these reforms must continue."
 
Disputes Over Figures
 Asked about the Chancellor's proposals, Philip R. Michael, the City Budget Director, said, "I'm sure they are worthy, and we will give them as much money as we possibly can," but he made no commitments.
And Mr. Michael disputed Mr. Fernandez's contention that he was forced to cut $750 million in the school budget since 1990. Mr. Michael said the cuts were made against hypothetical spending targets, that in each of the last four years school spending had actually increased and that in all but one year spending had increased more than the enrollment had.
City budget officials have predicted that in the current school year spending will rise by 3.6 percent to $7.6 billion, while enrollment increases by 2.1 percent. But figures provided by the State Education Department showed that spending had declined slightly, without making any allowance for inflation.

HEADLINE: Long-Term Bond Rates Jump to 6.96%

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates jumped to 6.96 percent yesterday and could move to 7 percent or higher if today's report on March employment is surprisingly strong and two key inflation reports due next week are disappointing.
In light trading yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond fell 16/32 point as the yield rose from 6.93 percent Wednesday. The long bond's yield of 6.96 percent was the highest since the post-election bond market rally pushed it to a 16-year low of 6.72 percent March 8. 
 There were several possible reasons for the decline yesterday, which also spread to 10-year notes, for which the price fell 9/32 and the yield jumped to 6.05 percent from 6.02 percent. Shorter-term Treasury notes were down only a little.
 
 
Weaker Dollar
 Among the explanations were the weaker American dollar, which prompted foreign selling, and reports of sales by a big holder of long-term bonds.
In addition, there were worries about inflation, despite the fact that yesterday's report on initial jobless claims and the survey of the National Association of Purchasing Managers indicated slower economic growth. [Page D3.]
But traders were primarily concerned about what the March employment report will say about the economy and what they can expect from the Government's report on producer prices next Thursday and the report on consumer prices due on Good Friday, when the bond market will be closed.
"We are going into a very big number," one trader at a primary dealer in bonds said. "And a lot of things are going on that are confusing people."
The key statistic for traders today will be the change in nonfarm payroll workers. In February, there was a surprisingly large increase of 365,000 that knocked out some of the support for the bond rally.
Nonfarm payrolls are exceedingly difficult to forecast, although economists and analysts all around Wall Street dutifully try do so. But there seems to be even more doubt about the March figure than usual because of the wide range of forecasts. They run from a decline of 73,000 to an increase of 235,000.
What many analysts would like is a number that seems to resolve the debate over the pace of economic growth and, in turn, makes it easier to decide whether the unexpectedly high increases in inflation in January and February are something to worry about. If they are, analysts seem to conclude that the decline in interest rates will be over for now.
There are two outcomes that could end the debate:
*Nonfarm payrolls could decline. That could lead to a conclusion that the economy is growing moderately but slowly, perhaps at an annual pace of 3 percent or less, far slower than the 5 percent rate at the end of last year. As such, the price increases from the beginning of the year might not be sustained, possibly leading to inflation no higher than last year's 3 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index.
*Nonfarm payrolls could jump by more than 200,000. That might mean that the economy is moving ahead at a relatively brisk annual pace of more than 3 percent. As such, the inflation rate would probably rise this year. In this case, bond prices would fall and the yield would move above 7 percent, traders said.
But there could be no clear answer. Nonfarm payrolls could rise by 80,000 to 120,000. That would mean the pace of job growth would be almost double the rate of the last three months of 1992. But it would not mean that the economy is really picking up a lot of speed. In fact, the economy would probably be growing at a slower pace than at the end of last year.
 
 
'Doesn't Settle Anything'
 That would not be enough of a slowdown to make inflation less worrisome, analysts said yesterday. "It doesn't settle anything and it raises the ante for next week's inflation data," said Alan Levenson, money market economist at UBS Securities. He said economists and investors would still not know if "the pace of job growth and economic growth is enough to start us heading toward 4 percent inflation in 1994."
So the focus will shift to the end of next week. The Producer Price Index rose four-tenths of 1 percent in February, and another such jump would be disturbing. The Consumer Price Index, without food and energy, jumped five-tenths of 1 percent in the first two months of the year, and a similar rise would make it very hard for the inflation rate to come in at 3 percent this year.
Also in the bond market yesterday, the scheduled auction of $14.25 billion of one-year bills was canceled because Congress had not approved an increase in the Government's debt ceiling. Congressional leaders have said they intend to approve a higher debt limit before going on a two-week recess today or this weekend. When that happens, the Treasury will reschedule the auction. The Treasury has said it will run out of cash to pay bills and reach the debt ceiling borrowing limit Wednesday.

The survey, conducted by the National Association of Purchasing Managers and released yesterday, is one of many pieces of evidence that economic growth in the first quarter was significantly less robust than last fall's 5 percent pace. 
 "Growth is still healthy," said Robert Bretz, who supervises the survey and is a purchasing executive at Pitney Bowes in Stamford, Conn. "But we're coming off an unsustainable high in January."
 
 
Other Signs
 There were other signs that the economy's pace was slowing. Construction, which has not shown many signs of life recently, slipped a little further in February, the Commerce Department said yesterday. After adjusting for inflation, total outlays edged down three-tenths of 1 percent after declining seven-tenths of 1 percent in January.
What is more, a spurt in jobless claims in late March to their highest level since November suggests that job growth may have been fairly lackluster. The increase, however, appears to have been partly a result of storms that kept people from filing in earlier weeks. Still, new jobless claims surged to 380,000 in the week ending March 27, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The Government's monthly report on job growth and the unemployment rate is due out today.
"Job growth in the first quarter was fast enough to knock the unemployment rate down," said Roger Brinner, chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, "but we can't expect gains like we saw in February." He was referring to the Labor Department's initial estimate that 365,000 new jobs were created in February.
Forecasters and investors closely track the purchasing managers' index -- compiled from a dozen or so survey questions -- because it offers the first real glimpse of economic activity in any given month. In March, the index fell to 53.4, from 55.8 in February and 58.0 in January. Any reading over 50 signals that the nation's factories are expanding. A number over 45 suggests that the economy as a whole is growing.
 
 
January's Five-Year High
 "In January, our production index was at a five-year high and the new orders index was at its highest level in nine years," Mr. Bretz said. "Relative to that, anything looks a bit puny."
The rate of growth for production fell sharply last month, the executives reported, and accounted for most of the drop in the index. For production, the problem was not the fierce winter storms that kept consumers out of stores. "The growth rate of of new orders had dropped significantly in February," Mr. Bretz said. "You could almost have predicted that March production would have been lower."
The growth of orders slowed some more in March. Nonetheless, order backlogs got fatter -- especially in plastics and rubber, oil and food -- for the third month in a row. Bigger backlogs suggest more production down the road. Last year, by contrast, order backlogs were flat or falling for much of the year.
The most worrisome note in the report was a sharp drop in export orders to the lowest level since the purchasing managers' survey included a question on such orders. One month does not make a trend, but this could be the first indication that recessions in Europe and Japan are finally taking their toll on exports, a source of strength for the economy over the last couple of years and about a quarter of the market for American factory goods.
 
 
Weakened Employment
 Inventories shrank a bit, though far less than in February, and manufacturing employment also weakened some, no surprise given the drop in production.
But there are indications, namely a lengthening workweek and record overtime, that factories may do some hiring in coming months.
"With backlogs building, hours building and overtime building, at some point manufacturers are going to say 'we've had enough of these overtime costs, let's hire more people,' " Mr. Bretz said. "We're getting close to that point."
At least one large manufacturer has already passed that point. The Whirlpool Corporation in Benton Harbor, Mich., said yesterday that it had added 900 temporary jobs and 800 permanent jobs since January, mostly to keep up with strong demand for its refrigerators.

HEADLINE: One Last Round as 'Cheers' Finale Is Taped

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, April 1

 BODY:
For all intents and purposes, that agreeable television mix of wry wit and barroom banter, set in a Boston tavern known as Cheers, ended on Wednesday night on a sound stage here.
With considerable emotion and fond remembrances of 11 years, the cast of NBC's "Cheers" shot the 274th and final episode of what has become a Thursday-night ritual in homes across America. It was the ultimate last call for the longest-running comedy on television. 
 Just how the writers plan to contrive a satisfying conclusion is a tightly held secret that was not revealed even to the specially selected audience that jammed Paramount Studios' Stage 25 on Wednesday night. A final scene is to be taped in secret later, and the 90-minute episode is to be shown on May 20.
About the only thing the producers have disclosed is that the bar will not be closed. They also say that President Clinton has expressed interest in making a cameo appearance on the final episode if it fits into his schedule, but that any such appearance would not be a deus ex machina to solve the problem of winding things up.
 
Special Guest Stars
 It can be said for certain that the final episode concerns a return appearance of a former "Cheers" star, Shelley Long, who played Diane Chambers, the brainy former barmaid and sometime lover to the bar owner, Sam Malone, played by Ted Danson. The character left the show in 1987, ostensibly to write a novel, when Ms. Long left to pursue a movie career. She was replaced by Kirstie Alley as Rebecca Howe, who managed the bar for a time.
When the show is broadcast, close observers, especially if they are Hollywood insiders, might notice a few special touches. The stiff, suited extras around the square wooden bar include Grant Tinker, the former chairman of NBC; John Pike, the president of Paramount Network Television; Warren Littlefield, the president of NBC Entertainment, and Kerry McCluggage, the chairman of the Paramount Television Group.
For the regular cast and crew, the reality that it was all nearly over had not yet sunk in. "I'm basically in denial," Kelsey Grammer, who has spent nine years as Frasier Crane, the psychotherapist, said during a break. "I'm going to go away for a while to put this in perspective." He plans to move to a "Cheers" television spinoff, where Dr. Crane will dispense therapy on the radio in Seattle.
"This is never going to happen again," said Rick Reden, a camera coordinator and director, who is also a nine-year "Cheers" veteran. "The show was like a bar. We would come in during our days off."
 
More Work Now, Emotion Later
 In fact, this finale was not the cast and crew's finale. The penultimate episode remains to be shot, out of order, as is not uncommon on television. So the finale was not, for the cast and crew, a real finale, but nonetheless a momentous event for a show that had its premiere in September 1982 when Ronald Reagan was President, Ed Koch the mayor of New York and the Dow Jones Industrial average stood at a mere 900.
James Burrows, who helped create the show and has directed most of its episodes, was behind the cameras for the final show. The script was written by the show's two other creators, Glen Charles and Les Charles; it was the first episode two brothers had written since 1987. All three are executive producers of the show.
"This is my family, our family; it's like a loss in the family," Mr. Burrows said in an interview today, adding that there would be more time for emotion after the penultimate episode is shot next week. He added that last night's shoot was unique in television annals. "No live sitcom has ever shot an hour and a half in one night," he said.
And the taping went smoothly, considering that it was triple the length of a normal episode and that it was difficult to keep the audience in its seats in a shoot that began at 7:20 P.M. and did not wrap until 2:15 this morning. Reporters present were sworn to secrecy, but suffice it to say that the lives of the major characters and their problems are resolved more or less happily before it ends.
 
The Gang's All There
 All the regulars were there: Cliff the mailman (John Ratzenberger); Norm Peterson, the unemployed accountant and barfly (George Wendt); Carla Tortelli, the wise-cracking barmaid (Rhea Perlman); Woody Boyd, the junior bartender (Woody Harrelson), and Rebecca Howe, as well as Sam and Frasier. Mr. Ratzenberger flubbed a line a couple of times, requiring retakes. "I'm just trying to stretch out the season," he blurted out.
NBC has pretty much turned the night of May 20 over to "Cheers." At 9 P.M. it plans to show a 30-minute documentary titled "Last Call: A Celebration of 'Cheers,' " followed by the 90-minute finale, then capped at 11:30 with much of the cast on the "Tonight" show with Jay Leno, who will take his show to the Bull and Finch, the bar in Boston on which "Cheers" was modeled.
But what to do about the set at Paramount, with its red vinyl bar stools, wooden bar with brass rails, old jukebox and posters of Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb? Might the Smithsonian Institution express interest in it as an artifact for some cultural anthropologist of the 21st century, not yet born, to fathom meaning from America of the 1980's?
It already has.

HEADLINE: Stop New York's Shady Borrowing

 BODY:
The proud State of New York has a rotten credit rating, the worst among the 50 states, according to one rating agency. This dubious distinction is rooted in a scheme devised to finance Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's ambitious building projects in the 1960's.
Now Gov. Mario Cuomo and lawmakers, properly embarrassed by the state's sunken standing after 11 years of his stewardship, have endorsed a plan to restore some respect and save some money. It's overdue, by years and billions of dollars. 
 New York's Constitution requires that voters approve state bond issues in a general election, and no more than one issue per year. But even when an issue gets on the ballot, many fail, as 5 of the past 10 have done.
The restrictions and repeated rejections led Governor Rockefeller to the idea of borrowing through public authorities, which could issue bonds without voter approval, albeit at a higher interest rate. The creative thinker behind this scheme was John Mitchell, then a bond lawyer, later Richard Nixon's Attorney General.
The last time voters approved a state bond issue was 1988. Since then, however, state authorities have borrowed more than $6 billion, at an estimated extra interest cost of at least $2 billion, according to Comptroller Edward Regan.
Authority borrowing costs more because it is not fully backed by the state, although in practice the state will make good if the authority comes up short. Costs are also high because authority bond issues are commonly arranged by negotiation with a selected underwriter, rather than by competitive bidding that might get the borrower a better deal.
As originally intended, authorities would borrow for specific capital projects that eventually pay for themselves -- for example, dormitories for the state university. But authority borrowing soon became a convenient device for evading voter approval on all sorts of projects, and for borrowing to cover ordinary budget expenses.
A particularly flagrant example of abuse was the state's sale of the Attica prison to an authority, the Urban Development Corporation, for $200 million in 1990, to plug a budget gap. The U.D.C. sold bonds to get cash for the purchase; the state will eventually repurchase the prison at a cost, in interest and principal, more than double the original one-shot benefit.
With shenanigans like that, it is no wonder that the credit rating agencies rank New York with the lowest of the low. To get out of the cellar, New York must break its addiction to fiscal tricks, completely and convincingly.
The State Senate has approved a proposed constitutional amendment to ease restrictions on voter-approved borrowing -- for example, allowing more than one bond issue per year -- and would create a new, centralized system for authority borrowing, strictly limited to capital projects. Negotiations along these lines are part of the current budget talks between Governor Cuomo and the Legislature's leaders.
Lawmakers have reportedly reached agreement, but their negotiations are shrouded in secrecy. Considering the long-lasting consequences of a constitutional amendment, the Legislature should not race to rubber-stamp whatever agreement the Governor and the leaders have made.
It is important that New York restore the integrity of its debt, but also important to do it right.

HEADLINE: Birth Control 'for All People'

 BODY:
It was a Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, who made an especially cogent case for the importance of international family planning. "Governments must act and private citizens cooperate urgently through voluntary means to secure this right for all people," he said. "Failure would limit the expectation of future generations to abject poverty and suffering and bring down upon us history's condemnation."
A subsequent Republican President, Ronald Reagan, didn't share Eisenhower's concern and denied funding for International Planned Parenthood and the United Nations Population Fund. The result was to inhibit certain invaluable population control programs for nearly a decade. Now President Clinton's Democratic Administration proposes to restore Eisenhower's compassionate approach to an issue that ought to be above partisan politics. 
 The Reagan Administration, responding to its more extreme right-wing supporters, promulgated the so-called Mexico City policy in 1984, which banned Federal aid to any family planning agencies that so much as mentioned abortion.
When population experts protested that such a ban held poor countries' efforts hostage to America's abortion controversy, Mr. Reagan's advisers had a blithe answer. Population growth, they said, was a "natural phenomenon" that could stimulate economic growth. More people, they argued, meant more ideas, more productivity and more consumers. If the abortion rule constricted population programs, it would do the world a favor.
Try telling that to a woman in, say, Bangladesh, for whom childbearing often begins with puberty and ends with menopause -- assuming that she lives till menopause. At least 500,000 pregnant women, most of them in poor countries, die every year. A quarter of the deaths that occur before term are the results of illegal abortions.
Try telling it to the African women living in those 18 countries in which, because of the Mexico City policy, International Planned Parenthood had to cancel programs.
And try telling it to the Chinese, who are desperately in need of population planning. Yes, there have been reports of coerced abortions, especially in rural areas; and some Americans don't believe China's denials. Still, what better way to discourage abortion than to encourage and facilitate humane family planning? That's what the U.N. Population Fund has been doing in China for a long time, but without American aid since Mexico City.
In the time since Eisenhower spoke of "this right for all people," an extraordinary number of the world's citizens have won that right. Thirty years ago, for instance, fewer than 10 percent of couples in developing countries used some kind of birth control. Now more than half do. And in Africa, where the fertility rate is highest and contraceptive use lowest, births are starting to decline.
Even so, the rate of population expansion remains awesome, threatening to impoverish the planet. We have already seen what drought, poor land use and overpopulation did to Ethiopia. Runaway pregnancy rates are no route to progress.
In asking Congress to renew financing for International Planned Parenthood and the U.N. Population Fund, Mr. Clinton is calling on the United States to pick up the standard it dropped in Mexico City. Once more, America has a chance to make a profound impact on the future of international family planning -- and on history's judgment.

HEADLINE: Troubles For Timber

BYLINE: By Jim Weaver; Jim Weaver was a Democratic Representative from Oregon from 1975 to 1987. 

DATELINE: EUGENE, Ore.

 BODY:
The object of today's "timber summit" in Portland, Ore. is to resolve the standoff between environmental groups, who are using the National Forest Management Act of 1976 to block the sale of old growth timber from the Northwest's national forests, and the timber companies and loggers, who want to harvest those trees. Politicians are crying that the environmentalists should be less intransigent, more willing to compromise. I say to those courageous souls: stand fast.
As chairman of the House Forests Subcommittee from 1977 to 1982, I spent countless hours flying over America's forests. The desolation was stark. I saw vast barren deserts in southern Oregon that once were the magnificent timber holdings of the most prominent names in the wood industry; bleached yellow earth that stretched for miles along the coastal mountains of northern California where giant redwoods once stood; contoured road-scars and checkerboard squares of clear-cuts in the national forests. 
 Are we replanting the trees? Surely. But it may take hundreds of years to re-establish the forests. On a 1982 trip with the California regional forester to the Trinity Mountains, we landed on site after site of replantings only to see withered seedlings. Embarrassed for the forester, I began looking for better plantings. "There," I said, pointing to a patch of bright green among the older, darker trees.
"That's a burn," he said wearily.
I called his attention to another lush green splotch.
"That's a burn, too."
The so-called "timber crisis" in the Northwest stems not from environmental intransigence over the spotted owl but from the fact that timberlands owned by the giant corporations have been mowed down. These companies must now resort to Federal timber in the name of jobs and the regional economy.
The primary purpose for conservationists going to court is to spare the few remaining stands in the national forests. People are beginning to understand this. If only the politicians would, too. And if only they'd come to realize that it's possible to stand up to a vocal minority and survive.
As a freshman Congressman from a rural industrial district -- the largest timber producing region in the nation -- I helped write the forest management act. It sounds foolhardy for a politician to bring down on himself the hatred of the main industry in his district. And they hated me! Mill owners would call out their workers before an election and tell them they would lose their jobs if I was re-elected. At a wilderness hearing here in Eugene, 600 log trucks wound about the town, their horns blaring, while workers paraded angrily outside the courthouse. In spite of that, I was elected six times with ever-increasing margins.
So, how do we solve the timber crisis? The Government must raise the price of timber by keeping the harvest from the national forests low. Higher prices will make trees more valuable. The more valuable the trees, the more care will go into in their growing, cutting and manufacture.
Couple this with capital gains tax treatment that benefits the long-term growing of trees -- and not the short-term cutting and exporting of them -- and we will lay the foundation for a sustained timber economy.
But that's not the way many politicians think about the use of natural resources. No doubt the dominant refrain at the timber summit will be criticism of high lumber prices and advocacy of logging of our forests.
This would be wrong. The reduction of the wood work force in the Northwest has had far more to do with the depletion of private timber than with the preservation of trees. When company's cut out their timber, they close their mills.
People will be put to work, as Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has suggested, cleaning up eco-systems and seeing to it that timber is harvested carefully. High lumber prices will force builders to build more carefully, using less wood.
The public will pay higher prices (including the Japanese who buy an average of 3 billion board feet of logs a year from us), and it should. When I was a builder in the 1960's, the cost of lumber was about 15 percent of the finished house. It is no more than that now. There is lots of room for higher prices, especially for commodities that soon will be gone if we keep up our wasteful exploitation.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Clinton's Bank Account

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Presidents have a kind of political bank account in American minds. When a President takes an important step, or ducks one, each of us makes a mental deposit or withdrawal according to our political tastes.
The accounts never get down to zero except in the minds of ideologues or out-party careerists. But most of us do not let a President get so rich that he can afford to forget we are keeping accounts. 
 In my bank, President Clinton has made a deposit that fattens his balance against some early withdrawals.
By executive order, the President canceled the Reagan-Bush ban on U.S. aid to any birth control group at home or abroad that gives a word of supportive advice or information about abortion.
Aside from violating freedom of speech and medical counsel for Americans, this order was an economic and political blow to countries that can afford it least: nations whose population growth is so explosive that it wipes out hope that there can ever be food for every mouth, or a decent place to rest every body.
I am not a demographer but I do have a qualification to write and shout about the importance of birth control and American help for it. I lived in India for four years.
On my desk is a book I bought in New Delhi long ago -- Murray's Handbook. It tells me the population when I first saw India in 1954 -- about 360 million. All over the world people knew then that India was being choked by its people.
I returned often, drawn by affection for a country that has never surrendered either to despair or despotism. During a visit last month I asked for the projected figure for 1993. It is 844 million.
Can I even grasp this? Just in the years of my own interest in India, it has grown by twice the present population of the United States. My God.
Between Bombay's airport and the city, the bouncy commercial capital of India, I drove along a carpet miles long -- collections of burlap rags in which hundreds of thousands of human beings live. Not fit for dogs.
In their villages there are too many people to feed, no chance of work. On the pavements they can at least hope that somewhere in the huge city there will be something for them, some food, some labor.
Perhaps we can grasp India now. But can our minds encompass a vision of the streets of Bombay, or of scores of exploding cities around the world, in another few decades? I do not think we can; nobody has ever seen such dreadful things as those streets will be.
With decent birth control, India could still be a reachable dream of economic and political dignity. Without it, all the sweat and talent will not fulfill that hope.
There is an almost unspeakable sorrow in that thought -- the knowledge that all the drive and effort that Indians and Mexicans and Nigerians and Egyptians, and so many others, have put into strengthening their countries may add up to nothing but unending misery.
In India, as in other countries that have failed at birth control, the fault is not America's. Their own leaders bear the responsibility for not doing enough in education, health care and the spread of birth control devices and techniques.
And American aid to many population control groups continued during the Reagan-Bush anti-abortion ban. But the order did more than wipe out aid directly or through the U.N. to groups that would not obey Washington's order to shut their mouths and brains about choice. It destroyed American intellectual and moral leadership in the international population-control movement.
For those Americans cynical about the value of American leadership, a couple of reminders. American political democracy brought strength to hundreds of millions during the ice age of Communism. And American push helped bring the agricultural revolution that around the world makes brown fields green.
But by saying thou shalt and shalt not to people and nations working to spread birth control, America separated itself from them, even from many who felt forced to submit. The U.S. surrendered its full moral and leadership powers.
Now America is back, Mr. Clinton's account is greater, and the accumulating interest will be shared by many people in many choking nations.

"Clinton Considers Measures to Help Troubled Airlines" (front-page, March 22) reports that the American taxpayer will be called upon to bail out the airline industry, in the same way as this long-suffering beast of burden has been called upon to bail out the savings and loan industry.
It is important to note that in both instances the initial damage was done by deregulating an industry that is structurally not suited to unregulated competition. 
 In the case of the savings and loan crisis, the greed of the managers and owners, like Charles H. Keating Jr. of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, was released from controls to the detriment of the depositors.
In the case of the airlines, the preponderance of fixed assets in the provision of services made it absolutely certain that individual carriers would engage in cut-throat competition and monopolistic practices that would seriously weaken the viability of the industry.
Do airline customers now pay retroactively as taxpayers for cheaper tickets in recent years? And will we, again as taxpayers, have to pay for past cost-cutting measures that also cut corners in airplane maintenance and gave us deteriorated service and jammed-together seats?
Further, will passengers now be called upon to make up for past losses by future ticket prices that are higher than they would have been if we had kept regulation? Where, then, have the much-touted benefits of misapplied market ideology gone?
It may turn out in the end that, as both passengers and taxpayers, we will pay more for flying around the country and the world than we would have if we had only let well enough alone.

HEADLINE: Wipe Draft Off Books In U.S., and the World

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Military conscription is a coercive act of government. It is an infringement of one's personal liberty, the taking away of the right to run one's own life.
The tolerance of military conscription by the people of the United States since the conclusion of World War II is beyond my comprehension. In high-technology modern warfare, there can be no possible need for conscription in the United States. 
 If the United States were to engage in war to protect its national interests, there would be more than enough volunteers, men and women, to fill the personnel needs of the armed services in combat and noncombat units.
President Clinton, who as a youth strongly opposed military conscription and who managed to avoid military service during the Vietnam War by taking advantage of the escape provisions in the Selective Service Act available to college students, is now in a position, as Commander in Chief of the United States armed forces, to lead the United States and the rest of the world away from military conscription.
And by so doing, he can also immeasurably improve the prospects for peace in the world.
I suggest that President Clinton and Congress take action immediately to put an end to the Military Selective Service Act, which was enacted during the Carter Administration, under which young men in the United States upon reaching the age of 18 are required to register for possible military service, even though no one has been drafted since the enactment of that law.
I further suggest that Mr. Clinton, as President, go in person before the United Nations and propose that all nations end military registration and conscription in whatever form and that the nations that end them then deny military, financial and economic assistance to all other nations that have military registration and conscription in any form, without exceptions.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Perot Call Off Truce; Both Say, No More Mr. Nice Guy

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANNAPOLIS, Md., April 1

 BODY:
President Clinton and Ross Perot abruptly dropped all pretense of diplomacy today in a fit of cross-country name-calling that noisily shattered their uneasy peace.
In a speech at the United States Naval Academy here, Mr. Clinton said in response to a question that Mr. Perot had engaged in "rumor mongering" by repeating unflattering stories about the Administration's relations with the military. 
 Mr. Perot responded tartly in a telephone interview from Dallas, asserting that Mr. Clinton had "ducked" military service and thus lacked the moral authority to criticize an Army general who recently complained of poor treatment at the hands of a White House aide. "If he wants to climb into the ring," Mr. Perot said ominously, "any time, anywhere."
The flurry of invective between the two men, who have circled each other like prize fighters but largely avoided delivering any direct blows, was apparently unplanned. But the result was to effectively halt the tentative peace that Mr. Clinton and his aides had cultivated assiduously in hopes of attracting Mr. Perot's supporters.
Between the insults, Mr. Perot declared, "There's no bad blood as far as I'm concerned."
But the President was clearly piqued as he responded to a question about Mr. Perot during a question-and-answer session at a luncheon sponsored by the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
 
Perot Spoke Derisively
 "You know, Mr. Perot came to Washington the other day and attacked my chief of staff as not being a real business person, and he had to call him on the phone and personally apologize the next day," Mr. Clinton said. "I mean, people can say anything from the podium."
In an appearance before a Congressional committee early last month, Mr. Perot derided Mr. Clinton's energy-policy strategists as "poets, philosophers and beekeepers," adding, "Not one of them has ever run a business or created a job, far as I know."
Mr. Clinton went on today, "I'd be more interested in why my economic program -- which is 85 percent what Ross Perot recommended in the campaign, except we raised taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy and don't have unspecified health care savings -- hasn't been endorsed since it's almost identical to the one he ran on."
 
'His Plan Won't Work'
 Mr. Perot, in his strongest criticism of the economic plan to date, said he had no intention of endorsing Mr. Clinton's proposals.
"His plan won't work," Mr. Perot said. "His plan is going to drastically increase spending. It is not being candidly presented to the American people."
Of the deficit reduction plan in particular, he said: "Most of it is based on really tentative premises and guesses."
The shots across the bow, bitter in tone and apparently the result of frustration in both men, was long in coming. Mr. Clinton has taken some tiny digs at Mr. Perot in recent days.
At a black-tie dinner for radio and television correspondents on March 18, he wrapped his criticism in a joke. When Mr. Perot spoke of the lack of business experience in the Administration, Mr. Clinton took that as a slap at his childhood friend, Thomas F. McLarty Jr., who is the President's chief of staff and ran an energy company until recently.
"He just resents it because Mack's a short guy with real power," Mr. Clinton said.
 
Poll's Findings on Perot
 In the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, conducted Sunday through Wednesday, 42 percent of registered voters said they viewed Mr. Perot favorably, virtually unchanged from the 45 percent who said the same in January. The percentage of those who viewed him unfavorably remained fairly steady as well, at 26 percent in January and 23 percent in the new poll. Each poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Mr. Clinton's thin skin has apparently thinned more in recent days because of articles about his strained relations with the military, among other things..
Mr. Clinton seemed especially annoyed by Mr. Perot's repeating a widely circulated story that a member of the President's staff had refused to speak to a uniformed general on the White House grounds.
"The other story, like all those military stories, was an abject lie," he told the members of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, who traveled here from their convention in Baltimore.
Mr. Clinton never served in the armed forces and was forced to defend himself through most of his campaign against accusations that he dodged the Vietnam-era draft.
The President, who has been struggling to establish a relationship with members of the military who oppose his plan to lift its ban against homosexuals, had lunch with 4,000 midshipmen at the Naval Academy today before speaking to the editors.
"I don't think we ought to be out here rumor-mongering myself," he added. "I think it does very little to support the public interest."
The officer, Lieut. Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, told The Washington Post in an article published today that the incident did occur. General McCaffrey went on to say, however, that the incident was overblown and that the resulting debate over the Clinton Adminstration's relationship with the military was a "grossly unfair rap."
In responding to Mr. Clinton's remarks today, Mr. Perot said the President had his facts wrong on the military story and when he asserted that the decision to remove United States Attorneys who were holdovers from the Bush Administration was not politically motivated.
"Nobody likes to be called a liar," Mr. Perot said in the telephone interview. "But to be called a liar by Bill Clinton is really a unique experience."

HEADLINE: Solid Quarter Led by Cyclical Stocks

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The first quarter brought smiles to many investors who owned shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange, especially in industries like semiconductors, energy and utilities.
The first three months of the year were less kind to small-capitalization Nasdaq issues, which cooled a bit after a record-breaking advance that had begun in early autumn. 
 And anyone who held medical-related stocks was badly hurt by the uncertainty surrounding the Clinton Administration's plans for reforming the health-care system.
 
A Solid Performance
 Spectacular winners and losers aside, the stock market's first-quarter performance was solid, as most stocks benefitted from a sharp fall in interest rates and signs that the economic recovery might be gathering momentum.
Of the more than 5,000 common stocks tracked by Media General Financial Services, stocks that rose in price during the quarter outnumbered declining issues by a ratio of almost two to one.
Much of the improvement was on the Big Board, where 1,341 stocks rose in price while just 529 fell. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 4.1 percent in the quarter, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 3.7 percent.
But the gap between winners and losers on Nasdaq's over-the-counter system was closer, with 1,462 issues posting gains and 1,045 showing losses. The Nasdaq 100 average, a grouping that includes heavyweights like Apple Computer and Microsoft, fell by 1 percent. But the Nasdaq's broader composite index managed to rise by 1.9 percent.
On the American Stock Exchange, 325 stocks rose in the quarter and 193 declined. The exchange actually boasted the quarter's largest percentage gain, with its Wednesday close of 423.43 fully 6 percent higher than its Dec. 31 close of 399.23.
 
Semiconductors Soar
 Among industries, the quarter was a particularly good one for cyclical stocks, including energy, steel, automobiles and gold, that had previously underperformed. And it was an absolutely spectacular time to own shares in semiconductor stocks.
"Investment in labor-saving technology has been soaring for the last six quarters," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corporation. "That is being reflected in the earnings reports of these semiconductor companies."
Of the 88 industry groups represented in the S.&P. 500, semiconductor stocks did best, rising nearly 30 percent during the period. But of the top five, three were energy-related, all with gains of more than 20 percent. And gold stocks rose 20.6 percent.
"Energy stocks had been underowned, they offered high yields and the news on oil prices during the quarter stopped getting worse," said Byron Wein, United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. "Gold prices were unrealistically depressed by heavy liquidation in 1992."
Falling interest rates were a boon to utility and financial stocks. The Big Board's utility average rose 8.9 percent, while its index of financial stocks advanced 8.7 percent.
 
Health Care's Slide

 
 Lists of stocks that lost money during the quarter were littered with names of companies in health care. Five of the six worst-performing groups in the S.& P. 500 were related in one way or another to health care.
The worst were miscellaneous health care companies, like the biotech concern Amgen and the drug manufacturer Alza, whose stocks fell 37 percent during the quarter. Drug stocks crashed 14.9 percent, medical products and suppliers fell 14.1 percent, and hospital management companies slid 13.9 percent.
With interest rates on the rise, analysts were hesitant to predict the second quarter would be as strong as the first. "There is room for stocks to rise further," said A. Marshall Acuff, portfolio strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "But any additional improvement will have to come from better corporate earnings."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 7, 1993, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on Friday, with an article about stocks that posted the biggest gains and losses in the first quarter, included an erroneous entry for Humana Inc. supplied by Media General Financial Services. Humana split 2 for 1 in the first quarter when it spun off its hospital management company, Galen Health Care Inc. Thus Humana was not the stock showing the largest percentage decline on the New York Stock Exchange in the quarter.
In addition, the three charts with the article, showing the biggest gainers and losers on the New York and American stock exchanges and the Nasdaq market, mislabeled the quarter covered. It was the first.

GRAPHIC: Tables: "Big Board's Gainers and Losers," "Nasdaq Gainers and Losers" (pg. D1), and "Amex Gainers and Losers" (pg. D4) show common stocks with the largest gains and declines in percentage terms in the third quarter, as calculated by Media General. Stocks that started the quarter less than $5 per share are excluded. Only one class of stock is listed for cach company.

HEADLINE: Single-Minded President;
White House Lacks Strength in Congress To Push More Than One Issue at a Time

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
The retreats and delays that are coming to exemplify the Clinton Administration's pursuit of its legislative agenda are rooted in one underlying fact: the White House is only strong enough to fight one battle at a time in Congress.
For the moment, that battle is over President Clinton's economic plan. Everything else -- even promises made dozens of times in the Presidential campaign and afterward -- is tied for second. 
 The main reason is in the arithmetic. The Democratic majorities are not so big that just a few defections do not mean trouble. Sometimes even Democratic unity is not enough, as today's deadlock in the Senate over passage of the President's stimulus package shows. The 43 Republicans are filibustering to prevent a vote on the $16.3 billion spending bill that Mr. Clinton says will spur the economy. [Page 10.]
 
Fear of Abandonment
 The Clinton Administration used the latest unemployment figures released today as ammunition in urging passage of the spending package, even though many analysts said they were reassured that the economic recovery was intact. The Labor Department reported that the number of payroll jobs fell slightly in March and that the nation's unemployment rate remained at 7 percent. [Page 7.]
After being starved for power for 12 Republican years, groups that supported Mr. Clinton distrust his single-mindedness on the economic front. They are besieging the Administration to put their fights first.
When they have to wait, they fear their concerns are being abandoned. This week environmentalists were outraged when the Administration retreated on its plan to change land-use practices by raising grazing rights fees and imposing mining royalties.
Those who want an overhaul of campaign-finance law see the indefinite delay on that issue as a wasted opportunity. Even advocates of anti-crime legislation or the North American Free Trade Agreement or homosexuals in the military wonder if the Administration's decision to delay action on their causes will hurt their chances.
The risk is that where the Administration sees strategic maneuvers others will see political cowardice.
Advocates of abortion rights, for example, watch the Administration sidestep other fights and wonder just how hard it will battle to repeal the ban on Federal financing of abortions for poor women. At the very least, such unease leads to more and more demands for quick action on favored issues.
And opponents of the Administration on various issues may become braver. "We were all concerned about his ability to say, 'No,' " Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the deputy Republican leader, said today at a breakfast with reporters.
But to the Administration, those risks are nothing compared with the risk of failing to obtain the economic package. As Leon E. Panetta, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, said, "Our No. 1 agenda here is keeping the focus on the economic plan."
That concentration echoes on Capitol Hill. "The primary purpose of this Congress is to address the economy, and the other issue is health care," said Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the House Democratic whip. "We're not going to get sidetracked by other issues."
 
Clinton's Role Defined
 And Mr. Clinton's influence is crucial. Without his pressure, said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, "We're not to be trusted in terms of staying focused."
So if higher grazing fees or mining royalties threaten its passage, out they go. If the trade pact with Mexico and Canada looks like a distraction, it can be shoved back on the schedule, as the irritating issue of campaign financing has already been.
When Mr. Clinton was elected in November, and his party maintained control of both houses of Congress, the Democrats saw long-awaited opportunities on issues Republican Administration had kept off the table. But 57 Democrats in the Senate are not enough to break a filibuster without Republican help.
Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama usually votes with Republicans, so that leaves 56. And when several Western Democrats threatened to desert over mining and grazing charges, the Administration abandoned the fight for now.
The House, with 255 Democrats, provides only a slightly bigger margin of safety.
 
Lesson From History
 History plays a part. Mr. Panetta and others in the Administration acknowledge that they have learned a lesson from the Carter Administration, which began with 292 Democrats in the House and 61 in the Senate but which was judged a failure because of its scattered demands on Congress.
"The shadow of Carter haunts everyone," the budget director said. "There were so many different issues that they were working on and they took so many missteps at the start that they never were able to get their act together."
More recent history matters, too. The Clinton campaign succeeded when it concentrated, and especially when it concentrated on the economy. "They get very nervous about getting off that focus," said Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut, who is in charge of campaign-finance bills in the House.
Representative Miller, who heads the Natural Resources Committee and is a critic of the decision on mining and grazing, agreed. He said he knew that the Administration was working behind the scenes to prepare bills on other difficult issues, but that the message it wanted understood by the public was "do only one thing at a time."
 
A Matter of Scale
 Mr. Miller said that while he disagreed, he understood the White House's thinking on putting the success of the budget package ahead of quick change in grazing and mineral charges. "On their radar screen, one was an aircraft carrier and the other was a rowboat."
Now the focus is the economy. Later this year it will be health care, although perhaps only in extended hearings, not floor action.
There will be time to deal with other tough issues, from the ban on homosexuals in the armed forces to abortion to campaign finance to mining laws. But supporters behind all of these measures may find themselves competing for attention and a prime place on the calendar.

HEADLINE: $9.6 Billion Package for M.T.A. Is Crucial to Its Rebuilding Plans

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

 BODY:
The budget agreement in Albany that gives the Metropolitan Transportation Authority virtually all of the $9.6 billion it requested for a rebuilding program over the next five years promises a smoother trip for mass-transit riders in the New York metropolitan region.
One in every five New York City subway stations will be renovated, an automated fare-card system will be paid for and 88 miles of subway track -- 13 percent of the system -- will be replaced, among other measures in the plan. It also calls for 144 new train cars and 40 new locomotives for the Long Island Rail Road and 200 miles of new track for the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.
 
Safer and More Reliable
 M.T.A. executives say the plan, which follows two previous five-year plans, each for about $8 billion, is critical to making the New York regional transportation system safer and more reliable. 
 The city's subway and bus systems, which together carry more than 3.5 million riders daily, suffered badly in the 1970's as the city's fiscal crisis and other financial problems prevented even routine maintenance.
Advocates of mass transportation feared that a cycle of neglect would begin again because of the recent recession and a sense that a great deal of money had already been invested on upgrading buses, subways and the two commuter lines.
"A year ago, people thought that we faced a period of disinvestment," said Gene Russianoff, senior attorney for the Straphanger's Campaign, an advocacy group for subway riders. "I'm glad to see that it's not happening."
The agreement in Albany, part of a massive transportation financing package reached on Thursday as part of a budget accord between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders, also pledges to save the $1.25 subway and bus fare for the next two years.
A fare increase is now planned for 1995, and M.T.A. officials hope that by then, after automatic fare cards for subways and buses are in use, riders will be more willing to accept the increase. Although details of the agreement were still being discussed yesterday, legislators and transit officials said that they expected the accord to hold.
They also said that public pressure for spending on transit, together with a slight improvement in state revenue projections, helped make an accord possible between the Republican-led Senate and the Democratic-led Assembly, which often splits on upstate vs. downstate concerns.
The agreement, a complex patchwork of financing that involves dozens of sources of money, much of it borrowed, is also a personal victory for Peter E. Stangl, the chairman of the M.T.A. He lobbied hard to prevent the Governor and the Legislature from scaling back the rebuilding program, or putting it off altogether.
"My concern was that some people might think it was already done," Mr. Stangl said yesterday. "But this is great. It's a recognition of how important transit is to how we live our lives, and how important transit is to keeping our region competitive."
In the M.T.A.'s two previous capital plans, shiny new subway cars brought a visible improvement to the underground network. The new cars break down far less often than the old ones, are air-conditioned and are generally free of graffiti.
In contrast, many of the items in the new plan will be invisible to ordinary riders. For example, $564 million will replace subway tracks and switches, $455 million will buy new signal lights and $518 million will rebuild bus depots.
 
Budget Discussions Continue
 In Albany yesterday, budget discussions continued as lawmakers worked out details of the $32 billion budget deal so that the Legislature could begin to vote on the package. Negotiators said they hoped to finish voting before Monday, when Passover begins.
But lawmakers also said that a Court of Appeals decision declaring that an important part of the way that New York State puts together its budgets is unconstitutional might cause some delays because lawmakers would have to rewrite much of their budget language.
While the rebuilding program also covers buses and commuter rails, $7.4 billion of the $9.6 billion plan will go for subways, the costliest and oldest arm of the city's transit system.
Mr. Stangl warned that details of the plan's financing are not yet final. For example, the plan's $9.6 billion anticipates a $500 million contribution from New York City that the Dinkins administration says it cannot afford.
The plan also relies on money from a $700 million transportation fund, misnamed a "locked box" fund because it was originally intended for transportation purposes only.
As part of this year's budget agreement, Governor Cuomo is taking $516 of the $700 million fund and using it to help cover the state's budget deficit. Much of the remainder of the fund will be used to pay debt service on the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bonds that will finance the rebuilding plan. But enough money remains for the rebuilding program, transportation officials say.
 
'Division of Funds'
 "I was very disappointed about the diversion of funds," said Assemblyman Michael J. Bragman, chairman of the Assembly's Transportation Committee. "But in the end, this is a package that is more than we believed could happen."
The M.T.A. did not get everything it wanted, Mr. Stangl said. For example, the Legislature refused to grant the M.T.A. the financial flexibility to transfer surplus money from its profitable commuter rails to help finance the subway system.
But the plan will enable the Transit Authority to begin more than a dozen projects as soon as the coming weeks and months. One of those projects is a $15.5 million plan to install a system of signal lights that limit the speed of subway trains as they approach certain stations, including the 14th Street-Union Square station, where a subway accident killed five passengers and injured more than 200 in August 1991.
"Replacing signals doesn't sound so important," Mr. Russianoff said. "But when you have an accident because they are faulty, that's when you understand why this plan is so critical."

HEADLINE: PHILIP MORRIS CUTS CIGARETTE PRICES, STUNNING MARKET

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
The Philip Morris Companies yesterday cut the price of its Marlboro cigarettes, the world's best-selling brand, in an acknowledgment that its flagship product was threatened by competition from discount brands and the changing habits of smokers.
The reduction of some 40 cents a pack will lower the price to a national retail average of $1.80, including excise taxes. The move startled investors, who knocked $14.75 off the price of Philip Morris shares, to $49.375. 
 The collapse of other tobacco stocks and a bond market rout contributed to a broader selloff in the stock market, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 68.63 points. [Page 43.]
Lesser price cuts will extend to other Philip Morris brands. In explaining the reductions, company executives cited gains by discount and generic labels costing as little as 89 cents a pack and an economy that remains weaker than they had expected.
 
Change in Buying Patterns
 The executives also conceded that many consumers had changed their buying patterns, balking at huge premiums for prominent brands and dropping their allegiance once they sniffed better value elsewhere. Marlboro's national market share has fallen to 22.2 percent, from 24.3 percent last year.
The tobacco industry is also under siege from the Clinton Administration, which is considering an increase of as much as $2 a pack in the 24-cent Federal tobacco tax to discourage smoking and pay for changes in the health care system. And some states plan sharp increases in their cigarette taxes; Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York has proposed a 21-cent increase, to 60 cents.
Analysts predicted much greater competition in the tobacco industry, which has long been able to raise prices far above the rate of inflation. They said sharp price cuts were all but certain.
"It is a price war," said Leigh Ferst of Prudential Securities. "Some people think it's just a battle, but it's really a war."
The Marlboro cigarette is the world's best-selling consumer product. Annual sales of six billion packs in the United States nearly match the sales of the next five brands combined. Philip Morris said its operating profits from United States tobacco sales would fall this year by as much as 40 percent, or $2 billion, as a result of the price cuts and greater competition.
Smaller savings, on average, will extend to other Philip Morris brands, including Merit, Parliament, Benson & Hedges and Virginia Slims. The savings will show up during the next few weeks through a variety of special offers as well as some direct price reductions.
Company officials spoke carefully of their moves as special promotions rather than permanent reductions, but specified no time limits. They said they would issue discount coupons, send special offers through the mail and cut wholesale prices in some instances, giving smokers an average savings of about 40 cents a pack. These actions will allow the company to formally maintain its current wholesale prices.
Executives at Philip Morris's main competitor, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which makes Camel, Winston, Salem and other brands, said they had not worked out details of their response but would defend their brands.
James W. Johnston, the chairman and chief executive of Reynolds, a unit of RJR Nabisco Inc., promised shareholders at the annual meeting yesterday that the company would take "appropriate steps to maintain its competitive positions in every segment of the market."
 
 
Assailed by Health Advocates
 Health groups attacked the Marlboro price cuts as an effort to lure more young smokers before new taxes take effect.
"Virtually all new users of Marlboro start as teen-agers or younger," said Matthew Myers, speaking for an antismoking coalition of the American Cancer, Heart and Lung associations. "It's that market that they're trying to expand and addict before the Federal Government increases the tax."
Philip Morris executives, who have denied aiming their products at young smokers, said they were responding entirely to business rivalry in a slack economy.
"Our strategy today is designed to deal with a competitive marketplace," said William I. Campbell, chief executive of Philip Morris USA. "It has no relation to the Federal excise tax."
In a recent test of the 40-cent price cut in Portland, Ore., the company gained four percentage points in market share, he said. With a lower price, he said, the brand can still gain customers at a substantial premium over discount labels, which have an average price of about $1.20.
"It is certainly not our intention to start a price war," Mr. Campbell said. "Quite the opposite."
Philip Morris, Reynolds and most other makers of high-priced cigarettes also sell discount brands, either under retailers' labels or as generic brands. From 1 percent of sales in 1982, these products have grown to about 36 percent, slowing the nation's overall decline in smoking.
Mr. Campbell blamed RJR Nabisco especially for pitching the industry into intense price competition, telling industry analysts that Reynolds was selling discount cigarettes for 99 cents at 71 percent of the stores Philip Morris checked.
Tobacco companies maintain that their premium cigarettes have premium ingredients: a higher proportion of American tobacco, Mr. Campbell said. But most of the higher price of premium brands represents marketing costs as well as substantial profits, which analysts estimate at about 56 cents a pack for Marlboros, before taxes, overhead and interest. The 40-cent price cut will probably not reduce the company's profit margin to 16 cents, they say, because sales volume is expected to increase.
Philip Morris, based in New York City, last year sold about $59 billion worth of Cheez Whiz, Miller beer, Maxwell House coffee, Kraft foods and dozens of other immediately recognized products -- a volume far greater than any competing maker of consumer goods.
The company calls Marlboro "the world's most valuable trademark," a boast that only the Coca-Cola Company might dispute. The brand is still personified by the rough-hewn cowboys featured in billions of dollars' worth of advertising. In much of the world, the red and white packs are virtually legal tender.

HEADLINE: Clinton Under Crossfire At Logging Conference

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., April 2

 BODY:
President Clinton and nearly a third of his Cabinet huddled around a wooden table here today to hear about old trees, diminishing salmon and a logger named Buzz.
The President's one-day forest conference, intended to solve an extraordinary regional conflict that has drawn the highest levels of government into its fray, left an impression that the public forests of the Pacific Northwest will not be reopened to large-scale logging. The forest have been off-limits to logging under court injunctions on behalf of rare fish and wildlife species, threatening the jobs of thousands of timber workers. 
 At the end of the day, Mr. Clinton said he would ask his Cabinet to bring him, within 60 days, a proposal to end the stalemate. He said the Cabinet's solution would have to insure the long-term health of the forests and the economic stability of communities that rely on timber.
And while he suggested that the Government would quickly try to get some timber to small mills suffering from shortages of logs, he said much of what is causing the turmoil was a result of historical forces affecting other parts of the nation's economy: increased productivity with fewer workers.
 
'Laws of Change'
 "I cannot repeal the laws of change," Mr. Clinton said, hinting that the age of big timber in the Northwest may be drawing to an end.
As loggers marched outside with signs asking Mr. Clinton to help their families, the President heard impassioned pleas to save marbled murrelets, coho salmon, spotted owls and other creatures that are dependent on some of the nation's last stands of old-growth forests.
With today's conference, which fulfills a campaign promise, Mr. Clinton has put the full power of the Presidency into what has seemed to be an intractable dispute. He has also exposed the cracks and tension within the Democratic Party between labor and environmental interests.
On Thursday night, 60,000 people gathered in the rain to demonstrate support of the ancient forests.
Today, thousands of loggers, who were given the day off from their mills, gathered here to appeal to Mr. Clinton to remove some of the environmental restrictions that have hurt their livelihoods.
Seated with Vice President Al Gore, four Cabinet members and two-dozen guests for a series of discussions, the President heard a mix of obscure forestry talk and heart-breaking family tales. A historian said that Northwesterners were "a people possessed by nature," and that the feud over what to do with much of that nature was tearing the region apart.
The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Seattle, Thomas J. Murphy, brought religion to an issue usually dominated by talk of board feet and spotted owl habits. "There are moral values in preserving forests," he said. "The timber crisis is a moral issue."
The President heard about Zane Grey, the early 20th-century outdoor writer, who used to catch big fish in Deer Creek, a stream north of Seattle now denuded by erosion from logging. And he heard loggers compared to the trailblazers who came here 150 years ago in the first year of the Oregon Trail.
"I cut trees for a living, just like my father and my grandfather did before me," said Buzz Eades, a logger from Redding, Calif. "I like to think that some of the trees that started life when my grandfather was cutting are old growth today. Mr. President, you are going to be old growth some day, too." His last remark brought laughter from the President.
 
Competing Industries
 Mr. Eades said some of his friends, "modern Paul Bunyans," as he called them, are on food stamps.
But much of that same logging is killing what was once a great salmon fishing industry, said Nat Bingham, a commercial fisherman.
"If we don't do something now to protect salmon habitat we will be listing species under the Endangered Species Act that will make the owl restrictions pale by comparison," he said.
Some of the nation's environmental leaders, angry over Mr. Clinton's decision earlier this week to delay changes in how Western lands are used, told the President that they would not retreat on the forest issue.
"In the last two months, I have spent more time inside the White House than I have in the last 12 years," Jay Hair, President of the National Wildlife Federation told reporters before the conference. "But what started out as a love affair is now looking like it may turn out to be more like date rape."
 
Labor Looks for a Favor
 But labor leaders, who supported Mr. Clinton here, also hinted that the President owed them a favor.
"Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, you campaigned on the pledge to put people first," said Mike Draper of the Western Council of Industrial Workers, which represents mill workers.
White House officials say the results of this conference will set the stage for future clashes in the country.
"This is critical to the political future of the West," said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon. "Democrats are more at risk than anybody else. We have a tradition of standing up for the environment and for working people."
White House aides say Mr. Clinton is not likely to propose changes in the Endangered Species Act or the National Forest Management Act, which environmentalists have used to halt timber harvesting.
There was also a brief exchange of regional pride. Mr. Clinton said Arkansas had the fastest-growing trees. After lunch, a panelist said, "With all due respect, Mr. President, we grow the fastest trees here."

HEADLINE: TOWARD THE SUMMIT;
The Spotlight, Again, Falls on Yeltsin

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 2

 BODY:
In principle, it is President Clinton who should be under scrutiny at this summit meeting, the newcomer making his first appearance in the Big Game. In fact, the world will probably once again be trying to figure out his partner, the big, puffy-eyed Russian just in from another brawl.
From the time he first clambered into the Kremlin over the rubble of the Soviet state that he helped to destroy, Boris N. Yeltsin always seems to be dashing from one barricade to another, usually portrayed by his lieutenants as the only viable obstacle to the return of the Bolsheviks. 
 Already before arriving in Vancouver, Mr. Clinton appears to have accepted that for now, at least, Mr. Yeltsin probably represents Russia's best hope. But his personal assessment, once he meets Mr. Yeltsin face to face, might well shape the future of American involvement in Russia's tortuous transition.
If previous impressions of Mr. Yeltsin are any guide, Mr. Clinton is not likely to emerge with a clear image. To many in the West, as in Russia, the large maverick who evolved from the Communist boss of Sverdlovsk into the executioner of the Communist empire remains something of an enigma.
He is the only leader ever elected by all Russia. He is the man who defied the Bolsheviks from atop a tank during the hard-line Communist coup in 1991, who was bold enough to break the state control on prices and to let radical, pro-Western intellectuals begin an economic revolution. He is the politician who has singlehandedly blocked reactionary deputies from power, who has firmly declared that Russia must enter into the league of democratic powers.
But this is the same man who rides roughshod over his legislature and the Constitution in the name of democracy, who nearly declared emergency rule, who came within a few votes of being thrown out of office, who is said to drink too much, who is openly disdained by his Vice President and many former allies.
In the end, Mr. Clinton will probably end up backing Mr. Yeltsin for the same reason that thousands of Russians, many of them veteran "democrats" who had begun to despair of Mr. Yeltsin, hit the streets again last week to chant his name and cheer his political survival.
Whatever most of them thought of Mr. Yeltsin personally, or of his record, or of his policies, the Congress of People's Deputies underscored that for now, at least, the choice is between a legislature packed with neo-Bolsheviks, nationalists and old apparatchiks and a President who has vowed to wrench Russia from their hands.
 
Attacks Boost His Standing
 The more dramatic the contrast, it seemed, the greater Mr. Yeltsin's support. As the delegate from Voronezh noted with some surprise, every time the Congress convened and attacked Mr. Yeltsin for his "anti-people reforms," his ratings increased. The greater the attack, the higher his ratings.
Thus his narrow escape from ouster last week may paradoxically prove to be Mr. Yeltsin's greatest strength in the referendum to which the Congress agreed for April 25. In technical terms, Mr. Yeltsin stands no chance of winning, since the deputies so stacked the rules that unless he takes virtually all the votes cast in the question of confidence in him, he will formally lose.
But in moral terms, Mr. Yeltsin has come out where he is at his best: in opposition. By assailing him so directly and unconditionally, the Congress has enabled him once again to rouse his legions with images of Communist plots and coups.
Whatever the outcome on April 25, it is certain that his lieutenants will lustily proclaim victory and try to push through another round of economic reforms before the Congress regroups and resumes its offensive. In the end, the feud is likely to end only when the Congress finally agrees to new elections.
Until then, the Congress is not likely to rest in its efforts to wrest Mr. Yeltsin's powers from him, and those who see in the Congress the face of reaction have to stay loyal to his banner.
That is not to say that Russians still feel the same passionate loyalty that Mr. Yeltsin inspired when he first raised the banner against the Communists. Many of the "democrats" who put him in power 22 months ago now openly criticize him, and almost all of the lieutenants he originally brought with him into the Kremlin are now gone -- some as sacrifices to his political adversaries. Of those remaining, most have turned against him, like Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi and Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, the Speaker of Parliament.
Though Mr. Yeltsin is hailed for the courage he showed in freeing prices on Jan. 1, 1992, he is criticized by more radical economists like Grigory A. Yavlinsky for the inconsistency of reforms since. Privatization, monetary reform and military conversion have moved at a snail's pace.
Much of the problem, of course, has come from the resistance of the bureaucracy and the Congress, and from the very novelty of the process. But Mr. Yeltsin is also accused of failing to work out a broad strategy for his reform.
Mr. Yeltsin has also been accused of wavering on the political front. Only in the last month, he declared "special rule" and then drew it back, demanded a referendum and then told the Congress he was willing to bargain it away. Meeting with President Francois Mitterrand of France, he said foreign aid was critical, then at the Congress he said it had been an error to put "excessive hope in foreign aid."
His behavior has given rise to charges that he allows himself to be manipulated by whoever is currently near him.
Certainly he remains a far less defined politician than Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union. Mr. Gorbachev was a natural favorite for the West -- decisive, quick, charming, proud, an obvious leader.
 
A Mass of Contradictions
 Mr. Yeltsin, despite a detailed autobiography and regular public appearances, is still something of an enigma. He is clearly more comfortable than Mr. Gorbachev among common people, but he reveals little of himself and has cultivated a presidential aloofness in his formal appearances.
He has a reputation for keen political instinct. But in recent months he has also been accused more than once of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, of letting personal feelings drive him to confrontation when a compromise was in his interest. A sudden, emotional appearance before the Congress last week was a case in point -- his hair out of place, a hint of inebriation, a sudden and dramatic shift of course, a populist appeal to dispense with all the politics and closet all the leaders for a week or until they came up with a compromise.
The result was a hurried overnight deal that only reopened the question of his ouster. Mr. Yeltsin later said he had not slept three days out of grief over his mother. His spokesman said he had played tennis that day. Opposition deputies hammered at his purported drinking.
But in that clumsy incident also lay the key to Mr. Yeltsin's abiding public support. To many Russians, he remains a personification precisely of the ambivalence and confusion in which they all live, and of an abiding faith that somewhere beyond lies a happier world.
And however harshly his record is criticized, the real question is whether anybody else could have done more. It has been Mr. Yeltsin's lot, after all, to preside over an extraordinary transition, for which no one had a blueprint. That Russia has not turned into a huge Switzerland overnight is no surprise; what is extraordinary is that despite all the chaos and hardship, Mr. Yeltsin is still by far the most popular man in Russia.

HEADLINE: TOWARD THE SUMMIT;
19 Western Nations Give Russia An Extra 10 Years to Repay Debt

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, April 2

 BODY:
In an important boost for President Boris N. Yeltsin just one day before he meets President Clinton, 19 Western creditor nations today gave Russia an extra 10 years to make $15 billion worth of debt payments that are coming due this year.
The so-called Paris Club of creditors, which include the United States, also went out of their way to stress "their continuing support for the Russian reform process launched and guided by President Yeltsin" and held out the possibility of further debt relief in 1994. 
 Although the rescheduling agreement announced today involves only part of Russia's $80 billion foreign debt, financial experts said it should make it easier for Mr. Yeltsin to obtain much-needed new credits from the West to finance his efforts to modernize the Russian economy.
The negotiations had dragged on for over a year, complicated by a financial dispute between Russia and Ukraine over assets of the former Soviet Union, but all parties were apparently eager to reach an accord before Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Clinton discuss Russia's economic crisis at their summit meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia this weekend.
 
$100 Billion Price Tag
 Before leaving Moscow tonight, Mr. Yeltsin said Russia needed more than the $1 billion in direct American aid expected to be offered by Mr. Clinton. "West Germany, in order to cope with the Communist hydra in East Germany, invested $100 billion," he told reporters. "That's the price of it."
The agreement today should also help the Group of Seven industrialized nations to come up with a new aid package for Russia when their Finance and Foreign Ministers meet in Tokyo on April 14 and 15.
A statement issued by the French Economy Ministry said the 19 creditor nations had welcomed Russia's "efforts at economic recovery" and called for acceleration of economic reforms so that Moscow could draw credits already approved by the International Monetary Fund.
The creditors, comprising the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia and 15 Western European nations, also noted that the agreement today should help bring about a similar agreement between Russia and its commercial bank creditors. Russia owes about $40 billion to governments, $20 billion to commercial banks and the rest to international organizations.
 
Russian Acknowledges Debt
 The statement said the Russian delegation, which was headed by Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr N. Shokhin, had acknowledged the "validity" of this debt and had reaffirmed Russia's responsibility for repayment of the entire foreign debt that it inherited from the former Soviet Union. Russia has accepted the lion's share of the Soviet foreign debt, with other former Soviet republics assuming the remainder.
The details of the accord permitting Moscow to postpone its debt payments have not been released.
Arrears on its debt servicing payments had prompted both the United States and Canada to freeze new grain credits to Russia. It was also unclear whether these credits will be released after the agreement today.

Canada Unveils Aid Package
 VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 2 (Special to The New York Times) -- Anticipating the type of help President Clinton may offer on a larger scale this weekend, Canada announced a $200 million Russia aid package today consisting mainly of food credits and technical assistance to speed the Russian transition to democracy and a market economy.
Among the projects included in the Canadian aid package are a new Canada-Russia Private Sector Partnership for management training and financial services, establishment of Russian Project Finance Bank to provide financing medium-sized loans to support privatization, and a program to help Russia modernize its oil and gas industry and improve the grain distribution systems.
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said that while the Canadian assistance is relatively small in dollar terms, if replicated by other industrial countries it would have "real impact."

HEADLINE: TOWARD THE SUMMIT: The High Stakes in Vancouver;
Clinton Believes His Own Program Is Tied to Russian Reform

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., April 2

 BODY:
President Clinton appears to be approaching the summit meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia on Saturday with an odd mix of feelings: a sense of urgency, a sense of opportunity and an unspoken fear that no matter what help he offers Mr. Yeltsin it won't make a difference.
The urgency derives from the President's stated conviction that if the United States does not do what it can to bolster Mr. Yeltsin, and Russian reform falters, Mr. Clinton's ability to slash his own military budget and get his own economic program through Congress will be imperiled. 
 In Mr. Clinton's view, aides say, the core of the Russian-American relationship has been fundamentally altered -- from one focused on reducing the threat of mutual annihilation to one focused on reducing the threat of soaring budget deficits in both countries.
More than any other in history, this summit meeting is going to be about balance sheets, not the balance of power. That is why for the first time the American President will be accompanied to a summit meeting by his Secretary of the Treasury.
 
Long Turmoil Predicted
 The opportunity for Mr. Clinton is to use the Vancouver summit meeting to establish himself finally as a credible statesman and leader of the Western alliance, something he has yet to do given his almost single-minded focus on domestic affairs. At a time when some in the military have questioned Mr. Clinton's credentials as Commander in Chief, his ability to assert leadership of the Western alliance takes on added political importance.
The sense of foreboding around the White House springs from a ream of intelligence reports suggesting that even if Mr. Yeltsin survives the latest power struggle, and the betting in the Administration is that he will, Russia will be in political turmoil for years. That will not only be a foreign affairs problem for Mr. Clinton, but also a domestic one.
Indeed, one cannot understand Mr. Clinton's feeling of urgency about helping Russian reform without understanding that he sees this issue as an adjunct of his domestic agenda. At its crudest, the White House logic goes like this: No Russian reform, no American defense cuts; no defense cuts, no chance for the Clinton Administration to deliver on its pledge to halve the budget deficit in four years; no dealing with the deficit, no re-election.
 
Stable Russia Is Key
 The whole Clinton proposal to slash $122 billion from the Defense Department budget by 1998 is built around the assumption that Russia will continue moving, with the inevitable bumps, toward a more open, democratic and free-market society that will not threaten the United States.
As Mr. Clinton said in his speech in Annapolis on Thursday, "If Russia were to revert to imperialism or were to plunge into chaos, we would need to reassess all our plans for defense savings." And if that happens, said Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, "you're going to throw the whole Clinton economic plan into a tailspin."
The aid package that President Clinton will present to Mr. Yeltsin on Saturday is tailored to help keep Russia on the general path toward reform. It is based on two approaches, which Mr. Clinton outlined to President Yeltsin in phone conversation on Thursday night.
The first involves roughly $1 billion in American aid in the form of grass-roots programs to help key political groups in Russia -- from army officers, to farmers to emerging capitalists -- on the assumption that if enough of them can be given a stake in the free market, Russia will inevitably move in that direction no matter who is in the Kremlin. Mr. Clinton has spurred other major Western allies to announce similar aid packages in the next few days, as Canada did today.
 
Rescheduling of Debt
 The second approach involves an American-led effort to get the Group of Seven major industrialized democracies to reschedule some of Russia's $80 billion in foreign debts, as the Paris Club of creditor nations began doing today. In addition, Mr. Clinton is proposing that the Group of Seven come forward with some sort of currency stabilization program that would be run by the International Monetary Fund. But this depends on Mr. Yeltsin's first getting control of his country's runaway money supply, which he and Mr. Clinton will discuss on Saturday.
In trying to persuade the American people to support some $1 billion in fresh American aid for Russia next year -- at a time when they are being asked to pay higher taxes and give up some domestic programs -- Mr. Clinton has relied heavily on economic arguments.
When asked in an interview with CBS News last week why Americans should aid Russia, the first thing Mr. Clinton said was: "America needs good customers for its products, and Russia -- a free Russia -- with a free economy, would prefer to do business with America over any other country. Every year we have to be looking ahead to find more and more markets for our products, because if we get drawn into the global economy, we've got to sell more to other people to keep our incomes high."
Some analysts argue, though, that Mr. Clinton, in his zeal to persuade the American people to support aid for Russia because it will be good business, or because reversion to a non-democratic Russia will bust America's defense budget, is dangerously exaggerating.
"Clinton and his people are saying deceptive things that are going to come back to haunt them," Stephen M. Meyer, an expert on the Russian military at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said. "The fact is Yeltsin is going to go someday, and probably soon, and when he does it is not going to be a pretty sight, and even if he stays it may not be a pretty sight. And then the right-wing in our country is going to say to Clinton, 'Well, you said it, now we need more defense spending.' "
 
Russian Military No Threat
 The fact is, Mr. Meyer said, that "if Stalin himself were to come back from the grave and return to power tomorrow" he would find that he could not pose any serious military threat to the United States.
The Russian military, he said, is in disarray. The Warsaw Pact military alliance is gone forever, Ukraine made off with the best of the Soviet Union's defense industries, land force equipment and strategic rocket forces, and the Russian Navy has virtually stopped all ship repairs, meaning many vessels are simply rusting and rotting.
True, Mr. Meyer added, Russia still has its nuclear arsenal, but those are purely doomsday weapons, which no Russian leader is likely to deploy. "Clinton should not have to deceive the American people to give Russia aid," Mr. Meyer said.
That is not advice Mr. Clinton is going to take, for part of his eagerness to put an aid package on the table, and demonstrate that he is aggressively supporting Mr. Yeltsin, is also to inoculate himself from any future "Who lost Russia?" finger-pointing. Which is a reminder that this summit meeting is not just about shoring up Mr. Yeltsin, it is also about showcasing Mr. Clinton as a world leader.
Just as President Bush established himself as the leader of the Western alliance at his shipboard summit meeting off Malta with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in December 1989, so Clinton aides hope the same will happen to their boss as a result of Vancouver.
But that will not be so easy. Mr. Bush asserted his leadership of the alliance by making a series of radical proposals at the Malta meeting to cut conventional and strategic arms, almost all of which belonged to the United States and meant saving billions of dollars. Mr. Clinton is hoping to assert himself by using Vancouver to take the lead in persuading the Group of Seven major industrialized democracies to increase their aid to Russia.
But, as Clinton aides concede, that will require spending other people's money. In particular, it will require persuading Germany, which holds 60 percent of the $80 billion Soviet debt, to be more forgiving and for Japan to be more forthcoming.
All the allies were ready to follow Mr. Bush down a road to a safer Europe, more free of weapons. But will they follow Mr. Clinton down a road of more aid to Russia, in which Washington gives a little and some allies are asked to give a lot?

HEADLINE: Big Selloffs in Stock and Bond Markets;
Tobacco Shares Pull Others Down; Dow Loses 68.63

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The stock market fell sharply yesterday, pulled down by plunging tobacco shares and rising interest rates.
Heavy selling in cable television stocks also put pressure on prices. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average posted its second-biggest loss this year, falling 68.63 points, or 2 percent, to 3,370.81. Broader market indexes fell as well.
Leading yesterday's rout was Philip Morris, which plummeted 14 3/4, or 23 percent, to close at 49 3/8. That decline alone clipped more than 30 points off the Dow.
Stocks were shaken further by heavy selling in the bond market, which pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond up to 7.05 percent, as new employment figures raised further fears of inflation.
Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was very heavy yesterday, at 325.3 million shares. The selloff in tobacco stocks accounted for more than 20 percent of the total.
But analysts were not ready to predict that stocks would continue to fall. "It was a collection of unhappy events, but they did not represent a change in the bull market trend," said Stefan D. Abrams, a managing director of the Trust Company of the West, an investment firm.
Indeed, the Dow is still well above its Dec. 31 closing of 3,301.11. The other bad day this year came on Feb. 16, when the Dow plunged 82.94 points, or 2.5 percent, only to rise slightly the following day.
"Typically, major price movements this year have been one-day events," said David G. Shulman, chief of equity strategy at Salomon Brothers.
The plunge in Philip Morris came after it announced before the market opened that it would cut 40 cents from the price of its flagship Marlboro brand to stave off competition from generic brand cigarettes. The announcement came as a surprise, and the company's stock immediately fell after it opened at 10:30 A.M., an hour late.
Philip Morris was the most heavily traded stock, at 34.3 million shares, and its 14 3/4-point drop knocked $13 billion off its total market value.
Other tobacco companies, including Loews, RJR Nabisco, UST and American Brands, were also big losers. Loews fell 16 3/8, to 94, while RJR dropped 1 1/4, to 6 3/4; UST, 3 1/8, to 26, and American Brands, 3 3/4, to 30.
"This was the day that Philip Morris acknowledged that it had to take drastic steps to counter the inroads of the less expensive generic cigarettes," Mr. Abrams said. "Heretofore, the company had left Wall Street with the impression that it had this problem under control."
Meanwhile, the Government's report on March employment yesterday shook up Wall Street. Traders had expected a rise in the number of new jobs. Instead, jobs disappeared in March. But a revision for January showed that jobs had grown much more than the Labor Department had originally reported.
Some people sold stocks in response to the unexpectedly gloomy March number, which suggested that the economic recovery might not be so strong, analysts said. Others, however, took the January revision as a sign that a higher inflation rate might be ahead; so they sold, too.
 
 
'A No-Win Situation'
 "The job report was pretty much a no-win situation," Matthew Finick, an analyst at Birinyi Associates, said.
Rising commodity prices also fed the concern about inflation, as did yesterday's rise in interest rates. Stock prices have gone up fairly steadily over the last two years, partly because people switched money into stocks from Treasury securities and corporate bonds. With interest rates falling for Treasuries and bonds, investors had sought better earnings in the stock market.
Yesterday, however, new signs of inflation and the rise in interest rates made stocks seem less appealing, analysts said.
 
Cable Television Issues Fall
 Cable television stocks came under severe pressure after the Federal Communications Commission ordered sweeping cuts in consumers' cable rates. Time Warner, for example, was down 2 1/4, to 30. In Nasdaq trading, Tele-Communications fell 2 3/8, to 18 1/8, and Comcast Communications lost 2 5/8, to 16 3/8. The drop in Tele-Communications and Comcast helped to bring down the Nasdaq composite index by 16.79 points, or 2.45 percent, to 669.85.
There were other casualties. Rising silver prices hurt Eastman Kodak, which uses silver in manufacturing film. Its stock fell by 2, to 52 1/2.
President Clinton's visit to Oregon lumber country made investors nervous about forest product companies, and several lost ground. Weyerhaeuser took the biggest hit, falling 2 1/4, to 39 1/8.
Some computer industry stocks also dropped, in part because Conner Peripherals, a disk drive manufacturer, reported that its first-quarter earnings would be poor.
And program trading added to the decline. Three sell programs involving futures contracts, offset by only one buy program, resulted in a 19-point loss in the Dow, Birinyi Associates reported.
The market's retreat was broad-based. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.91 points, to 441.39. The number of declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange overpowered the number that rose, with 1,614 down and 397 up. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 5.25, to 417.52.

HEADLINE: At Impasse on Jobs Bill, Senate Quarrels Instead

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
Frozen in filibuster just 42 days into its legislative year, the Senate dropped all pretense of debating President Clinton's jobs bill today and instead fell to squabbling over whose foot is dragging most.
Democrats and Republicans alike have jumped into the fray with such gusto that it seemed questionable whether they would quit any time soon, even though their two-week vacation was supposed to begin this evening. 
 In a day clogged with news conferences, Democrats accused Republicans of blocking a vote on Mr. Clinton's $16.3 billion package by proposing an endless chain of amendments to the bill, each requiring seemingly endless debate.
Republicans complained that Democrats were really the ones responsible for the bottleneck, wielding the Senate's maze of procedural rules to keep their amendments from being offered, much less debated. And they noted that since the Senate took the bill up eight days ago, Democrats have talked more than twice as much as they have.
This afternoon, the Democrats tried to cut the argument off and force a reasonably quick vote on the jobs bill. But the attempt foundered by a largely partisan vote of 55 to 43, well short of the 60 votes it needed.
 
Try, Try Again
 The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, said he would try again on Saturday and Monday. In the meantime, he said, he would listen to proposals by Republican leaders for a slimmed-down jobs package that could win their support.
But Senator Mitchell and Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who is Mr. Clinton's point man on the bill, suggested that the President wants his bill passed in full, or not at all.
That prompted Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, to note: "Sometimes when you play for all or nothing you get all. And sometimes you get nothing."
Mr. Clinton -- who was in Portland, Ore., leading a conference on Western forests -- suggested, in phrases copied from President Ronald Reagan's political handbook, that his opponents want to destroy his dreams for America's economy for political gain.
"It'll be a real shame if a minority of the Senate is successful in keeping hundreds of thousands of more Americans out of work," he said.
The President's argument that the economy needs the jobs bill got some help today when the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate was stuck at 7 percent last month. The bill would add $16.3 billion to the Federal deficit to create the statistical equivalent of about 200,000 jobs -- mostly summer jobs for teachers and teen-agers, but also more lasting work in construction and manufacturing and in Federal agencies.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, suggested that Republicans would accept a package limited to highway construction, summer jobs, unemployment benefits and immunizations for poor children, totaling about $8 billion. He added that he would offer an amendment to that effect if only the Democrats would let him.
The Democrats, knowing Mr. Dole's amendment would lose on a party-line vote, said that would be fine. But first, they said, Mr. Dole must agree to a firm date for voting on the entire bill, a vote the Republicans would surely lose.
The Republicans declined that offer. The Democrats show no desire to negotiate a compromise.
House Democrats had their share of problems today, too.
After pledging to give Mr. Clinton legislation granting him a diluted form of a line-item veto, the House leadership found itself opposed by an odd alliance: Republicans who called the bill too weak to help Mr. Clinton weed pork out of the budget, and Democratic members of the House Appropriations Committee and the Congressional Black Caucus who called it too strong. Together, they forced the leadership to pull the bill from consideration until after the House's spring break.

Dollar Continues Setting Record Lows Against Yen

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar hit a record low against the yen for a third straight session yesterday as news of tepid growth in employment in the United States accelerated the dollar's two-month decline.
Gold prices rose $2.20 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, where bullion for current delivery settled at $340.90 an ounce. The Republic National Bank put gold at $340.15 an ounce, up $1.90 from Thursday. 
 "It's a sluggish recovery in the U.S. still, and that's going to hang heavy on the dollar over the next couple of weeks," said David Brown, chief economist at Tokai Bank in London.
Nonfarm employment in March showed an unexpected drop, of 22,000 jobs, the Labor Department said. The report touched off large-scale selling of the dollar against the yen.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to another record low, closing at 114.00 yen, down 0.54 yen from Thursday's close. Later in London the dollar rose to 114.15 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at a record low of 113.75 yen, down from late Thursday's 114.04.
The Bank of Japan made a half-hearted attempt to support the dollar by making small dollar purchases. But the lack of concerted action by other central banks convinced dealers that the Group of Seven industrialized nations wants a stronger yen, which should make exports cheaper in Japan and thus trim Tokyo's huge trade surplus.
"If they had really wanted to push up the dollar, the amount would have to be much larger or the operation would have been a joint intervention," a bank dealer in the United States said of the Bank of Japan's efforts.
The dollar ended higher against the German mark after touching 1.5860 marks, its lowest level since January. In European trading, the dollar ended at 1.6055 German marks, up from 1.5998. Later in New York, the dollar rose to 1.5975 marks, from 1.5915 late Thursday.
Other late dollar quotes in New York, compared with late Thursday: 1.4780 Swiss francs, up from 1.4755; 5.4400 French francs, up from 5.4020; 1,584.00 Italian lire, down from 1,586.00, and 1.2641 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2598.

Conner Says First-Quarter Profit Will Be Weak

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 2

 BODY:
Conner Peripherals Inc. said today that poor demand and price declines for disk drives, as well as weak orders from its European distributor, would cause first-quarter earnings to fall substantially below current analysts' expectations.
Conner shares fell $1.125, to $13.50 in New York Stock Exchange trading today, and some analysts were surprised they did not fall further. 
 Price wars, the weak economies in Europe and Japan, and a transition to higher-capacity disk drives are likely to squeeze the earnings of all disk drive makers, analysts said. The Western Digital Corporation, another major disk drive maker, said two weeks ago that its earnings would fall below Wall Street expectations, blaming price cutting by competitors.
"The drive industry has had a debacle of a quarter, and I don't see what's on the horizon to make things change for the better," said Todd D. Bakar, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. "Within that framework, companies do better or worse depending on their product and customer makeup. Conner's vulnerability is above average given its product makeup, which tends to be in lower-capacity drives."
Conner said that it was evaluating possible moves to reduce costs and that any such actions could result in additional charges that would further reduce earnings for the quarter. Actual operating results will depend on expense levels or other charges incurred in the quarter, Conner said.
Before today, analysts' estimates for Conner's earnings in the quarter had been as high as 48 cents a share; today, some lowered their estimates to as little as 15 cents. In last year's first quarter, Connner earned $24.7 million, or 42 cents a share, on revenues of $441 million.
"The market for our disk drive products is currently being affected by a variety of factors," Finis Conner, Conner's chief executive, said. "Ongoing price competition and excess capacity in the industry has caused customers to defer purchases and reduce lead times for purchase orders."
Demand is increasingly shifting to disk drives with the capacity to store greater amounts of data, Mr. Conner said, significantly cutting into sales of lower-capacity products.
 
A Problem in Europe
 Conner was particularly affected by a deferral of orders by its major European distributor at the end of the quarter.
"We are currently in discussions with this distributor and are evaluating a restructuring of our relationship in order to improve our control and leadership in this channel," Mr. Conner said. The company will sell more disk drives directly to retailers in Europe, it told analysts in a conference call this morning.
The weakness at Conner "is part of a normal rubber band effect in the disk drive busines between capacity and demand," said James Porter, president of Disk Trend, a disk drive industry market research firm based in Mountain View, Calif.
He noted that disk drive makers themselves do not control demand cycles, but instead respond to demand created by new microprocessors and software in the personal computer industry. "I'm not looking for a decline in unit shipments for PC's," he added, "but growth of zero seems plausible."

HEADLINE: U.S. Jobless Rate Steady, but Payrolls Fell in March

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
In a report subject to widely differing interpretations, the Labor Department said today that the number of payroll jobs fell slightly in March and that the nation's unemployment rate remained at 7 percent.
The decline of 22,000 in payroll jobs was greeted initially with disappointment, since a six-digit rise had been expected. But after closer scrutiny of the figures, which provided the first broad view of the economy's March performance, many analysts were reassured that the economic recovery was still intact. 
 Some of their fears were allayed by upward revisions in the data for January and February, and the realization that the midmonth East Coast blizzard had distorted the March numbers.
 
A Positive View
 "We're still getting some gains in the labor market," said James E. Annable, chief economist for the First National Bank in Chicago. "It sure as heck ain't a recession."
But the Clinton Administration used the report to argue for passage of its $16.3 billion jobs bill, threatened in the Senate with a Republican filibuster.
The news "reinforces the need for the President's stimulus package," declared Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor, in a statement issued while he attended a forest conference with President Clinton in Portland, Ore.
Mr. Clinton himself leaked word of the unchanged jobless rate in an early morning television appearance before public release of the data at 8:30, Eastern standard time.
Republicans countered that the stimulus plan was a grab-bag of measures that would probably harm employment by slowing the economy.
While the March job figures paled in comparison with the robust February report, which included a surge of 365,000 in payroll jobs, analysts noted that the labor market managed to at least hold its ground when allowance was made for the severe weather that occurred toward the end of the survey week. The storm led to some job losses but had its biggest impact in shortening the workweek.
The private-sector workweek was 6 minutes shorter, with people in factories working 18 minutes less and factory overtime down by 24 minutes from levels that had been quite high.
The report also revised upward the previously reported job gain for January, to 113,000 from 44,000, and even added another 2,000 to the big February gain.
Moreover, various private economists noted, there was a tendency for full-time jobs to replace part-time work. A month ago, the report for February showed a jump of 348,000 in people working fewer hours than they wanted, and the Clinton camp cited this in support of its stimulation efforts. In March, however, the ranks of the so-called involuntary part-timers fell 267,000.
 
Discouraged Workers
 Nor has there been any significant rise of late in discouraged workers, who are people who have given up looking for jobs because they do not think they will find one. This figure, tabulated quarterly, rose 1.1 percent for the first quarter, the same as in the final three months of 1992.
"It's really fairly good," said H. Erich Heinemann, economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, viewing today's report over all.
Some analysts did, however, express concern about a 5 cent rise, to $10.80, in average hourly earnings, a possible sign of revived inflation. That figure may have contributed to a slump in the bond market today.
Of the 11 major states for which figures were reported today, only Massachusetts had a jobless-rate change of clear statistical significance -- a decline of 1.3 points, to 6.4 percent. New York and Texas posted declines of seven-tenths of a point, to 7.3 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively. New Jersey's jobless rate was calculated at 8.3 percent, up from 7.8.
The payroll survey showed a drop of 59,000 in construction jobs, which had climbed sharply in February. That was largely offset by an advance of 37,000 in business service jobs and a rise of 9,000, albeit smaller than usual, in health services. Factory jobs eased 9,000, after rising 30,000 in January and 20,000 in February.
Still other payroll data showed that the index of aggregate weekly hours of production workers eased six-tenths of a point, to 121.9, while the percentage of industries adding workers slumped to 48.6, from 61.1 in February.
 
Fewer Are Without Jobs
 The survey of households showed a job gain of 114,000, which, when combined with an expansion of 102,000 in the labor force, reduced the ranks of the unemployed by 12,000, to 8,864,000.
The jobless rate for adult women fell to 5.7 percent, from 6 percent, while the rate for adult men rose two-tenths of a point, to 6.7 percent.
"While we have seen slow but steady declines in unemployment between June and February," observed William G. Barron Jr., the Acting Commissioner of Labor Statistics, "joblessness remains well above prerecession levels, when the rate fluctuated between 5 and 5.4 percent. Moreover, the number of persons unemployed for six months or more in March was 1.8 million, triple prerecession levels."
Last month was the second anniversary of the official end of the ninth postwar recession, which began in July 1990 and lasted until March 1991. In the regaining of jobs, the latest recovery stands "a distant eighth," Mr. Barron told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.

HEADLINE: Science or Art Form? The Top Managers Talk About Their Tactics

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
Most investors in stock mutual funds choose diversified funds, asking the manager to decide which areas of the market are most promising at a particular time. So while single-industry funds offer the possibility of better -- and far worse -- performance in any given period, perhaps the most pertinent information for most people is the performance of general stock funds. Here are three funds that did best over the last quarter, year and five years.

Vista Growth and Income
Best Over 5 Years
Manager: Mark A. Tincher 
 "I think the economy may be a little stronger than people expect, so exposure to cyclical stocks will be better bets than defensive plays," said Mark A. Tincher, who manages the $325 million Vista Growth and Income Fund (800 348-4782) in New York, the best-performing equity fund over the last five years with an average annual return of 31.8 percent.
Mr. Tincher began at Citibank, where he handled the convertible securities part of the bank's institutional money management business. When that was sold to USF&G in 1985, he joined Chase Manhattan, sponsor of the Vista funds, where he managed money for the bank before taking over management of the fund in 1991.
Vista Growth and Income had an inauspicious beginning, starting its investing on Oct. 19, 1987, the day the Dow Jones industrial average dropped a dizzying 501 points, or 22 percent. Despite that, the fund has consistently led the pack of diversified equity funds.
Mr. Tincher attended the University of Toledo on a golf scholarship, earning undergraduate and graduate degrees in business "after I realized that I couldn't put food on the table playing golf," he said. But he indulges his passion every weekend at the Stanwich Country Club, not far from his Greenwich, Conn., home. His handicap: 4.
While Mr. Tincher, now 37 years old, is willing to call his investment style "value- and momentum-based," he says he picks stocks using Chase's valuation model, evaluating characteristics like price-to-book value, cash flow and earnings momentum. Using the model, the fund's five largest holding now are Allied Signal, A.T.& T., Capital Holding, Dayton-Hudson and W.R. Grace.
The fund also owns a sprinkling of small- to mid-capitalization companies, which represent about a quarter of its portfolio. One of Mr. Tincher's favorites is Harnischfeger, which makes mining construction equipment and machinery used to produce paper. The company is a fairly cheap cyclical play on a rebound of the economy, he said, and an offer by a Dutch company to buy 10 percent of Harnischfeger's shares was just announced. Another favorite is Analog Devices Inc., which manufactures computer chips primarily for the telecommunications industry.
 
Oakmark Fund
Best Over Last 12 Months
Manager: Robert J. Sanborn
The Oakmark Fund (800 476-9625), which last year was second to the Fidelity Select Savings and Loan Fund among all equity funds, has kept up its momentum, and ended as the top general equity fund for the 12 months ended this quarter, with a return of 42.5 percent.
Behind Oakmark's success is the patience of Robert J. Sanborn, who runs the $620 million fund with what he calls an "eclectic long-term value philosophy." The 35-year-old manager joined Harris Associates of Chicago, Oakmark's sponsor, after working with the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio from 1983 to 1987 and started Oakmark in August 1991.
"If things go well, it could be the last job I'll ever hold," he said
Mr. Sanborn says he likes to think of his investments not as stock-picking but as "buying a piece of the business" for five years or more.
The fund's turnover was a miserly 34 percent last year, roughly one-third the annual turnover of all stock funds. Mr. Sanborn says he is trying hard to get that down to 20 to 25 percent.
The excess buy-and-sell activity in 1992 was the result of too many stocks reaching their sell targets, he said. The defining characteristic of the fund is its value approach. Oakmark tries to buy companies that sell for 60 percent or less of what Mr. Sanborn estimates is their true value, then sell them when they reach 85 percent of value.
Trading decisions are based on his view of what a company is worth, revised each quarter, not changes in its stock price.
Infrequent trading helps him meet another goal: minimizing capital gains, commissions and other costs.
Mr. Sanborn says he also looks for companies whose management holds most of its personal wealth in company shares. (Yes, he keeps the bulk of his own net worth in Oakmark.)
Diversification is not a goal because more holdings increase the odds of producing an average performance, he said. Right now 20 stocks account for 70 percent of Oakmark's value, with the balance split among 30 more issues. The fund's largest holdings are mostly contrarian plays.
Its biggest, Philip Morris, took a pounding on Wall Street yesterday plunging $14.25, or 22 percent, to $49.875, after it cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes, endangering its profits. All the tobacco companies are also under pressure because of the increased anti-smoking pressure emanating from the White House.
The rest of his top five are Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company; Martin Marietta, a military contractor that may benefit from industry consolidation; Total, a French oil company, and De Beers, the South African diamond company.
Mr. Sanborn earned a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth and an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago. He and his wife, Louise, live in Evanston, Ill.
 
American Heritage Fund
Heiko H. Thieme
Best in Last Quarter
Manager: Heiko H. Thieme
Despite record levels in the market, the party isn't over yet, says Heiko H. Thieme, who runs the American Heritage Fund in New York (800 828-5050), the best-performing general equity fund in the first quarter of 1993, with a return of 18.6 percent.
American Heritage was a $1 million fund that was the worst in the industry, based on its five-year record, when Mr. Thieme took over on Feb. 1, 1990. Under his stewardship, it has become a $32 million champion, although it is still small by fund standards.
What strategy has he used? None, Mr. Thieme (pronounced TEEM-uh) insists. "My conclusion is to use common sense," he said.
Plus hard work. "I use 18 hours a day for work, and I sleep only four hours a night," he said.
After considering a career as a magician, Mr. Thieme earned a law degree from the University of Hamburg and then pursued postgraduate studies at the University of California at Berkeley.
His next stop was at Wood & McKenzie, a brokerage firm in Edinburgh and London. After a stint with White, Weld & Company, an investment bank, he joined the Deutsche Bank Capital Corporation in New York as strategist and then as manager of United States equities.
Mr. Thieme, 49, calls his approach "stock selection plus management of cash." The latter now makes up 15 percent of his portfolio.
He holds what he calls "Dow wallflowers," like I.B.M., Boeing and Philip Morris, and loaded up heavily on the latter yesterday morning as its share price plunged. But the fund's strong performance in the first quarter reflected investments in Evergreen International, a Canadian software company whose customers include the Internal Revenue Service; Triton Energy, a Dallas company that recently announced a major oil find in Colombia; British Petroleum, and International Fast Food, an American company that holds the franchise in Poland for Burger King.
He gives stocks that are in disfavor one to three years to turn around but will take profits when a stock shoots up. That partly explains the fund's recent high turnover of 600 percent, compared with 90 percent for the industry.
About 12 percent of his fund is invested in Senetek, a British biotechnology company, which is traded over the counter in the form of American depository receipts. While Senetek is now trading at less than $3, Mr. Thieme says he thinks it could reach $20 because of two forthcoming products: a formula that the company says shrinks wrinkles and another that it says treats male impotence. He also likes the Fairfield Bank and Trust Company, a small bank in Fairfield, Conn., where he has lived for the last 13 years. He says it is a cheap stock -- trading now at under $1 -- that is poised to profit on a turnaround in residential real estate.
Mr. Theime and his wife of 16 years, Corinne, have three children.

Switching From Bonds
Q. My wife and I are retired. Two years ago we bought three-month Treasury bills when they were paying 6 percent. Currently they are paying 3 percent or less, and as they start to come due for reinvestment in the next two months we are considering switching to no-load fixed-income mutual funds that pay monthly dividends that average 6 percent. What are the risks?
 BEN NEELAND, Bergenfield, N.J. 
 A. A reasonable move with a different element of risk. "If interest rates rise, the value of the mutual fund shares fall," said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago. "And you can't simply hold it to maturity and get your principal back. My opinion would be to look at an intermediate-term U.S. Government mutual fund, which will produce higher returns with only a small amount of increased risk. An alternative is to simply go into U.S. Government notes, perhaps three- and four-year maturities."
 
 
 
Global Bond Funds
Q. What is the current outlook on global bond mutual funds, especially short-term?
 PAUL SCHWARTZ, Manhattan
A. The outlook is bullish, said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal & Company. He's been looking at these international bonds funds and is very bullish short-term for particularly Germany, France and Denmark, in part because he foresees a series of interest rate cuts in Europe. "However, I am less bullish on Japan and the U.S. In the U.S., it would appear that the bulk of the move in bond valuation has already been accomplished, while Japan has already cut its discount rate 2 1/2 percentage points and is preparing to spend more than $100 billion to stimulate its economy. With all that, the country surprisingly continues to run a big surplus, suggesting that interest rates in Japan will not move much lower either."
 
 
 
Schedule B, Not D
Q. Does the I.R.S. require that every check written on a money-market mutual fund be listed on Form 1040, Schedule D, for 1992?
 MICHAEL M. MEYERS, Upper Montclair, N.J.
A. No, says Robert F. Lee, vice president for corporate taxes at Advest Inc., a securities dealer. "The fund is revalued daily; consequently redemptions are on a cost-basis price. It is not considered a sale as with other mutual funds. The interest you receive is considered a dividend and as a result is entered on Schedule B under dividend income."

HEADLINE: Unemployment Dips Below 10% in New York City

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
Mainly as a result of fewer people seeking jobs, the unemployment rate for New York City fell to 9.6 percent in March from 11.3 percent in February, according to Government data released yesterday. It was the first month since last April that the rate has been below 10 percent.
For New York State, a brightening employment picture -- mainly outside New York City -- helped the rate fall to 7.3 percent, from 8 percent in February. It was the lowest rate since October 1991. 
 New Jersey's rate crept up to 8.3 percent, from 7.8 percent the previous month, showing that a sustained job recovery has yet to take hold. Connecticut's March jobs data have yet to be released.
 
Problems Persist
 "In New York City, employment recovery is still more of a future hope than a current reality," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Job recovery is still hostage to a very extensive restructuring and downsizing that is coursing through the New York City economy."
The bureau adjusts the employment data for New York State and New Jersey to smooth out the statistical impact of seasonal factors like fluctuations in hiring and layoffs in industries like retailing and construction.
While the bureau does not seasonally adjust the city's data, economists in the office of City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman do, and they said the adjusted rate had fallen to 9.5 percent in March, the lowest since October 1991.
The number of employed city residents rose in March by a scant 5,000 from February, to 2,987,000, according to the Federal estimates. The number of unemployed residents seeking or available for work fell by 60,000, to 319,000.
Discussing New York State's job market, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, "After many months of idling, the state's economic engine shows some signs of coming to life."
He said employment had improved, particularly in service industries, which have added some 50,000 jobs since last summer. "You're also seeing a bit of strength in the wholesale and retail trades and the finance sector," he said.
There were 7,985,000 employed New York State residents in March, an increase of 127,000 since December and up 39,000 from February. The number of unemployed fell to 629,000, from 688,000 in February.
In New Jersey, the number of employed residents fell to 3,597,000, down 12,000 from February. The number of unemployed rose 19,000, to 325,000. "The problem is not that things are getting worse in New Jersey, it's that they are not getting better," Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
Connecticut's job market "is still in the process of bottoming out," Mr. Ehrenhalt said. The unemployment rate fell in February to 6.7 percent from 7.5 percent in January. But job cuts by military contractors and aerospace companies seem to be offsetting gains in other sectors in Connecticut.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
For a Real Challenge, Try Picking Newsletters

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla

 BODY:
THE last time Mark Hulbert looked, 45 investment newsletters devoted themselves exclusively to mutual funds. More are sure to join the fray, which is good news for Mr. Hulbert, who publishes The Hulbert Financial Digest out of Alexandria, Va., and is in the business of evaluating how well investors would do if they followed the advice of the people who sell newsletters.
In 1984, only 3 of the 41 letters he tracked -- 7 percent -- were exclusively giving advice about buying and selling funds. Today, 45 of the 140 investment newsletters monitored by Hulbert specialize in mutual funds -- 32 percent of the total. 
 Notably, it does not seem to matter whether the investment newsletter writer is recommending stocks, bonds, funds or pork-belly futures. Regardless of what investment angle they are recommending, few advisers manage to beat the market.
Mr. Hulbert reviewed the performance of 17 mutual fund newsletters that have been in existence since January 1987 to see how well these veterans have done. By examining a period that began before the stock market crash (and ended Feb. 28), Mr. Hulbert was able to see which fund letters could do better than the overall stock market in bad times as well as in good.
Of the 17, 3 managed to do better than the Standard & Poor's 500, a widely watched index of the overall stock market that was up 124.2 percent in the period covered by the review. That means 14 did worse than the stock market.
But as any newsletter editor will tell you, there is more to investment advice than beating the averages. (You wanted to make money, too? Didn't anyone tell you the 1980's are over?) And mutual fund newsletters today are offering something for everyone.
Investors might not beat the stock market averages by following the No Load Mutual Fund Selections & Timing Newsletter, whose investment recommendations gained 32.5 percent since Mr. Hulbert began to follow it in January 1990. But they might get a little religion from the editor, Stephen L. McKee, who quotes from the Bible below each table of contents.
Indeed, other fund-letter editors are also appealing to investors' devout sides. Sound Mind Investing bills itself as "the financial journal for today's Christian family"; its citations range from Ecclesiastes to Abraham Lincoln to Karl Marx. There's no track record to report, however, because Mr. Hulbert began to follow Sound Mind only two months ago.
Another letter combining profits and prophets is Funding Your Future, whose editor, Martin Kennedy, signs off each issue with a "God bless you, Martin."
Perhaps some other letters could use a little help from the Lord. The Sector Funds Newsletter, 17th of the 17 letters in the review, gained 28.2 percent in the six-year period, not even a quarter of the gain in the S.& P. 500.
Growth Fund Guide, ranked 16th, gained 32.3 percent in the period studied. Neither managed to beat even the 44.6 percent ultra-safe return of Treasury bills.
If fund letters are all over the map in performance, they are equally eclectic when it comes to their opinions about what will shape the market. Every nut case (the other guy) and reasonable investor (you, of course) can find an adviser whose opinions reflect their own.
On the matter of President Clinton's economic program, for example, Fidelity Insight said in March that "Wall Street may be overreacting to President Clinton's economic program."
Don't agree with that point of view? Try the Closed End Fund Digest, whose March headline read: "Say It Ain't So, Bill."
Mr. Hulbert noted that fund followers, more than stock, bond or commodity advisers, feel compelled to do a little editorial padding because there isn't all that much to tell readers after an initial call to buy fund A or sell fund B.
"A lot of these letters like funds for all the right reasons, but then they discover that funds don't have all the excitement they'd like," he explained.
But investors want a little entertainment along with the dull-but-useful advice, so editors provide political commentary, question-and-answer columns, summaries of what other newsletter writers are saying and bashing of newspaper and magazine writers.
They also use a little ink to tell you where they think the overall stock market and economy are going, and the conclusions from the best letters, right now, may not be what investors were hoping to hear.
The Mutual Fund Strategist, which ranked second in the Hulbert study, warned in its most recent issue, "It is very possible that the U.S. could be on the edge of a financial and economic collapse that is directly related to the Federal debt."
Fundline, another newsletter that outpaced the stock market over the last six years, said recent stock market rallies were the result of "uninformed buying usually done at market highs."
Advice from these top-performing publications costs from $96 a year (Fidelity Monitor) to $149 (The Mutual Fund Strategist). Among the newsletters that did not keep pace with the averages, prices run from $89 a year to $187. It does not always hold that you get what you pay for -- if making money is the reason you are subscribing in the first place.

HEADLINE: GOLD;
After a Dismal Year, A Strong First Quarter

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
GOLDBUGS, rejoice! Lexington Strategic Investments, a gold fund, topped the charts among all mutual funds in the first quarter of 1993, rising an eye-popping 72.7 percent. But envious investors should remember that Lexington was the worst performer of the 3,000-plus mutual funds in 1992: the value of its shares plummeted 61 percent.
All gold funds -- there are 32 others that invest in a mix of gold mining stocks and bullion -- are famous for their roller-coaster rides. Share prices swing violently up and down, but mostly down; gold funds are notable as the only stock fund category to lose value in the last decade. 
 Historically viewed as a refuge in international turmoil, gold has lately failed miserably in that role. The funds lost value during the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in 1990, the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and the unsuccessful Russian coup in the summer of 1991.
Gold has also been viewed as a hedge. Because it does not move in tandem with stocks or, especially, bonds, gold can dampen the volatility of an investment portfolio. "If you have a lot of money tied up in bond funds with maturities of more than five years, you need a hedge," said Gerald W. Perritt, who edits The Mutual Fund Letter in Chicago, perhaps 5 to 10 percent of a bond portfolio.
The Benham Group, a mutual fund company in Mountain View, Calif., that specializes in bond funds, added a gold fund to its mix in 1988 "to provide ballast for the portfolios," said James M. Benham, the chairman. The Benham Gold Equity Index Fund has assets of more than $200 million, the only gold fund to gain assets steadily in the last five years.
While most analysts are disgusted with gold, contrarians have emerged.
One raging gold bull is Michael Metz, chief investment strategist for Oppenheimer & Company in New York. Not a true goldbug -- he doesn't hoard canned foods to await the end of the world -- Mr. Metz says, "The end of disinflation plus declining opportunity costs translate into a huge bull market for gold."
He said the highest short-term interest rates in history worldwide had finally started to tumble, reducing the penalty for holding gold -- an asset that does not produce income -- for individuals and central banks. The long deflationary period worldwide is over, given the long-term strength of the American dollar, the recession in Europe and the slowest Japanese economy in decades. Rising inflation would lift gold prices.
Investors who want to own gold, either as a hedge or for potential appreciation, have a lot of homework to do. The usual way to select a fund, evaluating its long-term performance and risk, is irrelevant.
"Because the gold market has been in a slump for most of these funds' existences, the ones that boast the best track records are generally the group's most conservative entrants," said Eileen M. Sanders, an analyst for Morningstar Inc., a mutual fund researcher in Chicago. So the long-term top performers probably will lag if gold takes off. "It's more important that investors determine what role they want a gold fund to play in their portfolio than it is for them to look at past performance," she said.
For a pure play on gold prices, the best bet is Lexington Strategic, Ms. Sanders said. The no-load fund specializes in South African gold shares. Its share price is extraordinarily volatile, so prepare for a rough ride.
Two more conservative bets on gold are Fidelity Select Precious Metals and Minerals and United Services World Gold, which balance their volatile investments in South African gold with shares in companies in North America and other gold-producing areas, she added.

A Musical Asks: What Price a Pair of Sneakers?

BYLINE: By JON PARELES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, March 31

 BODY:
It's hard to imagine a more well-intentioned project than "Bobos," the latest production by the American Music Theater Festival. The "jazz, pop, rap musical," which opened Wednesday night and runs through April 11 at the Plays and Players Theater here, is about the brutal choices facing inner-city teen-agers, and it updates theater music with the riffs and beats of hip-hop. The combination of relevance and contemporary rhythm seems intended to draw a younger audience than most musicals do, while reminding the regular theatergoing crowd that there are people struggling just a neighborhood or two away.
"Bobos" aims to cut back on escapism while providing the satisfactions of an old-fashioned musical, from love songs to celebratory dance sequences. The program says "Time: The Present" and "Place: The City," and with props including knives, guns and a crack pipe, "Bobos" flaunts a certain grittiness. "This is the real deal," the opening number insists. 
 The show's composer, James McBride,is a former journalist, and "Bobos" grew out of a story he wrote about sneakers as ghetto status symbols. In "Bobos," Alfred (David Hughes) gets a pair of Brand X sneakers, derided as "bobos," for his 13th birthday. "You can't be down if you're dressed up like a clown," the other kids jeer, so to make the money for a spiffy pair of Nikes, Alfred gets involved with a violent, drug-dealing gang. He commits petty crime, get shaken down by corrupt cops, even lights up a crack pipe. Can his community -- including an adoring female cousin, a derelict with an unlikely secret, a Caribbean chicken chef and a benign quartet of rappers and break-dancers called the Autobots -- save him from evil ways? Since "Bobos" is a musical, the answer is obvious.
The show's creators, including the director, Bertin Rowser; its choreographer, Monica Johnson, and its costume designer, Felix Cochran, have kept an eye on the moves and fashions of current hip-hop: the aerobic routines and hunching swaggers, the bright baggy clothes and backward baseball caps. Broadway musicals like "The Wiz" and "Dreamgirls" have often capitalized on current black pop for a jolt of vitality, and "Bobos" uses rapping and break-dancing to punctuate a score that also includes more conventional show tunes. The gang members spout a little of the misogyny of current gangster rap, though the production steers clear of four-letter words. As at hip-hop concerts, the raps don't always make it clearly through the sound system, the fault of a combination of technical lapses and imperfect enunciation.
Mr. McBride and the librettist, Ed Shockley, dabble in pop-soul ballads, gospel, calypso, jazz and elaborate ensembles that interlace rapping and crooning. Some of the unexpected musical combinations work out well. But there are odd shifts of tone, and at times songs sound as if they had parachuted in from another show. Love duets between Alfred and his vibrant cousin Doris (Mesha Millington), with titles like "Until You Believe," not only proffer Broadway platitudes, but also sound peculiar when sung by 13-year-olds.
Often, secondary characters get the best songs, particularly Gerald (Armsted Christian), the derelict, who has a show-stopping gospel-blues tune in Act I and in Act II both a jazzy number akin to "Moody's Mood for Love" and a tender, dynamic ballad. James Wise as Brick, the head of the Autobots, can rap with playful rhythm and precise articulation, then pull off fancy (if somewhat dated) break-dancing spins and leaps.
The show's other musical center is Skooley (Robert Christophe), the gang leader who lures Alfred with the promise of easy money. Skooley, perhaps named after the pioneering Philadelphia gangster rapper Schooly D, recalls Sportin' Life in "Porgy and Bess"; he has better clothes, more authority and more fun than the virtuous characters. While gang members wear the gold chains and knit caps of characters from "New Jack City," their music comes straight out of "West Side Story": finger-snapping, insinuating tunes in which Skooley is suavely implacable. He holds all the cards; his decisions, more than Alfred's, govern the plot.
When the bad guy takes over a supposedly uplifting story, it's a sign of trouble, and "Bobos" eventually founders on its disparate ambitions. It starts out as a relatively realistic tale of an inner-city teen-ager, drawn by materialism into crime and drugs, not realizing he's gotten in too deep. But the traditional musical depends on a story line with conflicts that can be resolved by one big tuneful number, like the one in "Bobos" that advises, "Stick to the right/even when there's no light." Poverty, unemployment, crack addiction and crime aren't so easy to change -- that's why hip-hop has evolved such fragmentary, relentless structures -- and by allowing such bleak realities into the foreground, "Bobos" raises the stakes beyond what it can deliver.

HEADLINE: Aid -- and Trade -- for Russia

 BODY:
President Clinton, in a speech this week to newspaper editors, laid out sound reasons for America to aid Russia. Aid, especially if targeted to benefit ordinary Russians, could help move reform forward. And an economically prosperous and democratic Russia would open an era of international cooperation, generate trade opportunities and, by paving the way for steep defense cuts, free billions for civilian investment. Think of aid, Mr. Clinton urged, not as charity but as an investment in peace and economic growth.
He will carry this message to Boris Yeltsin today when they begin a two-day summit meeting in Vancouver. He will pledge about $1 billion in U.S. aid next year, and the prospect of a much larger package -- perhaps $30 billion -- from the Western allies after they meet later this month in Tokyo. 
 The historical record -- from Germany and Japan after World War II to Mexico in the 1980's -- shows that foreign aid can help reform succeed. It can do the same in Russia.
Russia needs Western money so it can stop printing mountains of rubles that it uses to finance huge deficits and to extend credit to bankrupt state enterprises -- a policy that has brought the country to the brink of hyperinflation. The West can help the Yeltsin Government summon the courage to cut back these subsidies by setting up a safety net for laid-off workers, promoting private enterprise and creating a fund to stabilize the ruble. A stable ruble is a necessary step toward encouraging trade and foreign investment.
But there's another way the West can help Russia that won't cost taxpayers a dime: Buy Russian exports. Trade is a key to prosperity.
Russia boasts rich natural resources and a highly educated work force. It can produce valuable products at low cost. But Russia can't sell if the West won't buy -- and so far, Western Europe and the U.S. have thrown up one obstacle after another.
Russia wants to export space satellites and launch vehicles. But an official of the U.S. Commerce Department recently called on Russia to raise its prices. The West, she said, wouldn't be interested in buying satellites that are priced "below market" to disadvantage U.S. companies.
But exactly whose market did the official have in mind? It is hard to imagine Russian companies selling below cost because their costs, especially wages, have collapsed along with the economy to appallingly low levels.
The European Community restricts imports of Russian fish. The U.S. and the European Community slap duties on Russian uranium and aluminum. Germany and Finland unilaterally shut out Russian textiles.
Yes, the West will want to protect itself against sudden, traumatic surges in cheap Russian exports. But the barriers so far erected are too tall -- costing Russia perhaps $3 billion in lost sales. That's a whopping amount for a decimated economy. The West should err on the side of leniency -- negotiating rules so that Russia can trade itself toward prosperity.
It's hypocritical, if not masochistic, for Mr. Clinton and other Western leaders to ask taxpayers to fork over billions of dollars in Russian aid while at the same time standing in the way of Russians willing to work their way out of poverty. Trade is no substitute for aid -- at least now. But it's necessary if Russia is to turn into the peaceful, prosperous nation Mr. Clinton envisions.

HEADLINE: How New York's Insurance Law Benefits Small Businesses

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As an insurance broker serving small corporate clients, I understand Jeffrey Heath's alarm in "Small Businesses Need More Time for New Insurance Law" (letter, March 24) at having his health insurance canceled and his concern over spiraling costs.
However, the New York State Health Reform Act, effective April 1, is neither the culprit nor the cause of high insurance rates. 
 Many insurance companies have opposed this law and spent a lot of money mailing scare literature to policyholders, threatening exorbitant rates. The law requires insurance companies who write health insurance in this state to stop discriminating against small business. Mr. Heath's carrier chose not to play by the new rules. Although 10 insurers pulled out, more than a dozen remain, serving the New York City area.
Mr. Heath complains that his insurance rates have increased to $11,500 for a family. I have good news for him. Because of the new law, his company is free to change insurance carriers any time, no questions asked. He can find a variety of insurance plans on the market as of April 1, ranging from $5,000 to $7,000 for a family, with lower rates for single parents and childless couples. Single rates are $2,000 to $3,000 a year.
Had he seen his rates increase to $12,000 a year because of a serious medical condition on staff, he would previously have been a captive of his insurance carrier, unable to move the plan. Under the old rules, a serious illness on staff had the effect of locking in the entire company and throwing away the key. No longer can insurance companies refuse to pay bills on pre-existing conditions when employees change insurance plans.
My office has 80 group plans in force. About 20 percent of our clients will have their rates reduced April 1. Another 25 percent are getting rates that represent an increase of less than 10 percent over 1992 renewal rates. Most of the rest will move to carriers offering affordable rates, not prevented by medical histories or pre-existing condition exclusions.
Had the new insurance law allowed us to comply as all policies became due for renewal, beginning April 1, Albany could have avoided wholesale panic.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Digital Is Leaving Headquarters Building

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MAYNARD, Mass., April 2

 BODY:
In a move that even its chief executive termed surprising, the Digital Equipment Corporation announced today that it was abandoning the 146-year-old Mill building that has been its headquarters since the day it was founded here on Sept. 4, 1957.
Robert B. Palmer, Digital's president and chief executive, said that the decision to leave the 1.1-million-square-foot building, which Digital owns, was part of a continuing effort to cut costs at the beleaguered computer company. Digital, which has not turned a profit in two years, lost $2.8 billion in the 1992 fiscal year and reported a $74 million loss for its fiscal second quarter ended last December. 
 Mr. Palmer said the recommendation to move the 2,100 Digital employees out of the building had been made by a company task force overseeing huge facilities reductions. The 200 employees who make up the corporate headquarters staff will be relocated to another Digital facility in Maynard this summer. The remainder will be transferred over the next 18 months to two years to other facilities, primarily in eastern Massachusetts.
 
'I Would Have Preferred to Stay'
 "It was quite a surprise to me, frankly, that they recommended moving," Mr. Palmer said. "Personally, I would have preferred to stay. But when you look at the numbers, we are attempting to maintain maximum employment, and you just have to make a business decision. It does sadden me."
Digital estimates it will save up to $15 million annually by moving operations out of the brick and beam Mill building, which sits astride the Assabet River in this tiny suburb 20 miles west of Boston. The former woolen mill, built in 1847, supplied wool cloth and blankets to the Union Army during the Civil War.
Mr. Palmer said Digital would work with the town of Maynard and state officials, along with private developers and the Federal Government, to find a use for the building that "will generate the maximum economic and social value."
Kenneth H. Olsen and Harlan Anderson, former M.I.T. research engineers and Digital's co-founders, moved into 8,680 square feet of rented space in the mill in 1957 to start the computer company. What attracted them to Maynard was the rent of 25 cents a square foot, which included heat, parking and a watchman's service.
Digital eventually grew so large that it took over the entire building, which it eventually bought in 1974. The building's confusing layout, twisting staircases and hallmark clock tower came to symbolize Digital to thousands of employees, customers and area residents.
Mr. Palmer insisted the decision to leave the Mill did not represent an attempt to cut ties with the past. Since he took over after Mr. Olsen was forced out by the board of directors last July, Mr. Palmer has initiated dramatic changes throughout the corporation and many longtime Digital executives have left.
Digital continues to trim its work force and facilities. The company has cut 8.7 million square feet of space since 1989, resulting in annual savings of $219 million. Digital also laid off approximately 3,200 employees in the fiscal third quarter, which ended March 31, bringing its total number of employees to under 100,000.

HEADLINE: Haiti's New and Old Rich

BYLINE: By Herbert Gold; Herbert Gold is author, most recently, of "Bohemia: Where Art, Angst, Love, and Strong Coffee Meet."

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
A few Sundays ago, I sat over a long lunch in a hillside mansion above Port-au-Prince, looking over the endless mountains and the wide blue bay. Drinks were served by silent black maids and waiters under trellises in a garden; then we moved indoors for seafood salad, fresh vegetables, fine French wines, sweets. My host and the other guests were light-skinned Haitians, army officers, business people, professionals of the sort who traditionally have gotten rich in Haiti and recently have gotten even richer.
One did a comic imitation of an arriviste trying to drink from a cup with a saucer and thinking the saucer was used to transfer coffee from the cup to the mouth. The black servants appeared not to notice the laughter; they remain invisible to the elite. In the 50's, when I lived in Haiti, a Government minister told me that, with a servant nearby, he could make love and find it no more embarrassing than having a dog or a cat in the room. This class is unhurt by the United States' embargo. It earns money off smuggling. It buys what it needs. Embargos do not apply to the profitable business of transporting drugs. 
 The conversation turned to politics, as it usually does in Haiti, where the Government offers theater of the absurd for the few and oppression for the many. Over coffee back in the garden (saucers properly used) a kindly old gentleman with a fine-boned face listened silently. Suddenly, he turned and whispered, "I very much want President Aristide to come back."
The remark surprised me.
"So the very first day," he continued in his precise and cultured voice, "I can kill him, kill him."
The previous afternoon, I had driven to the village of Petit-Goave, where builders were hammering away at the flotilla being constructed on the beach. One jobless man said, "If God doesn't come back tomorrow, I sail to Miami."
He believed police informants were listening and his life was at risk if he pronounced the dangerous name. By God he meant the exiled President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. He had gathered money for his passage. The boat-builders make money. The captains of these death vessels make money. The bribe-receivers among local officials make money. And if the boat people are stopped and returned, the police who confiscate the few dollars given them by the Red Cross or generous Americans make money.
Amid the chaos, money is pouring through Haiti in surprising quantities. Hundreds of millionaires live in Petionville, the cool and flowered suburb above Port-au-Prince. Many are the traditional mulatto elite; many are newly enriched.
Since I first arrived in Haiti 40 years ago, it has been a case of the same old same old -- only worse for ordinary people.
The tribe of profiteers grew under the Docs -- Papa and Baby; it is expanding under the military-thug regime fronted by Marc Bazin, the suave former World Bank official. The onetime Mr. Clean has surrendered to the dream of power, like so many. While his army backers trample human rights and the economy, the boat-builders, drug-runners, smugglers and military extortionists are joining the old millionaires.
The roads have gone from atrocious to nearly impassible, so the fashion has shifted from Jaguars and Mercedes to powerful Japanese four-wheel drives. The embargo means soap comes from the Dominican Republic or France rather than the U.S. So what? The French make good soap. Anyway, near St. Valentine's Day a store near the National Palace was filled with red heart-shaped boxes of American chocolates, French truffles, gift baskets of wine, cheese, goodies. What embargo?
Before I left, the first contingent of United Nations and Organization of American States human rights observers arrived. They were unarmed, of course, young people with a mission to . . . observe. "The voyeurs are here," said a cheerful friend. The millionaires, content with the regime, welcome these visitors. "Is it true they are being paid six or seven thousand dollars a month? I love it! They will eat, they will drink, they will spend. Wonderful for the economy!"
The economy of the wealthy who crowd the Petionville restaurants is no worse than it was under the Duvalier kleptocracy. Owning land, exploiting labor, stealing from the treasury or providing airstrips for drugs -- it's all just money. History seems to be on their side just because it always has been.
The philosophy of government can be expressed as: Don't fix the roads (we have four-wheel drives); don't worry about security or an honest police force (we have private guards). Poking holes in the embargo offers another road to profit.
What do the U.N., O.A.S. and the new Administration in Washington want? They say they want democracy and the return of President Aristide. Everyone without a gun wants him back; everyone with a gun wants to shoot him. While the standoff continues, those with guns grow richer and those without guns look to the boats on the beach at Petit-Goave.
At the party that Sunday, a man in an embroidered caftan -- observant, sophisticated, smiling -- said: "Do not worry so much, my friend. We are confident injustice will prevail."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
A Nicotine Fit Brings Down The Bull Market

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
EVERYONE knew that the Marlboro Man was lethal to many of his customers. But who thought he could kill a bull market?
Whatever else Philip Morris's decision to cut prices may signify, it marks an end to the era in which big consumer product companies were viewed as growth stocks on Wall Street. The belief was that such branded companies could push up prices forever, thus raising profits even if consumption was growing slowly or, in the case of tobacco, shrinking. 
 But things have changed. Now, as Philip Morris put it, companies must fight for market share in "a highly price-sensitive market environment."
The collapse in Philip Morris shares -- the price fell 23 percent on Friday -- came on the same day the Government's latest employment report provided solid evidence that the economic recovery is for real. But with competitive pressures depressing profit margins, even a good recovery may not bring the big profit gains that Wall Street is expecting.
That is a scary idea for stock owners in large part because expectations of a lot of good news, and very little bad news, have gone into prices. At the peak last month, the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index had a dividend yield of 2.73 percent. (Now, after Friday's plunge, it is 2.83 percent.) Arnold Kaufman, the editor of S.& P.'s Outlook newsletter, points out that only seven previous times in the index's 66-year history has the yield gone under 2.9 percent, the most recent one being in 1987. In every case, a sharp fall in stock prices has followed.
Many believe this time is different. Low interest rates, they say, mean that low dividends are to be expected and that the history of dividend yields is not important. The public, which has been buying stock mutual funds at a record pace, has nowhere else to invest. And as the economy grows, dividends will rise. Abby Joseph Cohen and Steve Einhorn, the Goldman Sachs strategists, talk of a "silly putty" recovery stretching out for years.
It is perhaps comforting that Friday's fears were a bit confused -- rising gold prices and employment threaten inflation, while the Philip Morris announcement implies the opposite -- and calmer reflection may make things look less bleak. Perhaps the bond market, which fell Friday on the employment report, will bounce back, and traders will feel better.
Or maybe they won't. Philip Morris was the stock most owned by institutions, a core part of every portfolio. A lot of money managers got off to a horrid start in the second quarter and seem destined to underperform the market averages.
Neat explanations of market tops are seldom available until after the fact. If a top has passed, there will be talk of the Clinton Administration's anti-business hostility to drug and tobacco companies, or perhaps of a turn in interest rates.
But the real lesson may be simpler. When stocks are expensive -- as the low dividend yield shows they are now -- it is risky to bet on them staying that way for a sustained period.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
A Capital Quarter for Real Estate

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
CALL it Wall Street's nod of approval for the new occupants of the White House: a 3.3 percent rally for equity funds in the first quarter. At that pace, there would be double-digit returns for the year as a whole.
The only losers were health-and-biotechnology funds, which fell 14.1 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J. The other 22 stock fund categories showed gains ranging from a low of eight-tenths of 1 percent for environmental funds to a high of 21.7 percent for gold, which gained on dwindling supply after being last's year worst performer. 
 But aside from a small group of funds investing in Japan (up 17.2 percent because of local factors) the quarter's next biggest winner was the real estate category, up 15.1 percent in a showing that well reflects investors' improving sentiments about the economy in a Clinton era.
Several factors are at work. A number of successful initial public offerings by real estate investment trusts have helped the sector regain Wall Street's interest. A tightening supply of housing -- because of a slowdown in construction after the overbuilding of the 1980's -- has pushed up rents. In addition, many pension managers who had been badly burned by real estate investments in the 1980's are moving back in, bidding up prices. Most real estate fund managers expect returns of 15 percent to more than 20 percent in the next few years.
"The real estate industry and real estate stocks in '93 are where the United States stock market was in '81 -- we've had a bad period and now there's good times ahead," said Barry A. Greenfield, who manages the Fidelity Real Estate Investment Portfolio. Proof of growing confidence: his fund's assets have soared from $150 million on Jan. 1 to $450 million.
Sam Lieber, manager of the $10 million Evergreen Global Real Estate Fund, sounds a note of caution, however. Those buying for yield only, he said, are focusing solely on dividend rates and ignoring the value of the underlying real estate. They could scamper off, to the detriment of the market, he said, "if interest rates pick up over the next year, particularly on the short end."
Mr. Greenfield of Fidelity, a confirmed bear from 1986 through last September, says he has shifted since then from health-care real estate investment trusts and cash into more aggressive commercial and industrial real estate. And while REIT yields have tumbled this year as prices rose, they still average 5.5 percent -- a nice premium over the 2.5 percent paid by money markets.
Mr. Greenfield cautions that while he expects this to be the start of a three- to seven-year upturn, in the short run real estate stocks are now somewhat pricey and a temporary slowdown may be in order. He advises buying on the pullbacks.
His fund's three largest holdings are REIT's: Weingarten Realty, a dominant developer in Houston; Federal Realty, which owns properties in Maryland and Virginia, and Carr Realty, a new company that owns office buildings in Washington.
In February, Allen A. Parker, who runs the $25.4 million U. S. Real Estate Fund, added a chunk of California thrift institutions, which now account for 8.7 percent of the fund, and national mortgage bankers, 15.5 percent, to his homebuilders and REIT's portfolio. Mr. Parker believes the California recovery will be gradual, and prices of savings and loans should be first to jump as home-buying interest revives. Two favorites: Great Western Financial and Golden West Financial.
And mortgage bankers, he said, should gain market share at the expense of failed savings and loans, especially given the wave of homeowner refinancings expected this spring. He also invested 2.5 percent of the fund in Ethan Allen, a furniture store that first offered shares in mid-March, because a lot of the cash freed by lower mortgage rates is being invested in furnishings.
While the $45 million Templeton Real Estate Trust can invest worldwide, half of its holdings are in the United States, partly because REIT's still offer much better yields than short-term securities. Adding projected growth, returns could reach an annual 16 percent over the next couple of years, said Jeff Everett, who runs the fund from Nassau.
Mr. Everett, who took over in December, likes American Health Properties, which operates psychiatric facilities in the Northeast and yields 8 percent, and Nationwide Health Properties (6.4 percent), which operates nursing homes across the United States.
Unlike most of his colleagues, Mr. Lieber manages his Evergreen Global fund solely for capital growth, not yield. Slightly less than one-third of the fund is invested in the United States, 26 percent in Europe and 39 percent in Asia. His biggest holding is Alexander's, which he says is using its valuable properties to transform itself into a real estate company.
PRA Real Estate Fund, $95 million in assets, and Cohen & Steers Realty, $99 million, the two funds with the highest returns in the latest quarter, cater mainly to institutional investors with $100,000 minimums. As of last week, however, Cohen & Steers is also offered through Charles Schwab & Company with a $2,000 minimum (to rise on May 28 to $10,000). PRA expects a similar link soon.

HEADLINE: A Summit to Discuss Mere Money

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia

 BODY:
In the years that superpowers reigned supreme, summit meetings were awesome spectacles. Nations great and small would watch spellbound as two men with the power to pulverize the planet met to impose limits on their rivalry and delineate their empires. Their every utterance, their every handshake, their every signature had instant and fateful impact on millions of lives, and set billions of dollars in motion.
The summit of Presidents Clinton and Boris Yeltsin is clearly of a different order. Sure, the hype is still there -- the "Bill and Boris" T-shirts, the entwined American and Russian flags, the miles of television cable strewn through some cavernous convention center. But giving American money to Russia, no matter how ardently the need is argued, just doesn't have the mind-focusing quality of a nuclear holocaust. 
 Alas, that does not make the job any easier for the two Presidents at their meeting in Vancouver this weekend. On the contrary, they are meeting precisely because managing a world stripped of the discipline of the cold war is proving at least as difficult as managing the cold war.
The point was dramatically underscored by Eduard A. Shevardnadze not long ago. Being the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union was far easier, he said, than trying to lead his war-ravaged homeland of Georgia. As a Soviet leader, he had only to make a decision for the potent apparatus of the Kremlin to set it in motion. In Georgia, he could barely keep tabs on the wars breaking out all over the place, much less manage them.
Tell me about it, Mr. Yeltsin might be tempted to say. Only last week he narrowly escaped ouster at the hands of a Russian Congress that has persistently worked to undermine his reforms and his rule. His decrees are increasingly ignored in the provinces. "In principle," as the Russians say, he still carries around a nuclear button and commands the biggest army in the world, but whether he really controls any of this is anybody's guess.
That political shakiness is the main reason Mr. Clinton is seeing Mr. Yeltsin this weekend. The American President has argued that if reactionary forces do take charge in Russia, the price of a revived confrontation will be far higher than the cost of trying to prop up Mr. Yeltsin.
That may be so. But Washington is also learning that power is not what it used to be. When Communism succumbed, there was a naive sense that everything would organically settle into a "new world order," in which the soothing forces of the market and political freedom would triumph under the paternalistic tutelage of the sole superpower. But the survival of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, the savagery in Bosnia, the brush fires in Central Asia and the Caucasus, Ukraine's new taste for nuclear power -- these are only some of the nasty manifestations set loose by the erosion of superpower dominance.
In many ways, Russia's wavering over its course has been the most difficult new problem. At first, the post-Communist Russians seemed uniformly enthusiastic to join a new world order, replete with a market economy and a democratic government. In retrospect it should have been obvious that a nation largely ignorant of the free market, unschooled in democratic fair play and accustomed
 
 
to global influence would not so easily settle into the role of obedient apprentice.
The problem, still unresolved, is that so much depends on what direction Russia chooses. Right now, this includes the problems of Bosnia and Iraq, both of which a militant Russia could inflame. Beyond those lie the shape and cost of Western defenses, the security of Europe and Asia, the very stability of any new world order. Until Russia resolves its power struggles, everything stays in flux.
In addition, Washington has had to accept that its ability to influence events in Russia is limited. The cold war conditioned Americans to ascribe great moral power to their teachings. A few years ago, Russians seemed desperate to hear the message of freedom, and their Government equally desperate to block it. This persuaded many Americans that once heard, their voice would play a major role in putting Russia on the right track.
So it came as a surprise that American views were not universally embraced, that many Russians were convinced that their country was not suitable for American prescriptions, that there were even Russians who resented and resisted American pop culture and American conceptions of free enterprise and private property.
 
More Promised Than Delivered
 The question was not only money, though the fact that the West promised far more than it delivered did not help. The very notion of aid proved intolerable for a people accustomed to being treated as co-arbiter of the world's affairs. And the perception that the West was trying to block Russia from its traditional markets, especially for selling arms, only added to the resentment.
These themes were clear at the Congress last week. Reactionary deputies assailed Mr. Yeltsin for "selling out" to the West. Mr. Yeltsin himself acknowledged the error of putting too much faith in Western aid. And legislators who are normally warm to the West argued against trying to tailor aid to Mr. Yeltsin's political problems. "To give tactless support to one man is counterproductive," said Yevgeny Ambartsumov, chairman of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs. "It is only seen as interference in the internal affairs of a great nation that finds itself in a sad state." These are the sort of things that neither Eisenhower nor Khrushchev had to worry about when they held the first postwar summit meeting at Camp David in September 1959. And that is what makes the meeting of Messrs. Clinton and Yeltsin in Vancouver qualitatively different.
At Camp David, the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union had only to issue a few carefully measured signals to achieve their ends. In the heightened atmosphere of the cold war, a few small agreements -- scientific and cultural exchanges, new disarmament talks -- were enough to foster "the spirit of Camp David" and to change the entire course of relations.
The great summits of those years were ends in themselves, carefully choreographed symbols whose power was in the spectacle of two leaders meeting, rather than in the content of their talks. Most agreements they signed were concluded long in advance.
There is some of that Vancouver, to be sure. The very fact of the meeting is an indisputable part of the message for Mr. Yeltsin's supporters and detractors. But the ritual dance of summitry is not the whole point; these are not chiefs meeting only to raise a peace pipe, but wary partners trying to help each other get a grip on a confusing world. What happens in Vancouver is not the culmination of a process, but the process itself. That may reduce the glamor, but certainly not the substance.

HEADLINE: Clinton the Conservationist Thinks Twice

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
For reasons that nobody in the White House can fully explain, President Clinton has trouble with trees. When Mr. Clinton was a young governor in Arkansas in the late 1970's, his proposal to end clear-cutting in the state's forests attracted such disdain it contributed to his only defeat for re-election.
Last week, on the way to a forest conference to help decide the fate of the last great stands of timber in the Pacific Northwest, Mr. Clinton stumbled again. Days before arriving for the meeting in Portland, Ore., the White House announced that the President had cut a deal with Western Democratic senators. The compromise with the senators, who had threatened to oppose Mr. Clinton's budget, derailed a bid to roll back destructive land-use practices in the West that had been subsidized for a century by the Government. 
 The announcement was seen by environmentalists as a betrayal. Some House members felt upstaged because they had already voted on the land-use package and hadn't been consulted about changes. The most vocal protest came from Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, who is the national environmental movement's most influential ally on Capitol Hill. "It shows exceptionally poor political judgment," said Mr. Miller. "It was the imperative of deficit reduction and shared sacrifice that would have allowed the necessary changes to be made. They have given away the advantage they had to get the policy changes enacted."
But as the week ended, it became clear that the issue was far from dead. While the White House clearly had suffered a setback, it landed upright in a position in which it has found itself with increasing regularity: compromise. Faced with the reality that everyone's an environmentalist until change comes to the backyard, Mr. Clinton blinked but persisted, though on a less ambitious course.
He gained commitments from the Western Democrats to support administrative and legislative proposals that would improve the management of Western lands. Though the steps would not be nearly as drastic as those proposed by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, they would begin to halt Government-subsidized grazing, mining, and logging that leaves scars on the land. And he used the forest conference that he had organized in Portland to shore up his credentials as a conservationist and to tell timber interests, in effect, that they would have to change with the times.
But there was no question that the criticism had stung. The White House worked hard to make nice to bruised Congressional egos and to convince the press that it had not sold out. "The environmentalists and their friends in Congress say you can't win unless somebody else loses big time," said a White House aide. "And there are some in business who still think environmental protection is nonsense. That is not the way environmental policy is being shaped by Bill Clinton. After years of arguing this issue from the poles on the right and the left, and getting nowhere, we're trying to move the debate closer to the center."
It is a message that even Mr. Clinton's two closest advisers on environmental policy -- Vice President Al Gore Jr. and Interior Secretary Babbitt -- may have had trouble grasping. Although both Mr. Gore and Mr. Babbitt have talked about marrying economic and environmental goals, their first actions as members of the new Administration suggested a strict conservationist agenda. In December, even before he took office, Mr. Gore promised to block the opening of a hazardous waste incinerator in Ohio. But three weeks ago, the White House overruled him and cleared the $160 million plant for commercial operation this month.
 
United in Portland
 For his part, Mr. Babbitt, the former chairman of one of the country's most influential environmental groups, had been riding the Western range for weeks touting a plan to protect public lands by requiring miners, loggers and ranchers to pay much more for Government-owned resources. After being warned by Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat from Montana, that regional loyalties supplanted party politics on such issues, Mr. Clinton easily compromised.
Mr. Clinton's decisions on the incinerator and land-use policy embarrassed Mr. Gore and Mr. Babbitt. But if there was any lingering discord, it was not visible in Portland on Friday. Flanked by the Vice President, the Interior Secretary and several other Cabinet members, President Clinton listened intently for hours to loggers and environmentalists and suggested that the age of big timber was ending.
Though nothing was decided in Portland, the week had tested Mr. Clinton's campaign promise to make economic and environmental concerns compatible, and had produced some lessons. Mr. Clinton signaled to business executives that it is he, not Mr. Babbitt or Mr. Gore, who commands the environmental agenda. And he signaled to environmentalists that their concerns were important enough to put near the top of his domestic priorities. Finally, said White House aides, Mr. Clinton, following the pattern he had established with daylong sessions on the economy and health care, was trying to broker a new approach to environmental policy-making through consensus.
Mr. Babbitt, who had been shot out of the saddle, rallied to his boss's defense. "Bill Clinton promised change and there will be change," he said last week.
The question is how much change and whether it will make any difference. As with Mr. Clinton's other daring early proposals, such as ending restrictions on Haitian immigration or opening the military to homosexuals, the President had promised much more on the environment than he was capable of quickly delivering.
In February, Mr. Clinton announced a proposal championed by Mr. Babbitt to radically change a century of practices that promoted development of the West at Government expense. Mr. Clinton billed the plan as an effort to raise revenue and reduce the deficit, though the extra revenue would amount to less than $1 billion over five years. The real importance of the plan, tucked into the Clinton budget package, was to manage millions of acres of Government land more carefully.
The Administration proposed to more than triple the grazing fees, now $1.86 a month for a cow and her calf, on 280 million acres. Interior Department officials said the intention, in addition to providing revenue, was to dissuade ranchers from abusing the land. The White House wanted to raise the price of timber from national forests and end the practice of offering it below the market price. And Mr. Clinton proposed royalties on gold, silver and other minerals that had been mined on Federal land under a law that had remained virtually unchanged since 1872.
The plan was hailed by environmentalists as a breakthrough in ending a century of Government-sanctioned destruction. But across the West, well-organized, influential groups of landowners, ranchers, loggers and miners raised a fuss and found supporters in senators from Mr. Clinton's own party.
The most powerful of those lawmakers is Senator Baucus, who is the new chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Like two Democrats before him, Georgia's Senator Sam Nunn, who opposed homosexuals in the military, and Louisiana's Senator John Breaux, who had questions about Mr. Clinton's budget, Mr. Baucus found an opportunity to both solidify his support at home and to alert the White House that he was a player to be reckoned with .
With Mr. Babbitt, a former governor of Arizona, just getting his feet under him at the Interior Department, and without a single specialist in Western resource issues in the White House, the Administration was unprepared for Mr. Baucus's attack. After all, Mr. Baucus enjoyed the dependable if unenthusiastic support of national environmental groups in Washington. The Montana lawmaker had battled to prevent development of oil wells in Alaska and protect endangered species.
But Mr. Baucus also has deep roots in a way of life dependent on the land -- and an abiding interest in being re-elected. His family owns one of Montana's largest ranches. Last year Mr. Baucus sponsored legislation to cut a million acres of Federal forest in his home state, and he has consistently opposed increases in grazing fees and protected mining companies.
 
Western Heft
 Thus, Mr. Clinton's environmental intent became tempered by regional politics. Led by Mr. Baucus, a group of Western Democrats trooped down to the White House in late March after the House had voted on the plan, and negotiated a new deal with the President and Thomas F. McLarty, the chief of staff. According to White House aides who were close to the negotiations, Mr. Baucus made it plain that he had enough support in the Senate to scuttle Mr. Clinton's entire budget package, the centerpiece of his young Presidency.
Mr. Baucus demanded that the White House drop the fee increases from the budget plan. He also asked for an adjustment to the energy tax that Mr. Clinton had proposed to reduce its effect on farmers and industries in the West. According to a White House aide, Mr. Baucus then promised to support the Administration's effort to change some of the exploitive land-use practices in the West by seeking smaller fee increases through legislation and administrative efforts.
On Monday , the White House agreed to the demands. But before Mr. McLarty and other White House officials could explain the changes to members of the House or the press, Mr. Baucus sent a press release to Montana newspapers.
Trying to make the best of diminished possibilities, Mr. Babbitt said he would hold public hearings after which the Department of the Interior would establish grazing fees without legislation and would encourage better grazing practices by tying the fee levels to the quality of range management. Fees would be highest for ranchers who caused the most damage. And Mr. Babbitt said the President would support legislation sponsored by Mr. Clinton's friend from Arkansas, Senator Dale Bumpers, to amend the mining law to require royalties and to establish measures for cleaning up mining wastes.
"The politics of this was not handled in the best of fashion," said Representative Mike Synar, a Democrat from Oklahoma and chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on environment, energy and natural resources. "But we're going to get to the same place, just in a different manner. The fees on grazing, timber and mining are going up."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Gridlock In the Peace Business

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: BONN

 BODY:
With President Clinton, President Boris N. Yeltsin and practically every European leader in between tied up in knots over domestic problems, the United Nations, the NATO alliance and other international bodies have been hovering close to uselessness.
Last week, the most frustrating spectacle continued to be the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There, Serb commanders repeatedly blocked United Nations forces trying to deliver relief to starving Muslims in the east, but backed by neither the international will nor the power to insure peace. The parliament of Bosnia's Serbian nationalists rejected even a conditional acceptance of a peace plan already approved by the country's other two warring factions. One of the authors of the peace plan, former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance, ended his months of effort with little success, handing over his United Nations mediating role to Thorvald Stoltenberg, Norway's Foreign Minister. 
 In Brussels, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreed to enforce a United Nations-ordered air-exclusion zone over Bosnia, NATO's first operation in a war zone since its creation in 1949. Yet the Serbs have besieged Muslims mainly from the ground, with artillery and other forces, and hardly from the air at all. NATO remains unable to agree on the makeup of a ground force that could back up a peace accord if it is ever reached.
The international near-paralysis underlying such events results largely from the way both the world's crises and the domestic preoccupations of nations are intertwined. It is nothing new that chaos, or for that matter peace, often reigns through a complex interaction of national motivations; what is new is that the complexity is no longer obscured by the simplicity of bipolar confrontation and proxy wars.
It is certainly clear that solving conflicts is not necessarily any easier now that the United States and Russia are usually pulling on the same end of the rope instead of being at odds. The recent political turmoil in Russia demonstrated that.
Many diplomats believe that consistent pressure on the Serbs by the Russians, their cultural and diplomatic allies before communism, is needed for any settlement in the Balkans. But that pressure has dropped noticeably, diplomats say, since President Yeltsin's conservative adversaries in the Congress of People's Deputies started gaining ground while criticizing him for being too pro-Western.
No country is an island, to take John Donne one step further. Europe and the United States are willing to do what they can to help Russia bring about economic and political change, because if Russia disintegrates, so could world order, and with it most hope of using the cold war bonus to rebuild the West's suffering economies. Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher said the stakes were "enormous" at the meeting between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin in Vancouver this weekend.
 
Leadership Void
 But the real tests for leadership are in places like Kuwait and Bosnia, and in the Balkans the West so far is getting a failing grade. Frustration over Bosnia helped prompt the American intervention in Somalia late last year.
With leadership lacking in Europe, Europeans have still not fully grasped the implications of the United States' decision, confirmed last week, to reduce its troop strength to 100,000 by the mid-1990's. Germans still ask Americans what Mr. Clinton would do if the Russians menaced Lithuania, or if Hungary and Romania started fighting, not realizing that the answer is: very little. From now on, American administrations will expect Europeans to first try to solve their problems by themselves.
But the war in the Balkans has pointed up the inadequacy of the European Community as an instrument of solving such conflicts. The resulting demoralization has domestic consequences, as well. Some commentators suggested that it was one reason for the Socialist defeat in France's elections last month. The past, meanwhile, weighs heavily on the strongest European power, Germany, which seems hopelessly divided over whether its soldiers can participate in peacekeeping missions.
The Germans sent cargo planes to drop supplies to Bosnian Muslims last week, for example, but bucked to a constitutional court the question of whether it was legal to leave German crew members on NATO surveillance planes after the Security Council voted to enforce the flight ban over Bosnia.
In Europe and the former Soviet Union, what has happened is a dangerous resurgence of 19th-century nationalism, with conflicts breaking out all over just where many of them left off in the 1930's when the first, Wilsonian attempt at a new world order failed.
What the effect of continued impotence will be on other world crises, from the Middle East to east Asia, is not hard to see. North Korea last month showed its contempt for international control over nuclear development by renouncing the non-proliferation treaty. Iraq has long shown similar disdain, and South Africa recently announced that it had secretly developed a nuclear arsenal and then dismantled it, all without any effective outside controls.
Muslim fundamentalism is a mounting concern in many countries, also with a connection to Western impotence in Bosnia. The Arab world has long believed that the West has a double standard for Israelis and Palestinians. If Muslims come to believe that the West wrote off Bosnia's Muslims, allies like Turkey could turn away from the West, with negative strategic consequences.
Sooner or later, unresolved resentments come home to roost. Muslim terrorists bombed the World Trade Center in New York City to protest what they saw as American complicity in humiliations in the Middle East. Everything is connected, and sooner or later Europe and the West may have to pay a price for their impotence in the Balkans.

Seattle Has a Plan: Urban Renewal for Fun

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
It is the Fourth of July in the year 2000, and another half-million people have moved to Seattle. Every gas station has an espresso machine subsidized by the city and Boeing machinists can work out of their homes.
In a summer mist, civic leaders cut the ribbon to Seattle's contribution to the dawning century: a grand new park in the center of the city, lined by apartments, town houses and open-air restaurants. A salmon stream runs down the middle of the manicured greenway and all the people who live in its vicinity have cellular phones. 
 Welcome to Seattle's dream du decade. A mix of indigenous goofiness and back-to-the-future practicality, the Seattle Commons is the centerpiece for this city's plan to build a series of "urban villages" over the next 20 years.
The urban village term comes from Mayor Norm Rice, who has broken with the city's no-growth tradition and proposed that Seattle should welcome newcomers rather than make fun of them. The Commons concept, which sprouted from the musings of a local newspaper columnist, has been embraced by the city's leaders as a jump-start out of a civic midlife crisis.
Most American cities are in a reactive posture, trying to hold onto the basics of public safety, fire protection or keeping the bridges from falling. Seattle, a city that spent its first 140 years tearing down its hills, filling in its tidelands, building the West Coast's largest office towers and recycling anything that wasn't bolted down, has never given up the self-improvement kick. The Space Needle, perhaps the city's most lasting icon, started as a doodle on a cocktail napkin in the infant Space Age.
As the metropolitan area has gone through unrelenting growth, with the suburbs pushing to the edge of the Cascade Mountains, Seattle's reaction has been to bemoan urban sprawl while carefully guarding its unique single-family neighborhoods. Under Mr. Rice, the city is openly welcoming growth, so long as it is channeled into one of the Mayor's half-dozen or so urban villages.
 
Suburban Flight
 The areas targeted for hyper-growth are underused or rundown semi-industrial areas stalled by commercial indecision. The Mayor's plan would bring parks, transportation hubs and other amenities in the village area while encouraging new high-density housing through zoning changes. Traffic is just bad enough to make political leaders bet that many people, especially families, are ready to pick in-city living over the suburbs.
In fact, families are willing to move back to most American cities if enough of the trimmings of suburban life -- safety, a good park, retail outlets -- are nearby, say urban experts. "The problem is when you're starting something new, on such a grand scale as Seattle is trying, you have to create really nice neighborhoods very soon," said Allen Altshuler, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
Mr. Altshuler, who has studied Mayor Rice's urban village concept, said the plan has tremendous risks because of its scope. "But I think it can be done," he said. "Seattle is probably one of the few places that could make it happen because it has a tradition of in-city living and very little tradition of racial polarity."
The biggest of these urban villages would be the Commons, 470 acres of residences, small businesses, a school, a marina and a big park running down the middle. It would connect Lake Union to the downtown retail core and to the Seattle Center, where the major theater, ballet and opera companies are based.
Mayor Rice describes the Commons, and urban village concept in general, as "A community where people can shop, play and go to school, all within walking distance of where they work." The description may fit Manhattan -- and when you add the park, which is being billed here as a small version of Central Park, the comparison is even closer. But what the urban village visionaries are really trying to do is create a suburban feel inside the city.
But many critics of the park -- most notably the Seattle Times, the largest private land owner in the Commons -- have said the city could end with up little more than a very expensive new high-crime area.
Enter the cellular phone option. Many of the prominent early backers of the Commons are young, wealthy entrepreneurs who made their billions in high-tech. Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, has given the project a $20 million line of credit to buy land for the park. Another backer, Craig McCaw, head of McCaw Communications, the cellular phone giant, donated $1 million. He said he would like to see the Commons as a wireless community, where residents and workers would carry a phone at all times. Wireless phone service would cost about the same as normal phone lines if it was installed at one time, Mr. McCaw has said.
Mr. McCaw said his donation was not contingent on cellular phones being a part of the project. But it added a new dimension to the crime debate; backers said Commons residents would be only a press of 9-1-1 away from police help during evening strolls in the new park.
Mr. McCaw also has his corporate headquarters in the Commons neighborhood. He took a poll of his employees and found that most of them would like to walk or ride their bikes to work.
An aversion to the automobile is one of the major precepts of the urban village design. "Work, live, play -- all without a car, that's the driving vision behind the entire project," said Joel Horn, the director of the Commons project.
In presenting the Commons plan to the city, the backers wrote: "People are beginning to see the costs of abandoning the city -- traffic, long commutes, sprawl, the loss of rural open space and the loss of a sense of community. They are starting to return to the cities, not just to do business, but to live. The Commons is a response to the growing appetite for city living."
Several big obstacles are ahead of the Commons backers, who say they would like to open the park on July 4, 2000. One problem is cost. Now in the hands of its private founders, the Commons would become a city project next year if the Seattle City Council votes, as expected, to make it part of the mayor's urban village master plan.
It could cost up to $400 million to acquire all the land and build the park and its amenities. The money is supposed to come from short-term bonds and tax money from an anticipated rise in adjacent property values.
In theory, private developers will build the housing once the area is rezoned. But a variety of market conditions, not the least of which is the Boeing Company's plan to lay off 28,000 workers in the Seattle area over the next two years, could keep developers on the sidelines. Without the housing, the urban villages are nearly worthless, say critics.
But optimism around this project flows like the rain water that is supposed to drain the city's hills and recirculate into the salmon stream in the new park. Seattle, forever remodeling itself, seems incapable of unpacking its boxes and settling in.

Voting on The Budget: The Easy Part's Over

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
So far, the votes in Congress on President Clinton's economic program have been little more than tests of party loyalty. Democrat ranks held last week, and the House and Senate approved the outline of the President's five-year budget plan without the vote of a single Republican.
Now comes the hard part. 
 When Congress reconvenes the middle of this month after a break for Passover and Easter, the lawmakers will immediately begin dealing with what Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, calls "areas of quicksand" -- politically sensitive topics like Social Security and Medicare, military spending and energy taxes.
The Clinton Administration is under no illusions that its honeymoon can continue indefinitely. "I know it's going to be a lot tougher when you get to the details," said Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, one of the President's chief political and legislative strategists.
Mr. Clinton has already shown his willingness to back down to keep Democratic votes in line. To retain the support of several Western senators, he agreed last week to remove from the budget his proposal to raise fees for grazing and mining on Federal land. For farm-state lawmakers, he proposed that ethanol, the fuel made from grain, be exempt from energy taxes. For New Englanders, he agreed that the tax on home heating oil would be no higher than the tax on natural gas. He also scrapped his proposal to limit the cost-of-living increases in the pensions of civilians retired from Federal jobs.
But other matters are so central to the President's goal of simultaneously lowering the deficit and generating more public and private investment that they cannot easily be set aside. These are some of the ones likely to cause the most political fireworks:
Taxes on Social Security benefits Single retirees with annual incomes above $25,000 and couples with incomes above $32,000 now pay income taxes on up to half of their Social Security benefits. Mr. Clinton would tax up to 85 percent of their benefits, a proposal that would raise nearly $25 billion over the next five years.
Mr. Clinton argues that everyone must pay a price for deficit reduction and that only the richest 20 percent of retirees have enough money to be affected at all.
But Republicans and many Democrats maintain, with some justification, that the proposal makes a mockery of Mr. Clinton's campaign pledge not to raise the income taxes of anyone but the wealthy. A pair of retired schoolteachers with pensions totaling $30,000, dividends and interest of $5,000 and Social Security benefits of $15,000 could hardly be considered wealthy, but their taxes would rise by more than $550 a year.
Energy Tax To raise nearly $50 billion over five years, Mr. Clinton would place a new tax on nearly all fuels. When fully in force, it would raise the price of a gallon of gasoline by 7.5 cents and increase the typical homeowner's electricity bill by $2.25 a month. Treasury officials say that the average energy bill of a family of four making $25,000 a year, now $2,242, would rise by $105. But the cost of almost all consumer products would also rise, so the total cost to families of modest incomes would be considerably greater.
Mr. Clinton has said that this is the fairest tax that would raise enough revenue. Mr. Rostenkowski said he thought the members of his committee, who have the first crack at tax legislation, would "swallow hard" and accept the tax. But many important Democratic senators from oil-producing states, including J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, chairman of the Energy Committee, have vowed to try to defeat it.
Investment Tax Credit Mr. Clinton's proposal to give businesses a tax break on the investments they make in machinery and equipment would cost more than $20 billion over five years and would be offset by an increase in the corporate tax rate to 36 percent from 34 percent. The tax credit has little support in Congress, and executives in most businesses say they would rather keep the lower tax rate.
Mr. Rostenkowski and his counterpart in the Senate, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, chairman of the Finance Committee, are at best unenthusiastic.
But Mr. Bentsen said the tax credit was an integral part of the President's program that would not be abandoned. "What the President is looking for," he said, "is the biggest bang for the buck, the best leverage for stimulating the economy, and you get that with the investment tax credit."
Military SpendingMr. Clinton wants to cut the military budget to $246 billion in the 1997 fiscal year from $273 billion now. Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the most important Democratic lawmaker on military matters, questions the wisdom of such a deep cut. But the main question here is not so much how the military budget will be received by Congress but exactly how the President and the Pentagon plan to bring it about.
The military budget for the next fiscal year, which was released last weekend, was called a "holding budget" by Defense Secretary Les Aspin. Details of just what cutbacks Mr. Clinton will seek in arms programs and troop strength await an assessment of the nation's military needs to be completed this summer.
Health Ultimately, Mr. Clinton's success or failure in domestic and economic policy will turn on his ability to develop and win enactment of a health-care system providing universal insurance coverage on the one hand and cost containment on the other.
Last week, Administration officials acknowledged that the original May 3 deadline for sending Congress the legislation would be missed and that the measure stood no chance of enactment before next year.
Mr. Rostenkowski, whose committee has jurisdiction over not just taxes but also health, said he thought it just as well that this year would be devoted to tax and spending measures and next year to the health system. The last time they talked about the health plan, he said he told the President, "This is going to take all your strength, all your attention, all your commitment."

Tourism's Latest Tough Sell: 'Waco, a Wonderful Place to Visit!'

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

DATELINE: WACO, Tex.

 BODY:
"You could say a hidden advantage to all this is that everybody now knows where Waco, Tex., is," says Elizabeth A. Taylor, the city official in charge of marketing Waco as a tourism and convention destination. "All this," of course, refers to the bizarre standoff between an armed doomsday cult and hundreds of Federal agents that has played out on the central Texas prairie near here for over a month.
Ms. Taylor arrived to take over as director of the Waco Convention and Visitors Bureau on Feb. 27 -- exactly one day before a shootout at the cult's compound left at least six people dead and, however unfairly to this city of 100,000 people, left the name "Waco" synonymous with guns, violence and religious fervor run amok. She was unpacking boxes when the news came on the radio. Some might see her timing as a monumental case of bad luck, but Ms. Taylor, 32, has exuberantly assumed her new duties as the challenge of a professional lifetime. 
 "There's no doubt about it," says Ms. Taylor, who has shown up at daily F.B.I. news briefings loaded with brochures, maps and helpful advice about everything from where to eat to where reporters and agents could buy, ahem, clean underwear as the siege stretched on. "I think that once it's over we have a real opportunity to turn some lemons into lemonade and really tell people about Waco's story."
Waco does have a pleasant story to tell. "First of all, we're conveniently located," she says. "We have beautiful parks and the Brazos River and 14 museums." She proceeds to name nearly all 14, ticking them off on her fingers with a flourish. "We're the home of Dr Pepper. You can take your kids to the Dr Pepper Museum and see where it all got started. You can have a Dr Pepper float at the soda fountain there.
"And then there's the Texas Ranger Museum, which is the all-time favorite here," she continues. "It just truly is the all-time favorite."
But Ms. Taylor is the first to concede that for now, Waco will have to contend with being the butt of Jay Leno's jokes. This brings up an observation on her part: the city's name is pronounced WAY-Co, not WACK-O. She has even been ribbed by colleagues in the tourism-promotion industry about having the toughest job in America, but she hardly seems fazed.
"I guess I've developed a pretty thick skin, mainly because of my name," says Ms. Taylor. Her parents always loved "Elizabeth" and, she says, never thought through the complications of giving their daughter the name of a famous movie star.
 
Liz and Dick, Sort Of
 "Usually when I meet people they go, 'Right. Sure. You're Elizabeth Taylor.' " But she just laughs along and can even offer one of those amazing-but-true stories to complete the punch line. When she was an undergraduate at North Texas State University in Denton, she worked for a while as a news announcer on a local radio where the disk jockey was a fellow named Rich Burton. "It was a real scream," she says -- an all-night jazz and news show with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. "The calls would come in, people were on drugs or they were drunk and they thought they were just hearing things."
Some people in Waco are outraged that the city is getting all the attention when the standoff is actually just outside the city limits, in an unincorporated part of McLennan County. But Ms. Taylor has urged them to be calm about that particular injustice.
Yet even as she and other city officials are fretting over the long-term damage to Waco's viability as a vacation or convention site, the short-term effect is just the opposite. The siege has kept hotels and restaurants jammed for weeks with reporters and law enforcement agents and may yet amount to the greatest economic-development initiative the city has seen. "I don't think anyone is reveling in the reason that you-all are here," says Ms. Taylor. "But the plain fact is that you-all are spending money in Waco."
Her most immediate headaches actually stem from the fact that too many people want to come here. Just last weekend, she barely managed to avert a major confrontation when hundreds of Shriners showed up for a golf tournament, only to find Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents sleeping in their beds. "So you've got some very persistent people here saying, 'Hey, we've got these reservations,' " Ms. Taylor recalls. Perhaps because city officials would prefer return business from the Shriners rather than from the camouflage-clad gun-toting agents, they let the Shriners prevail. "We very carefully relocated 40 rooms of Federal agents into other hotels," Ms. Taylor said.
But sooner or later, the standoff will end, the agents and the media will leave and Waco will need to address an image problem that Ms. Taylor's $220,000 advertising budget may not be able to overcome. Even now, her tourism representatives are having to field questions about whether it is safe to come to Waco, never mind desirable. The facts are that the standoff is miles from downtown and the F.B.I.'s biggest security problem lately has been religious fanatics trying to sneak into the compound. Still, people are worried.
 
Nervous Detours
 "We've had some inquiries from individuals who say, 'I've got to drive down to Austin or San Antonio for such-and-such, now if I stay on the interstate will I be safe?' " she says. "Because people don't realize we are not under siege, we do not have military blockades in the street."
Ms. Taylor grew up on a peanut farm in DeLeon (west Texas) and has managed tourist and convention bureaus in Georgetown (central Texas), Big Spring (west Texas) and Denton (north Texas). She majored in journalism but opted for tourism. "It's more fun helping people have a good time," she explains.
Ms. Taylor is not so worried about losing convention business because, she says, the people who plan them tend to be more concerned with hotel rates, the frequency of daily flights to Waco and other bottom-line questions.
"It's a standard set of questions, really," she says. "We're competing with Lubbock, we're competing with Midland-Odessa, we're competing with Abilene and Amarillo. We're competing with anybody who has a similar-sized facility."
There have been nervous jokes shared among city officials about running bus tours out to the compound when all this is over, turning the site into sort of a Ford's Theater of what will surely go down as one of the strangest episodes in the country's law-enforcement history. But Ms. Taylor doubts that such a strategy will ever be adopted.
"I don't know that there's any point to trying that," she says. "I think we're really trying to say, 'Okay, Waco's bigger than this. Waco can come out ahead of this.' "
And for Ms. Taylor, the $39,000-a-year-job in Waco has already evolved into more than just another line on her resume. "I guess it comes from me being a pretty adventurous spirit," she says. "My thinking is: Wow, this is going to be fun, kind of with a little dread but also with a little excitement. Boy, am I going to have another great chapter to add to my book -- that type of thing."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN VANCOUVER;
CLINTON PRESENTS BILLION TO YELTSIN IN U.S. AID PACKAGE

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 3

 BODY:
As President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia began their first summit meeting today, Mr. Clinton presented the Russian leader with some $1 billion in American aid programs intended to support Russian democrats and spur the Western allies to make Russian reform their top foreign policy priority.
Among the new or expanded programs in the package were loan guarantees to build apartments for demobilized Russian soldiers; loans for Russian entrepreneurs; medical supplies, food and grain assistance; funds to help the Russian Government sell state-owned industries, and technical advisers to help repair pipelines and oil wells and begin exporting again. 
 Mr. Clinton said the package was intended to help promote free-market skills on a grass-roots level in both Moscow and the Russian countryside, so the movement toward democratic reform would continue no matter who governs in the Kremlin.
 
Cold-War Laws Cited
 But while aides said the two men had hit if off personally, the leaders also voiced complaints on several issues. Mr. Yeltsin complained bitterly to Mr. Clinton about laws from the cold war era still on the books in the United States, like those that tie Russia's trading privileges with the United States to Moscow's relaxation of emigration restrictions, and laws that restrict American investment in Russian high-tech industries that have potential military uses, like communications technology.
Mr. Yeltsin argued that Russia's behavior has changed so fundamentally that these laws should be repealed. The Russian leader also complained about the collision of an American submarine with a Russian submarine in the Barents Sea two weeks ago, for which Mr. Clinton expressed his regret.
 
Russian Military Send-Off
 Mr. Clinton voiced his concern about the behavior of Russian Army troops based in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, where they have been accused of siding with a separatist movement, and about the pace of Russian withdrawal from the Baltic republics, which was suspended this week.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin arrived in Vancouver this morning. Mr. Clinton flew in from Portland, Ore., where he moderated a conference between the timber industry and environmentalists, and Mr. Yeltsin came from Moscow, where he was seen off by the country's military leadership in a signal that they would insure that no one would try to topple the Russian leader while he was gone for the two-day summit meeting.
Mr. Yeltsin, who just narrowly survived a vote to remove him from office by the Russian Congress last weekend, said he would be running the country "by telephone" and that the "nuclear button" was in safe hands.
The Vancouver Province newspaper greeted the two leaders with various irreverent headlines, including "Bold Boris Comes Cap In Hand" and "For a Look At Bubba and the Bear Try These Sites."
Security around the meeting sites was provided by 2,000 Mounties, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. They guarded all access roads; all manhole covers were sealed and all mailboxes and newsstands were removed.
 
Anthems in the Rain
 Mr. Yeltsin stepped off his Aeroflot jetliner into a pouring rain and brushed aside an attempt by aides to protect him with an umbrella. He stood ramrod straight in the downpour as the Canadian and Russian national anthems were played.
Shortly after their arrival, the two Presidents drove through the gray mist to the campus of the University of British Columbia, on a wooded promontory overlooking the Pacific. They were joined for lunch there by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada at the sprawling Mediterranean-style home of the university's president. Mr. Mulroney, speaking of Mr. Yeltsin, told reporters after the lunch, "He and the President seem to be getting along like a house afire."
After bidding farewell to Mr. Mulroney, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin took a brief walk through a wood of shaggy evergreens to the university's Museum of Anthropology and then sat down to their first one-on-one session, with only note-takers and interpreters present.
What was most striking about this get-together was the degree to which both men appeared to be looking over their shoulders at their domestic fronts, as much as across the table at each other.
Mr. Clinton, apparently worried about polls showing many Americans opposed to increasing foreign aid for Russia at a time when they are being asked to cut domestic programs, promised that the United States would not try to solve Russia's problems alone.
"I want America to act, but America cannot and should not act alone." Mr. Clinton said in his regular Saturday radio program, broadcast as he arrived in Vancouver. "Just as we mobilized the world on behalf of war in the gulf, we must now mobilize the world on behalf of peace and reform in Russia."
 
Dangers of Too Much Aid
 Mr. Yeltsin, who has been under attack by Communists and nationalists in the Russian Congress who say he has sold out to the West, said on arrival that while his country needed Western help, too much of it would not be good because his opponents would only use it to paint him as a lackey of Washington.
Asked by reporters if $1 billion in new American aid was enough, Mr. Yeltsin said: "Too little is not good because it is not enough to enable you to solve problems, whereas too much also could be bad because it can be used by the Communists to target us. The opposition will say we are enshackled by the West. What we need is an optimal figure that will enable us to keep the reform afloat and not let the Communists come to power."
Mr. Yeltsin was not shy about letting Mr. Clinton know that without him the prospects of Russian reform would be greatly diminished, and therefore the West could not allow him to go home empty-handed.
"As long as there is President Yeltsin in power in Russia," Mr. Yeltsin told reporters on his arrival, "then definitely the reforms will continue."
 
A Long-Term Mission
 But while Mr. Yeltsin was obviously preoccupied with his own political future, Mr. Clinton repeatedly stressed in his arrival remarks that aiding Russia must be viewed as a long-term enterprise that cannot be judged in the short run, or according to the fate of any one person.
Aides said Mr. Clinton is trying to lead the American public to think differently about Russia, so the public will not want to withdraw aid in the midst of what are expected to be many false starts, back steps, and bumps along the way.
"I believe that what you will see building up over the next few weeks is a very significant effort to support a long term process in Russia," Mr. Clinton said. "It is important that the efforts be targeted to lasting and tangible benefits to people in Russia. I look at this as a long-term effort."
 
First Session on Economics
 American officials said the first one-on-one session was devoted entirely to economics, and began with Mr. Clinton sketching the broad outlines of what his Administration was ready to do now to support the Russian democratic movement. The President, aides said, outlined a three-pronged American approach.
While the White House held a briefing on the meetings, the Russians canceled the one they had planned.
Mr. Clinton said the package should be viewed as the American contribution to a much broader effort by the major Western democracies "to support a long-term process of developing Russia," which his Administration is orchestrating and which will become fully apparent in coming weeks as more countries announce aid. Already in the last two days, Britain and Canada have announced increases in aid to Russia, and after Mr. Clinton spoke by telephone with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan on Friday night, American officials expressed optimism that Japan would give more, too.
The first element in the American package outlined by Mr. Clinton involved roughly $1 billion in aid, drawn from funds already appropriated by Congress for fiscal 1993, either specifically to support Russian reform or from the international aid budgets of various government departments that will now be redirected for this effort.
This package included the following:
*Housing loan guarantees for the construction of several thousand housing units for Russian military officers stationed in the Baltic states, who have been reluctant to leave because they have no housing in Russia.
*An initiative that will provide the Russian Government with funds over three years to help sell off state-owned factories to the private sector. American business and accounting advisers and farmers will also be sent over to help these new private businesses in capitalist practices.
*An enterprise fund that will provide seed loans to Russian entrepreneurs.
*New agricultural grain credits to help the Russians obtain American wheat, despite being in default for failure to pay back $625 million in grain credits from 1991-92.
*Food, medicine and other nonmilitary assistance from surplus American military stocks, directed particularly at areas outside of Moscow.
*A technical assistance program to help repair and improve Russia's dilapidated natural gas and oil industry, so it can earn more foreign currency.
 
A List of Priorities
 The second element of the package consists of programs that the United States believes could also be helpful to Russian reform, but for which the money has not yet been appropriated by Congress for fiscal 1994.
While Mr. Clinton's fiscal 1994 budget calls for spending only about $700 million on aid programs for Russia and other former Soviet republics, he told Mr. Yeltsin that he was ready to go to the Congress and seek even more money because of the urgency he attaches to the success of Russian democracy.
The third element of the package included the President's thoughts on the types of multilateral assistance that could be provided to Russia -- including debt relief and currency stabilization funds -- through the Group of Seven major industrialized democracies and institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
Mr. Clinton said Washington had discussed with its allies a package that could amount to as much as $30 billion in the form of aid to Russians who would be unemployed by the sell-off of state-owned industries, money to underwrite the importing of new machinery and spare parts and a $6 billion fund to help stabilize the inflation-ravaged Russian ruble.
Mr. Clinton, aides said, discussed with Mr. Yeltsin how far the Russian was ready to go in getting control of his country's runaway money supply, which would be crucial to how much outside financial institutions would be prepared to do. The President said he would convey Mr. Yeltsin's views to the Group of Seven, whose finance and foreign ministers will meet in Tokyo on April 14 and 15 to discuss Russian aid.
According to Russian officials, Mr. Yeltsin asked that Mr. Clinton convene a meeting of the Group of Seven heads of state no later than May to undertake this multilateral aid package, because to wait any longer could be dangerous for Mr. Yeltsin politically.
Asked if he was satisfied with the outcome of the summit meeting so far, Mr. Yeltsin said tonight that he was "very pleased."

From the day the first parcels of relief aid were unloaded from American military aircraft at Moscow's international airport more than a year ago, Russians have been puzzled by what they see as the West's fumbling attempts to help their beleaguered country.
First, amid a blaze of publicity, came shipments of food, ranging from baby food to American military rations left over from the Persian Gulf war. Then the Group of Seven major industrialized nations patched together a complex $24 billion financial aid package intended to help Russia build a vibrant economy. 
 Now, after a year of watching a stream of Western consultants troop through Moscow, Russians are asking what happened to the $24 billion that was promised them last year. Some question whether it ever came at all.
 
Aid Missed Mark, Russians Say
 The answer, as Western economists have tried to explain at great length, is "no" and "yes, but. . . ." From the West's point of view, Russia's failure to meet payments on its loans has in effect been hidden assistance.
The problem was that the $24 billion package never focused adequately on meeting the country's needs, some in Russia argue. Instead it consisted of a hodgepodge of old loans, a few give-away programs and new credits contingent on conditions that proved impossible to meet.
Only a little more than half of the $24 billion was actually delivered, although some Western Governments and institutions say the figure is closer to two-thirds. The difference between what was promised and what was given arose mostly because loans and a $6 billion ruble stabilization fund planned by the International Monetary Fund were contingent on harsh austerity measures that were not adopted. These measures included bringing monetary and budget policies under control.
Of the aid that has been disbursed, only a small portion has been in the form of outright give-aways. Last year, Russia received 476,000 tons of food, valued at $700 million, and $200 million worth of medicine donated by public and private sources.
 
Aid or Business Deals?
 The core of the aid package was an $11 billion commitment for credits issued by several Western countries, of which about $8 billion was actually distributed in 1992.
To many Russians, these credits were not so much aid as business arrangements that helped the lending nations find markets for their goods more than it helped Russia pay for them. Most of these credits were granted to the old Soviet Union. They are not distributed in cash, but in the form of food, industrial equipment or other items purchased by Russia from the lending countries on normal commercial terms.
Because of its debt problems, Russia has not been in a position to obtain commercial bank loans to buy these commodities. In that sense, the credits offered by the West are a boon. But not surprisingly, many Russians are less than grateful for what they see simply as an opportunity to buy things from their benefactors.
"Most of these credits are a prepackaging of old programs, circulated by the lending countries for their own domestic purposes," said Denis Kiselyov, chief of the analysis unit at the World Bank offices in Moscow. "It is very difficult to qualify them as aid."
 
Biggest Chunk Goes for Feed
 For instance, $3.5 billion -- the single biggest loan in the package -- is a credit from the United States to buy American grain, to be used mostly for livestock feed, as part of a program that has been around for decades.
Other foreign credits have been used to purchase machinery, equipment and spare parts. How the money has actually been spent is difficult to track. For the most part, the credits were allocated to Russian industries, just as they were in the days of Gosplan, the monster state planning agency of the old Soviet state.
This summer, in an effort to introduce market economics into the system, the Russian Government required factories receiving the parts or equipment to pay back the foreign credits themselves, with interest.
Mr. Kiselyov said this approach has been resisted by some crucial industries which, through powerful lobbies, are able to plead for special treatment.
Over the last few years, Russia has been the beneficiary of numerous special aid programs, not all of them included in the $24 billion package. Since 1989, Germany has provided about $48 billion in cash and credit guarantees -- much of it to buy Moscow's acquiesence to the unification of Germany. Most of the aid has been used to build housing for returning Soviet military officers. The United States is also providing $800 million to help the Russian Army dismantle and dispose of its nuclear arsenal.
In the meantime, private programs have been established, of which the most spectacular is the international Science Foundation, founded by the American financier George Soros, which in the next two months plans to distribute $10 million to 20,000 scientists in Russia and the other former Soviet republics.
When the Group of Seven industrialized nations first came up with the $24 billion figure for Russia, they also proposed to deliver another $20 billion to the other states of the former Soviet Union. But so far the other states -- with the exception of the three Baltic nations -- have received no money because they continue to use the Russian ruble as their currency and therefore are not in control of their monetary policy.
One of the main reasons for the failure of the International Monetary Fund to distribute its loans is that there has been a running feud between the Government and the Central Bank, which is answerable to a legislature dominated by opponents of Mr. Yeltsin's economic reforms.
For example, the Central Bank has resisted pressure to curb loans and subsidies that have fueled Russia's 25 percent monthly inflation, and only recently was it persuaded to release critical information about its operations, a prerequisite for the next round of negotiations with the monetary fund.
Western creditors say that a major part of their aid to Russia has been a set of marathon negotiations to reschedule the payments due on $80 billion in past debts, and on Friday the Western governments reached an agreement to let Russia postpone $15 billion worth of payments falling due in the next year.
To the West, granting Russia a more relaxed repayment schedule amounts to a huge break. But for average Russian citizens, debt reschedulings, loans, credits and stand-by agreements are abstract notions.
 
Russian Resentment
 What Russians see, instead, are Western food products -- cooking oil, butter, dried milk -- that have trickled into their stores, and Western medicines dispensed mostly through hospitals and clinics.
Some items have stirred feelings of resentment and embarrassment among Russians. Some Russians are convinced that most aid has either been stolen, or diverted by the "mafia" for private gain.
Recently, Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi charged that 60 percent of the aid had been siphoned off by "commercial structures," which he said pocketed $59 million in profit.
Countering the criticism, Aleksandr A. Zhitnikov, first deputy chairman of the Government commission that distributes the aid, vigorously defends his program. Early on, the Government chose to sell the donated goods to commercial outlets, with the proceeds going to special social welfare funds. Russia's federal social welfare fund, for example, got $20 million from the sale of American butter and Taiwanese rice.
"The majority of the population regards aid with understanding," said Mr. Zhitnikov.
 
Trust Us, Administrator Pleads
 Mr. Zhitnikov and his commission have objected to some conditions placed on the aid -- such as the initial requirement that it be targeted for Moscow and St. Petersburg, even though these cities contain only 10 percent of Russia's population. "The West needs to trust us and our assessment of where the needs are," he said.
Taking advantage of the West's reawakened interest in Russia's problems, the Russian Government has stepped up a campaign to force an opening on Western markets for Russian goods and commodities which, it says, is more important in the long run than more short-term loans.
"The Americans are talking about expanding aid to Russia," said Sergei Y. Glazyev, Russia's Foreign Trade Minister. "What we demand is a free access of Russian goods to the markets of developed countries, including that of the United States, and an end to discrimination against Russia in foreign markets."

HEADLINE: Florida Blazes Trail to a New Health-Care System

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., April 3

 BODY:
The Florida Legislature approved a sweeping overhaul of the state's overburdened health-care system early today, making Florida the first state in the nation to combine free market competition and government regulation in a way similar to the Clinton Administration's plans for controlling soaring medical costs.
Overcoming obstacles posed by lobbyists who sought to gut the proposal with hundreds of amendments, Gov. Lawton Chiles, the author of the plan, won bipartisan support for his package after three days of marathon deliberations in the State Capitol and threats to call lawmakers back for a special session if the plan was voted down. The difficulties the Governor faced provide a glimpse into the resistance that President Clinton is likely to confront in his efforts to revamp the system. 
 Mr. Chiles said he hoped that Florida's embrace of a system of managed competition, in which large numbers of people and businesses buy health care from organized networks of doctors and hospitals, would be a model for other states as well as Washington. "We would like to be able to chart the way for the Federal Government," he said.
 
Biggest State Experiment
 Other states have taken steps toward broad changes in their health-care systems, including Hawaii, Oregon, Vermont and Minnesota. But Florida's plan, which will tryto cover most people eventually and at the same time to control health costs, is taking place on a larger scale than anything seen elsewhere.
In part, Florida's lawmakers were pushed to act by the soaring health-care spending, which rose to $38 billion last year from $9.4 billion in 1980. Another factor was the size and composition of the state's population. Florida's 13.5 million residents include the highest proportion of elderly people in the nation, as well as large numbers of immigrants and rural and urban poor. In addition, businesses with 50 or fewer employees, the companies most affected by rising health-care costs, account for 95 percent of all jobs in the state.
As a phalanx of lobbyists representing hospitals, insurance companies, doctors, drug manufacturers, pharmacists, malpractice lawyers, laboratories and other interests watched, both houses of the state legislature authorized the creation of 11 Community Health Purchasing Alliances. As envisioned by Mr. Chiles, these new state-chartered regional cooperatives will help employers obtain the best care at the cheapest price and decide what kind of care plans can be offered on the market.
As a result, 2.5 million uninsured residents in the nation's fourth-most populous state should be able to obtain what Mr. Chiles has described as "full access to quality, affordable health care." People already enrolled in health-care plans will be able to remain with those programs, although some premiums are expected to rise initially. Eventually many insurers and employers are expected to participate in the purchasing alliances.
The plans will also be open to self-employed, unemployed and low-income people. Depending on their incomes, they may qualify for state or Federal subsidies.
"I don't think there will be immediate savings," Mr. Chiles, a Democrat, said shortly after the State Senate passed the package at 1 A.M. today. "But I do think there will be people getting health care who never had a chance to get it before, and there will be small businesses that will be able to cover their people that they were not able to cover before."
Mr. Chiles said that although health care costs would not immediately drop, "I don't think we will see the 15 to 20 percent increase in premiums that we have seen every year for the last five years." He added, "We have got to stop the spiraling increases, and then we'll talk about savings."
 
Questions Still Not Answered
 Many practical questions remain unanswered. Because Florida's approach is untested, no one knows how much the system will cost or save. Nor is it clear what the minimum benefits will include and what sort of treatment guidelines will be applied to doctors who choose to take part in the system.
"This is an experiment," said Doug Cook, director of the state's Agency for Health Care Administration and Mr. Chiles's chief adviser on health issues. "We're going to have to see how it works as we go along. This is the first shot across the bow, and there aren't any guarantees."
Mr. Cook acknowledged that the initial phase of the program would require additional investment by both the state and Federal governments to provide coverage to people not now insured. He said he anticipated that both Federal and state authorities would be willing to increase aid.
But the bill's backers here, who included both conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats, argue that as more and more people gain access to health care, costs will ultimately be reduced. Through the large volume they are expected to generate, the 11 local health-care alliances would be able to obtain the best price for consumers, while insuring a steady flow of business to participating doctors.
Mr. Chiles's package nearly foundered as a result of arguments over how much authority the purchasing alliances should be granted. On Thursday night, the Florida Senate voted down a plan that would have allowed the cooperatives to decide what type of health-care plans would be offered to employers, establishing that a minimum of three types of plans be made available.
Opponents of Mr. Chiles's plan objected both to granting broad power to the alliances and the Governor's insistence that he be allowed to appoint the majority of the 17 members of the boards supervising each cooperative. With so much government participation, "you are in fact creating a system that leads to socialized medicine," Alberto Gutman, a Miami Republican who is chairman of the Senate Health Committee, said in an interview. "You are setting up a one-payer system that is like a utility, and I have never seen the price of a utility go down."
Doctors and their allies favored a much weaker organization, in which the purchasing alliances would serve primarily as information clearing houses for individual businesses looking for the coverage best suited to their needs. In the words of Dr. Mathis L. Becker, chairman of the Florida Medical Association's Council on Legislation, the cooperative should be "a place to come in and get a bunch of brochures."
But through old-fashioned negotiation and repeated reminders that the Federal Government might impose a solution that did not take Florida's needs into account, Mr. Chiles was able to win over most of those who had opposed his plan. Of the 10 state senators who voted against the plan, several were liberal Democrats who said they concerned the overhaul did not go far enough.
Mr. Chiles was willing to compromise, for instance, on the thorny issue of whether Medicaid recipients and state employees should automatically be enrolled in the purchasing alliances. State employees will be allowed to choose whether they want to join. And recipients of Medicaid, the joint state and Federal program for the poor and disabled, will be put into a separate pool so that, as Mr. Gutman put it, "the costs to non-Medicaid people do not increase."

HEADLINE: Truly Modern Filibuster: Choreographed Gridlock

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
On what was supposed to be an off day, the Senate came to work this morning just long enough to certify that it cannot agree to vote on President Clinton's jobs bill, to register a few political accusations and to plot its next battle.
Then it quit until Monday, when most lawmakers who were collared by reporters outside the chamber seemed to think that they would do pretty much the same thing all over again. 
 "I am assuming I can cancel my trip to Bosnia and Russia," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat who had intended to fly today.
This is the modern Senate filibuster. It is nothing like the popular image, enshrined in Jimmy Stewart movies and old newsreels, of obstinant lawmakers delivering all-night stemwinders and reading from phone books.
 
Religion, Sunset and Games
 To the contrary, this exercise in gridlock is not only completely choreographed, but also contrived to give everybody as much time on television and as little inconvenience as possible.
Sensitive to religious concerns (and, some might suggest, to the opening of the baseball season on Monday in nearby Baltimore), the lawmakers are taking off Palm Sunday and planning to meet only briefly Monday morning. They will also interrupt their deliberations in deference to Passover, which begins at sundown Monday, a few hours before the national collegiate basketball championship game.
So relaxed is this struggle over the nation's economic health that only 89 of the 100 senators showed up today, nine fewer than on Friday.
In truth, the Republicans, who are staging the filibuster to block the President's proposal, do not need to be here at all. The Democrats need 60 votes to end debate and force a vote on the bill, a $16.3 billion amalgam of public works projects and spending increases for Federal agencies. But there are only 57 in the entire Democratic membership, so unless some Republicans defect, the majority senators are powerless.
In the only action today, the Democrats got 52 votes, all from their own party. The 37 Republicans in attendance voted to keep talking.
 
Looking Toward Wednesday
 Some predicted the two sides would begin to reason together by Wednesday, when Passover has ended, Mr. Clinton has returned from meeting President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, and lawmakers have wearied of argument.
To call this debate leisurely is not to mock its seriousness. Mr. Clinton, and many Senate Democrats, argue that the legislation will create 200,000 jobs. They also believe it wrong for the Republicans to toss obstacles before a new President's economic program, particularly when his election victory rested largely on unhappiness with his predecessor's fiscal stewardship.
"Grass-roots Americans want to end the gridlock and get the economy moving," Mr. Clinton said in his Saturday radio address. "Unfortunately, some people in Washington, D.C., haven't gotten the message that the people want fundamental change."
Speaking of the Republicans, Senator Donald Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said today: "This is Presidential politics, plain and simple. They're prepared to wound this President, to wound his chances to help this country."
The Republicans have coalesced against the jobs bill in part because the Democratic majority tried to ram it through in a way that denied them any chance to offer amendments. They also argue that the bill would increase the deficit, create few permanent jobs and is ridden with pork.
Not long ago, they might have held the floor for days and nights on end to block it, but these days, all-night speeches are more for show than effect. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, staged one last year to dramatize his support for a threatened Long Island factory, and former Senator William Proxmire, a Wisconsin Democrat, orated nocturnally every so often about the public debt.
True filibusters began to die in the mid-1960's, when the Senate managed to break a Southern roadblock against the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
The last filibuster worthy of the name, Senate officials say, was back in 1988, when Republicans successfully blocked a Democratic overhaul of campaign-spending laws. The Capitol Hill police arrested Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, and carried him into the Senate so Democrats could have enough members on hand to conduct business.
"The Republicans have their blood up, and well they might," Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said today. "And I think they kind of enjoy it."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IS CAUGHT BY BOSNIA DILEMMA

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG with MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3

 BODY:
The Bosnian Serbs' rejection of a plan for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina brings President Clinton face-to-face with the question he raised during the Presidential campaign and has avoided ever since: Should the United States use force to stop the fighting in Bosnia?
Now, the Serbs have called the Administration's bluff -- betting, in essence, that Washington will not respond with force and that they can weather sanctions while they continue grabbing land in Bosnia. Even today, fighting was reported in Sarajevo and the eastern enclave of Srebrenica, in violation of a cease-fire.
 
'Argument Still Goes On'
 Administration officials said that they plan to support tighter sanctions against the former Yugoslavia in meetings at the United Nations next week, and then to look into exempting Bosnia from the arms embargo. Already today, the Security Council called for more peacekeepers in eastern Bosnia, but did not respond to a request that the peacekeepers take over Srebrenica to save the besieged residents. 
 While there is an Administration consensus on sanctions, there is no agreement about what, if any, military action to take if those efforts fail. "Where the rubber hits the road is the use of force," said one senior Administration official. "The argument still goes on."
Since Mr. Clinton took office, he has relied on diplomacy and economic sanctions as his weapons. He has said he was willing to send ground troops, something he once opposed, but only in the role of peacekeepers to enforce an agreement honored by all sides.
On Friday, the Bosnian Serbs brought the Clinton White House full circle. During the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton ruled out ground troops but called for air strikes against the Serbs and said the West must be tough in discouraging the ethnic aggression unleashed by the fall of Communism.
After taking office, President Clinton shelved the most muscular military options and sought instead to improve a peace pact that recognizes some of the Serbs' victories, but denies them their aim of annexing parts of Bosnia.
Critics inside and outside Government argue that Mr. Clinton's initial decision against arming the Bosnians or using force amounted to a failure of will that emboldened the Serbs. Mr. Clinton's aides insist they are doing far more than their predecessors, and argue that Mr. Clinton's shift in position is part of the education of a President who is still at the mercy of shifting international realities and who needs to keep his domestic agenda of economic renewal in the forefront.
 
Toughest Foreign Policy Issue
 A reconstruction of the Clinton Administration's decision-making on Bosnia, based on interviews with officials, has brought to light new details about what officials call their toughest foreign policy dilemma.
Limits were set at the outset on the extent of Washington's involvement. The Clinton Administration concluded shortly after taking office that Bosnia's travail, though tragic, did not amount to a "never again" scenario that morally compels America to intervene. Rolling back all the Serbs' territorial gains, about 70 percent of Bosnia, was not a realistic goal, officials decided.
The value of using force has prompted conflicting advice from the Pentagon. Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has persuaded some top policy makers that air strikes would not silence the artillery around Sarajevo or deter Serbian aggression. But Defense Secretary Les Aspin has argued in meetings that air raids could deter Serbian attacks.
Although the Administration has placed great hopes on the effect of tighter sanctions, the Central Intelligence Agency recently concluded a study that says they will have little immediate effect on the fighting in Bosnia. The Serbs' weapons are so abundant, the agency said, that they are exporting arms to raise cash.
They also discussed the effect on President Boris N. Yeltsin, who told the Administration that tough action against the Serbs could further jeopardize his position with the Russian Parliament. Serbs and Russians have historically been allies.
In July, Mr. Clinton issued a statement that said: "If the Serbs persist in violating the terms of the current cease-fire agreement, the United States should take the lead in seeking United Nations Security Council authorization for air strikes against those who are attacking the relief effort." Later, he said Washington should be prepared to use force to free the prisoners held in Serbian detention camps.
 
Response to Bush Challenge
 The remarks served a political purpose. At the time, President George Bush was asking whether his opponent had the steel to be Commander in Chief, attacking Mr. Clinton's inexperience in foreign affairs, his avoidance of the draft and his lukewarm support for the Persian Gulf war. In taking an assertive stance on Bosnia, Mr. Clinton fought back and used the Bush Administration's inaction on the issue as evidence that Mr. Bush lacked the vision to lead the post-cold-war world.
The Clinton team began the Presidential transition eager to reverse the Bush policy. Bosnia was the subject of Presidential Review Directive 1, the first issue on the White House's foreign policy agenda. The issue was considered so important, it was sent directly to "the principals," a committee made up of Secretary of State Warren Christopher; Mr. Aspin; the Director of Central Intelligence, R. James Woolsey; Vice President Al Gore; General Powell, and Madeleine K. Albright, the United Nations delegate.
The Administration instructed the State Department and Pentagon to draw up the broadest possible list of options, but many were discarded.
With the President elected on a platform of domestic change, "clearly he was not going to entertain the option of 'going in' in a major way," an official recalled. Each proposed cure, they said, seemed to have side effects that were as bad as the disease -- or worse.
At the Administration's orders, the Pentagon drew up a list of possible bombing targets, including the artillery around Sarajevo, bridges between Bosnia and Serbia, and targets deep in Serbia. General Powell repeated his argument that bombing would not seriously hamper the Serbs' ability to wage war, persuading some senior officials, but not Mr. Aspin.
 
Escort Troops Ruled Out
 Another possibility, adding American troops to the United Nations contingent delivering aid to Bosnia, was ruled out. "If you send in forces to escort humanitarian aid, and the situation gets worse, you're in a quagmire," one official said.
Arming the Bosnians was more complicated. Mr. Clinton and most of his aides favored this step, while others argued that no peace settlement would endure until the Muslims reclaimed a reasonable amount of the land and were able to protect themselves against Serbian efforts to drive them from their homes.
Britain and France, fearing Serbian retaliation, said they would pull their troops out of the United Nations operation in Bosnia if the arms embargo were lifted. Though Bosnian officials told the Pentagon months earlier that they would rather have guns than food, senior Administration officials felt they could not risk the starvation of thousands of people.
Russia was another factor. Administration officials worried that Moscow might veto any move by the Security Council to lift the embargo.
Miss Albright, the United Nations delegate, was especially gloomy. "Every time this topic comes up," one senior official said, "Madeleine rolls her eyes and says: 'You may get the Security Council to approve a no-fly zone, but you will not get this.' "
The same factors were seen as likely to block Security Council approval of air strikes against the Serbs.
Europe's objections to arming the Bosnians or air strikes were reinforced by Lord Owen, the European Community peace envoy, and Cyrus R. Vance of the United Nations. As Mr. Clinton began his policy review, Mr. Vance and Mr. Owen said the factions were close to agreement. They mobilized European officials against the options Clinton presented in the campaign.
 
Qualms About Peace Plan
 On Feb. 5, at their third meeting on Bosnia, senior Administration officials had serious qualms about the Vance-Owen plan, which they criticized because it partitioned Bosnia on ethnic grounds and ratified the gains the Serbs had achieved through violence.
Nonetheless, the consensus was to give diplomacy a chance. Officials understood that if the United States wanted a direct role in the talks, it would have to ante up troops for the peacekeeping force.
The aides agreed on a package of options: Push the United Nations to enforce a no-flight zone over Bosnia; strengthen economic sanctions, send an American envoy to the peace talks, and signal willingness to help enforce an accord.
An hour and half after the meeting began, Mr. Clinton sat down at the table. The President said he was inclined to agree with his aides' recommendations, but wanted the weekend to think the decision over.
On Feb. 8, after one last phone call to General Powell, Mr. Clinton signed a presidential directive ordering the steps. Two days later, Mr. Christopher announced the policy, using strong words to propose restrained actions.
 
Campaign Promises Abandoned
 The Secretary of State was well aware that his announcement represented an abandonment of the campaign promises. "Our options are less good than they were at the time the President spoke when he identified in August the need to take aggressive action on this subject," he said.
Former Bush Administration officials call these rationalizations, and say that most of the obstacles to forceful military action cited existed in August. "They need to explain better than they have how the options that looked so good during the campaign look so bad now," said Arnold Kanter, Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs in the Bush Administration.
Differences among Administration officials widened after Mr. Christopher announced the policy, particularly over the circumstances under which Americans would join a peacekeeping force. Both Mr. Aspin and General Powell want to wait weeks to make sure the warring factions are making a good-faith effort to implement a treaty before stepping in to police it. The State Department, the C.I.A. and NATO agree that any pact will unravel without swift, large troop deployments. That dispute is likely to reemerge if the Serbs change their mind and sign the peace pact.
Meanwhile, Administration officials believe there is only a small constituency for tougher steps on Bosnia. One official cited a poll that found only 10 percent of respondents want to go beyond sending peacekeepers.
The political pressures also are clear. On Capitol Hill, there is little support for military adventures in the Balkans. Few legislators have joined Representative Frank McCloskey, the Indiana Democrat, who recently sent Mr. Clinton a letter in which he said: "Western defeatism in the face of genocide stands exposed. Your Administration is saying that the U.S. will tolerate land grabs at the end of the 20th century: we will not come to Bosnia's defense with the awesome airpower at our disposal."
 
 
BALKAN UPDATE
 Bosnian Serbs meeting in Bileca reaffirmed their contempt yesterday for the Bosnia peace plan drawn up by mediators, declaring they were determined to pursue their goal of dividing Bosnia into three parts, despite international sentiment. In a second vote on the plan, they rejected it 68-0, with one abstention.
The Muslim-led Government of Bosnia threatened to resume full-scale war against the Bosnian Serbs unless the West persuaded Serbian nationalists to sign the peace accord soon.
But Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today in Vancouver that he believed the Bosnian Serbs might still accept the plan and suggested it was possible that the proposal could be adjusted to accommodate some of their concerns.
Conditions deteriorated in Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia, where approximately 60,000 Muslim civilians are trapped, when Bosnian Serbs blocked further United Nations aid convoys but said they would allow empty trucks to enter to evacuate the Muslims.
 At the United Nations, the Security Council approved a statement condemning the Bosnian Serbs for blocking the relief effort and asked for more peacekeeping troops in Eastern Bosnia, but it did not act on a recommendation to send troops to Srebrenica. It expects to meet on Monday to discuss further sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, the two remaining republics in Yugoslavia.
Increasing violations of the fragile, week-old cease-fire were reported in both Srebrenica and in Sarajevo, the capital, United Nations observers said.

HEADLINE: With Europe in Flux, No More Politics as Usual

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, April 1

 BODY:
With public opinion polls showing voters all over Europe fed up with the political leaders and parties that have dominated politics for decades, at first glance the French elections held last weekend seemed to reaffirm the strength of mainstream democratic politics.
On a continent where far-right parties have been making hay out of rising popular frustration over the social and economic problems caused by foreign immigration and turmoil in formerly Communist countries, this was no small comfort. 
 But three years after the epochal changes that followed the collapse of Communism in Europe, signs of crisis in the political systems that insured the success of its free societies during the cold war remain evident from Britain to Germany in the north and from Spain to Greece in the south.
"My children are aged between 17 and 20, and when they get together with their friends, they don't talk about politics," said Jean-Manuel Bourgois, a French publisher. "They talk about whether any of them or their friends will have jobs after they finish their studies."
 
The Future Is the Issue
 Worry about mounting unemployment and the sagging economy is the underlying issue everywhere, but there is also confusion about the purpose and strategic future of Western European societies now that "Western Europe" is no longer forced to lead a separate existence.
The French, with more than 3 million people out of work -- 10.6 percent of the labor force -- did what voters in the United States did in November after they concluded that the government was incapable of solving the problem. They threw the governing party out and brought in the opposition.
And, just as nearly a fifth of American voters registered their frustration by voting for Ross Perot, nearly 20 percent of the French electorate supported environmental movements and parties like the far-right National Front of Jean-Marie Le Pen.
But the new conservative Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, now has two years to show that he can do better trying to solve economic problems and to define the new Europe than Francois Mitterrand and the Socialists.
 
Out of Ideas
 It is in addressing the future of Europe that the real problems begin, because the European economies are closely linked, and in Germany and Italy as well as in France, leaders and parties that have been in power for years have run out of fresh ideas.
There is also a sense that conventional politics is increasingly corrupt, and its practitioners are being discredited. In Italy, an entire generation of leaders stands accused of having been in the pocket of organized crime.
Here, Mr. Mitterrand's party was weakened by scandals over alleged financial corruption and the health service's mishandling of blood supplies tainted by the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS.
In Spain, the Government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, in office since 1982, has been steadily losing popularity because of corruption scandals and soaring unemployment. Jose Maria Aznar, leader of the opposition People's Party, contends that the French election presaged a similar outcome in Spain later this year.
"The French have put an end to an administration that, just as in Spain, offered a sad balance of unemployment and generalized corruption," he said.
 
Scandals in Germany
 In Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl faces general elections in the fall of 1994. Since unification, his conservative-liberal coalition Government has been paralyzed by one petty scandal after another, as well as by a broader indecision about the economic and strategic problems.
The most recent scandal involves the Transport Minister, a man from eastern Germany named Gunther Krause, who insisted on getting a sizable Government subsidy for his cleaning woman. Since she found the job through the state labor office, the subsidy was perfectly legal; but politically it was a big mistake at a time when Germans are being called upon to make sacrifices to pay the unification bills.
"If you pay taxes, you're helping to clean the Krauses' house," one radio commentator put it the other day.
Mr. Kohl's Social Democratic opponent, Bjorn Engholm, is in no better shape after disclosures that a key party ally had been making payments to a member of Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats, who had tipped off Mr. Engholm about plans to discredit him five years ago by spreading false rumors.
 
Discord Over Immigrants
 The German parties fought with each other for years about how to cope with the rising tide of foreign asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants.
Strong showings in regional elections by right-wing German parties like the Republicans, and a wave of far-right attacks against foreigners last year that killed 17 people, raised fears that Germans were sliding back into evil old ways.
But in France, the National Front party of Mr. Le Pen, who appeared at campaign rallies with a private police force that bore stronger resemblance than anything in Germany today to the Nazi SA paramilitaries, drew a strong protest vote in the first round of the two-stage French elections.
"I voted Le Pen in the first round because no other party came out and said what's really rotten in France today," said Francois Barbey, an unemployed real-estate salesman in Fontenay-sous-Bois. "France is losing its cultural and national identity under a tide of foreign immigrants. The whole hill in back of my house is full of welfare housing projects, and foreigners have most of the apartments."
 
No Seats at the Edges
 Mr. Le Pen's party won no seats in the French Legislature in the second runoff round on March 28, and neither did the coalition of environmental parties that represented the other side of the spectrum of what many had hoped or feared would turn out to be a new politics to replace the old.
Brice Lalonde, a former environment minister who lost his seat in the elections, explained the defeat as a rejection of socialist policies. "A lot of French people don't know what it means to be French anymore," he said.
Mr. Bourgois was worried that many voters would still feel disenfranchised. "Farmers and fishermen have already taken to the streets, and there could be a lot of violence ahead if things don't go well," he said.
The farmers and fishermen have been protesting against European Community policies they blame for costing them their livelihoods.
[A wave of strikes and demonstrations on Friday from Britain to Italy brought a million people into the streets, with many protesting the community's inability to do anything about the rise in unemployment.]
But the community itself has been largely paralyzed for more than a year by the difficulty of ratifying the treaty on monetary and political union on which its leaders agreed in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in late 1991.
 
More Votes on Treaty
 Danish voters rejected it last June but will vote again on May 18. Depending on what happens, Britain's Parliament will vote on the treaty in the fall. Rejection by any one of the 12 member countries would leave it dead.
In both France and Germany, a revival of French-German cooperation is seen as the best way of reinjecting vigor into the European Community, and almost the first thing Mr. Balladur did after being named was to announce plans to see Mr. Kohl.
The new French Government is expected to press the Germans harder than Mr. Mitterrand did to get the independent Bundesbank to lower short-term German interest rates and to allow the French to bring theirs down and stimulate their flagging economy.
"The Germans are used to living quite happily for the past 12 years with a weak France," said Pierre Lellouche, foreign policy adviser to Jacques Chirac, leader of France's conservative neo-Gaullist party.
But like many German politicians and bankers, Mr. Lellouche said he thought the common European currency foreseen by the Maastricht treaty would never come to pass.
"The treaty is a dead letter," Mr. Lellouche said.
Marie-France Garaud, an opponent of the treaty who is president of the International Institute of Geopolitics in Paris, disagreed. "There is already a de facto common currency," she said, "the Deutsche mark."

HEADLINE: Casino Panel's New Mission: Save Atlantic City

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 3

 BODY:
New Jersey's powerful Casino Control Commission is changing its mission from micro-regulation of the casino industry to the restoration of aging Atlantic City to its former prominence as a resort.
It is a race against time, says Chairman Steven P. Perskie, to insure that the gaming industry, confronted with mounting competition from explosive growth in all forms of gambling across the country, does not fall victim to stagnation as the once-grand city did. 
 "I look at the opening of the new convention center as a new beginning," said Mr. Perskie, referring to the $260 million downtown convention site that is scheduled to open in 1996 as the centerpiece of the city's long-promised renaissance.
 
Aiding a Battered Industry
 "Nineteen ninety-three, '94, '95 will unquestionably be the most critical period of all," said Mr. Perskie, who in his two years at the helm of the commission has transformed it from the gambling industry's adversary to its watchful ally. "The question is, is it too late? I don't believe it is, but if it doesn't happen by 1996, it will be too late."
In theory, the primary role of the five-member Casino Control Commission remains the regulation of legal gambling in Atlantic City -- chiefly keeping it free of mob influence.
But in fact, Mr. Perskie's appointment to its chairmanship in September 1990 was part of an intensive effort by the city, the state and the regulators themselves to shore up an industry battered by the junk-bond financing binge of the 1980's and legal gambling's failure to keep its promise to reverse Atlantic City's decay.
Besides the convention center, the state has bought and is committed to expanding Atlantic City International Airport. State and local officials also plan to build new housing, raze decrepit downtown properties and replace them with a new corridor of hotels and restaurants to be anchored by the convention center, and to promote the development of non-gambling attractions along the boardwalk.
The commission -- which is now purged of dissenting voices -- is also, as Mr. Perskie puts it, "literally rewriting the entire system of regulation."
"All the infrastructure investment and the regulatory change has been done to create an attractive environment for new investment," he said. The goal is to revive Atlantic City as a resort and convention destination, not just a magnet for gamblers.
 
Slacking Off on Regulation?
 Legal gambling was adopted in 1976 in an effort to save the city. By the time the first casino went up in 1978, all the elegant old resort hotels had been torn down, the boardwalk was all but deserted and the population was declining rapidly and becoming increasingly poor.
The casinos have flourished, employing more than 40,000 people and winning $8 million a day. But the city continued to spiral downward, and today its population is about 36,000, half of what it was at its height in the first half of the century. It is also a one-industry town, depending on gambling for 90 percent of its revenues, compared with Las Vegas which derives half of its income from non-gambling attractions and tourism.
Mr. Perskie is at pains to deny that the commission is slacking off on its regulatory mission at the expense of revitalizing the city, but others are not so sure.
One is W. David Waters Jr., a tough regulator who resigned from the commission 18 months ago, after it became clear that he would not be reappointed to a second five-year term.
"I think the industry has done a masterful job of whining and crying over their supposed inability to make money," he said. "The industry has convinced the present commission to go easy on them. The attitude, beginning with Perskie, has been to have more sympathy with things the industry presents as problems that stand in the way of their making money."
Mr. Waters resigned after losing in a series of votes that he said sharply departed from regulatory guidelines.
 
Support for Trump
 Among them was a decision finding Donald J. Trump "financially stable" despite being more than $3 billion in debt -- $1.3 billion of it due to his three casinos, the Trump Castle, the Taj Mahal and the Trump Plaza, which represent about one-third of the $3 billion-a-year Atlantic City gaming industry.
Another was a relatively minor fine of $65,000 levied against the Trump Castle in 1990 after Mr. Trump's father, Fred Trump, made an illegal loan to his son to allow him to make his soaring bond payments. By buying $3.5 million worth of chips at the Trump Castle but not making a single wager, Fred Trump allowed Donald Trump to use the money for his payment.
Mr. Waters called it an "outrage" that the commission would "fail to carry out what it understands to be its responsibility" to heavily fine or suspend specific individuals for violations, rather than levying what he saw as a token fine against a faceless corporation.
Asked if there was any substance to suggestions that the commission is no longer as tough as it once was -- it once denied licenses to the hotelier Barron Hilton, who was subsequently licensed by the current commission -- Mr. Perskie said, "There is a superficial reality to that, but only a superficial one."
"It was an express policy of the Governor that we yield not a micrometer on the high standards of licensing" and other oversight responsibilities, said Mr. Perskie, the former chief of staff for Gov. Jim Florio.
"When I got here, there was a regulatory culture in this agency and the Division of Gaming Enforcement, and it was clearly understood by the industry, and that was that the regulatory environment was adversarial to the industry," he said. "I said to the staff the first day I got here that we're neither the adversary of, nor the advocate of, the casino industry. Regulating can be done without an adversarial atmosphere."
Commissioner Frank J. Dodd was one of those who voted in favor of finding Mr. Trump financially stable, a requirement if he was to to keep his three casino licenses. Mr. Dodd, whose five-year term expires this year and who is hoping for re-appointment, said he voted for Mr. Trump to avoid chaos in the industry.
"One banker told me confidentially that it would be like foreclosing on Uruguay -- you bring the whole country down," Mr. Dodd said in a recent interview.
 
A Host of Competitors
 Mr. Dodd, Mr. Perskie and the other three commissioners now agree that the worst of the junk-bond financing crisis, which left some casinos with debts they could not meet, is largely over. The new danger, they say, is the seemingly endless competition from a rapidly proliferating gambling industry.
The decade and a half when Atlantic City stood alone, as the only place between Monte Carlo and Las Vegas where casino gambling was legal, is gone amid a swirl of gambling fever across the country:
*A veritable fleet of reincarnated riverboat casinos is already plying the Mississippi, with more planned.
*The Foxwood Casino, opened in Connecticut last year by the Mashantucket Pequot Indians, is already earning tens of millions of dollars and has become a model for similar ventures across the country.
*New Orleans is planning a casino hotel to dwarf Mr. Trump's billion-dollar Taj Mahal, Chicago would like to host a major casino and the list of new and potential alternative gambling ventures like lotteries and electronic card games continues to grow.
*Gov. Mario M. Cuomo just last month reached agreement with the Oneida Indians to allow New York State's first high-stakes casino in the center of the state, and negotiations are under way with the Mohawks for another. More than 50 tribes in 17 states now operate casinos or big bingo parlors.
 
Call for a Time-Out
 Nelson Rose, a professor at Whittier College of Law in California who analyzes the growth of gambling, predicts that within a decade, every major population center in the United States will be within a two-hour drive of a casino resort.
Such growth has generated mounting concern in New Jersey, a deluge of proposals for new and expanded gambling ventures, and a call from Governor Florio for a time-out to take stock. In January, the Governor overruled the State Lottery Commission, which had approved a plan to allow high-speed keno lottery machines in bars and restaurants.
The machines proposal, adamantly opposed by the casino industry, would have allowed a player to play every five minutes, 16 hours a day, and came on the heels of the expansion of gaming hours in Atlantic City to 24 hours a day, the introduction of horse-racing simulcasts in casinos, and overtures to legalize sports betting and to allow video poker terminals outside Atlantic City.
"There is a need to evaluate the complete gambling picture in New Jersey," the Governor said, as he halted further expansion of the industry to take a hard look at the state's increasing reliance on gambling as a major revenue source.
Commissioner James R. Hurley, who was a member of the Legislature 17 years ago when casino gambling was approved, acknowledged that the state had gone back on its promise at that time not to allow nonstop gambling 24 hours a day, but said, "The marketplace has changed."
Commissioner Dodd, who also played a role in pushing the legal gaming legislation through as Senate president in the 70's, said, "The hue and cry at the time was, 'We don't want to be Las Vegas!' But if you have ever been in Atlantic City, you would die to be Las Vegas."
"I and other legislators envisioned that casino gambling in Atlantic City would be men in tuxedos and women in evening gowns sipping champagne," he said. "That was 15 years ago. Now we are happy to get beer drinkers."

HEADLINE: YELTSIN TIPTOEING ON SENSITIVE ISSUE

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 3

 BODY:
No Russian or Soviet President has ever traveled abroad watching his back quite as anxiously as President Boris N. Yeltsin must in Vancouver.
In his very first comments on arrival here for his summit meeting with President Clinton, Mr. Yeltsin gave a measure of the danger he faced when he acknowledged that even overly generous Western aid could be a weapon against him in the vicious political struggle back home. 
 "You see, too much is not very good either," the Russian leader said when asked how much aid he was seeking. "Too little is not very good. Too much also could be bad, because it can be used by Communists to target us. The opposition will say we are shackled by the West."
 
Hostile Comment From Speaker
 The comment followed a stinging attack on his visit by Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, the Speaker of the hostile legislature and Mr. Yeltsin's bitterest opponent. Meeting with Western diplomats in Moscow, Mr. Khasbulatov complained that their capitals were "rushing too fast to support the ill-conceived steps of one political side in Russia."
If Mr. Yeltsin's actions result in bloodshed, Mr. Khasbulatov warned, "then a share of the responsibility will rest on Western countries."
The very notion of criticizing a leader, much less discussing the possibility of civil war, while he is on an international mission would have been unthinkable before in a nation that has always put great importance on maintaining a bold and unified face abroad. Mr. Yeltsin himself was dismissed from the Communist leadership in 1987 in part because he publicly criticized Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the eve of a United States-Soviet summit meeting.
This time, even Mr. Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, undermined his President's mission a bit by publicly declaring that he found foreign aid degrading.
"What they tried to do, this humanitarian stuff, it's humiliating, though it's not meant that way," he said in a television interview. "We have to thank them for it. But I, for one, feel humiliated in that sense."
 
Top Ministers See Him Off
 Other symptoms of Mr. Yeltsin's plight were less public, but no less telling. All three "power ministers" -- those of Defense, Security and the Interior -- showed up at the Moscow airport on Friday to see Mr. Yeltsin off, along with Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, in what was evidently a demonstration of support.
Russian officials privately acknowledged that Mr. Yeltsin had decided to leave Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev in Moscow, leading President Clinton to leave Defense Secretary Les Aspin behind.
Mr. Yeltsin also felt compelled to reassure his countrymen on departure. "I have a telephone, and I will run the country myself," he told reporters before boarding his plane. "Be assured the nuclear button is in safe hands. I am not abandoning the controls."
Officials also privately reported that Mr. Yeltsin would impart his most personal thoughts to Mr. Clinton on a walk outdoors, to preclude the leaking of a transcript to his opposition, as happened after his meeting with President Bush in January.
Mr. Yeltsin's requests to Mr. Clinton reportedly include a greater emphasis on economic cooperation rather than direct aid, a more substantial aid package, an accent on assistance to the private sector and an emergency meeting of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations as early as May.
Mr. Yeltsin was also expected to raise the crises in other former Soviet republics, most notably in Georgia, the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave in Azerbaijan and Tajikistan, where civil wars are proving increasingly intractable.
 
Delegation Reflects Situation
 The Russian President's delegation in Vancouver also reflected Russia's financial crunch and the political turmoil at home.
Only a handful of Russian reporters were in evidence, and the Tass team complained bitterly that they had been denied electronic communications gear. For the most part, this reflected the shortage of hard currency.
But the absence of Pravda, which as the Communist Party daily used to be a major presence at all United States-Soviet summit conferences, was interpreted as an ideological boycott. Even its Washington correspondent failed to make the trip, and the paper wrote today: "One has to admit, although it is painful, that the summit is a stillborn diplomatic child."
Mr. Yeltsin's security detail, by contrast, was undiminished.
His immediate team included Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev; Aleksandr N. Shokhin, the Deputy Prime Minister charged with social policy, who has been conducting economic negotiations in Paris, and Boris G. Fyodorov, the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for economic policy.
The man most closely advising Mr. Yeltsin at this meeting is Dmitri Ryurikov, his adviser on foreign affairs, who is said to be slated for a senior Government position.
Mr. Yeltsin's interpreter in Vancouver is Sergei Berezhkov, whose father, Valentin Berezhkov, was Stalin's interpreter at the Yalta conference 1945.

HEADLINE: A Brooklyn Precinct: Crime Figures Send a Complex Message

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
His body tense, his hand hovering over his holster, Officer Dennis Gallagher cautiously pushed open the door to a dank apartment house in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. He searched the lobby for the addicts who usually scurry away when he enters, leaving behind crack vials and fearful tenants. But he found none.
"When community policing started, a lot of people were skeptical," said Officer Gallagher, who now speaks proudly of his alliance with the building's superintendent and others in the neighborhood who have helped him rid the block of drugs. 
 Officer Gallagher, 34 years old, has no doubt why recent statistics show that reported serious crime dropped 6.8 percent last year in the 88th Precinct in Fort Greene and 7.8 percent in New York City overall: growing ties between New Yorkers and a police force that is moving from its patrol cars onto the streets.
 
Mixed Reviews
 Not everyone in Fort Greene agrees. Interviews with residents, merchants and police officers paint a more mottled picture about the reasons for the decrease and which residents have benefited in the 88th, a racially diverse swath of north-central Brooklyn with a population of about 60,000.
To be sure, no one -- including the Police Department -- knows exactly why crime has declined in New York City since 1991 after steady increases that began in the mid-1980's, when crack-related violence ripped through many neighborhoods.
But a look at the 88th Precinct -- which ranks about average in crime and includes sturdy middle-class areas as well as pockets of grinding poverty -- may provide some hints about the evolving nature of public safety and law enforcement throughout the city.
Since 1991, reported serious crime has dropped 21.3 percent in the 88th Precinct. Beneath the sure simplicity of that figure, though, lies a knot of influences.
Crime seems to be down in some parts of the 88th because residents have embraced their patrol officers, inviting them to block association meetings and feeding them steady streams of information. On foot-patrol beat No. 5, merchants call Officer Gallagher by his first name. (Local criminals call him "Red" or "Blondie" because of his hair.)
Changes in the drug trade, particularly the waning allure of crack, also appear to be a factor. Another important influence is the economic growth of the area. The 88th Precinct, which includes Fort Greene, Clinton Hill and a small slice of Bedford-Stuyvesant, once had a reputation as one of the city's poorest. But since the early 1970's, many people have bought and renovated the stately 19th-century brownstones that have long defined this part of Brooklyn.
These homeowners seem particularly interested in working with their beat officers, perhaps because they want to protect property values. "They take a more active role in their community," said Evelyn Williams, manager of Community Board No. 2, which includes the 88th Precinct. "They demand more services."
In poorer sections, though, people seem more reluctant to get involved and far more skeptical that the police can make a difference in their lives. Many even refuse to discuss crime because they fear retribution from the drug dealers and muggers who they feel outnumber the police.
Edward A. Carter was strolling the other day through the Walt Whitman housing project at the northern end of the 88th Precinct, pointing out the dangerous courtyards and chatting with women around the scraggly benches that rise from the cracked pavement. The talk was of drugs and guns and an unrelenting onslaught.
"We don't have a lot of stores around here where kids can get some work, some salary," Mr. Carter, 59, a long-time tenants' leader at the project, said to shouts of agreement. "They have to cut their eye teeth on some kind of crime."
Mr. Carter and many residents of these areas scoff at the recent statistics. In fact, even as crime has dropped in the precinct as a whole, it has remained constant at the two largest housing projects in Fort Greene, the Walt Whitman and Ingersoll Houses, where more than 11,000 people live.
 
Settling Disputes With Guns
 The project's residents say the crack trade may have ebbed since the frenzied late 1980's, but they point out that more and more teen-agers are using guns to settle disputes.
Relations with beat officers, the cornerstone of community policing, seem frayed in the poorer neighborhoods, as if residents, who are mostly black, still view the mostly white officers as an occupying force. Nearly 60 percent of the officers in the 88th Precinct are white.
"I don't really think that they want to get involved," said Jeanette Turk, 35, who lives on Fulton Street, one of the most crime-ridden areas of the precinct. "They want to do their eight hours and get home safe."
The police are further hindered by the lack of stores in these sections, as Officer Manuel Da Silva pointed out the other night while he roamed past abandoned tenements and empty lots near Ms. Turk's block.
"When you walk into a store, you have customers inside and you can interact," said Officer Da Silva, 23, who patrols beat No. 9. "Stores are very helpful, because they know what's going on when the cops are not there."
But in other parts of the precinct, residents and merchants seem pleased by the new officers hired under Mayor David N. Dinkins's Safe Streets, Safe Cities plan. The 88th expects to increase the number of foot-patrol officers to 40 by 1994, up from 29 now and fewer than 10 in the late 1980's.
 
'Out There on the Street'
 "Things have drastically changed over the past few years," said Morissa D. Geller, a children's book illustrator who is president of the Cambridge Place block association. "I attribute it to the community patrols. The officers are out there on the street. There is real problem-solving taking place.
"Before, the police were a foreign force. They were something to be feared -- an unknown entity."
Mel Corbett remembers when customers shunned his store, Myrtle Variety Hardware at 341 Myrtle Avenue, because addicts and dealers lingered on the sidewalks outside, drawn to the block by a grocery that did a brisk trade in crack and heroin. That was in the late 1980's, before the Police Department adopted community policing as its guiding strategy.
"It was like a drug supermarket," he said.
Mr. Corbett, 40, a community leader who lives nearby, said the store owners on his street helped close the grocery by funneling information about drug sales to Officer Gallagher and narcotics investigators.
"When you see cops on the street, you are not going to see the random crime that you would see if the cop wasn't on the street, or the cop was in the car," Mr. Corbett said.
Kent Davis, owner of Diamond Kuts, a barber shop at 218 DeKalb Avenue, can also recall a time when he felt besieged. He sought help from Officer Gallagher several times last year about the rowdy teen-agers who smoked and sold marijuana on his block. "Recently, it's so peaceful," Mr. Davis, 32, said. "Words can't even explain it."
 
Making the Police Smile
 That kind of talk makes Capt. John J. White smile.
When Captain White took command of the 88th in January 1992, he installed a large map of the precinct on a wall in the lobby of the station house, a rickety 19th-century brick building at 298 Classon Avenue that is known as the "Castle on Classon" because of its turret.
Using the map, residents can identify which of the 11 foot-patrol beats they live in and who their patrol officers are.
"We cannot do it alone," said Captain White, 51, who joined the force 30 years ago as a beat officer in Harlem. "It has to be a partnership."
Both Captain White and Lieut. Joseph Moscatt, who heads the precinct's community policing effort, acknowledge that the sharp decline in reported serious crime in the 88th is rooted to some extent in a decrease in drug-related violence.
"Obviously, there are natural fluctuations," said Lieutenant Moscatt, who joined the precinct in 1989. "With the crack epidemic, we have come off a major high in crime over the last few years."
Residents like Mr. Corbett and some officers believe that drug use has dropped because today's teen-agers have learned from the devastation wrought by crack in the 1980's. And they point out that a decade after crack flooded the streets, some of the most violent dealers are in jail.
 
Old Crimes, New Hideouts
 Others insist that dealing has just moved from the streets into buildings because of the stepped-up foot patrols. The traffickers know that the police face greater obstacles in going after crack houses, which they cannot enter without search warrants.
"These people are not stupid," Officer Da Silva said on patrol the other night, pointing to a fortress-like tenement at 1000 Fulton Street, which is apparently the center of the neighborhood's drug trade. "They know what we can and cannot do."
He and other officers have waged a lengthy war against 1000 Fulton. But it has reopened several times. The precinct is now trying to close it for good under the city's new public nuisance laws.
That would please Freddie Hamilton, 49, an executive at a child welfare agency who lives on nearby Waverly Avenue. Just like others in her neighborhood, she is encouraged by the growing numbers of foot-patrol officers, but still believes that crime has not declined.
"The optimism is very guarded," she said. "The only thing that I can say is that the people who have decided to stay, the people who know that they are going to be here, understand that if we don't come together and do something, we won't survive."

HEADLINE: West That Is No More Turns Back Land-Use Fees

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DENVER, April 3

 BODY:
Except at rodeos and in country music bars, the cowboy hat has become a rare sight in the American West. The typical Westerner today is an urbanite, usually no more likely to know the difference between an Angus and a Hereford than the average New Yorker.
In the economy of the New West, which is tied more closely to computers than to cattle, the number of ranchers who work public lands in 11 Western states has dropped to about 30,000. Even in the West, far more people belong to the Sierra Club than to the Cattlemen's Association. 
 But President Clinton's retreat on grazing-fee increases, as well as on royalties on the minerals mined from public lands, illustrates that the political might of the Old West has not faded into the sunset just yet. And it vividly demonstrates how the Senate, with two members for each state, gives less-populous states disproportionate influence. The support of Western Democrats is essential for passage of Mr. Clinton's economic program in the Senate.
Environmentalists complained bitterly that Mr. Clinton's move signaled a lack of resolve in confronting entrenched economic interests, especially in light of the relatively small number of ranchers and miners on public land. All of the public-land ranchers in Colorado, for example, would not have enough votes to elect a City Council representative in Denver.
 
A Cowboy's Symbolic Power
 But the philosophical battle over public land, like the storied heritage of the cowboys, cannot easily be reduced to pure economics or numbers.
"It's remarkable that such a small minority could wield such influence," said Patricia Limerick, a historian at the University of Colorado. "But to understand what's at work here, you have to enter the fuzzy world of the imagined West, the tangled collection of cultural values, the symbolic power of the cowboy and the miner, and what we think we owe to our founders."
To be sure, it was not symbolism but economic pain that the Western senators emphasized when they objected to Mr. Clinton's proposal to raise grazing fees by 56 percent over five years on the 280 million acres of public range and establish a 12.5 percent royalty on minerals. They say the increases would not only eliminate jobs in mining and ranching, but would also harm the small towns that depend on ranchers and miners for their trade.
But if it were a matter of rural economics alone, say a small-town widget factory that was seeking protection, it is unlikely that so many Westerners, far removed from the old ways of the region, would care as deeply. But to Americans, cowboys are not just widget-makers.
"It isn't the normal way that people get ahold of politicians, through campaign contributions or big voter turnout," said Richard Lamm, the former Governor of Colorado, who lives in Denver. "You'll get a call from a family that has been on the land for 100 years. They pioneered it. They remember their grandfather telling stories of how they got through the blizzard of 1888. And then they tell you that if a new law goes through, they're going to go under. Well, I don't care how hardened you are, it's difficult not to be moved by that."
 
'Trust-Fund Babies'
 The debate has also been colored by perceptions of class. Most Westerners see ranchers and miners as blue-collar people working hard to survive. And they tend to view the environmentalists who call for restricting use of public land as privileged people with little understanding of the labor involved.
"The environmentalists have not been very good at getting their message across," Ms. Limerick said. "If there is anything more smug than white, middle-class environmentalists, then I don't know what it is."
Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado has emerged as a champion of miners and ranchers, depicting many of the environmentalists as "trust-fund babies who come out to hike in thousand-dollar equipment," and who look condescendingly on the "blue-collar people on Federal lands trying to make $25,000 a year."
While the miners and ranchers on public lands cast themselves as the legacy of the rugged West, environmentalists depict these industries as remnants of an old, inequitable power structure that uses politicians tied to the status quo to get their way.
 
Far From Status Quo
 In this battle of image and public relations, ranchers and miners could scarcely have cast a more appealing leader than Senator Campbell, an American Indian who wears a pony tail and a bolo tie, a former Olympic judo champion and a jewelry maker who rides a Harley Davidson motorcycle.
"I'm not exactly the status quo," he said with a deep chuckle.
Neither could Mr. Campbell be considered much of a conservative, with his record in support of minorities, unions and abortion rights.
On behalf of Western senators, Mr. Campbell wrote to President Clinton in February and warned of hardship in rural areas that the public lands proposal would cause. Mr. Clinton met twice with the senators and arranged for his chief of staff, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, to meet with them on two other occasions. Finally the President granted their request to delete the public lands provisions from his budget proposals.
 
Next Move on Fees
 Mr. Clinton has vowed to press ahead with fee increases. His spokesman, George Stephanopoulos, has described the President's retreat as a "change in process, not policy." The issue will now go to Congress on its own, not as part of the budget package.
Environmentalists have pressed for ranchers to pay a higher fee that reflects fair market value. Ranchers now pay $1.86 a month for the equivalent of one cow and her calf, which is as much as 90 percent cheaper than leasing private land.
The mining industry pays no royalty for the minerals it takes, which critics say amounts to a giveaway of Federal bounty. But mining industry officials say the searching for gold, silver and copper is so expensive that royalties would cause mass layoffs.
In an interview, Senator Campbell conceded that some increase in grazing and mining fees was inevitable. "We're all going to have to share the burden in reducing the Federal deficit," he said. "But the initial proposal would have been devastating."
An alternative proposal on Federal lands, which the President had requested, is now being drafted by the Westerners, at Mr. Clinton's request, but it would be far less reaching the President's proposal.
Ms. Limerick, the historian whose work has debunked much of the mythology of the Old West, said American still yearned to celebrate the vanishing life of Western ranching.
"In economic terms, it probably doesn't make much sense to help save these ranchers," she said. "It would be more efficient to raise all the cattle in feed lots.
"But as a nation, we may come to the conclusion this this is a cultural resource, a way of life that we want to preserve, like Yellowstone, as dramatic and glorious as any scenic attraction."

HEADLINE: Still a Dream 25 Years After King's Assassination

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, April 3

 BODY:
Twenty-five years after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, more than half of black and white Americans rate the nation's race relations as poor, and blacks and whites remain deeply divided on economic issues like preferential hiring and promotion of minorities.
The findings in a New York Times/ CBS News poll conducted March 28-31, as well as the prevailing sour racial mood, in which the name King today more often summons up Rodney G. King than the slain civil rights leader, provide a gloomy counterpoint to nationwide observances in memory of Dr. King's death on April 4, 1968. 
 Still, the current mood accurately reflects the frustrations of Dr. King's final years when he became increasingly aware that addressing the economic and social problems of the black poor across the nation was going to be far more complicated and elusive than mounting the moral crusade that desegregated the South. In recent years a more troubled economy has made these issues even more difficult to address and contributed to both increased competition for scarce jobs between blacks and whites and the plagues of drugs and crime in black communities.
 
Unforeseen Developments
 "His whole focus at the end was on the economic issues, but no one could have foreseen the levels of cultural decay in American life and the kind of economic slowdown we would face," said Cornel West, chairman of the African-American studies program at Princeton University. "No one could have expected the level of violence, physical and psychic, we see today. It would bring tears to his eyes."
According to the nationwide New York Times/CBS News telephone poll, only 37 percent of Americans rated the nation's race relations as good. That included 38 percent of white respondents and 27 percent of blacks. Fifty-five percent of whites and 66 percent of blacks said race relations were bad. A slim majority of Americans, 52 percent, including 54 percent of whites and 45 percent of blacks, said race relations were better now than 25 years ago.
The poll of 1,368 people, of whom 1,056 were white and 229 black, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for whites and six percentage points for blacks. The responses from 83 others, who indicated they were of some other race, were too few to be statistically reliable.
On some issues, blacks and whites had sharply differing perceptions. For example, almost half the white respondents who were asked how much real improvement there has been in the position of black people in the last 25 years said blacks had made a lot of progress. Only 29 percent of blacks agreed that there had been a lot of progress but more than half said there had been some.
 
Gap on Job Preferences
 The gap between blacks and whites was widest on issues that touched on jobs. When asked if blacks should be given preference in hiring and promotion where there had been job discrimination in the past, 33 percent of all Americans said yes. But while only 28 percent of whites said a preference should be given, 66 percent of blacks said there should be a preference.
Many respondents, in follow-up interviews, said economic pressures and competition between whites and blacks for jobs were imperiling the gains they had seen in their lifetimes.
"When there's economic tension, when there are a lot of people out of work, when people are competing against each other for few jobs and the jobs that do exist don't seem to pay enough to make ends meet, then the old prejudices and hatreds resurface," said Dennis Souza, a 42-year-old white social worker from Somerset, Mass. "That has a lot to do with what we've seen in the last year or so."
 
Lack of Progress Seen
 Many blacks said the legal gains of Dr. King's era had not translated into lasting social or economic ones.
"I was one of the original marchers on Washington, and what I've found is, as far as race relations go now, it's just a facade," said Samuel Butler, 47 years old, of Columbia, Md., who recently left his job of 13 years and sued his employer, saying he was a victim of discrimination. "There are a number of people I've met and talked to here, over the last few years especially, who've become victimized by racism."
And if many whites see significant racial progress, some clearly feel threatened by the changes they have seen in their lives, particularly in urban areas where blacks control political power.
"In Birmingham, I mean, if you're not black, then you're nobody," said Sheila Watson, a 44-year-old white homemaker from Moyer, Ala., about 25 miles from Birmingham. "Things have changed for the worse for white people."
 
Place in History
 Twenty-five years after his death, Dr. King remains a towering figure in American history, but one whose image is in transition, scholars and former associates agree.
David Garrow, a historian who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1987 for his biography of Dr. King, "Bearing the Cross" (Morrow, 1986), said the increased interest in Malcolm X, and the oversimplified comparisons between Malcolm X and Dr. King, had to some extent reduced Dr. King's influence today.
But he and others say the trend largely reflects the degree to which Dr. King is remembered as a soft-focus, nonviolent dreamer rather than the tough-minded, increasingly frustrated tactician he was.
"We've put Martin on this rotunda of irrelevant adulation and removed him from the struggle for economic justice," said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, who now heads the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which Dr. King founded. "Somewhere along the line we managed to resurrect the messenger and bury the message."
Dr. King's son, Martin Luther King 3d, said an organized, nonviolent campaign to put pressure on corporate America to provide more opportunities for blacks was the kind of activity his father would support today.
"I don't think the broader society has really focused on the issues that affect black people," said Mr. King, a 35-year-old Fulton County Commissioner here. "Now we're at a point where we don't have a choice."
Despite the increasing interest in Malcolm X, the poll results showed little retreat nationally from the goal of integration. Only 6 percent of whites and 7 percent of blacks saw separation of the races as a worthy goal.
 
Falling Short of Dream
 Shelby Steele, an author who is often at odds with the civil rights leadership, said the racial divide today reflected how both whites and blacks have failed to live up to Dr. King's vision.
"I think people see integration as a form of idealism, and I think Dr. King saw it as a form of pragmatism," he said. "I think what he meant by integration was very difficult for whites and blacks. It requires a commonality; it requires achievement on the part of blacks; it requires an enormous amount of tolerance on the part of whites; it requires government expenditures -- all sorts of things. I think rather than go for that we've retreated into a kind of ethnic politics."
Mr. King and other black officials felt a new sense of optimism because the Clinton Administration is viewed as more receptive to black concerns than the Republican Administrations of the last 12 years.
"I think we're at a turning point," said Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, a former civil rights leader. "I think Bill Clinton's election has given people hope, and hope is a very important thing."
 
No Successor to King
 Still, few think that in a nation where racial issues are wrapped up in economic ones and compounded by an increasingly multiethnic and multiracial society, the solution to America's racial ills will come from a commanding figure who will be able to shape this era as Dr. King dominated his own.
"We've been fooled into thinking that we need some magic hero," Mr. Lowery said. "That there's some eight-foot tall black dude riding a big black horse wearing black shining armor waving a black magic wand, making everything healthy, wealthy and wise."
With a weary shake of his head, he said: "He ain't coming. He ain't coming."

HEADLINE: Irish Ex-Premier Hopeful for Ulster Accord

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DUBLIN, April 1

 BODY:
Life is not as exciting now for Garret FitzGerald as when he was Prime Minister of Ireland and persuaded Margaret Thatcher to give Dublin an official toehold in Northern Ireland for the first time since Ireland won independence from London in 1922.
Nor is it as vexing as when, as Prime Minister, he had what he described as an "exasperating" meeting in New York with John Cardinal O'Connor at which he failed to persuade the Cardinal to publicly condemn the violence of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. 
 Nor is it as discouraging as when the Irish Ambassador in Washington reported that President Reagan had told him that East European Communists were fomenting much of the trouble in Northern Ireland. But Mr. Reagan did help with Mrs. Thatcher.
Mr. FitzGerald, an economist who was last Prime Minister from 1982 to 1987 and was head of the Fine Gael party, retired from Parliament in January and is now, at 67, enjoying the life of a senior statesman -- writing a weekly column in The Irish Times, lecturing abroad, joining his wife, Joan, in admiring the daffodils in front of their Victorian home in the fashionable Rathmines section.
Interrupting a speech-writing session recently, he described Ireland's current problems: the weak economy and the civil strife in the north and how the current Government, headed by Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, might have an unusually good chance to end the conflict, in which more than 3,000 people have died since 1969.
On the anomalous economy, he noted that while Ireland has relatively low inflation, moderate Government borrowing and an enviable international payments surplus of more than $1 billion, it is still in deep trouble, with unemployment running at about 20 percent, the highest rate in the European Community.
The root of the problem, he said, is demographic: "It's not that we produce less. We've more people to feed, too many dependents per worker. For every one person working, there are two dependents. In Europe the ratio is 1-to-1."
He said that until the last few years, Ireland, an overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country where the church preaches forcefully against contraception, had the highest fertility rate in Europe. This produced tens of thousands of new jobseekers each year in an economy that could produce only a few thousand new jobs. But between 1986 and 1990, an average of 30,000 Irish a year emigrated, keeping unemployment relatively low.
"The recession of the early 90's," he said, "has hit Britain very badly and America also, the two places emigrants go to, so that on top of having this huge number of people seeking jobs, we've now got people coming back rather than going out."
 
Baby Boom Wanes
 But he said the fertility rate is dropping fast, and by 2000, the baby boom will be over and the unemployment rate should drop.
On Northern Ireland and the relationship between Ireland, Britain and the United States, Mr. Fitzgerald moved back and forth between the current efforts to make peace in the north and the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which he and Mrs. Thatcher signed in 1985, giving Ireland a consultative role in the north and establishing an Irish Government office in Belfast.
"American support can be helpful" in the north, he said, "but you have to get the right balance." He declined to say whether President Clinton should appoint, as he has suggested he might, a special envoy to Northern Ireland, a proposal that worries the Governments here and in London.
Mr. FitzGerald said the new Irish Government had a reasonable chance of making progress toward a settlement because it has a large parliamentary majority with a coalition of Prime Minister Reynolds's party, Fianna Fail, traditionally hard-line anti-British, and the more flexible Labor Party.
With Labor leading the way toward a new agreement, Mr. FitzGerald said, Fianna Fail, which seems better trusted not to betray the country's interests, could persuade people to support a new plan for the north.

HEADLINE: Justice Cuomo?

 BODY:
There is this much to be said for the idea of putting Mario Cuomo on the Supreme Court. By leaving Albany for Washington, he might improve both places.
After a dozen years of dominating New York's political scene, Governor Cuomo's departure would allow a new generation of leadership to develop. Certainly New York politicians of both parties are rooting for a new Cuomo career. Democrats stir at the possibility of movement at the top of the party. Republicans have already begun to see their party's 1994 nomination as a prize worth seeking. 
 For most of his three terms, Governor Cuomo has seemed poised for a lunge at national office -- or a run at a state judgeship. His tortured deliberations have led some to suggest that the last thing he needs is a job requiring clear decisions. But Mr. Cuomo, a man of words whose talent lies more in what he says than in what he does, seems to think he has the right temperament for the bench. A former court clerk, a lawyer and occasional law teacher, he has even expressed envy of those he has appointed to New York's Court of Appeals.
Of course, Mr. Clinton may be playing a cruel little political game: first woo and flatter Mr. Cuomo by mentioning him when he needed him during the campaign, then turn to another nominee who offers something that Mr. Clinton needs in 1996 -- say, a swing state that is less predictably Democratic than New York.
But let's assume that Mr. Clinton is at least half serious. The President has talked about the qualities he's looking for, but he's cited only the Governor by name.
Mr. Cuomo has moved Democratic conventions with oratory about heart. Last summer, he lamented the economic distress of "millions of Americans who took for granted the basic right to make a living with one's own hands and mind and heart . . ." Is that the "big heart" of which the President spoke in seeking a justice with "a fine mind, good judgment, wide experience in the law and in the problems of real people, and someone with a big heart"? Governor Cuomo has been stingy with executive clemency, even at Christmas. But that deficiency of heart might not hurt him with the former Arkansas Governor who refused to stop four executions. Mr. Cuomo is infamous for carrying bitter grudges, never forgetting or forgiving. That may not disqualify him with Mr. Clinton either.
Mr. Cuomo has intellectual energy and broad public law experience. Whether he can do the work of the Supreme Court, including the quiet slogging over many cases that are anything but cosmic, is a question he himself has raised. Earl Warren comes to mind as a Justice who was rusty on the law but skillful in ways that public service develops. But Mr. Warren, another former Governor, went as Chief Justice, not the junior member who gets up to answer the door at secret conferences.
The President seems to see Mr. Cuomo as a potential peacemaker on the splintered Court. But Mr. Clinton also relishes the spectacle of a Justice Cuomo in verbal bash-ups with another loquacious lawyer from Queens, the right wing's Justice Antonin Scalia. In any case, a little electricity can't hurt.
Retiring Justice Byron White, who will leave at the term's end, has given Mr. Clinton much more time to think about this vacancy than most Presidents are granted. He might well dwell on the qualities of various public figures and how they might mesh with a Court that needs intellectual firepower and more sanity and compassion about issues such as abortion. Mr. Cuomo has firmly endorsed a woman's right to choose, incurring the wrath of the Archbishop of New York and other high-ranking members of Mr. Cuomo's own faith.
To discuss Mario Cuomo at this point is neither to endorse him for the Court nor to wish for his departure from Albany. Yet the notion of a Justice Cuomo stimulates thought, mischievous and solemn, about change.

HEADLINE: FOUR FUTURES FOR RUSSIA

BYLINE: By David K. Shipler; David K' Shipler is a former Moscow bureau chief for The New York Times and the author of "Russia: Broken Idols, Solemn Dreams

 BODY:
Russia is at a painful turning point, facing momentous alternatives but appearing powerless to make a deliberate choice. Its people stand at the junction of their authoritarian traditions and their novel experiment with political freedom; they hover between a state economy and a free market; they are simultaneously bound together and driven apart by their history and their current striving for a new identity.
Hardly any nation's future is more crucial to global well-being than Russia's and hardly any nation's future is more uncertain. After decades of gray, predictable Soviet inertia, the land that sprawls some 6,000 miles from Europe to the Pacific rim churns with volatility. Even tomorrow is a question.
As President Boris Yeltsin and President Clinton were preparing for their summit meeting, scheduled for this weekend, the rising confrontation between Yeltsin and his legislature reached a crescendo. In the absence of a firm constitutional structure, any outcome seemed possible. 
 Clinton, who gave Yeltsin a rousing endorsement, last month proposed increasing American aid to improve Russia's economy and support democracy. But Western assistance cannot be decisive, as helpful as it would be psychologically and materially. Even without Yeltsin, the Russians might continue to lurch toward a democratic, free-market system. And even with him, they might fail. They are destined to find their direction in their own culture and politics, but even these lack definition.
Russia is groping in an ideological wilderness, devoid of the Marxism-Leninism that once served to decode history and chart the future. Gone is the evangelical patriotism that fueled a mighty empire. Vanished is a pride in the past, except among those few who cling to the myths of Communist achievements and czarist glories. The sense of mission has disappeared, and nothing has replaced it.
Religion has not yet overcome its traditional subservience to the state to arise as a comprehensive system of belief. And democracy, an alien idea, is still regarded as little more than a political position, not the deeply rooted set of moral convictions that it must become to flourish.
Into this void swirl the impatient winds of yearning. They batter the fragile structures of free debate, open politics and private enterprise. They pick and nag at every untidy, unfinished part of a work in progress for which no blueprints exist. Russia is suspended among its fears, waiting, it seems, to be propelled along one course or another by forces undefined, uncontrolled.
Hardly any nation's future is more crucial to global well-being than Russia's, and hardly any nation's future is more uncertain. After decades of gray, predictable Soviet inertia, the land that sprawls some 6,000 miles from the edge of Europe to the rim of the Pacific is a cauldron of volatility. No one with a shred of wisdom would claim to foresee what lies ahead. Even tomorrow is a question, for Russia always seems at a turning point these days. [I'll insert here reference to recent developments, such as the outcome of the confrontation between Yeltsin and the Congress of People's Deputies.]
Despite the unknowns, visions can be sketched, parameters drawn, variables calculated as an exercise in thinking through the possibilities. Without making predictions, four plausible scenarios for the future of Russia are presented here.
Simple regression to a Communist state seems unlikely. Although many Russians look back wistfully at the economic security they felt then, the dogma of the Party is discredited, and the old doctrine cannot satisfy the search for a guiding truth. Those who hunger for order, discipline, an encompassing ideology and a firm hand at the top must search elsewhere. That is where we begin, by examining the prospect of dictatorship in another form.
 
I. THE AUTHORITARIAN STATE
The comfortable country dacha is nestled in deep snow that turns blue in the late winter dawn. Boris Yeltsin, still groggy from too much drink the previous night, peers through the frosty panes at the black bones of the birches against the drifts, then he starts. He grips the windowsill.
Poking out from behind a mound of plowed snow at the end of the drive is an oblique angle of blackness--not a truck, not an automobile--some part of an armored personnel carrier? And silhouettes of men in uniform, pacing, stamping against the cold, looking frequently his way.
Yeltsin rushes to the spacious desk in his study, which holds five telephones. He picks up one after another. All dead. It has finally happened. It could be next year, or next week, or tomorrow.
Perhaps the coup has taken place suddenly, like the unsuccessful one in August 1991, with the army moving swiftly at the command of such conservative civilians as Aleksandr Rutskoi, the Vice President, and Ruslan Khasbulatov, Speaker of the Parliament. Since 1992, Rutskoi has given expression to a reviving Russian nationalism, part of that thirst for national meaning. Khasbulatov, who craves power, has tried to use the legislative branch not to check and balance the executive but to take over its functions.
It may be that military leaders, weary of the chaos of the country, have seized the reins of authority themselves. The armed services, once respected on a global scale, have been vilified in the press and disrupted by shortages of funds, internal ethnic tensions and pullbacks from the periphery of the crumbling empire. A breakdown of discipline has inflicted civilian society as well, with the police in retreat and organized crime on the offensive in smuggling, fraud and protection rackets.
Or, perhaps it has been the "creeping coup" of which Moscow politicians have been speaking worriedly: a gradual consolidation of reactionary control over the legislature, or the election of a new Parliament, which in the current mood might be quite nationalistic and conservative. After all, there is a clear answer to the question: Are you better off under Yeltsin than you were under Brezhnev? If a referendum is held, voters may choose a parliamentary over a presidential form of government, allowing a rightist legislature to drain away the power of the President or elect one of their own as national leader.
Those who know Russian history recognize the country's authoritarian tradition as a central factor in the future. Melor Sturua, a veteran columnist for Izvestia and a visiting professor at the University of Minnesota, sees the strong possibility of an ultranationalistic, ultraconservative Russian state supported by the Russian Orthodox Church. In the absence of ideology, Sturua believes, the church is emerging as the only moral authority in the country. And people in the church want a czar in the Kremlin, he says, as a way of regaining their prerevolutionary power. They might support a reactionary Parliament that heads in that direction.
In other words, if Yeltsin, the first popularly elected leader of Russia, proves too large a figure to be removed from office, the office could be removed from him, in effect, by being rendered impotent. He may never have to confront soldiers outside his dacha. Or Yeltsin himself, who has shown autocratic tendencies, could try to dissolve the legislature and impose "emergency rule," which he has intimated he might do.
There are many paths to authoritarianism, all leading through a hard landscape of economic turmoil, ideological emptiness and political disorder; they come out of a traditional Russian affinity for strong leadership and a search for a single idea to unite the nation. Now that Marxism-Leninism is dead, the idea can be a mystical sense of Russian greatness, in which Russian Orthodoxy is the interpreter of Russian history and Russian pride.
If banners and slogans reappear across the broad boulevards leading to the red brick walls of the Kremlin, they are not the red and white calls of Communism but blue and white letters exhorting a mighty Russia to regain its purity: "Russia For Russians!" "God Save Sacred Russia!" "We Shall Never Sell Mother Russia to the Jackals of the West!"
Pamyat, the extreme Russian nationalist organization that surfaced under Gorbachev, gains adherents who preach anti-Semitic and anti-Western conspiracy theories. Scattered assaults are made against Jews. Swastikas appear on apartment doors, and right-wing newspapers print articles blaming Jewish entrepreneurs--as well as Armenians, Georgians, and Asians--for driving up prices and enriching themselves off struggling working people. Cartoons are published with anti-Semitic caricatures of sly businessmen gouging the elderly. Rumors are spread that Yeltsin and his top advisers who advocate liberal economic reform are Jewish and are taking orders from Jewish bankers abroad.
But the most insidious nationalism has worked its way more subtly into the ranks of the colonels, bureaucrats and civilian politicians who strive to control Russia within, reassert its dominance over adjacent lands and recapture its global role as a superpower. The sense grows that Russia is unnaturally truncated and that, as Yeltsin said in early March, Russia ought to police and quell the conflicts in the surrounding former Soviet republics. Here, the ethnocentrism and xenophobia are turned into policy.
The conservatives articulate the moral revulsion toward capitalism felt by many ordinary Russians, the visceral sense that it is simply wrong to amass private property, to employ workers who do not share in profits, to buy goods at one price and sell them for more. Reacting to the hyperinflation that has wracked the country, the state strives to retard the move toward a private economy. Land, the dearest symbol of nationhood, is returned to unyielding state jurisdiction, and private leasing is ended. Small-time entrepreneurs are labeled "speculators" and are rounded up for trial. Rigid customs and monetary restrictions are enforced to curtail the flight of capital and the flow of smuggled goods.
At the same time, however, the government declares its desire to proceed with Western investment, even amid suspicions that the West is trying to buy Russia cheaply, to strip the Motherland of valuable resources. This is an argument that has been made frequently through the years by conservative Communists and then by conservative anti-Communists. Paradoxically, Moscow continues to lobby for Western aid, even as it stakes out a more independent economic and foreign policy. A limited private economic sector is deemed desirable, and many Russians speak admiringly of the Pinochet model in Chile, as they began to do in 1991. As before in Russian history, the goal is to modernize without Westernizing.
The boisterous press that has grown up under Gorbachev and Yeltsin is gradually brought to heel, first by the manipulation of state supplies of newsprint and printing facilities, which squeeze the unfavorable publications and reward those that extol the virtues of the government. State television is drastically revised; hard-hitting documentaries disappear, and the nightly news show--whose old name, "Vremya" (Time), is revived for its nostalgic appeal--mutes its critical reporting and gives increasing voice to a new tone of Russian patriotism.
Such patriotism is really a retreat into elemental ethnic identity. It instills in film and theater a reverence for unblemished Russian village life before the country was tainted by the un-Russian, Western ideas of Marxism and then democracy. It exacerbates the prejudices against non-Russians in the Russians' midst. It animates a popular conviction that the Russian army should defend and rescue Russians who are facing discrimination in Moldova, Lithuania, Tadzhikistan and other former Soviet republics where Communism has been replaced by the governing ideology of ethnocentrism. It encourages a reanimation of the historical Russian drive to expand contiguously, to recapture lands that were lost when the Soviet Union collapsed.
The attachment to what is "Russian" also colors foreign policy, feeding the sullen resentment over Yeltsin's slavish deference to Washington in the Middle East, the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere. Russia resumes extensive arms sales to Syria, breaks with the United States on Iraq, and refuses to back Security Council resolutions that authorize military action against Serbia. Further negotiations on reducing strategic nuclear weapons become difficult.
Outside Yeltsin's dacha, the snows gradually melt away. The guard is thinned out, for Yeltsin comes to understand that he is not going anywhere, that his fate is not to be like that of Gorbachev, who was able to travel and speak and run a think tank after his fall from power. Yeltsin is to be held as Khrushchev was -- in comfortable silence.
 
II. DISINTEGRATION AND CIVIL WAR
Five or ten years from now, when historians try to trace it all back to a single incident, they find the spark in a sad, grimy bar in Ulan-Ude, the poor, industrial city south of Lake Baikal. Ulan-Ude is the capital of Buryatia, a part of the Russian Federation that borders on Mongolia, and whose population is mostly ethnic Mongolian.
Late on a Friday night, the floor of the crowded bar is slippery with mud, tracked in from the spring rains. As usual, the men inside--there are no women there--are a mixed group: Mongols, Russians, Ukrainians, and others. They have come directly after their work in the steel-girder factory nearby; their dinner has been vodka and cognac.
A grizzled Russian in stained overalls lifts his glass in a loud toast. "To Mother Russia!" The Russians drink, but the Mongols look away. Some grumble. "To Mother Russia!" the Russian repeats, raising his glass and catching the eye of a burly Mongol, challenging him to join in the salute. "I said, to Russia!" Now the bar has fallen silent.
Finally the Mongol stands and lifts his glass slowly until it is high above his head. "To our motherland, Buryatia!" he declares, and throws the liquor back in one gulp.
"You chuchmek," the Russian growls. It is the slur applied to Central Asians, but rarely uttered in their presence. It gets immediate results. The Mongol lands a solid punch, and the brawl begins.
Outside, two policemen sit in a patrol car, the engine idling, part of the force that is routinely stationed near bars on weekends. Their windows are rolled up against the chilly evening, and they do not hear the fight until it spills into the street. By then, a few Russians are badly outnumbered by many Mongols, who are pummeling them with fists, kicking them as they sink to the ground. An officer thinks he sees the glint of a knife, and he fires, and then his partner fires, and several Mongols fall dying to the sidewalk.
In a vacuum, the episode would have had little consequence. But this is no vacuum. Throughout the vast Russian Federation, the same centrifugal forces that tore the Soviet Union apart in 1991 are now pulling at Russia itself. Every one of more than twenty ethnic or regional groups, it seems, has carved out a zone of independence. Every one chafes at the chains of control in which Moscow has held them in bondage, from the czarist era through Soviet Communism.
Under Communism, strict economic controls from Moscow's central planners were a source of constant, albeit quiet, complaint. Farms in the distant steppes could grow only the crops they were told by Moscow bureaucrats to grow, regardless of local needs. Polluting factories were erected anywhere, at Moscow's whim. The Siberian city of Yakutsk, where temperatures fall to 40 or 50 below, could not install specially insulated windows and doors in new buildings without permission from Moscow, six time zones away.
The erosion of central authority under Gorbachev, and the acceleration of the decline under Yeltsin, have speeded the fragmentation of Russia into regional fiefdoms. What begins with a struggle for economic autonomy, then, translates quickly into an attachment to language, history, culture, religion, race, ethnicity. And so the episode in the bar spreads rapidly as Buryat Mongols hunt down Russians in the streets, in schools, in apartments. The Russian army mobilizes and confronts the local militia. But the army, too, is fragmented along racial lines, and soldiers are soon fighting against each other. The conflagration spreads to scores of hot spots throughout Russia, and the army cannot contain the breakup of the country. "Ethnic cleansing" takes place, mostly against Russians, but also by Russians in some areas against Central Asians, Armenians and others.
In the year or two after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the vestiges of the Soviet army fought in the brushfire ethnic wars of Georgia, Moldova, Tadzhikistan and elsewhere. So it seems a natural development that reactionary leaders, amid calls to protect the 25 million Russians living outside Russia's borders, send troops against local authorities in Tadzhikistan, Moldova, even Ukraine. And the warfare spreads, threatening to escalate into a devastating confrontation between Russia and Ukraine, which retain their nuclear arsenals.
The fragmentation of Russia could also be relatively peaceful, owing to the simple collapse of central state institutions that began under Gorbachev and continued under Yeltsin. Local warlords, many of them former Communists, raise their own militias, collect their own taxes (which they refuse to send to Moscow), arrange their own economic systems (which maintain intricate trade with Russia) and align themselves with various foreign powers, whether Japan or Iran or China or Western Europe.
The sequence of events is variable. Perhaps the disintegration has been provoked by the imposition of authoritarian, military rule in Moscow. Or, the threat of such fragmentation could deter the rise of dictatorship, as Harley Balzer of Georgetown University believes. Would-be autocrats in Moscow realize that as soon as they tried to establish a dictatorship, he says, defiant regions would immediately break away into dozens of independent countries.
Whether or not the army could prevent this is a matter of debate among experts. Stephen F. Cohen of Princeton sees the military as more capable than Balzer and others believe. Its loyalty is to the idea of Russia, Cohen says, and it still defers to Moscow, unlike other institutions. The army remains encamped in many of the former Soviet republics, he notes, most of whose forces would be no match for Russia's.
However long a breakup might last, it need not be only along ethnic lines, according to Paul Goble, a former State Department specialist now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. The dynamics are different from the Soviet Union's demise, he observes; that was decolonization, whereas Russia is witnessing the death of a state.
Goble predicts that within a year or two, 20 to 30 percent of Russia's territory will no longer be under Moscow's control. The North Caucasian Confederation led by its president, Dzhokhar Dudayev, has already seceded, Goble notes, and he expects the six million Kazan Tatars in the middle Volga region to break away to realize their goal of creating an Idel-Ural Federation. Such a federation would cut European Russia's transportation and communication links with the Russian Far East, which is primarily ethnic Russian and rich in natural resources. The Far East would then spin into independence. But by the end of the century, he foresees a nationalist Russia expanding again to recapture the lost territories, in what could be ugly warfare.
In the meantime, virtually all Russians have fled Buryatia, piling into Russian cities as refugees, ill-housed and jobless. They fuel a rising indignation and a lust for revenge.
The bar in Ulan-Ude has only Mongolian patrons now, and the blue, white and red Russian flag has been taken off the wall. But not forever.
 
III. DEMOCRACY AND A MARKET ECONOMY
In twenty or twenty-five years, when Muscovites enter the small, curtained voting booths, they do so with a sense of confidence that their voices will be heard. It is now their fifth or sixth presidential election, and they are beginning to believe in the stability of a democratic system that has provided repeatedly for the peaceful transition of political power from one leader to another.
To sketch this rosy scenario is to describe the enormous distance that Russia must travel. Every element in the optimistic picture is roughly the opposite of what exists today.
In this hopeful future, a number of parties have emerged, including the Communists on the left, European-style Social Democrats, conservative business-oriented groups and right-wing ultranationalists. After years of undisciplined speechifying and uncoordinated politicking, a certain coherence has come to the parties, and they are acting roughly as units, representing an array of constituencies.
Lobbyists, so vilified in the West but so essential as middlemen between interest groups and government, have finally evolved to fill what had been a yawning gap. Environmentalists have their action committees, as do entrepreneurs, factory owners, farmers, transportation interests, tenants' organizations, and others who have business with the Parliament. They can now be heard by the legislators as never before.
The legislators themselves have staff, as they did not previously. As a result of visits to Congress by Russian lawmakers during the Gorbachev and Yeltsin years, a Russian version of the Congressional Research Service, modeled after that agency in Washington, has been established with American aid so that members of Parliament can rapidly acquire budget, tax, and legal information to help them make informed decisions. The executive branch accepts its obligation to provide accurate data.
The tone of debate has improved. It is still raucous at times, but less malicious and more prone to compromise; no longer does a politician try to destroy everyone who disagrees with him. Legislators are more prepared to form coalitions to get measures enacted than in earlier years, when every individual seemed to have his own agenda. A healthy dynamic of check and balance has grown up between the legislature and the President, without either trying to usurp the powers of the other.
At the local level, a civic society is developing, with growing involvement by ordinary citizens in their town and neighborhood governments, where the impact of their activities is most immediately felt. They plan land usage, clean up polluting industries and relegate manufacturing to non-residential districts. They channel private housing into well-organized living areas and improve public transportation. Voluntary and charitable organizations multiply. The visible changes that people can make to their immediate environment encourage others to participate, and a true political culture gradually emerges.
Because young people who were teenagers during Gorbachev's liberalization came to intellectual maturity in an atmosphere of free inquiry and discussion, they have become a generation resistant to oppression. They have grown up accustomed to speaking candidly, a habit reinforced by more open schooling and the robust press. The longer the freedom lasts, the broader the constituency for free speech will be, the more animated the forum of competing ideas will become, the more difficult the task for any aspiring dictator.
Along with a new respect for the concept of checks and balances and separation of powers, an independent judiciary arises. Professional judges are now immune to the old system of "telephone justice," in which a Communist Party secretary simply picked up the phone to get his desired verdict. Although some of the judges are holdovers from the Soviet system, they relish the right to exercise their own minds, and they grow to fill their new roles.
Protections of defendants' rights finally take hold. At long last, the police and the courts are observing the law, passed under Gorbachev, that provides access to a defense attorney immediately after arrest, rather than after interrogation and investigation. This requires serious police work and an end to the earlier reliance on forced confessions. Police morale is damaged for a while and crime soars, but after some years police professionalism improves, and citizens begin to have faith in the impartiality of the criminal justice system.
The Constitutional Court, created under Yeltsin, is strengthened as the first body in Russian history with the power to decide on the constitutionality of legislative or executive actions. Modeled on the United States Supreme Court, it brings an aura of legality to a society that has never embraced the rule of law.
In the economic sphere, Russia moves increasingly toward private markets. After long debates and political battles, laws are finally passed permitting land to be owned, bought and sold by private individuals or institutions, without restrictions. The ruble is made fully convertible, repatriation of profits by foreign businesses is allowed, government red tape is stripped away, and investment pours in from manufacturers in the United States, Western Europe, Japan and the Middle East. Consumer protection laws are enacted and enforced.
With its wealth of natural resources, cheap labor and scientific talent, Russia becomes a prosperous complement to Western economies and enjoys a slow but steady rise in the standard of living, especially in the cities.
Moscow's foreign policy remains closely aligned with Washington's as Russia becomes a durable ally of the United States in defusing trouble spots abroad and, ultimately, providing aid to developing countries.
And in the voting booths, Russians still use paper ballots, continuing the old practice of crossing out the names of the candidates they oppose.
 
IV. MUDDLING THROUGH
Nothing has changed in the Siberian village of Nizhneangarsk. Woodburning stoves still heat the log cabins, fighting the frost on the insides of the walls. The shelves of the town's only store are usually barren of red meat and green vegetables. Villagers survive on potatoes, spaghetti, bread, canned tomato sauce, half-rotten cabbages and, on occasion, fatty pork rind and canned fish. The schools are poor, and people still try to find their way to the cities, where crime is rampant but goods are more plentiful. A decade from now, life in such remote villages is still considered fitting punishment for criminals, who continue to be exiled there.
Except for a new class of wealthy entrepreneurs, Russians face hardships that have not eased appreciably after years of hesitant reform. The economy remains a mixture of state ownership and private enterprise as authorities try to blend the efficiency of the market with the social protections of the welfare state. Transportation, mining, the weapons industry and most other heavy manufacturing remain in the hands of government, although officials and former officials enrich themselves by funneling goods into the private marketplace. Entrepreneurs have begun producing some consumer items--clothing, furniture, toys, books, music tapes and the like--but private businessmen are involved mostly in stealing state-made goods and selling them.
Agriculture remains largely under the jurisdiction of collective farms or state farms, for very few individual farmers have been willing to risk going out on their own. Inconsistent government policies have undermined confidence; farmers permitted to lease land one year have been thwarted by local officials the next. Only half steps have been taken toward private land ownership--acreage must be held at least a decade before being sold, for example--and farmers have no network of financial institutions from which they can get loans.
Western investment has been fitful and uneven, partly because of Russian ambivalence toward foreign businesses, partly because of Western reluctance to provide enough aid to guarantee loans and stabilize the ruble. Yeltsin and his successors recoiled from the "shock therapy"--the rapid privatization of the economy--demanded by the International Monetary Fund as a condition of assistance.
Politically, Russia is neither a dictatorship nor a full-fledged democracy. It stumbles from crisis to crisis, along what seems to many Russians the brink of anarchy. No new Russian constitution has been written because the atmosphere has been too contentious; the old, Soviet document has merely been amended into a patchwork of provisions. The legislative and executive branches continue to vie for dominance, but in their maneuvers have brought about a crude balance of power. The economic tribulations and the specter of political disorder promote an illiberal mood in the public, but the spirit of open debate remains pervasive. The press remains irreverent.
For years, Russia's enormous problems have looked like volatile chemicals that must eventually transform themselves by decaying or exploding. The notion that they can continue indefinitely, without resolution, has seemed improbable. But Stephen F. Cohen, the Princeton historian, takes a long perspective, cautioning that Russia moves very slowly, usually in gray areas where dichotomies and clear-cut categories do not exist. The issues and choices can remain undecided for a long time, he believes, and Russia's course can consist of zig-zags of advance and retreat; even if democracy and the private economic sector grow, the country will find its own particular formulas and not adopt those of the United States.
Russia is caught in competing impulses that coexist with each other: an opening to the West and a xenophobia, an embrace of political pluralism and a deep desire for order and authority, an infatuation with the free market and a revulsion over its methods and results. These uneasy contradictions may describe the most likely scenario of all.
And the hard winters still come to the village of Nizhneangarsk.

THE WORST TEAM MONEY COULD BUY
The Collapse
of the New York Mets.
By Bob Klapisch
and John Harper.
304 pp. New York:
Random House. $21. 
 THE Mets championship teams of 1969 and 1986 seem to have spawned a shelf of books each, but "The Worst Team Money Could Buy" very likely will be the only clothbound yearbook for the franchise's 1992 season. And mercifully so: the '92 Mets, with a team payroll of $44.5 million, won just 72 of 162 games -- surely fewer victories per dollar than any team in baseball history, even allowing for inflation. A team with 13 millionaires on its roster finished 10th in the National League in earned-run average, 10th in scoring, 11th in home runs and 9th in fielding.
Living through the season was like enduring six months of water torture divided into 162 nasty drops. And that was just the regular season. Two New York sportswriters who covered the Mets last year -- Bob Klapisch for The Daily News and John Harper for The New York Post -- take the reader from the preseason trades of disgruntled star players through accusations of gang rape to enough petty feuds and squabbles to fuel a soap opera. All you want to know about the Mets' 1992 season is in "The Worst Team Money Could Buy," as well as a few things you may not want to know and quite a few things you would never have thought to ask.
In one sense Mr. Klapisch and Mr. Harper have done their job. They detail the arrogance, egomania and ineptitude that helped create the 1992 fiasco, like the misguided paternalism of the front office that dismantled a championship team and the staggering immaturity of semiskilled millionaires like Gregg Jefferies and Vince Coleman.
On the other hand, "The Worst Team Money Could Buy" at times is more excruciating to read than the season was to live through. Despite occasional nods to the players' humanity -- it is refreshing to read something nice about Gary Carter, and Darryl Strawberry tells how he is praying for his father's recovery from a heart attack -- the book seems driven by dislike and envy of its subjects. Page after page bombards the reader with phrases like "money-inflated egos," "overpaid prima donnas," "spoiled ballplayers," "pampered, irresponsible millionaire ballplayers," "excuse-making ballplayers," "over indulged millionaire ballplayer" -- well, you get the idea. And if you don't, you certainly will after Mr. Klapisch reports that he "gawked" at the paycheck a laughing Dwight Gooden waved in front of his face.
"The Worst Team Money Could Buy" never comes to grips with the fact that the enormous sums baseball players now earn have changed the role of the newspaper beat writer. To their credit, the authors acknowledge that beat writers no longer just report the news but are having an increasingly greater influence on the shaping of it. (In one bizarre vignette, the Mets' then manager, Davey Johnson, calls a peace meeting between Mr. Klapisch, his colleague Mike Lupica and the Mets' first baseman, Keith Fernandez, whom Mr. Lupica had called "the Prince of Darkness.") Newspapers are no longer the primary source for descriptions of games, as they were in, say, Ring Lardner's day, when players and writers traveled, ate and played cards together, and when players' off-field exploits were taboo subjects for news columns. Today it seems that beat writers more and more cover teams to explore the players' private lives and to offer judgments about players' character (or lack of it). Friction between press and players, especially in New York, seems inevitable. One wonders if it isn't beginning to grate on readers.
Certainly the preoccupation with ballplayers' money and morals in "The Worst Team Money Could Buy" can grate on the reader. As Florida prosecutors neared a decision on whether to prosecute the Mets pitcher David Cone on rape charges, the authors write, "scandal-frenzied journalists spent the game hanging around the press box, bored by the mundane matters of baseball." Unfortunately, this description is appropriate far too often for Mr. Klapisch and Mr. Harper. They frequently seem to regard any baseball issue that does not concern sex or money as uninteresting. "As a whole," they write, without apparent irony, "journalists tend to get self-righteous in these kinds of matters." Correct -- as a whole, and sometimes in pairs.

HEADLINE: 'I Want' Now Gets

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla

 BODY:
POWER to the people. The little people, that is.
Marketers and some decidedly grown-up interest groups have discovered that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line: straight from advertisers to children who will use a product. 
 It's a pragmatic strategy based on a simple truth: Now that mom is away from home nearly as often as dad is, there isn't much point in fashioning media messages that follow the traditional route from advertiser to parent to child. Why bother explaining to mom the proportions of water to Kool-Aid mix when it's junior who's mixing the stuff in the first place?
"Kids are making more and more purchasing decisions," said Arthur I. Pober, director of the Children's Advertising Review Unit of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. "Because of that, they're being marketed to directly, and that gives them consumer power."
It doesn't mean that parents aren't buying for their children; they are, and at a furious pace. But where Ozzie and Harriet once decided what size blue jeans to pick up for Ricky, today mom and dad are seeking their children's opinions -- or letting the children make purchasing decisions on their own.
"The family unit has changed dramatically, with parents vying for the approval of their kids," Mr. Pober said. "It puts kids in a very powerful role."
Even when parents are doing the spending, the discretionary money tends to flow into children's items, not into adult goods. James U. McNeal, professor of marketing at Texas A & M University, who has overseen 30 years of spending surveys on the 4-to-12-year-old set, says parents and children are on a spending spree. In a telephone survey of 120 parents last Christmas, he said, most parents told him they were holding back on spending "except for the kids."
Children themselves have more money to spend, even as their parents' disposable income declines -- a function of both guilt and a quest by parents to make children more independent.
Marketers are taking note as this increasingly powerful consumer group takes shape, said Jim Williams of the Williams Inference Service in Longmeadow, Mass., which has been counseling clients on the emerging "child power" theme and how to exploit it. "You've got a two-member earning situation or a broken home," Mr. Williams said, "which means that the adults are just plain not there much. Children, as clever as they are, can take advantage of the situation."
So can adults with a product or a message to sell. Eleven cruise lines were pitching family vacations at last count, Mr. Williams said, while restaurants are wooing young customers with everything from crayons at the table to full-screen cartoons.
It was just a matter of time before someone invented a word to describe the marketing hullabaloo over children. "Filiarchy," Professor McNeal calls it. Lou Pinkowitz, vice president of market development at Kid Care, a child's toiletry maker, points to "the G factor" -- runaway guilt. "There are more and more working mothers, and one of the things we know that generates is guilt," Mr. Pinkowitz said.
Enhancing the G factor is the phenomenon of women postponing childbearing to allow their careers to develop. "It doesn't take an economist to tell you that if you postpone satisfaction, it's more important to you when it finally comes," Professor McNeal said.
Children are also spending more money on themselves. "Kids are in day care much younger, which gives them greater independence," Mr. Pinkowitz said. And because many working parents leave their older children for long stretches, a number of parents are beefing up allowances so that youngsters can shop for their own clothes or snacks, Professor McNeal said.
Lest there be any doubt that we are talking about real dollars, Professor McNeal's most recent survey of 1,440 families, in 1991, found that the 34 million children in the 4-to-12 age group had a combined income of $14.4 billion, of which they spent $9 billion. On a weekly basis, that is an average income of $8.13 a child, of which the youngster spends $4.90, Professor McNeal said.
The fastest-growing spending categories were shoes and clothing, which accounted for 13 percent of children's 1991 spending, up from a level so minuscule in the 1988 survey that it was lumped in a "miscellaneous" category. Parents are spending an additional $146 billion on everything from vacations to videos at their children's behest.
And the ranks of the young and spendthrift are growing. A Rand Youth Poll released last September found that teen-agers spent $58.9 billion in 1992 -- a key year, since it marked a reversal in the declining number of teen-agers in America. "They're making $40 and $50 buying decisions for video cartridges," said Michael Lyden, senior vice president for marketing at Tyco Toys in Mount Laurel, N.J. "Kids above 8 are buying with their 'own money' that came from mom and dad. And in the standard toy business," he said, including items such as dolls and toy trains, "we're losing kids earlier."
In many respects, child consumers have become more sophisticated, but the marketing pros who study children's buying habits say that the sophistication tends to be very shallow.
Rita Underberg, clinical professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Rochester Medical Center, says parents can make the most of the family financial arrangement by insuring that not all gifts are in the form of money or material objects. Give things "that cannot be measured and that cost no money," she advises, such as reading an extra story at bedtime.
Parents should also consider limiting how much children can spend and what they can spend it on. Ms. Underberg suggests that parents make it clear that there are negotiable and non-negotiable issues when it comes to purchases. "I never think a kid should have more than five bucks sitting around in the house," she said, "so the non-negotiable part is that more than five bucks goes into the bank." The negotiable issue could be that the children can choose between two toys.
Older children should have more leeway, Ms. Underberg believes, though she urges parents never to permit "things in their home that make them feel uncomfortable," including pornographic magazines.
This does not mean that adults should strip their children of all their purchasing power and influence, psychologists say; many parents agree. "My mother-in-law used to say to my wife, 'Why are you asking the kids what they want for lunch?' " Mr. Pinkowitz recalled. "My wife said, 'If they can't make decisions about what they want for lunch, they can't make decisions about what class to take or what job to have.' Little decisions make it easier for them to make bigger decisions."

HEADLINE: Disrespect Rules

BYLINE: By Felicia R. Lee

 BODY:
WHEN Richard Wallman walks the halls of John Marshall High School in Rochester, he never knows what he might see or hear. There are students who look right through him when he talks. There are students who use obscenities when they tell him to get lost. There are students who threaten each other with weapons while he is in within earshot.
Mr. Wallman, a soft-spoken man, says he expects a little more; after all, he is the principal. Yet last year he watched in disbelief as one student shot another at the school, evidently over a cassette player. 
 "There seems to be a lack of respect from a good number of students," he said. "Kids come into the high schools not as prepared as they should be, and they get turned off very easily. I think a lot of it is frustration. Then the summer before last we had more fatal shootings than ever before in the city, and what happens in the school just mirrors what happens in the city."
What is happening in Rochester is also happening in San Francisco, Chicago and almost every city in the nation. Students, educators, parents and people with a finger on the pulse of social trends say there has been a severe erosion of respect among many young people for schools, teachers and each other. While those students may well be in the minority, experts say, there are enough of them to sour everyone's school experience.
The disrespect includes rampant violence in inner-city schools, but also occurs in suburban schools where teachers bemoan the students' emphasis on grades instead of knowledge -- sometimes expressed as a belief that teachers owe them the good grades needed to enter competitive colleges.
In all types of schools, teachers and principals complain about students who openly talk back to them using vulgar language or only slightly veiled sarcasm.
It is, however, the violence that has everyone most concerned. Every day, 100,000 children take guns to school. Every day, 6,250 teachers are threatened and 260 are attacked. Every day, 14,000 young people are attacked on school property. Every day, 160,000 children miss school because of the fear of violence.
These statistics, from the United States Department of Justice and the National Association of School Psychologists, provide a sketch of the pain, fear and anger pervading schools. And they go far in explaining why teachers talk about changing professions and students talk openly about carrying weapons for protection.
"This is part of the culture," said Carol Nagy Jacklin, a psychologist and dean of social science and communications at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles. "Aggression and violence are plentiful and there is a general problem of not respecting elders. I'm not sure we ever did. Moreover, in general the culture doesn't respect teachers. We pay more to parking-lot attendants.
"The problem is even more exaggerated for children raised in the drug culture and inner-city areas," Ms. Jacklin said. "They're often raising each other and themselves. They're not getting all the mores they've always gotten about respect, punctuality, the value of life."
Linda Floyd, on leave after teaching for 24 years at Marshall High in Rochester, said she reached the end of her rope when, several months after suspending a 19-year-old ninth grader for slamming a door on her, she read in the newspaper that the former student was part of a gang of 15 people arrested for beating a boy to death; they apparently wanted his jacket.
"It's gotten to the point where they're defiant, disruptive and dangerous," Mrs. Floyd said, adding that she had become emotionally drained by the demands of teaching. "I was bitten by a girl when I tried to break up a fight," she said. "I've been stepped on and pushed around. The verbal abuse and the emotional abuse are the things that have bothered me most of all."
Frank Mickens, the principal of Boys and Girls High School in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, said it was the relative absence of violence at his inner-city school, where students have gone on to Ivy League colleges, that had won Boys and Girls a national reputation for working against the odds.
The success has had a price. Mr. Mickens has banned decorative gold tooth caps and expensive jewelry and coats from the school to cut down on theft. In the mornings and afternoons at dismissal he patrols the school's perimeter to prevent drug dealers and other outsiders from approaching students. Each semester he expels scores of students who refuse to obey rules by fighting or cutting classes. On the other hand, the school spends a great deal of time honoring students who do well.
"We service seven or eight of the toughest housing projects in the city," Mr. Mickens said. "I have a simple proposition: This is my house. I'm 46 years old. A 15-year-old is not going to dictate to me how this school is run."
Ladeeta Smith, a college-bound senior at the school, said it was naive to expect students who do not respect their parents to respect teachers. She said many parents were so overwhelmed by their own problems that they were ineffective as guardians and role models.
This disrespect toward all adults, she said, means never publicly deferring to authority lest one lose respect among peers. "I think a lot of time they have to put up a show," Ms. Smith said. "Deep down, they would really like respect from teachers and to respect them in turn."
In places like Westhill High School in Stamford, Conn., where the student body ranges from low-income children of the housing projects to the upper middle class, disrespect is more nuanced. While a shooting would be a shocking occurrence at West hill, a fairly sedate school, negative student feelings about teachers are expressed in other ways, like sarcasm and pressure for good grades.
"If the kid who believes he is an A student gets a B, watch out," said Frank Donatucci, a guidance counselor. "They know what it takes to get into those colleges."
Michael Miller, a senior at Westhill, says that while he sees less respect for adults, students are often only acting in their best interests in a competitive academic and economic climate. He says that parents also push their children and the teachers for good grades.
The situation at Marshall High in Rochester deteriorated to the point that the district brought in David Hursh, a professor of education at the University of Rochester, to help teachers and student teachers deal with the conflicts. Professor Hursh says he found that students were suffering as much as teachers.
Most of Marshall's student population is black or Puerto Rican from low-income households. Half the student body drops out before graduating. Professor Hursh found from his interviews that many students felt that the teachers often did not respect them because of race or economic background and that their schools expected little from them. "When kids see that their school is dirty, there are not enough desks or materials, what kind of message are you giving?" he said.
"In the 50's," Professor Hursh observed, "middle-class kids like me sat through classes and jumped through the hoops because they knew at the end there were jobs. These kids don't believe there are jobs at the end."
Erin Thompson, a junior at Marshall, agreed that some black students felt that white teachers looked down on them because of race. "I think a lot of students come to school angry and they're venting their frustration," Mr. Thompson said. "School is just where they are five days a week."

HEADLINE: EX MACHINA;
Computer-to-Go Generation

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
EVER SINCE the start of the microcomputer revolution, educators and parents have entertained a fantasy ideal of a computer on every child's desk. But as schools become more technologically savvy, that idea is slowly evolving into a more practical notion of classrooms using a mixture of a few powerful desktop systems and many portable machines.
Some schools, especially at the college level, recommend and in some cases require that students carry portable machines, like laptop or notebook computers. The Harvard Business School, recognizing that graduates will be increasingly on the go, is among many standardizing on portables.
 
Supplemental Tools
 But even at the elementary-school level, notebook and laptop computers are getting new attention, not necessarily as replacements for desktop systems but as supplemental, mobile tools. 
 "Schools are nibbling at Powerbooks and laptops," said Sal Capozzi, product manager for elementary and secondary schools at the research firm Market Data Retrieval in Shelton, Conn., which recently concluded a survey of technology purchasing plans at hundreds of school districts nationwide.
Even a year ago, notebook computers were viewed by many educators as impractical. They lacked color displays, and color is important for most elementary and secondary school educational software. But the need for color on the portable is less if there is a color desktop system nearby, and some of the newer notebooks can be attached to an external color monitor. Also, in the last year, virtually every maker of notebook computers has added a color-screen option.
A larger concern was that portables were expensive, with consumers paying a premium for portability. A Zenith Data Systems Corporation Z-Note 325Lp color notebook computer costs $2,224 when purchased by schools, for example. It has an 85-megabyte hard-disk drive and a 386SL microprocessor. A comparable desktop machine can be had for half that price.
On the other hand, the Z-Note price is remarkable considering that color notebooks cost at least $4,000 just a year ago, before the microcomputer price war began; that's less than the price of last year's desktop models, though still costly for financially pressed districts.
The best-selling computer in the world today, Apple Computer Inc.'s Powerbook, is even costlier, ranging in price from about $2,000 to $5,000 and up.
"It's still at a point where the cost is prohibitive for widespread use," said Susan Harman, chief author of "Educational Technology, a Catalyst for Change," a research report by the investment firm Robertson, Stephens & Company of San Francisco. "They really have to get to the point -- I'd say $1,000 -- to start widespread adoption."
Price alone is an incomplete benchmark, says Marilyn Feltenberger, who directs educational sales for Zenith Data, of Buffalo Grove, Ill. "When the lights are turned off at the school, the desktop computers are not being used," Mrs. Feltenberger said. "That's not necessarily a wise use of the taxpayer's dollars. Although the initial outlay for a desktop might be lower, on a pennies-per-hour-of-use basis, the portable is more economical."
"But it shouldn't only be a dollar issue," Mrs. Feltenberger said. "The goal of computers is to enhance the learning of the individual or teacher, and it's not enhancing their learning a bit when they don't have it at home doing the homework at night or on weekends. The portables offer mobility and usage 24 hours a day."
 
Security a Concern
 But the idea of sending a $2,000 portable home with a student, or even leaving one sitting around a classroom, scares the most stalwart administrators. Many notebooks have built-in security locks, and in schools where notebooks are used, it is common to lock them in the school safe at night.
But David Dwyer, project manager for Apple's Learning Technologies Group, says, "One thing I've learned is that if the kids are given the opportunity to be responsible, it's amazing how responsible they are."
Mr. Dwyer said that in schools where security is of primary importance, where computers are bolted to table tops and chained, the highest incidence of vandalism occurs. "The message is, 'We don't trust you with this device and it's the property of the school,' " he said. "The message in the other world is, 'Here, kids, here's a grown-up, professional tool that's going to enable you to do something that you can't do in any other way. Take care of it.' At schools where students are given responsibility, vandalism is virtually zero."
In her report, Ms. Harman of Robertson, Stephens speculated on the school of the year 2000. Notebook computers were key: "Using portable computer notebooks connected to the central work station with video disks, CD-ROM's, network access and digital libraries, students are exploring their community and the world to
present detail about their project. By simply creating and selecting video, sound, text and graphic images that appear on the screen, students construct an exciting presentation."
The report concludes: "Sound like science fiction? In reality, the technologies are here today. Their implementation will accelerate as society addresses the need to restructure schools and to use technology as a catalyst for change."
Obviously, implementing these technologies will also go faster as computer prices decline so that schools can better afford them. "The only certain speculation is that prices in the computer industry continue to go down," Ms. Harman said.
Indeed, at Ward Chapel Primary, an elementary school in Middlesboro, Ky., Betty Helton's first-, second- and third-grade students are preparing to use Powerbook computers provided by Apple as a grant for a project on transportation. Working in teams, they will also use video camcorders to create a report on local fire trucks, ambulances, police cars and other vehicles. The portables allow them to go where the learning takes place.
Apple provided her class with five Powerbooks and a desktop Macintosh as part of a broader experiment in finding successful classroom arrangements of computers. "I can't believe all the opportunities the Powerbooks provide us," Mrs. Helton said. "It has enhanced the educational experience."

HEADLINE: College Majors Often Prove Minor

BYLINE: By Margo Kaufman

 BODY:
IN THESE judgmental times, when you are what you eat, wear and drive, it's comforting to think back on those simple days in college, when all you were was your major. On campus, a field of emphasis was a trusty Rorschach test: A declaration of electrical engineering meant a nerd with a pocket protector; business, a loud fraternity brother with a sweatshirt and loafers without socks; philosophy, a head-in-the-clouds intellectual who was disconnected from life.
But while the common stereotypes often ring true -- sociology majors do tend to be liberals, premeds serious and music majors dressed in black -- conversations with graduates from all walks of life reveal that a degree is not destiny.
 
Manzi? Classics?
 For instance, Jim Manzi, president and chief executive officer of Lotus Development, the second-largest software company in the world, studied classics at Colgate. Roger Corman, the Louis B. Mayer of B Movies, earned his degree in engineering at Stanford, and Jonathan Winters, the comedian, and Patrick Ewing, the center for the Knicks, both majored in art -- at Kenyon and Georgetown, respectively. 
 "To be honest, I majored in golf," said Jon Winokur, who insists he was more often found playing the course at Temple University than working at courses in his ostensible major, political science. The author and compiler of numerous books, including "The Portable Curmudgeon Redux," Mr. Winokur says his time on the links was not in vain. "It taught me that golf is ruinously expensive even if you don't gamble."
Greta Martin took a bachelor's degree in mathematics at Spelman College, but no calculator swings from her garter belt in her current job as a Hot Box Girl in the Broadway musical "Guys and Dolls." "People always love to tease dancers about not being able to count to eight, but I can count eight and a lot more," said Ms. Martin, adding that her analytical background helped her learn dance routines more quickly.
In the same way, Julie Sahni, a chef and author of "Classic Indian Cooking," credits her study of architecture and urban planning at Columbia with giving her an analytical approach to food. "There's a belief that food is all approximation and feeling," Ms. Sahni said, "but when you want to translate that into a language so that you can teach other people, it helps to be able to codify."
 
A Media Game
 Sam Perkins, the forward who is now with the Seattle SuperSonics, says his University of North Carolina degree in communications (an area of expertise often in evidence under the backboard) made it easier to deal with the media.
And Bob Garfield, a commentator for National Public Radio, said his English major at Penn State insured that he would never have to wear a three-piece suit and tasseled loafers. "The day I graduated I was utterly untrained and untrainable, and thoroughly ill prepared for any kind of adult pursuit," he said. "Which of course forced me into journalism, which requires no skills."
Perhaps there are two types of people: those who spring from the womb knowing what they want to do with their lives, and the rest of us. The focused include New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, who majored in American history at Princeton, knowledge that may not have been useful in his previous job with the Knicks trying to hit from the outside; George Lucas, who majored in film at the University of Southern California; the actress Frances Sternhagen, who studied theater at Vassar -- but only because she was getting C's in history and a professor steered her away from a fact-dependent department, and Dr. Joyce Brothers, whose Cornell degree is in psychology.
Actually, she took a dual major with home economics. "One of my final exams was making a Napoleon, for which we had to roll out 18 or 20 layers of dough," Dr. Brothers recalled recently. "I sweated that."
Wafflers who didn't declare a major until senior year -- most likely under threat that they could not graduate if they didn't make a decision -- can take solace in the fact that students who are very decisive often cannot tolerate ambiguity, so they make up their minds prematurely. "They don't like to deviate from what they perceive is the correct way," said Gary Emery, a psychologist and the director of the Los Angeles Center for Cognitive Therapy. The goal-oriented, he said, may set a course as early as grade school, though some people seem to have assembled resumes in kindergarten.
"Actually it was prenatal, second trimester," said Stuart Brotman, a former communications major who advises executives in the communications industry. By high school, Mr. Brotman says, he was so certain of his calling that he chose Northwestern University because it had a program that would enable him to work in his field before graduation.
People like this can be really intimidating to people like the rest of us who end up making excuses for having stumbled into our current professions much as we luck into a great pair of shoes on sale. In our defense, while we may not have a map, we do have a sense of direction. Ellen Gould, a sociology major at Brandeis turned actress, recently starred in "Bubbe Meises, Bubbe Stories," a one-woman play she wrote about the lives and stories of her grandmothers, which, she said, is "essentially the sociology of a generation."
Lori Cole, who designs computer games, drew from her degree in elementary education (tempered with art courses) at Arizona State to create her "Quest for Glory" fantasy adventure series, in which an apprentice hero learns to fulfill increasingly difficult tasks, like saving a small kingdom.
 
Perfecting Deception
 The magician Harry Blackstone Jr. says his theater arts/ communications major at the University of Southern California suited him well for his current work -- making elephants disappear. "Magic is the great theatrical art of what if," he said. "And since I minored in journalism and spent some time in politics I had the perfect background for the art of deception."
Blanche Roberts, the national pug breeder of the year, majored in drama at Syracuse with a minor in education. It's proved very useful now that she's judging, she said, because the ring is like a little classroom. "You tell people where to go and what to do, and they obey," she said. "And it's helped me speak clearly: 'Go to the end of the line,' and, 'The winning bitch is . . .' "
Of course, some people are stuck with majors that were dictated not by preference or by default but the times. "I majored in revolutionary anarchy," said Deborah Levin, an artist's representative and Goddard College alumna. While Ms. Levin concedes that her courses showed her how to be a free thinker and take risks, her studies had a lingering drawback. "It makes it impossible to lie about my age," she said.

Bungee Jumping

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
'One scene from the last Judson Welliver Society meeting stayed with me," writes Mary Kate Cary, recollecting the assemblage of former White House speech writers, of which she is one. When that ghostly gathering learned that President Clinton had reviewed a speech on the prompter for the first time only minutes before air time, she notes, Anthony Snow, with whom she served on the Bush staff, exclaimed, "That's bungee jumping!"
As the group chuckled, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. -- a Kennedy adviser and writer, and the coiner of such phrases as "the Imperial Presidency," "the vital center" and "permanent government" -- turned to Tony Dolan, the author of Ronald Reagan's "evil empire" phrase, to ask, "What's bungee jumping?" 
 "Tony explained something about people tying a rope around themselves and jumping off a cliff," Ms. Cary recalls. "Schlesinger peered through his glasses at Tony for a time, and made a 'harrumph' noise."
The sound, I think, was not a disapproving har rumph; it was more of a hmpf of wonderment from a lover of vivid metaphors.
A few days later, the phrase was back in the news. Dick Thornburgh, the former Attorney General who spent a year decompressing as United Nations Under Secretary for Administration and Management, issued a farewell report that described the financing of peacekeeping operations as "much like a financial 'bun gee jump,' often undertaken in blind faith that timely appropriations will be forthcoming." A New York Times editorial on this subject was titled "Bungee Jumping at the U.N.," which The International Herald Tribune improved with "Enough Bungee Jumping."
Bungee, which is sometimes spelled bungie, is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary Supplement as British slang for "india rubber." A 1934 citation says, "The piece of india-rubber for erasing purposes was referred to as 'india-bungie' or 'bungie.' "
However, Punch Coomaraswamy, a former Singapore Ambassador to the United States, who grew up in a Malaysian rubber-growing area, challenged this assumption and sent me an entry from Hobson-Jobson, a glossary of colloquial Anglo-Indian words that defined bangy, rooted in the Sanskrit vihangama, as "a shoulder-yoke for carrying loads, the yoke or bangy resting on the shoulder, while the load is apportioned at either end in two equal weights, and generally hung by cords."
Other Lexicographic Irregulars have noted the word used for elastic ties for parachutes -- "we always snapped those bun gies to make sure they still had their elasticity" -- and in a 1946 book, Theodore H. White described a model airplane driven by a propeller worked by a rubber band as "her wretched bun gee airplane."
Whatever the correct etymology, the ideas of elasticity and load-bearing cords are present. We are now ready for a bungee jump.
You are hoisted high aloft by a crane or attain some altitude in your hot-air balloon. Attached to your ankle is a bungee cord, a thick elastic that is also tied to your jumping-off point. You then leap, screaming, into the blue; well before you hit the ground, the elastic cord begins restraining your fall, until you are bouncing up and down. After a while, you are just hanging there, gently bobbing, and your friend at the jumping-off point hauls you back in.
"Modern bungee jumping," The New York Times reported in 1991, "using the wrist-thick bundles of rubber strands wrapped in woven nylon, was born on April Fool's Day, 1979, when members of the Oxford Dangerous Sports Club attached bungee cords to themselves and dived from the 245-foot Clifton Bridge in Bristol, England." At the time, The Sunday Telegraph quoted one member as saying, "Quite pleasurable, really."
Its current political and financial meaning, Professor Schlesinger: Any unnecessarily risky undertaking, especially a stunt that gives the participant a feeling of living dangerously and onlookers a thrill of trepidation.
 
 
SATAN'S HOMETOWN
 WHAT'S GOT INTO Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan -- doesn't he know how to spell? Doesn't Oxford University Press have a proofreader?
"Pandaemonium" is the title of his 16th book; this one, about the ethicity of ethnicity, argues that self-determination is undermining the harmony of mixed cultures. Pandemonium -- the word, not the Moynihan title -- is a word that takes tumult and uproar to their outer limits, a condition of all hell breaking loose. It should be spelled, of course, pandemonium, without the a before the e.
But wait: the very thought of the breaking-loose of hell gives us a clue to the author's intention. Pandaemonium is a place. Pan- is a Greek combining form meaning "all"; demon ium is a gathering of demons. John Milton, in his 1667 masterpiece, "Paradise Lost," coined the word, writing of "the walls of Pan daemonium, Citie and proud seate of Lucifer." The Devil called for "A solemn Councel forthwith to be held/At Pandaemonium, the high Capital/Of Satan and his Peers."
The ae lasted until Thomas Carlyle, in his 1831 "Sartor Resartus," wrote of those who "in this hag-ridden dream, mistake God's fair living world for a pallid, vacant Hades and extinct Pandemonium."
The senior Senator from New York is harking back to Milton's meaning -- the capital of Hell -- in his study of ethnicity in global politics, and can thus get away with the archaic spelling. The rest of us, in using the word to denote "wild disorder, noisy confusion, bedlam," should stick with the capitalization, just as we capitalize Hell when referring to the place. (I'll feel like hell when Hell freezes over.) But we should adopt the modern spelling because Carlyle was a respectable writer and ae is hard to figure out how to pronounce. Pat should remember that when he writes his encyclopaedia.
 
MEANWHILE, BACK AT REVANCHE
 "I BELIEVE THE Western world and Western countries did not understand the reality of revan chism," said Boris Yeltsin, standing at the side of the French President, Francois Mitterrand. He defined the term in the next sentence: "a serious attempt to restore the Communist regime of the Soviets."
Mitterrand could have told him that revanche is the French word for "revenge," usually meaning the retaking of lost territory or return to old regimes. For generations, Soviet leaders complained of West German revanchist aims toward East Germany; now the term, evidently a Russian favorite, will be popping up at summits, directed at the Communist apparatchiks seeking to make a comeback in Moscow.
The word is always used pejoratively; if you are for economic revanchism, you eschew that word and say instead you favor retaliatory democracy or you're a reciprocitist. Revanche, in diplomacy, is never admitted to be sweet.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in: Georgetown

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
THE Wilsons are typical of many young adults who grew up in well-to-do Fairfield County. Thomas Wilson is from Westport, his wife, Susan, from Weston. Like many of their peers, they are rearing their first child, and cannot afford to live in either town.
After spending two months looking at 40 houses -- "whatever we could afford in Westport or Weston was in terrible disrepair," said Mr. Wilson -- they decided to look farther north where prices were more reasonable. 
 Last November they bought a well maintained three-bedroom, two-bath house for $188,000 on almost an acre in Georgetown. "We like the area because of the small-community feeling," Mr. Wilson said, "and there are lots of other couples in their early 30's with young children."
A major attraction was the array of services and highly regarded school systems available to residents, wherever their homes may be in the four-town area. For Georgetown is not a town itself but a neighborhood of homes with a one-block business district at the confluence of Redding, Ridgefield, Wilton and Weston.
Many Georgetown children attend Redding Elementary School, Reed Middle School and Barlow High School in Redding. Enrichment programs are an important part of the curriculum, beginning in third grade with 6 to 10 weeks of study on the violin, flute, clarinet or guitar.
The Miller-Driscoll K-3 school in Wilton has a computer program in which pairs of children view an event on screen, then use the computer to draft, write, edit and produce in book form an essay on what they saw.
"We can see the day when laptops will travel to and from school with each child instead of notebooks," said Dr. Donald Holt, curriculum administrator.
More than 90 percent of graduates from the four public high schools go on to higher education.
Resident permits are issued by each town for its swimming facilities, tennis courts, hiking trails and other recreational services. The Dhly Ridge Municipal Golf Course in Ridgefield charges $400 a year plus $3 a day to play, and $250 for each additional family member. Several free tennis courts are available.
Redding's Topstone Park offers a beach and swimming pond, horseback riding, canoeing, hiking and basketball on 280 acres at $80 for families, $35 for individuals. Weston runs five-week summer day camps for children. Half-days for 4- and 5-year-olds cost $375 and a full-day sports camp for older children is $500.
On Georgetown's Main Street, which is parallel to Route 107 and has no sidewalks, the Georgetown Saloon offers dinner for $12. Dress is casual and the dance floor is jammed on Saturday nights. The Sagebrush Cafe next door charges $18 for a southwestern dinner. A TV repair shop, barber shop, two liquor stores and a vacant shop or two fill the rest of the street.
Millicent Good, owner of Driscoll Country Real Estate on Route 107, notes that "housing is not available in quantity at any time in Georgetown, " adding that "people tend to settle in for the long haul." Prices occasionally fall below $175,000 and rarely go above $250,000 for a large Victorian. "Close to Main Street houses and lots are small," she said, "under half an acre, but as you fan out, homes are larger and lots go up to an acre."
"I've watched Georgetown evolve for 22 years," said Marilyn Sloper of the local Shaker Realty. "I'm getting more calls for Georgetown specifically from young people who have the energy to fix up a house themselves."
From 1813 until five years ago Georgetown was a blue-collar enclave dominated by the Gilbert & Bennett wire mill, which employed 90 percent of the community's work force. The paternalistic company, with 44 buildings and a large pond on 50 acres along Route 107, provided not only employment but also housing and a public school for its workers.
TWELVE years ago the schoolhouse was taken over by the Landmark Academy, a private school named for the building's National Register of Historic Places status. The youngest of its 160 pupils are 18 months old and its classes range through the 8th grade.
"We believe in early learning," said Linda Keefer, the director. "French and physical education begin at age 3 and reading at age 4. We teach Judeo-Christian values and enroll children of all faiths." Fees range from $462 a year for part-time infants to $6,000.
In 1988, Gilbert & Bennett moved its manufacturing operations to Georgia, keeping only a skeleton staff on site while it made plans to convert the complex into a mixed-use development.
Several brick buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places and will be renovated and new housing will be built around the pond. Groundbreaking is more than a year away and completion could take 10 years, but eventually it will have 295 rental and condominium units of one to three bedrooms, 145,000 square feet of retail and 21,000 square feet of office space. The housing will be offered at market rates.
Several of the dozen or so two-family houses on Portland Avenue built by Gilbert & Bennett at the turn of the century have been bought and updated by owner-occupants or investors. A unit can sometimes be rented for $700 to $900 a month.
Before redevelopment begins at Gilbert & Bennett a state-mandated sewer treatment plant must be built to eliminate septic leaching on Main Street. The plant will be financed jointly by the company and Ridgemoor at Redding, a $100 million life-care facility to be built just north of the wire mill on Route 107.
Plans include 299 condominium apartments and detached homes for people 62 and older, ranging in price from $350,000 to $1 million. Common charges have not been established but will cover use of a 60-bed skilled nursing home on the 144-acre site. A clubhouse, restaurants, spa, greenhouse, indoor and outdoor pools and other amenities will be available to residents.
Paula Ream's Branchville SoHo Gallery, next to the Metro-North Danbury line's tracks, is one of the region's prestigious exhibition spaces. It has exhibited the work of established artists for more than 13 years. On the upper floor, simplex and duplex apartments rent for $650 to $850.
Built in 1853, the gallery, now on the National Register, has undergone many metamorphoses. Originally a communal storage barn, it became a stagecoach stop and inn, an antiques shop and, at its nadir, a plumbing supply store with toilets displayed in the windows.
Another noteworthy establishment next to the tracks is the Branchville Railroad Station Whistle Stop Muffin Company, which occupies the former station house. Commuters cannot buy a ticket there, but they can and do get breakfast before getting on the train.
A scone weighing half a pound costs $1.50, as do nine varieties of enormous muffins, 20 varieties of cookies, buns, rolls, brownies and cake slices, freshly made on the premises. Customers can settle down in the antique 8- by 10-foot waiting room with their carbohydrate, coffee and newspaper, or order a variety of cakes and pies to take home for $13 to $36.
In 1991, Georgetown's despondency over the closing of the wire mill was dispelled while the cavernous old buildings became the setting for the film "Other People's Money," with Gregory Peck and Danny DeVito. "Some of the actors stayed in private homes and townspeople were hired as extras," said Richard Gibbons, attorney and spokesman for Gilbert & Bennett.
The short-lived boost to the economy was welcome, but cannot compare with the 850 temporary and 725 permanent jobs to be created by the $120 million Gilbert & Bennett project, or a projected $40 million in construction earnings and $20 million annually in retail sales.

"We have lost a piece of history forever," said Ebba Anderson, a society member.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Avenue of the Americas;
From Corporate Corridor to Boulevard of Barristers

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
FOR years, Avenue of the Americas was called the Corporate Corridor. And for good reason: Street after street of look-alike buildings, headquarters to Exxon, J.C. Penney, W.R. Grace and other corporate stalwarts, stretched from the 40's to Central Park, spelled only by an occasional hotel.
But now many of those companies have packed up and moved South. Others, like McGraw-Hill, have retrenched, creating a space vacuum along Avenue of the Americas/Sixth Avenue that, increasingly, law firms have rushed to fill. A result is that the Corporate Corridor is rapidly becoming Barrister Boulevard.. 
 "No other avenue is so identified with law firms that once coveted a Park Avenue address," noted James B. Frederick, a principal at the real estate brokerage Abrams Benisch Riker/Colliers.
The numbers are striking. According to Cushman & Wakefield, in 1990 law firms leasing more than 10,000 feet sopped up more than 1.18 million square feet of Manhattan space, 7.4 percent of the 15.89 million total feet of space leased. Seventeen percent of the law firm deals were on Sixth Avenue.
A year later, big law firm space deals accounted for 6 percent, or 801,880 square feet, of the 13.42 million feet rented; 35 percent of the law firm deals were on Sixth. Last year was more of the same: Law firms renting more than 10,000 feet took nearly 1.18 million feet of space, or 7 percent of the 16.75 million feet of total space that was leased; 36.3 percent of the law firm leases were for Avenue of the Americas space.
Architecturally, the Sixth Avenue buildings are well suited to a law firm's needs. Many have large, rectangular floorplates that provide for enough windowed offices to appease as many senior partners as necessary and most are skyscrapers, offering spectacular views. And the combined shrinkage and flight of corporate tenants opened up floor upon floor of contiguous space.
"Sixth Avenue is the only place left with large blocks of economical space," said David W. Levinson, an executive managing director at Edward S. Gordon.
But the availability of space would have counted for naught if an Avenue of the Americas address did not project the "right" image. And until recently, for lawyers it did not.
West Side rents have always been well below East Side rents. Where Park Avenue has stayed in the low-to-high $40's, Avenue of the Americas rarely makes it beyond the high $30's. Moreover, brokers report that Sixth Avenue landlords offer particularly rich workletters and free-rent packages.
For publicly held corporations, whose shareholders reward frugality, that was a plus. Law firms, however, assumed that clients associated plush offices and fancy addresses with affluence and success, and thus with competence. And that meant east of Fifth Avenue.
The recession changed that. As the free-spending 80's became the cost-conscious 90's, clients who once seemed impressed with ostentation started to look askance at lawyer's overheads that, they feared, were being passed on in legal fees.
Thus began the migration of law firms to the West Side. Cravath, Swaine & Moore has settled into Worldwide Plaza, on Eighth Avenue and 50th Street. Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn has gone to 1585 Broadway, at 48th Street. Last year Mendes & Mount left 3 Park Avenue, at 35th Street, for 750 Seventh Avenue, at 49th Street.
Indeed, law firms that move to Avenue of the Americas aren't mavericks anymore.
"Where Sixth Avenue used to be the westernmost boundary of midtown, it now is centrally located," said Mitchell Barnett, a director of Cushman & Wakefield who represented LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby & MacRae last summer when it moved its 1,200 people to more than 200,000 feet at Avenue of the Americas Plaza, at 125 West 55th Street. "Couple that with the cost-consciousness that a Sixth Avenue address projects, and you see lots of firms coming round."
Those considerations certainly tipped the balance for LeBoeuf, Lamb. It had been scattered among floors at 520 Madison, near 53d Street, and at nearby 10 East 53d, and it wanted to consolidate. Avenue of the Americas Plaza, with its 23,000-square-foot floorplates, seemed ideal. The firm could get eight floors plus the concourse level. The building offered ample electrical and telecommunications wiring. And Alan M. Berman, chairman of LeBoeuf, Lamb's real estate group, says the deal's economics were "excellent."
Still, in the high-flying 80's, LeBoeuf, Lamb would have been reluctant to move west, lest clients think it was coming down in the world.
"FIVE, six years ago we would have been a lot less comfortable trading a Madison Avenue address for the West Side," Mr. Berman said. "But today, clients are impressed when lawyers have efficient office space, because they feel we'll pass the savings on to them."
There's a lot about Sixth Avenue that impresses the lawyers themselves.
Peter S. Britell, head of Coudert Brothers' real estate group, waxes positively eloquent about the five high floors his firm just moved into at 1114 Avenue of the Americas, the former W.R. Grace building on 42d Street. Coudert, which moved from 200 Park Avenue, at 45th, also took the fourth floor at 1114 for a "treetop conference center" that overlooks the newly refurbished Bryant Park.
"On a clear day we can see the Statue of Liberty, Kennedy and Newark Airports, and the conference center makes you think of London or Paris," Mr. Britell said.
Mr. Levinson, who represented Coudert in its move, adds this filip: "Maybe smaller firms need to be on Park, but Coudert is beyond needing a street number for image."
Numerous brokers say their law firm clients are having similar reactions.
"These days, lawyers are choosing a transaction, not just an address," said Barry Shaw, a senior director with Sylvan Lawrence who represented Gordon Altman Butowsky Weitzen Shalov & Wein in its move last year from 101 Park Avenue, at 40th Street, to 50,000 square feet at 114 West 47th.
Park Avenue, meanwhile, has lost its luster, says Steven A. Swerdlow, executive vice president of CB Commercial Real Estate, who is helping Morrison & Foerster, a law firm at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, at 52d Street, find expansion space.
"You've got a lot of functionally obsolete buildings on Park Avenue, which just can't accommodate the electrical and telecommunications needs of a modern law firm," Mr. Swerdlow said.
Not surprisingly, Sixth Avenue landlords have actively courted law firms, to replace corporate tenants that have moved away.
As soon as the Exxon Corporation, which had been the major tenant at 1251, at 50th Street, announced its plan to move to Dallas in 1986, Wm. A. White/Grubb & Ellis, then the building's leasing agent, went after Shea & Gould, which was at 330 Madison, at 42d Street, and was looking to expand.
"We knew they wanted high, big floors, and there simply are not that many buildings in New York that could offer this kind of space," said Howard Rosen, an executive vice president with Wm. A. White/Grubb & Ellis. The law firm became part of the first wave of Sixth Avenue converts, moving into about 200,000 feet on four high floors in 1988.
Last year Fish & Neave moved from 875 Third Avenue, at 53d Street, to 109,000 square feet at 1251 for similar reasons.
"They got a building with 41,000-foot floors, window space to spare, a rent that starts in the mid-$30's, a flexible lease and a terrific concession package," said Mr. Frederick, who represented the firm in the deal. "How can you beat that?"
Despite the Avenue of the Americas' new cachet, the flood of law firms moving there will probably slow to a trickle. The avenue, in a sense, is a victim of its own success: The large blocks of contiguous space that attracted the firms are growing scarce.
"This trend will have a natural end," said Mr. Rosen. "The space will just run out."
If that happens the trend may come full circle. Price Waterhouse's move to Americas Tower has opened up more than 300,000 feet at Citicorp Center, on Park Avenue. Chemical Bank's and Ernst & Young's moving out of 277 Park Avenue, at 47th Street, will make 500,000 feet available there. And there's still about 70,000 square feet available atop 450 Lexington Avenue, at 44th Street.
If the deals are right, the old Park Avenue law firms may go back East yet again.

As Condos Fade, Rentals Move Into Gap

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

 BODY:
IF the 80's could be called "the decade of the condo, we're now entering the era of rentals," said Paul J. Feiner, Supervisor of the Town of Greenburgh.
With his strong support, the Town Board recently approved an 87-unit rental project, the first to be built in the town in 33 years. "I hope we're leading the way on this issue for other communities," said Mr. Feiner. "Rentals is the ideal housing for our seniors and many other groups whose needs are not now being met." 
 Similar proposals for rental housing are showing up in other parts of the county as well, including a 330-unit project for the Village of Tuckahoe, 159 units in the Town of Mamaroneck, 26 in the Town of New Castle, 14 in the Town of Harrison and 12 units in the Village of Croton-on-Hudson.
Many of the projects are affordable housing and, as such, receive government subsidies. But market-rate projects are being planned, too.
This is due primarily to falling land prices and the virtual disappearance of the condominium developer from the market.
The Greenburgh project is for a site on Hillside Avenue once occupied by the Old Tarrytown School where 87 one- and two-bedroom units will be built in six buildings.
The complex will also have a tennis court and picnic area, said Samuel Wilkins, president of Hillside Realty and Management Corporation, of White Plains, which is developing the project.
Mr. Wilkins had originally planned to build 88 condominiums, "but the condo market is very slow," he said, "and market studies were showing a large rental market."
Twenty percent of the units will be marketed as affordable, rents from $560 for a one-bedroom to $675 for a two-bedroom.
The remaining apartments will rent at market prices, $775 for a one-bedroom and $870 for a two-bedroom.
Mr. Wilkins has agreed to give Greenburgh residents first priority. He now has 76 people interested in the units. "We should have interest for all 87 in short order and we haven't even begun marketing," he said.
The project is being financed primarily through a long-term $4 million loan from the state's Housing Finance Authority.
It also has a $1 million grant from the county's Housing Implementation Fund and $500,000 in tax credits from the state. Mr. Wilkins said he was now applying for some additional grants.
GREENBURGH has also given preliminary approval for 105 rental units on Taxter Road by Trammell Crow Residential of New Canaan, Conn. The garden-style apartment rents will range from $900 for one-bedroom units to $1,600 for two bedrooms.
Trammel Crow is one of the largest developers of rental housing in the Northeast, where it has built a total of 5,000 units, according to Samuel Fuller, development partner for the company.
"In recent years, we've been building steadily in Long Island, Queens, New Jersey and Connecticut," Mr. Fuller said, "but the door was closed in Westchester. Land prices were extremely high. With condo developers bidding for the land, they created an artificially high price. There was also an onerous approval process."
Now, with land prices at more realistic levels, the developer is exploring additional Westchester projects, including one in Mamaroneck for which details are not yet available. By far the majority of rental projects now under way in the county fall into the affordable housing category.
One of the largest is the Hommocks Park Apartments in Mamaroneck, where 54 one- and-two-bedroom units will be built by the town on the site of now-demolished Larchmont Motel, on the Boston Post Road.
In recent years, the motel housed welfare clients and had turned into "a drug haven," said Town Supervisor Caroline Silverstone. The town bought the 1.7 acre property for $2.2 million.
Twenty percent of the tenants will receive rent subsidies from the Federal Section 8 low-income housing program. The rest of the units will be available to those with incomes of $34,000 to $51,000, depending on the size of the family.
Rents will be 30 percent of a tenant's income in both cases. Priority will be given to municipal employees and volunteers, such as firemen and paramedics.
There are 120 people on the list of prospective tenants; among them is Kevin Leddy, a tree trimmer for the town. Mr. Leddy said he hoped that when the project is completed a year from now, he would still be able to afford it.
Now living with his brother, Mr. Leddy said that in order to afford his own place, he'd have to move to the Bronx.
"I live and work in town," he said. "This is the first project that's come along that would help me stay here. I hope it doesn't get lost in red tape."
The county government has identified a need for 5,000 units of affordable housing by the year 2000, according to Lynn Oliva, County Planning Commissioner. "There's a tremendous need for more affordable housing options, both in home ownership and rental," she said. "In the last year or two a lot more projects seem to include rentals."
Part of the reason rental housing is so scarce in Westchester is that 42,000 units were essentially taken off the market when they were converted to co-ops and condominiums in the 80's.
MOST municipalities discourage condominium and co-op owners from renting out their units by placing them under rent restrictions imposed by the Emergency Tenant Protection Act.
Also, developers have been reluctant to build new rental housing and become long-term landlords. "We'd rather individuals buy their units," said Robert Weinberg, chairman of the Robert Martin Company, of Elmsford, which owns a portion of the Taxter Road property in Greenburgh that's now scheduled for rental development.
Mr. Weinberg is convinced that the market for condominiums will rebound, "in two or three years," he said.
Meanwhile, rentals are a way around the current problems in the market, he said. "It's a psychological reaction. People don't want to make an investment in housing until they see some improvement in the economy."

HEADLINE: A Day With Christine Whitman

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
AT 10:30 one recent morning, after a 40-minute drive from her family farm in Hunterdon County, Christine Todd Whitman called a meeting of her campaign staff in the People for Whitman headquarters in a modern office building in Clark.
"This is clearly a wonderful story," Ms. Whitman said, holding up a newspaper article in which a public opinion poll had been interpreted as showing tepid support for the re-election of Gov. Jim Florio. "We can use it to feel good, get excited, and to confirm what we've been hearing out on the street. But we can't let it go to our heads. Things haven't gotten nearly as hot as they're going to get." 
 The campaign workers, a relaxed group of fresh-faced 20-somethings, many in denim jeans and sweaters, nodded their agreement and sipped their Diet Cokes. Ms. Whitman -- formal and aristocratic, wearing a cobalt blue suit -- proceeded to the next item on her agenda.
So began another day in the campaign of the 46-year-old woman who, some political experts say, represents the Republican Party's best hope for unseating Mr. Florio in this November's gubernatorial election. Her first political hurdle, though, is the June 8 primary, which pits her against three fellow Republicans: Patrick Gilligan, a Morris County businessman; James Wallwork, a former state senator, and Cary Edwards, the state's former Attorney General.
In the course of a nine-hour working day, Ms. Whitman spoke to meetings of Republican women, teachers, business people and a newspaper editorial board -- and referred to her Republican rivals hardly at all. Her time was spent attacking the policies and political philosophy of Governor Florio.
In an interview during the day, Ms. Whitman returned to her theme that a November campaign would be hard-fought, particularly since the Democratic State Committee has hired James Carville, President Clinton's chief campaign strategist last year, as a campaign consultant. Mr. Carville and Mr. Florio are "street fighters," she said, "and James Carville's M.O. is to put the opponent on the defensive early on."
After an 11 o'clock session in her private office with State Senator C. Louis Bassano, the Union Republican who is chairman of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee and who briefed her on a variety of health-related issues, Ms. Whitman set out for her first appearance of the day, a luncheon of the Essex County Republican Women in West Orange.
Along the way, seated in her leased 1992 Mercury Sable, Ms. Whitman said that on a typical day she traveled about 200 miles. She recalled her losing 1990 race against United States Senator Bill Bradley, her first statewide campaign.
"We would have to drum up events," she said. "Nobody really cared that we were out there. If I saw two people on the street corner, I would stop to talk." Now, she said, "we are in a position of constantly turning down events."
Though born into a prominent Republican family -- both parents served the party in various state and county positions -- Ms. Whitman herself has held just one elected office, that of a Somerset County freeholder from 1983 to 1988. She then spent two years as president of the State Board of Public Utilities.
It was the campaign against Senator Bradley that catapulted her into her present prominence. Though he was widely considered unbeatable and outspent Ms. Whitman by a ratio of 12 to 1, she received 49 percent of the vote.
Some political experts say that Ms. Whitman's surprising showing was attributable to voter backlash against Governor Florio and Mr. Bradley's refusal to talk about the Governor's unpopular tax increases; nevertheless, it gave her instant name recognition among voters.
"She nearly knocked off New Jersey's premier political icon," said Ross Baker, professor of political science at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. "That clearly gives her a lot of credibility."
At the Manor in West Orange, 150 Republican women were waiting to hear what Ms. Whitman had to say for herself. Before her formal speech, she worked the room.
Her style bore little resemblance to the way most politicians, including Governor Florio, perform that task. Ms. Whitman moved tentatively from one person to another, smiling and gently shaking hands, maintaining a measured distance. There were no shouts of recognition, no hearty laughs, no arms flung over shoulders.
In her speech, Ms. Whitman concentrated on what she would not do as governor: she would not do what Mr. Florio has done.
"I don't like what I've seen happen in the state of New Jersey in the last three years," she said. "It's common sense not to spend more than you take in, and it's common sense to know where you want to go before you try to get there.
"We've given him over $7 billion in new money over the last three years," she continued, referring to revenue raised by taxes Mr. Florio has imposed since taking office in 1990. "The question that has to be answered is, 'What happened to it?' "
 
For a 'Business Friendly' State
 Ms. Whitman also criticized what she called Mr. Florio's reluctance to bring "people into the process" of government. Decisions that adversely affected business -- like the increase in the sales tax and the stiffening of regulatory policies -- had not been discussed with business leaders, she said, adding: "We've got to make this state business friendly. We need jobs, and we can't have jobs without businesses."
But Ms. Whitman offered only a few specific proposals of her own. She did say that she supported a constitutional amendment that would require the Legislature to earmark a revenue source for every new expenditure. And she called for a "two-year budget planning cycle" rather than the one-year cycle that is now used. "It makes sense to know what things are going to cost you, not just this year when the bills come in, but next year as well," she said.
In her formal talk, which she delivered without notes, Ms. Whitman's style was measured and serious with none of the political orator's anecdotes or dramatic gestures. At times, she shifted from one idea to the next without completing her thought.
Ms. Whitman seemed most at ease answering questions from the audience. When asked about abortion, she said was pro-choice. She called for increased sex education in the schools to avoid unwanted pregnancies, and better support for women who become pregnant out of wedlock and choose to bring the pregnancy to term. "The bottom line is that that is a very personal decision that should be made between a woman, her physician and her conscience," she said.
 
A Stop for Lunch
 At about 1:15, after leaving the luncheon without eating, Ms. Whitman and her entourage -- including her 15-year-old daughter, Kate, a student at the Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts -- found their way to a West Orange restaurant, Pals Cabin. There the candidate and her daughter ate at a separate table.
The next stop was a 2:30 meeting in Hackensack with the editorial board of The Record. Just the day before, the newspaper had published the results of a poll it had conducted with The News Tribune in Woodbridge, which indicated that Mr. Florio would defeat both Ms. Whitman and Mr. Edwards if the election were held now. That was the poll that had inspired the article in The Record that had so pleased Ms. Whitman at her headquarters earlier.
Gerald M. Pomper, a professor of political science at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, later explained how one poll could yield two results.
The poll indicated that if the election were held in mid-March, Mr. Florio would get 39 percent of the vote while Ms. Whitman who would get 30 percent. And if he were running against Mr. Edwards, Ms. Whitman's closest rival, Mr. Florio would get 40 percent while Mr. Edwards would get 25 percent.
"I read that poll as not being very comforting to Mr. Florio," Mr. Pomper said. "He's the incumbent, and he didn't even get 50 percent."
After the June primary, Mr. Pomper said, "the race is going to be between Florio and 'not-Florio.' " And if the "not-Florio" is a credible alternative, he said, Mr. Florio will very likely lose the election.
 
Voters' View of Women
 As a result, he said, the Republican candidate's ability to elicit trust among the voters will be the essential key to victory in November. And Ms. Whitman, he said, is likely to appear more trustworthy than Mr. Edwards simply because she is a woman. "Voters feel women are cleaner, more honest, fresher," Mr. Pomper said.
In any event, there is little to distinguish between Ms. Whitman and Mr. Edwards on policy matters. The two hold similar positions on such issues as abortion, taxes and education, and both favor providing incentives to business to stimulate the state's economy.
"You really have to be something of a connoisseur of philosophical shadings to see the difference between the two," said Mr. Baker, the Rutgers professor.
After the editorial board meeting, which was closed to the visiting press, Ms. Whitman was asked how the session had gone. "I think it went fine," she said, adding that she sometimes has trouble giving journalists the kind of answers they seem to want. "I get accused at times of not being substantive enough."
 
Coffee With Teachers
 It was just after 4 o'clock when Ms. Whitman arrived at her next stop, a kaffeeklatsch with a group of local teachers at the home of a former Wood-Ridge mayor, Peter Incardone Jr.
Seated on a straight-backed chair in the living room, Ms. Whitman fielded their questions. Most of them appeared to agree with her endorsement of a program that would give parents the right to send their children to the public schools of their choice, and her approval of the concept of school vouchers, which could be applied to the cost of private as well as public education.
The teachers balked, however, when Ms. Whitman explained her views on tenure. "Everybody would like a job to be forever," Ms. Whitman said, but she said she preferred "five- and seven-year contracts to take a teacher beyond any political cycle."
One teacher in attendance responded: "I'm a teacher advocate. If you did that, if you eliminated tenure, I would be fired."
At 5:40, after leaving the kaffeeklatsch, Ms. Whitman made a brief detour to the Wood-Ridge Public Library, where she was shown a computer system that makes thousands of books throughout the county available for lending. She put the system to the test by asking if the officials could locate a book of poems that she long been hunting for, in vain.
The system came up with the book, and Ms. Whitman delightedly took pen and paper out of her purse, wrote down the information ("A Treasury of the Familiar," edited by Ralph L. Woods and published in 1942) and slipped the paper into her purse.
 
Session With Executives
 Another 15 minutes in her Mercury Sable took Ms. Whitman to Saddle Brook, where a group of 150 business executives in the area had gathered at Manchester, a company that specializes in out-placement services. Molly Shepard, the company's president, is a former classmate of Ms. Whitman's at Wheaton College in Norton, Mass.
The guests were sipping wine and eating snacks when Ms. Whitman arrived and began making her rounds. During a brief lull between handshakes, the candidate paused for a moment and took a deep breath, and her daughter, Kate, came up behind her and touched the small of her back. Ms. Whitman reached around behind her without looking and took Kate's hand, squeezed it and then moved on.
Among the guests was Anthony D. Zajkowski, a Newark banking executive. "I'm dying to find out what she has to say," Mr. Zajkowski said. "I think personally that it's about time that the Republican Party came up with some quality women in leadership roles. I came to see if she's the one."
Eventually, everyone went to the cafeteria in the basement. Ms. Whitman had been asked by her former classmate to give a speech that was "not political." Ms. Whitman said later that she had wondered, "How do you give a speech that's not political when you're running for governor?" But she succeeded in doing so.
 
Question on Gun Control
 In the question-and-answer period after her speech, however, politics intruded. Mr. Zajkowski asked Ms. Whitman about her position on gun control and whether she believed that the National Rifle Association "had a lock on the Legislature" on the issue. He said he had recently "had a gun pointed in my face in Newark."
Ms. Whitman responded that the Legislature's failure to derail Mr. Florio's ban on assault weapons did not indicate "a lock on the Legislature," but she did not discuss in any detail her own feelings about gun control. She owns a shotgun, which she uses for shooting clay pigeons.
Later, when asked about his reaction to the candidate, Mr. Zajkowski said that he liked what she had said "from an overall standpoint," but that he was not satisfied about her stand on gun control. "I think she skirted a little bit around the issue," he said.
 
Assessing a Rival
 By 7 o'clock, the meeting in Saddle Brook was over and Ms. Whitman was in her car heading back to campaign headquarters. She reflected on the differences between herself and Mr. Edwards.
"It really comes down to the way we view government," Ms. Whitman said. "It's the old way of doing things versus the new way of doing things." She cited Mr. Edwards's suggestion that the position of state auditor be created to oversee the budget process.
"That's a typical response for another layer of government," she said. "We don't need that. We have all the tools we need to bring government back under control without adding on another layer."
 
Differences With Florio
 Her differences with Mr. Florio, she said, are more fundamental.
"One is faith in the people," she said. "A recognition that you have to bring people into the process rather than precipitous decision-making where the governor says, 'I know what's right for you and here it is and you're going to like it.' "
It was 7:45 when Ms. Whitman arrived at campaign headquarters in Clark, and soon she and her daughter were on their way back home to have dinner with the rest of the family -- John R. Whitman, a financial consultant, and the Whitmans' son, Taylor, 14.
Earlier in the day, during the meeting in Saddle Brook, Kate had stood watching her mother shake hands and chat with people she had never seen before. "I don't think I'd ever be able to keep smiling that long," Kate said.

HEADLINE: The Children of the Shadows: Shaping Young Lives

 BODY:
They are the children of the shadows: the impoverished youth who live in the tumbledown neighborhoods of the American inner city; the children of often desperate and broken families, where meals are sometimes cereal three times a day; the young people who daily face the lures of drugs, sex, fast money and guns; the unnoticed youths who operate in a maddening universe where things always seem to go wrong.
 Their world, while never especially sunny, has grown far bleaker. After a period of decline, the proportion of children living in poverty has been rising. School performance has steadily fallen. Juvenile crime has exploded and turned more violent. Teen-agers are killing more often, killing younger and being killed with numbing regularity. 
 Numbers and trends, though, tell only so much. Behind them are the young people themselves, their voices, their lives. New York Times reporters spent weeks with 10 inner-city children, learning their stories. In addition, a group of reporters spent hours in round-table discussions with 15 teenagers from the New York region, speaking about their families and their schools, drugs, gangs and sex, their hopes of escape and their fears that they never will.
 
TODAY, their stories begin with Nicholas Whitiker, a Chicago fourth grader growing up too fast. Other profiles are:
TUESDAY, APRIL 6 Ladeeta Smith, a Brooklyn teen-ager who lost a father to alcoholism and a mother to AIDS.
THURSDAY, APRIL 8 Crystal Rossi, Bensonhurst schoolgirl losing focus in class as she is tempted by the streets.
SUNDAY, APRIL 11 Marcus Tramble, a Chicago youth frustrated by his fears and the fears of others.
TUESDAY, APRIL 13 Fernando Morales, a Connecticut drug dealer, full of bravado and fatalism.
THURSDAY, APRIL 15 Jerina Gervais, an Oakland girl trying to expunge a wayward life of teen-age sex.
SUNDAY, APRIL 18 Freddie Cherokee Brown, a Bronx youth haunted by confrontations with the police.
TUESDAY, APRIL 20 Asenhat Gomez, newly arrived from the Dominican Republic, now isolated in Brooklyn.
THURSDAY, APRIL 22 Derrick White, a Memphis teen-ager, groping for a road map out of the projects.
SUNDAY, APRIL 25 Shawn Hunt, a one-time messenger for Brooklyn drug dealers, closing in on success.
 
States were ranked on six factors affecting the lives of the teenagers who live there. The composite score is a way of evaluating where teen-agers face the most obstacles to success.
 
The measures were:
*The percentage of all births that are to single teen-agers.
*The violent crime arrest rate among juveniles.
*The percentage of teen-agers no in school and not in the labor force.
*The violent death rate for teen-agers.
*The percentage of children living below the poverty level.

OTHER VOICES
'I Want to Be the First One to Stay Married'
 
Q. The whole idea of traditional family has changed a little bit since when our parents were growing up. What is a family? How do you define family?
 
DOUG KILCOMMONS, 17, Staten Island (Tottenville High School): Your family is people who love you, people who love you and are going to support you through thick and thin.
 
JUAN RIVERA, 18, Brooklyn (Bushwick High School): It doesn't have to be blood relationship, because I have several families. I would say my friends, when we're all gathered around. I can go to them for any support, love and understanding.
 
Q. Is there an ideal family?
 
WUBNESH HYLTON, 19, Brooklyn (Hunter College): I was just talking with my roommate last night and she was asking me if I wanted kids and I was telling her, 'No,' because whenever I envisioned it, it was always me raising a child by myself, and I never wanted that. I came from a single-parent household. And I was telling her, you know, if I did have a kid I would have to see some commitment coming from the guy. So I guess my vision for, like a family, would be like mother and father but also extended family like grandmothers and uncles and aunts and cousins, supporting that nucleus.
 
JERRY VITALE, 16, Brooklyn ( Lafayette High School): My parents, they brought me up, they gave me a home, shelter, clothes. So when I would have my wife and my kids, let's say, and they getting old, I would take care of my parents. It would be my turn. So, right there that would be my little family.
 
ZAIRE GRAHAM, 17, Bronx (Fashion Industries High School): I do want to be the Huxtables. You know why I want to be the Huxtables? Because they cool.
 
BERNARDO VASQUEZ, 17, Manhattan (A. Philip Randolph High School): What I like about the Huxtables is that that's something positive. If a little kid is sitting in the back and he's thinking, damn, click. That might be the clock that might make him the doctor.
 
ZAIRE Exactly. Not the show itself. It's just the ideal behind it that there can be the black "Brady Bunch," you know, the black family on TV. It gives the kid like me in the projects the ideal that I can have this brownstone in Brooklyn with my husband who's a doctor and me the wife who's the lawyer. Cause if all the shows we have are "Good Times" that means, damn, I'm stuck in the projects for the rest of my life. I ain't going nowhere.
 
Q. In your own families, what things would you like to change?
 
BARBARA FUENTES, 16, Hartford (Hartford Public High School): I would like my parents to have gone to college. My parents didn't go to college and my older sister was a pregnant teen and my other sister is now wed and has another child. I'm setting a goal for myself so that I could go to college and be the first one in may family to get married and have a successful life.
 
ZAIRE In my family, I think I want to be the first one to stay married, because everybody in my family, yeah, we got married, but nobody stayede married. When I get that house and that husband and everything, want to be able to hold on to it.
 
JUAN If I wanted to change something, maybe growing up with a father around.
 
JERMAINE WIGGINS, 20, Bronx: Same here, a strong male in the family. I have an older sister and she's supposed to be, you know, my role model. And my mother looks on me as, you know, "You're the man of the house." Where if my father's living there with us it would be great.
 
Q. What is the most special time that you spend with your family?
 
DONALD CROSBY, 18, Bronx: Each morning I can wake up and just kiss my mother on the cheek and tell her that I love her. That's a special occasion for me, or when I can just see my sister home from college or when my father's home from work and my mother and father are not arguing. That's special. You know, little things like that.
 
JUAN For me I feel it's Thanksgiving when all of my family comes over and, you know, we all eat together and hang out, and speak and thank God for everything, you know, just being together.
 
Q. Who do you look up to the most in your family?
 
DONALD My role model in my family would be my uncle. This man is completely motivated. He's been working all his life. It doesn't matter what he's doing, he can be hustling, this man keeps food on his kid's table and he talks to me a lot, comes takes me out. Being that I'm not so close to my father, he tries to fill in that gap.

HEADLINE: Focus: California;
Can Impact Fees Stunt a Town's Growth?

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW

DATELINE: RIVERSIDE, CALIF.

 BODY:
THERE is no receptionist at the front desk of the Riverside County Planning Department. A revolving sign assures visitors that "someone will be with you in a few moments." Another says the agency is closed every other Friday. Just beyond is a cavernous area filled with empty desks.
One of the fastest growing counties in California -- its rate of growth was 10 percent in 1989 and 6.4 percent in 1992 -- Riverside is a typical example of an area that has grown to depend on real estate impact fees to pay for vital services and develop infrastructure. When times were good, the fees helped municipalities and counties grow by making development pay for its effect on the community, like the need for more or wider roads, sewers, schools, parks, fire protection and other services. 
 But many of those communities have found that in a recession high fees stunt growth and that services paid for by fees have shrunk to dangerously low levels. The county's Buildings Department, for example, which gets 97 percent of its funds from impact fees, went from 197 employees in 1989 to 15 today.
"Because we depend so heavily on impact fees," said Gerald V. Jolliffe, the county's principal planner, "when building slowed, we lost the fees and with them our ability to plan in advance. Applications for building permits now take much longer to get through the approval process and we are unable to prepare for the next development wave."
The county gets a total of $6,675 in fees for each new dwelling unit. Of these, two-thirds are classified as impact fees. They are used to cover not only the effects of new construction on public facilities but also the activities of the Building Department.
Some sections of the county have an additional fee of $1,600 an acre of development to cover the impact on the endangered Stevens kangaroo rat. Those fees are on top of other impact fees charged by municipalities and school districts, which often bring the total impact charges on new construction to more than $30,000 a unit.
Since 1978, when Broward County, Fla., became the first jurisdiction to impose impact fees, they have been challenged in the United States Supreme Court, which decided in 1987 that there must be a "rational nexus" establishing a clear connection between new growth and mandated local improvements.
So far, at least 17 states have passed enabling legislation to let counties and municipalities impose such fees. New Jersey and Connecticut have legislation to allow fees for improvements to roads and sewer, drainage and water systems. Although New York State has no such legislation, municipalities regularly force developers to make infrastructure improvements as a condition for permission to build large projects.
California's impact fees are among the highest in the country, partly to make up for shortfalls in property taxes resulting from Proposition 13. That measure, passed in a referendum in 1978, stipulates that municipalities may not increase property taxes by more than 2 percent a year on properties bought before 1978.
IN May 1992, the Riverside County Planning Department tried to make up for its shortfall by asking the county's Board of Supervisors for a 60 percent increase in fees. The request was rejected after the local Building Industry Association brought representatives of all of the building trades to the meeting to persuade the supervisors that an increase would further hobble the limping construction industry.
"The supervisors understood that raising fees when building activity drops is like beating a dead horse," said Thomas Van Voorst, executive director of the Riverside County Building Industry Association. "What you really need is to lower fees to stimulate the market."
"For every $1,000 in additional fees you lose 7 percent of the market," said Stephen Johnson, a partner in the Meyers Group, an independent firm that studies real estate trends in Southern California. "The more fees you impose, the more middle- and lower-income people are shut out of the market."
The most extreme example of a community suffering from impact fees is Chino Hills, a posh city of 44,000 with rolling hills and bridle paths. It is in San Bernardino County, just west of Chino, and abuts Los Angeles and Orange Counties. It was started by San Bernardino County in 1982 as a bedroom community to serve larger employment centers nearby. All of its infrastructure was to be financed through impact fees, which started at $4,200 per dwelling.
On Jan. 1, 1992, Chino Hills was chartered as a city, with excellent road and park systems financed by fees that now total more than $40,000 per dwelling. These include development fees of $36,000 that are charged when the building permit is issued and school fees of $2.65 per square foot of construction.
"Often the fees total more than the cost of the land," said Ronald N. Short, Director of Community Development at Chino Hills.
One of the first actions taken by the new City Council was to authorize an evaluation of the impact fee structure that had been put in place by the county. The Council found that although large one-family homes were still selling because of the natural beauty and the location of the city, the fees had all but ruled out other development. Its one low- to-moderate-income area, the Los Serranos neighborhood, which has about 170 empty lots, was deteriorating.
There was virtually no commercial development because the county had set commercial fees at an average of 9.2 times those of residential.
"We would try to bring in commercial development," said Mr. Short, "and they would have to pay $160,000 an acre just in fees. That was outrageous and no one would go for it."
In February the City Council passed a resolution cutting impact fees by 25 percent, waiving fees for new housing in Los Serranos over the coming year and allowing commercial property to pay up to one half of its fees from sales taxes it generated for the town.
As a result, Mr. Short said, a developer quickly put up 13 modest one-family houses in Los Serranos and sold them within a week for $137,000 each. The number of building permits for one-family homes went up by about 20 percent and the city was able to negotiate a deal for the construction of what Mr. Short calls a "power center," a large mall of outlet stores and discount shoppers clubs.
The city, which gets 1 percent of all state and county sales taxes collected within its boundaries, expects to reap $700,000 a year in sales taxes alone from the power center, which would more than double the amount of sales tax revenue currently collected. Construction is expected to begin before year's end.
Mr. Short says that the recession made Chino Hills begin to examine its fee schedule because there was considerable competition for the little commercial development taking place in Southern California. However, he said, the current reduction in fees is just the start of a process that he hopes will lead to a complete restructuring of the fee schedule.
"WE are looking at all of our fees and comparing them with what other communities in our area are doing," he said. "We've already found some ridiculous inequities. For instance, we charge $19.05 per square foot in impact fees for restaurant development. In Chino, it's $1.35. So who in his right mind would build a nice restaurant here? For regular retail stores, our fees come to $14.44 a square foot, as opposed to 64 cents in Chino."
Mr. Short hopes the new fee structure, when it is finally worked out, will allow the city to attract several more power centers.
"We realized that the idea of making development pay for itself is good to a degree," he said. "But sometimes that can be an oversimplification. You have to look at the fee structure in terms of the goals of the town, and by reducing our fees, we are actually in a lot better shape on our operating budget."

HEADLINE: Skillful Students Offer Money-Saving Ideas

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG

DATELINE: VALHALLA

 BODY:
THE economic turnaround has not yet caught up with many county residents who are still looking for ways to save money rather than spend it. For those willing to sacrifice prompt delivery of services for substantial savings, programs offered by the Board of Cooperative Educational Services at regional Technical and Occupational Education Centers can pay off. The centers offer services ranging from automobile and computer repairs to carpentry, floral design, catering and haircuts, performed by high school students, young adults and displaced workers looking for opportunities to try out new vocational skills.
"Our purpose in providing these services is primarily to give our students an opportunity to practice what it is they have learned here, to apply the skills they have been taught here," said Dr. Joseph S. Schwartzberg, director of occupational education at the Southern Westchester Center for Technical and Occupational Education in Valhalla. 
 "Since these are service occupations, we want to give students the opportunity to interact with the public," Dr. Schwartzberg added. "Our purpose is instructional, so every project becomes an instructional activity or lesson for the class."

 Dr. Otto Behrens, director of occupational education at the Northern Westchester-Putnam Center for Technical and Occupational Education in Yorktown Heights, added, "What we're trying to do is give them a real-life experience, what they would find out when they are on a real job."
Because students attend classes for only two to two and a half hours each day, potential consumers should be aware that there can be a long waiting list to schedule an appointment. With car and computer repairs, instructors usually want to assess the educational value of the project before assigning it to a class. Repairs and projects are also likely to take longer than if a customer brought a comparable assignment to a local shop. For most services, however, there is only a materials charge -- and consumers are guaranteed close supervision for their project.
"Nobody pays for labor," Dr. Schwartzberg said. "What we charge is what it costs us to do it. The work that gets done here is top quality, because students are supervised by teachers who have spent years in the trade. We never compromise on quality."
Dan Brady, coordinator for transitional services at the Board of Cooperative Educational Services' incarcerated-youth program, has been taking in his cars for the last 15 years. "It's thorough, because the teacher supervises the work," Mr. Brady said. "And I like the idea of the kids' getting a real learning experience. Since they have no vested interest in selling me parts, I believe them when they say I need something for my car."
Except where indicated, all the following services are available at both the Southern Westchester Center for Technical and Occupational Education, 65 Grasslands Road, Valhalla (761-3400), and the Putnam-Northern Westchester Center for Technical and Occupational Education, 200 Boces Drive, Yorktown Heights (245-2700). Consumers are advised to call for an appointment. Telephone extensions are available for the Yorktown Heights center only.
Drivers with dented or damaged cars can obtain an assessment in the auto-body repair program. The instructor will determine the educational benefit for students and give the driver a cost and time estimate. For tuneups and mechanical problems, drivers should apply to the auto-mechanics programs.
A small-engine repair program, at the Yorktown Heights center only (Extension 436), is offering consumers a seasonal special: tuneup and cleaning of lawn mower motors for $10. Students in this program will also tune and repair outboard motors, snow blowers and garden tractors.
The carpentry program offers a combination design and construction service. Whether it is a backyard gazebo, outdoor storage shed or picnic-table set, students in the architectural-design program will create a blueprint that can be followed by carpentry students. Consumers have to provide and arrange for delivery of materials.
A three-day-a-week nursery school, available at the Yorktown Heights center only, is staffed by students in its child-care program. Parents interested in enrolling their children in this program should call Extension 434 to find out if space is available.
 
Cosmetology Clinic Days
 In the computer-repair program (Extension 438 at the Yorktown Heights center) consumers baffled by gremlins in their latest model I.B.M. or Macintosh can take their equipment in for diagnosis and repair.
Students in the cosmetology program ply their skills at shampooing, haircutting, manicuring and coloring on clinic days, when the public is invited to make an appointment. At Valhalla, clinic day is Friday, with classes starting at 8:30 A.M. and noon. Fees range from $2 (for a manicure) to $4 (for a basic haircut). More complicated processes, like a frosting or permanent, cost $15.
At the Yorktown Heights center, fees are $1 for a manicure, $3 for a haircut and $14 for a permanent. Clinic days in Yorktown Heights are Thursdays and Fridays. The number to call for an appointment is 245-4869.
 
Student-Run Restaurants
 With prom season and Mother's Day approaching, the horticulture program's offerings can be especially timely -- and inexpensive. At the Valhalla center, corsages and boutonnieres start at $3, bouquets at $5; floral centerpieces start at $12. At the Yorktown Heights center, boutonnieres are $1.25, corsages $2.25 to $4, table centerpieces $8 to $15.
Both centers offer the public a dining experience in their on-site student-run restaurants. At Valhalla's Taste of Class, reserved sittings are available on Wednesdays from 11 A.M. to 1:30 P.M. A five-course lunch is $10.
In Yorktown Heights, the Educated Palate is open to the public on Thursdays from noon to 1:30 P.M. for a buffet lunch at $9.95. The extension to call for reservations is 236. Students in the Yorktown Heights program will also do off-site and on-site catering for meetings or special events.

HEADLINE: Japan's Recession Felt in the County

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG

 BODY:
FOR Kumiko Buller, a real estate agent who works for Ye Village Realty in Dobbs Ferry, a particular three-bedroom Colonial in Irvington had always been an easy rental property to offer to relocated Japanese executives who sought her services. That house's location near the train station and the elementary school made it desirable -- and as soon as one Japanese family returned to Tokyo, Mrs. Buller could count on a waiting list of clients.
But when the last Japanese tenants went back to Japan in July, the house remained vacant until March 1, an ominous sign to Mrs. Buller of the changing Japanese market in the county. "We see people going back, but we're not seeing their replacements," Mrs. Buller said. "Japanese companies are sending fewer people over, or they are closing offices in the metropolitan area. In the past, when the selling market was very weak, the rental market was very strong. Now the rental market is also weak. I can see the change very well." 
 Similar signs are also apparent to at least one restaurateur, Tony Saegusa, owner of Azuma Sushi in Hartsdale, which is a popular spot for Japanese executives. "For the first time in two decades, more people are going back to Japan than are coming over," Mr. Saegusa said. "Among our regular customers, we see that fewer companies are going to have new representatives here."
While the official numbers on Westchester's Japanese population have remained relatively constant for the last two years -- about 10,000, according to the Japanese consulate in Manhattan -- those who work with the Japanese community in the county say that there has been a significant change in the demographics of the Japanese population in the county since 1991.
 
Trading Down Is Now Normal
 Realtors and business owners who cater to this market say that the combination of tighter visa restrictions, which went into effect in 1992, and recessionary economies in Japan and the New York City area, have resulted in fewer Japanese companies sending executives overseas. And those managers who are transferred to the New York area now tend to be younger -- and are expected to take on longer assignments than in the past.
"Because of the recession in Japan, many families are sent back to Japan," said Dan Omori, vice president of Furumoto Realty in Scarsdale, a real estate agency that specializes in the Japanese market. "The moving expense is so great for Japanese companies that companies now like people to stay at least three years or more. And people want less-expensive properties now than they did two or three years ago." For example, while a 50-year-old executive might have wanted a prime piece of Scarsdale real estate, a thirtysomething replacement is willing to take a two-bedroom condominium near a train station.
Added Cynthia Landon, a rental agent with Redac, a Scarsdale-based real estate and relocation firm: "We're absolutely seeing a drop-off. The Japanese companies are cutting back on their overseas staff because of our economy and theirs, and because it's more difficult to obtain visas."
The impact of the county's changing Japanese population goes beyond restaurants and real estate. Younger families that are now being sent over are more interested in nursery-school programs than in school districts, with the ramifications being felt by after-school and weekend Japanese programs and by school districts.
 
School Districts Also Affected
 "The Japanese Weekend School, which teaches Japanese language and academics to school-age children, faces a critical problem in enrollment, especially in the last year," Mr. Saegusa said.
School districts that have long been attractive destinations for Japanese families are beginning to sense the change as well. "When I go to conferences, I have noticed people saying to me, 'Oh, are you losing Japanese students?' " said Rita McGuigan, a teacher of English as a second language at Edgemont High School. "But we haven't noticed a decrease yet, although some of my advanced students think that we will soon."
A spokeswoman for the Scarsdale Board of Education said that the district had observed that fewer Japanese corporations were sending executives to the area, although statistics on the decline had not yet been gathered.
 
Conclusions May Be Premature
 "We're not getting as many students in for a short time, the way we used to," said Barbara Gstalder, a teacher of English as a second language in Chappaqua's middle and high schools. "Our numbers are down. Normally, I would have expected 5 to 10 new Japanese students by this time of year, when the Japanese school year ends, but there is only one new Japanese student so far. There is definitely a slowdown."
Despite such evidence, others say, it is premature to assume that there is any real Japanese flight from the area. "Japan is not abandoning America," said Joseph Brunetto, president of JapanAmerica Communications Corporation, a 10-year-old company in Scarsdale that offers language classes in Japanese and English to Americans and Japanese and activities like yoga classes, aerobics, bridge and arts and crafts. It also publishes Japanese-language magazines and books for the Japanese community here and in Japan.
"The population is changing as companies are bringing in younger people," Mr. Brunetto said. "Very simply, the bubble burst in Japan the same way it did in America. Now they are downsizing and looking at ways to reduce expenses. If they have a 50-year-old office director with a wife and two children about ready to enter college and can replace that family with a 28-year-old person who has a wife and 3-year-old child, they don't need to provide subsidies for education. Companies are bringing fewer top people over here. They are also trying to give more autonomy to the foreign offices by trying to get the American staff to do more and stabilizing their work force in America."

HEADLINE: Enough of the Old-Style Summits

BYLINE: By Michael R. Beschloss; Michael R. Beschloss, a historian, is author of "The Crisis Years: Kennedy and Khrushchev 1960-1963" and (with Strobe Talbott) of "At the Highest Levels: The Inside Story of the End of the Cold War."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
After Presidents Clinton and Boris Yeltsin leave Vancouver, it would be a good time to ratchet down the ceremony between American and Russian leaders.
One cannot help but be struck that in atmospherics the Vancouver summit resembles less the low-key sessions Mr. Clinton recently has had with Western leaders than the media events of the cold war: two leaders flying to a third country at a moment of world drama, the throwaway remarks as they vanish behind closed doors, the TV correspondents filling time outside, the instant assessments. 
 There are good reasons for Mr. Clinton to have convened this first summit in the old style. Yet he should think carefully about the next time. Staging future meetings with Mr. Yeltsin or his successors in the customary grandiose manner could hamper his foreign policy -- by increasing the tendency to focus relations on one man, by shortchanging alternative Russian leaders and other states of the former Soviet Union.
Mr. Clinton hoped to provide the Russian President with at least the outward appearance of a meeting between two states of equal might, as in the old superpower days. Nobody's interest would be served if Mr. Yeltsin were to appear the supplicant.
During the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton criticized George Bush for his failure to expend sufficient political energy to fulfill U.S. promises of serious aid if Moscow stayed the course of radical reform. Flying to Vancouver allowed Mr. Clinton to demonstrate that he is taking a different approach.
Mr. Clinton is acutely aware that Russia could revert to its authoritarian and expansionist ways. He does not want history to judge him as a President so absorbed by domestic affairs that he missed the chance to prevent retrenchment. He also knows that such a retrenchment could produce hysteria at home, cause the military budget to expand and undermine his economic program.
Furthermore, a decision not to give Mr. Yeltsin the royal treatment would have been seen as evidence that, in Mr. Clinton's mind, Mr. Yeltsin's political ills were incurable. It would also have been offensive on a purely personal level. Mr. Yeltsin is a sensitive man who bitterly remembers his first U.S. visit, in 1989, when he was hustled into a White House side door, without photographers present, in order to avoid offending Mikhail Gorbachev. A full-scale summit is thus a boost not only to Mr. Yeltsin's shaky status at home but to his morale.
The fact remains that the substantive business could have just as easily been transacted during a quiet weekend in Moscow or at Camp David. Mr. Yeltsin will say some things he cannot say in public or safely telegraph through other channels: the exact state of his relations with the Russian military or which domestic political compromises he will or will not make in order to keep his job. He will use his formidable powers of personal persuasion to make the case for large-scale Group of Seven assistance to Russia.
Ritualized summitry adds nothing to these discussions and may even distract the participants. Indeed, both men seem to prefer quieter settings. Mr. Clinton's White House talks with the departing Canadian Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, suggest that his diplomacy is best when informal. Mr. Yeltsin's own allergy to rigid protocol need hardly be noted.
More fundamentally, for Mr. Clinton to afford Mr. Yeltsin the imperial-summit treatment in the future would personalize American policy toward Russia in exactly the way for which Mr. Clinton lambasted George Bush on the campaign trail. For Richard Nixon to hold a theatrical summit with Leonid Brezhnev, for instance, did not suggest that he was siding with Mr. Brezhnev against his political rivals: for all practical purposes, there weren't any.
But in the turbulence of today's Russian politics, this is no longer true. Recall the Abbott and Costello scenes in Moscow when Mr. Bush met Mr. Gorbachev in July 1991. Mr. Bush tried to include Mr. Yeltsin and other republican leaders, and Mr. Gorbachev tried to include them out. Mr. Yeltsin then announced that he would not be part of a "faceless mass audience." Invited to a private session with Mr. Bush, Mr. Yeltsin pointedly kept him waiting, prompting one Bush aide to complain, "That guy's got to be told we're not going to let him use us in his petty games!"


T hat farce suggests how difficult it is to have a ceremonial summit with a contested Kremlin leader while trying to take due account of his colleagues and rivals. Although Moscow hardly teems with reform politicians of national stature, there is little for Mr. Clinton to gain by fostering the notion that Mr. Yeltsin is the only head of the Russian Government with whom he can work. That would stifle the emergence of other reformers to succeed Mr. Yeltsin when he leaves.
The prime ministers of Japan and Britain and other U.S. allies, received in Washington in the conventional manner, can be excused for wondering why the President would persist in interrupting his White House schedule for days at a time to prepare for and fly off to a media event with a Russian leader.
But future imperial summitry with Russia might easily injure American relations with other former Soviet republics. Even now, the leaders of Ukraine and the Baltic states are not happy to see the U.S. lavish such attention on Mr. Yeltsin when their own foreign policies -- and perhaps their armies -- might collide with those of Moscow.
Ceremonial summits between American Presidents and their Kremlin counterparts were invented for a specific purpose. In 1943, at the dawn of the cold war, Stalin was angry and suspicious about the failure of Roosevelt and Churchill to open a promised second front against Nazi Germany. Always confident of his talent for personal relations, F.D.R. flew halfway around the world in an uncomfortable little plane to Teheran, in Stalin's backyard, in order to renew trust.
Without knowing it, Roosevelt had improvised a mainstay of the half-century struggle that followed. Grand summits brought a regularity and civility to a relationship that was fragile, strained and monumentally dangerous. But now that the perils of the cold war have mainly receded, Mr. Clinton would do well to heed George Bush's first private, handwritten letter to Mikhail Gorbachev, in July 1989: "I would like very much to sit down and talk to you, if you are agreeable to the idea. I want to do it without thousands of assistants hovering over our shoulders, without the ever-present briefing papers and certainly without the press yelling at us every 5 minutes about 'who's winning,' 'what agreements have been reached' or 'has our meeting succeeded or failed.' "
Mr. Bush did not take his own good advice. Mr. Clinton should.

HEADLINE: New York City Readies 37 Specialized Schools

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
In the most sweeping expansion of New York City's public high school system in decades, school officials are rushing to sign up students and prepare classrooms for the inauguration of 37 small experimental schools this fall.
The dozens of new schools, each with a curriculum centered on a separate theme, represent an extraordinary effort to bring into the mainstream educational approaches that have been tested, until now, only in isolated pockets of the city's system. The initiative, which involves starting up more high schools at one time than have opened altogether in the last half century, gained final school board approval in a series of recent meetings. 
 The new institutions, most of which will occupy space in existing school buildings or on college campuses, focus on topics varying from music to finance to community organizing.
Most of the schools were developed in partnerships between the Board of Education and unions, colleges, neighborhood groups and even some churches in all five boroughs. Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez's support has been crucial, and he and his top aides hope that the initiative will remain as his main legacy, overshadowing the battles over condom distribution, teaching about homosexuality and other controversies that led to his ouster.
"This is the most extensive reform of secondary schools going on anywhere in the nation," said Stanley S. Litow, Mr. Fernandez's deputy chancellor for operations.
 
Change Amid Many Tensions
 Educators elsewhere agree. "I think the folks in New York have good reason to sound breathless," said Michael Kashley, executive director of the Washington-based Council on Great City Schools. "What's unique is that they're opening so many new schools as a way of decentralizing the bureaucracy and offering more personal attention to students. One would think it was an act of genius if it weren't so obvious."
But the change comes as the city's school system is already experiencing tremendous tensions, with a divided central Board seeking a replacement for Mr. Fernandez, ideological wars racking many of the city's 32 community school boards, and many political leaders calling for basic change in the way the system is governed.
As a result, some educators and union officials are murmuring that too many experimental schools are being opened too fast. The scope of the undertaking has raised questions about how the lumbering school bureaucracy will cope.
With many of the students in the city's full-size high schools -- some have nearly 5,000 students -- headed for failure, the new schools aim to make learning more relevant by focusing the basic academic subjects on a practical community project or a professional or vocational specialty. Although some schools are to be vocationally oriented, the overall approach is meant to be much broader.
The schools are organized around a variety of themes, which will be used as springboards to present lessons in different subjects. At El Puente Academy in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, students are to study science by organizing a neighborhood measles vaccination campaign. At the High School for Economics and Finance in Manhattan, classrooms will simulate a corporate office. Students at the School for Social Change in the Bronx, pioneered by Hospital Workers Union Local 1199, are to learn community organizing through service projects like planting neighborhood gardens.
 
Little Effect on Crowding
 Thirty schools will open with ninth-grade classes in the fall. Seven others will open with lower grades and are to add high school classes in coming years. The schools opening in September will add about 4,000 new seats to the city's system, which this year includes 124 high schools. When they reach their average enrollment of 500 to 600 students in 1997, the new schools are expected to enroll more than 25,000 students, school officials said. Even so, they will have little effect on classroom overcrowding because the student population is growing by more than 20,000 a year.
Measuring student-staff ratios or class sizes has not yet begun, because most staffs have not been hired. But school authorities hope the new schools will give students more individual attention.
Since the board voted final approval on March 17, authorities have printed a new high school catalogue and rushed 170,000 copies to hundreds of lower schools so that students can re-evaluate their fall plans. Students were to apply by today, but applications received by April 15 will be accepted, school officials said. Students already accepted at other high schools may apply to the new schools and, if accepted, make their final choice later, the officials said.
 
If Washington Had the D Train
 The selection criteria vary from school to school, but in most cases are intended to avoid "creaming," or selecting only the top students.
The schools are in varying stages of development, but board approval has set off feverish preparations everywhere. The School for the Physical City, a collaboration of the Cooper Union, Outward Bound, and other groups, will build a curriculum around study of New York's bridges, subways and other infrastructure. It has already hired its principal, Mark Weiss. Last week in a temporary office at Cooper Union, Mr. Weiss and aides were planning a history sequence that will include a reconstruction of George Washington's Revolutionary War retreat through Prospect Park and across the East River.
The same day, recruiters from the Boys Choir of Harlem were visiting junior high schools auditioning singers -- boys and girls -- for the ninth-grade class of a new Choir Academy of Harlem High School, which the choir is organizing in collaboration with Community School District 5.
At his offices at 127 West 127th Street, Horace Turnbull, the choir's general manager, said he was searching for a school leader who can adapt to the singular traditions of the choir, which intends to build a classroom schedule around the choir's national and international tours.
Union leaders are watching closely to see how the involvement of community groups in the administration of public schools will work out in practice. Donald Singer, the president of the principals union, said he regarded the founding of smaller schools as a good idea in theory and had been assured by Mr. Fernandez that the new institutions would comply with all union contracts and staff certification requirements. But he said the bewildering number of new schools made him uneasy.
John Soldini, a vice president of the teachers union, voiced similar concerns. He has tried to track the initiative with office graphics, he said.
"But every time you finish a chart, a new school pops up," Mr. Soldini said. "This is a radical transformation of the system, and with the Chancellor in limbo, they want to move ahead as quickly as possible. I'm not saying it's a bad idea -- too many of our students are lost under the traditional structures -- but I've never seen anything like this. It's overwhelming."
Some of the schools have run into 11th-hour difficulties. Last week staff members and parents at Junior High School 293 in downtown Brooklyn, complaining that they had not been consulted, forced cancellation of plans to open one of the new schools, the High School for Global Citizenship, in a wing of J.H.S. 293.
 
'Schemes for Segregation'
 Two schools that are expected to appeal primarily to black and Hispanic students have drawn opposition from the New York Civil Rights Coalition. They are the Middle College High School at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, and the Leadership Secondary School, slated to open in September on the Lower East Side with sixth- and seventh-grade classes.
"These schools are inherently racist, new schemes for segregation," said Michael Meyers, the Coalition's executive director. Mr. Meyers said he intended to file complaints against the two schools with the Office of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education.
Despite these storm clouds, however, most educators viewing the process are speaking in superlatives.
"People will say that creating so many small schools is going to be an administrative morass," said Theodore Sizer, a Brown University professor who has collaborated on six of the schools. "But who cares? That's just a management problem. Usually, ease of management has replaced what is right for kids. Now they've reversed that."
Academics long ago began to attribute the high dropout rates and failings of traditional American high schools to their huge scale and industrial atmosphere, with school days punctuated by clanging bells. For nearly two decades, some New York educators have been experimenting with smaller high schools, often in defiance of the bureaucracy.

HEADLINE: 'Hey Prez!': Computers Offer New Line to Clinton

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
Want a full transcript of President Clinton's latest speech on housing or welfare? Just tap in a command on your home computer.
Want the White House to know instantly what you think of Mr. Clinton's economic plan? Call the "White House comments line" and punch in a response on your touch-tone phone. 
 Have more to say? Just type a note on the computer and punch in the White House electronic-mail address. In seconds, the message will have reached 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
Mr. Clinton does not have a computer in the Oval Office (he prefers legal pads), but he has surrounded himself with a new generation of aides who are steeped in the latest technology. They are marketing Mr. Clinton (his computer name is Clinton Pz) in ways that a President has never been presented before.
While the grind of speeches and news conferences by the Clinton Administration may be conventional, the President's messages -- critics would say propaganda -- are penetrating households and offices in far less traditional ways.
For the first time, even people with little knowledge of computers can send a message to the White House through electronic mail. One computer jockey recently began a note to Mr. Clinton with the greeting, "Hey Prez!" Another punched in, "To Waffle Willie."
Subscribers to major on-line computer services like America Online, Compuserve, Internet, MCI Mail and Prodigy can get information put out by the White House on their computers within hours after it is processed.
After punching the command "GO WHITEHOUSE," users of Compuserve see this greeting flash on their computer screens: "Welcome to the White House forum!" They can then retrieve speeches from the President, Vice President or First Lady on dozens of subjects.
They can also view photographs of the President striking any number of patriotic poses. In classrooms around the country, students and teachers can retrieve by computer the daily White House news briefings and schedules, and Mr. Clinton's speeches.
That is only the beginning: Administration aides are tinkering with things like digital photography that would allow the President's image to be transmitted almost instantaneously to people around the country, and building the President's own cable television network to show Government at work. There is even talk of a live, on-line "town meeting" with Mr. Clinton.
"The advantage is you're getting information from the horse's mouth," said Randall Davis, a professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has advised the White House on computers. "You are hearing what the original source said. Not only has the message not been filtered before it arrives at your computer, it has not even been repackaged."
Others warn that the White House is simply using technology as another way to go over the head of a probing press corps.
"People are going to be taken in by the glamour of having a hot line of their own to the White House," said Jarol P. Manheim, a professor of political communication at George Washington University. "And the glamour is going to blind them potentially to the level of management of information that inevitably lies behind anything they put out. The danger is that people perceive it as unfiltered when in fact the filter is one step back so that it's being done by those who produce rather than gather the news."
Opening the White House to new ways of communicating, however, does not guarantee a positive response. One computer user named Anthony recently fired off a message to the White House, attacking Mr. Clinton's economic plan and saying he hoped the President would "stop dividing this country by economic class for crass political purposes." (Mr. Clinton probably never saw the message.)
 
Not That Gore
 Hundreds of computer messages, or E-mail, are sent to the White House each day. A man named John Jackson recently sent an electronic message there and got a reply from a man named Alan Gore, who apparently does not work in the Administration.
"You are not THE Al Gore ARE YOU?" he asked.
"No," chimed in a man named Marc Perkel, who was also on line, "he ain't the Veep."
Then Alan Gore replied himself: "The Veep is Albert, and I'm Alan," he wrote. 'Don't feel bad: since the election, I have gotten quite a few phone calls (one obscene) and E-mail messages from people who are confused over the name. I also get lots of mail from Green wacko organizations, thinking I will support them in their mission of Earth-worshipping destruction of civilization."
A boy in Maryland recently sent this electronic letter to Mr. Clinton: "I am 8 years old and I am very concerned about animals and pollution in our country. Please try to make cleaner factories and cars and save our animals from dying. P.S. Do you have a job for me?"
The technology has not reached the point where people can routinely get electronic messages back. Until the White House tools up its computer operation, people who send electronic messages to the President and Vice President will get a written, albeit slower, response via the United States Postal Service (snail mail, computer users call it).
While there is no talk yet of amazing technological feats like beaming holograms of Mr. Clinton to every breakfast table in America, Jeff Eller, who heads the White House media affairs office, said he had been besieged by vendors asking him to try out assorted new gadgets, offers that he happily accepts.
He tosses off phrases like "pretty cool stuff" to describe the possibilities, but Mr. Eller vowed not to get carried away from his objective of getting Mr. Clinton's message out as effectively as possible.
"It's nice to have great toys, and technology is a wonderful thing," Mr. Eller said as he chomped on his familiar unlit cigar and fiddled with a full-color image of the White House on his computer screen. "But you should never use technology for technology's sake."
 
More Mail Than Predecessors
 Mr. Clinton is receiving more regular mail than any of his predecessors, officials of the White House correspondence office said, and messages by computer are coming in at an even faster pace.
"Our goal is to make all this information available to all Americans, regardless of location, and with no attention to station in life," said Jonathan P. Gill, a software developer from Medford, Mass., who is now the White House electronic mail coordinator. "It will lead to a more informed electorate. A lot of what the campaign was about was disaffection and alienation. The President used the term 'to reconnect.' It's wonderfully democratic."
But officials from the correspondence office said most of the computer messages were coming from a rather narrow audience: the best educated and most affluent. In other words, those who can afford computers.
Diane Bradley, a reference librarian at Auburn University who has made use of data from the White House, scoffed at concerns about demographics. "It's a current events source that the public did not have access to in full text before," she said.
With all the talk of high technology, the paradox is that the White House inherited an antiquated, patchwork computer system for internal use that many people simply do not use.
"People never turn their machines on because it's so dysfunctional," said John Podesta, the White House staff secretary, who handles all the paper that crosses Mr. Clinton's desk. "It's not helpful to send someone a computer note if they're not going to work on their computer."

HEADLINE: Egypt Warned U.S. of Terror, Mubarak Says

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said today that the United States could have prevented the bombing of the World Trade Center if American officials had heeded his country's warnings about an Islamic fundamentalist network in the United States.
But he suggested that the information provided by Egypt related generally to activities by individuals in the United States, not that Egypt had passed on specific information foreshadowing the bombing. 
 Mr. Mubarak called on the new Administration to take a more active role in stemming international terrorism, particularly activities inspired by Islamic fundamentalist groups. He blamed the current violence in Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East in part on Iran and in part on veterans who fought with Afghan guerrillas as part of the American-backed war against the Soviet-backed Communist Government in Kabul.
 
New Details About Suspect
 He offered new details about the background of Mahmud Abouhalima, a suspect in the World Trade Center bombing who was captured in Egypt and flown back to the United States two weeks ago. President Mubarak asserted that the suspect said during his interrogation by the Egyptian authorities that he had quarreled with Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, an Egyptian fundamentalist cleric for whom he served as a driver and aide.
In an hourlong interview, a day after his arrival in Washington, Mr. Mubarak also said he would ask President Clinton when they met for the first time on Tuesday to urge Israel to make another gesture to help resolve the problem of the 400 Palestinians deported to Lebanon in December.
But Mr. Mubarak's most surprising remarks concerned the bombing. "It could have been prevented if you listened to our advice," he said. Asked whether the United States had been given clear information about the activities of individuals and specific mosques, he added: "That's right. And this information has been exchanged with American intelligence."
Mr. Mubarak declined to give details of what information had been passed on or how the American authorities could have used it.
But other senior Egyptian officials said that several months ago, they had given the Americans detailed warnings about the activities and inflammatory oratory of Mr. Abdel Rahman and his operation in New Jersey, and about mosques in Brooklyn, through diplomatic and intelligence channels.
The American authorities have not publicly linked Mr. Abdel Rahman with the trade center bombing, nor have they sought to question or detain him.
 
Close Intelligence Ties
 The United States and Egypt have an extremely close intelligence-sharing relationship, and the Embassy in Cairo is used by the Central Intelligence Agency and its sister intelligence agencies as the information-gathering hub for much of the Middle East.
Despite the repeated warnings from Egypt, American law enforcement and intelligence officials have taken a somewhat sanguine view about the threat posed by Mr. Abdel Rahman and his followers. In an interview last month, senior Government analysts said they believed that his role in violent acts was limited to exhortation. The C.I.A. declined comment today on Mr. Mubarak's assertions.
Concerning the Middle East peace talks, Mr. Mubarak said he would "try to do my best with the President" to persuade him to urge the Israelis to speed the return of about 400 Palestinians deported to Lebanon in December.
This issue has frozen the peace talks. Washington has invited all the participants to a new round of talks on April 20, but the Palestinian delegation is demanding additional concessions on the deportee issue before attending.
"The Palestinians now want a small step within the package to take place," Mr. Mubarak said, referring to an accelerated timetable for the return of the deportees that Secretary of State Warren Christopher has presented to Israel and to the Palestinians.
 
'I Think It Would Help'
 "If President Clinton could agree with it and discuss it with Prime Minister Rabin," he said, "I think it would help a lot."
Senior Egyptian officials said one idea would be for Israel to bring back all the deportees by August or September, instead of the current deadline of the end of the year.
Asked about Mr. Mubarak's proposal, a senior Administration official said the Clinton Administration would be unwilling to ask Israel to make another concession on the deportees.
"The ball is very clearly in the Palestinian court as to its decision to come to the next round of talks," the official said. "The time has come for the Palestinians to decide on the basis of the significant package and understandings that got worked out with the Palestinians and the Israelis to come to the table, and that's it."
Mr. Mubarak said he would also urge Mr. Clinton to maintain the current amount of aid for Egypt -- $2.1 billion a year, saying he was heartened by Mr. Clinton's pledge not to cut the aid. Such aid is necessary if Egypt is to continue its economic modernization program and make up for lost tourism revenue caused by terrorist bombings in the last year, Mr. Mubarak said.
But he added, referring to budget debates in Washington: "We realize the situation here. We are not asking for any more. Economic reform will take another two, maximum three, years and then we will look to what will happen with aid."
 
Arrest of Abouhalima
 Mr. Mubarak seemed reluctant to discuss events surrounding the World Trade Center bombing, but he offered new details about Mr. Abouhalima, who was arrested in the Egyptian port of Alexandria and interrogated by the Egyptian authorities before he was sent to the Untied States.
Mr. Abouhalima's lawyer and family members have said that he was tortured by Egyptian authorities and that any statements he made were coerced. United States officials have said he was examined for signs of torture, but the results have not been disclosed.
President Mubarak said that after Mr. Abouhalima left Egypt in 1980 for Germany, he tried unsuccessfully to get political asylum "as a man who is not wanted in Egypt because he a Nasserist," a follower of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt from 1956 to 1970.
Before his return, Mr. Abouhalima went to Jidda, Saudi Arabia, to get an Egyptian visa because he had German documents, Mr. Mubarak said. He suggested that the Egyptian authorities had arrested Mr. Abouhalima on their own initiative rather than at the request of the United States.
During the interrogation, Mr. Mubarak said, the suspect professed his innocence, saying, "I'm ready to go to the United States to prove I am innocent, because there is no evidence against me."
 
Criticism of the Cleric
 Although during his interrogation, Mr. Abouhalima said Mr. Abdel Rahman was his spiritual guide, he accused the sheik of violating Islamic principles, Mr. Mubarak said, because the cleric had raised funds for Afghan guerrillas and put the money into an interest-bearing bank account, in violation of the Islamic ban on interest, and taking the interest for his personal use.
Acquaintances of Mr. Abouhalima say he traveled to Pakistan or Afghanistan for months at a time as part of the effort to help the Muslim rebels.
Mr. Mubarak said he would not request the extradition of Mr. Abdel Rahman, who has called in sermons for his overthrow. "Oh, keep him in your country!" the President said. "We don't need Abdel Rahman. You accepted him in your country, keep him! He is a normal Egyptian. If he wants to go to Egypt, he is welcome. But he is not allowed to violate the law."
Although Mr. Mubarak said Iran was sponsoring terrorism in the Middle East, he also blamed the United States for creating the basis for an Islamic terrorist network by supporting so-called Islamic fighters against the Soviet occupiers in Afghanistan.
"When the Soviets occupied Afghanistan and the war started," he said, "so many criminals, thieves, those who have been sentended to jail for several years, not only in Egypt but everywhere, were being summoned to participate in liberating Afghanistan.
"You in the United States were encouraging these people to go there to work against the Soviets at that time, against Communism. Then after the Soviets withdrew, the United States pulled away its hand."
Mr. Mubarak said that after the war, Iran had begun to use Afghan veterans for its own terrorist goals, and he called on the Clinton Administration to redouble its efforts against terrorism, in particular to help clean out the thousands of veterans who still live in Pakistan along the Afghan border.
The United States should play "a tough role," he said, "because it is a source of problems, and not only for the Middle East."

HEADLINE: Military Cuts: A Millstone for Ex-Workers

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS

 BODY:
David H. Dolson assumed he was on the right track. He was part of a team coordinating the production and delivery of replacement parts for aircraft made by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation. While still there, he set about preparing himself for work in a society no longer bracing for war with a Soviet superpower.
Mr. Dolson, who is 27 years old, determined that industry needed managers for foreign plants, so he earned a master's degree in international relations. Laid off in September 1990, he went to Bolivia and learned Spanish. Home again, he said, "I'll go anywhere." So what is he doing now? "Installing kitchens," he said. He earns $7.50 an hour, half his pay at McDonnell Douglas. 
 Mr. Dolson is one of the faces behind what policy makers call conversion, the shift of many military bases and weapons factories to reduced or altered missions. But for most of the people in the weapons industries, conversion is just not working.
The problem is not confined to McDonnell Douglas, the nation's biggest military contractor. If good work is hard to find for these workers, most of them skilled in modern technologies, what does that portend for the economy of the next decades?
Once before military-industry workers faced a large-scale conversion, after World War II, when a resurgent economy took them on. Some workers here say the nation needs Washington or a new Henry Ford to create new industries to do the same.
 
Sharp Cuts in Pay
 "And so far," said Linus J. Portman, a 51-year-old engineer let go by McDonnell Douglas after 26 years, "we don't seem to have anything."
Rather than the shift from one good job to another, as conversion implies, most workers find themselves in the same boat as steel and automobile workers, facing month upon month of unemployment, unstable jobs and sharp cuts in pay.
President Clinton has promised to spend $375 million through this September to retrain the workers, and retraining would consume an undetermined part of the $20 billion that he proposes to spend for conversion over the next five years. But some analysts say the money does not begin to meet the need to develop new jobs and the skills of workers to perform them.
"The long range economic programs being espoused by the Administration will not lead to jobs for the people being let go today," said V. W. Souverall, who monitors conversion as executive director of the National Center for Career Change in Walnut Creek, Calif.
Nationwide, Mr. Souverall said, nearly 400,000 military workers have lost jobs since the industry's contraction began in 1989. With more old Pentagon contracts winding down and fewer new ones coming along, he said, 450,000 more will be out of work by 1996. Other estimates put the total loss by then at more than a million.
 
Hampered by Slow Recovery
 Finding good new jobs has been slow in part because the recovering economy has been slow to produce them. But other influences impede the workers' conversion. Age is one. Many laid-off workers are in their 40's and 50's. Another, the workers say, is that some employers find them too specialized, or ill-equipped or spoiled and overpaid for cost-conscious commercial businesses.
Still another factor is that military contractors and workers conspire against conversion. Like many companies these days, McDonnell Douglas has occasional spurts in business that it absorbs by rehiring laid-off workers. They come in as temporary independent contractors with good pay but often without any of the old benefits. This only postpones the workers' preparations for permanent new jobs.
Independent contracting still appeals to the workers because the Clinton Administration's preferred antidote, training in new skills, pays slim rewards. Industries requiring the new skills are hard to find. Where jobs are available, the workers discover that they have to compete with kids who have learned the same skills. Like the kids, they must start on the bottom rung, at kids' wages.
The dynamics of conversion play out in a one-story, former McDonnell Douglas office building here. Using a Department of Labor grant of $3.4 million, the State of Missouri and St. Louis Community College operate a Worker Re-Entry Program for McDonnell Douglas's castoffs. Job-seekers learn resume writing and interview techniques and consult lists of job openings that counselors cajole from area employers. The workers with appointments for job interviews here arrive at the center in suits. Most days, just one or two suits show up.
Jane A. Boyle, the center coordinator, said that about 3,000 laid-off workers had enrolled over the last two years and that 100 to 200 came in each day, some every day. Most are white, middle-age men who had earned $20,000 to $150,000 a year and now collect Missouri's unemployment benefit of $175 a week, or $9,100 a year.
Job-seekers here say they feel devalued, like the crazed former military worker in the film "Falling Down." "I helped to build America," the character, played by Michael Douglas, says. "You should get rewarded for that."
Donald R. Earney, 51, earned about $30,000 helping run the internal telephone system that connects the company's acres of plants and offices bordering the city's airport. He began at 19.
 
'You Do Feel You Failed'
 He was laid off in September. At the end of March, he found work helping a Prudential Securities stock broker. He works 20 hours a week for less than $10 an hour, without benefits. "In 32 years at McDonnell Douglas," Mr. Earney said, "I never missed a working day. You do feel you failed."
People with all levels of skill and experience come through the center. J. Robert Caldwell, 62, shows up wearing blazers and plaid button-down-collar shirts. He was "director, international business development, McDonnell Douglas Missiles Systems Company," his business card says. He earned more than $100,000 a year.
The ax fell on Mr. Caldwell without warning in November, ending a 37-year career at the company. He said he spent nearly all those years at the cutting edge of missile technology. "I went out to feed the monster," he said. "The monster can't be fed any more."
Mr. Caldwell is one among tens of thousands. Since the middle of 1990, McDonnell Douglas has chopped its entire work force to 80,000 from 132,900 and in St. Louis, its headquarters city, to 26,000 from 42,000.
About 50 percent of those laid off through last fall have found permanent, full-time jobs, said E. Terrence Jones, a professor of political science at the University of Missouri in St. Louis who has surveyed the workers. Some of the rest have retired or remain unemployed. But he said some have also been in and out of temporary jobs, staying connected to the company as independent contractors.
"Contracting is a big thing here," said Ms. Boyle, the coordinator of the job center. "If it means six months of work, they'll take it." McDonnell Douglas owns a business that places independent contractors, most at McDonnell Douglas.
Donald J. Price Jr., who earned $17 an hour, about $34,000 a year, as an aircraft mechanic, said he hoped to be recalled. "I'm not going to throw away 15 years working on aircraft," he said.
 
Problems for Older Workers
 But the practice creates complications. In addition to postponing the workers' search for more secure jobs, it seems to feed a bias among employers against taking on McDonnell Douglas workers. Ms. Boyle says some companies balk at hiring them for fear they will bolt the moment McDonnell Douglas invites them back.
Like unemployed people generally, those having the most difficulty finding work are older workers like Fred Broemmer. Mr. Broemmer, 50, was laid off last July. On a work table, he places a four-inch stack of copies of job applications he has submitted to more than 500 employers, all for naught.
Mr. Broemmer was a $60,000-a-year manager overseeing two supervisors and 15 workers who maintained the offices and plants. He said there was nothing esoteric about the work. Most companies need people with his skills. His rejection letters rarely give reasons.
 
Stereotyping by Employers
 One that he said was typical, came from a health services company and read, "Although you have an impressive background, the qualifications which we are seeking to fill the position of materials manager most closely match another candidate."
Stereotyping of McDonnell Douglas workers may also be thwarting the searches of Mr. Broemmer and others. Such stereotyping holds that workers from a company contracting with the Government might not be cost conscious enough.
Roger B. Pickett, who was laid off in December 1990, earned $41,000 as an industrial engineer. "There's a definite stigma," said Mr. Pickett, 36. "I called one employer who was looking for an industrial engineer. I said I worked for McDonnell Douglas. He said, 'That's five strikes against you.' " Mr. Pickett did not get the job.
Employers will not directly acknowledge stereotyping, but one said there were grounds to the workers' suspicions. "I believe other companies don't understand their industry," said Ronald Uliano, St. Louis-area vice president for TAD Technical Services, which hires engineers, computer programmers and technicians for temporary contracting jobs much as the McDonnell Douglas subsidiary does.
Some people in business say that there are other considerations that inhibit their hiring former McDonnell Douglas workers. The area's leading power utility, the Union Electric Company, receives many applications from the re-entry center. Few get jobs, but the reason is that the utility, too, is cutting staff. Joseph Nesselhauf, the employment manager, said Union Electric had hired some people with needed skills, including three or four people from McDonnell Douglas.
 
Specialization Acknowledged
 Workers admit to one criticism: that some are overly specialized. William J. Drescher, 39, laid off in December, was a packaging engineer. He devised boxes and crates that were nearly bomb proof for shipping missile and fighter plane parts, some of the parts worth more than $1 million. "Not a whole lot of people ship that kind of stuff," he said.
He is taking courses in computer-aided design and computer programming. But there, too, he thinks any new job will mean a big cut in pay. Like many job seekers here, he is willing to relocate, but there are no more jobs for packaging engineers elsewhere than there are here.
Some workers profited from leaving McDonnell Douglas -- eventually. Patrick Fisher, 39, a chemical engineer, was laid off in January 1991. In December he found a permanent job here as a chemical engineer at the Mallinckrodt Specialty Chemicals Company, and he is earning around $60,000, 35 percent more than before.
More typical is the case of Veselina Jovanovic, who was a financial analyst at McDonnell Douglas. After seven months out of work and interviews with only two employers, she started work in March as a financial analyst at Washington University here.
The job is permanent, but the pay, $28,000 a year, is $7,000 less than she earned at McDonnell Douglas.
Job seekers here say the policy makers in Washington have hardly begun to grasp the human toll in paring down the military industry they largely created. "Everybody in this room has dedicated a reasonable portion of their life to supporting the defense of this country," said Jay Lowry, 46, an electro-optics engineer who was earning more than $50,000 when he was let go in December. "All of a sudden they're told, 'Goodbye.' "
Jeannie Broaders, 43, spent 16 years at the company, the last six as a human- resources manager. She takes herself less seriously than some job hunters, one day wearing a plastic parrot on her left ear, a one-inch-diameter orange ball on her right, and on her blouse a button reading, "I'm in a huge cult called the unemployed."
But she sees a monumental challenge facing laid-off military workers. "It's like the Amazon rain forest," she said. "There's no one solution."

HEADLINE: A Forbidden Fruit in Europe: Latin Bananas Face Hurdles

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia

 BODY:
The French Embassy in Ecuador has been pelted with bananas. Workers in Colombia's principal banana-growing region have lost their jobs. In Panama, the President was forced to announce that he could not close the canal to vessels with European flags, much as the people might like that.
Latin America is in revolt against Europe over bananas. The European Community recently adopted a package of quotas and tariffs aimed at cutting by more than half Europe's banana imports from Latin America. 
 Europe wants to help some former banana-growing colonies of European nations in Africa and the Caribbean by waving through their bananas tariff free while imposing steep taxes on the Latin fruit.
Many people here see the move as a sign of growing protectionism in Europe, particularly against Latin America, an area perceived by many Europeans as part of the United States' sphere of economic influence.
 
Like Snow in the Amazon
 For Latin American growers, who made Europe their fastest-growing export market in the 1980's, the decision is as shocking as a snowfall in the Amazon. Banana prices are falling here, land prices for banana plantations are slipping and some fruit is rotting in the fields.
Until recently, growing bananas for northern markets was a multibillion-dollar bright spot for Latin America's struggling economies. About half of the region's banana exports have traditionally gone to Europe, and growers calculate that the new restrictions, announced in February and effective July 1, will cost the region $1 billion and 170,000 jobs by 1995.
"It is one of the greatest acts of injustice in world economic history," declared President Rafael Leonardo Callejas of Honduras, a Central American nation that depends on banana sales for 60 percent of its export earnings.
Juan Manuel Santos, the Colombian Trade Minister, is fuming. "Diabolical, perverse, discriminatory and illegal," he said, and for good reason: his country is the world's third-largest exporter of bananas.
"Banana wars," predicted a headline in Colombia's most widely circulated newspaper, El Tiempo.
Belgium and Germany, a nation that is particularly fond of bananas, are trying to reverse the ruling in the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
Bananas are not the only Latin American fruit to run into barriers erected by a newly unified Europe. Apple imports from Chile will be drastically limited under a new European Community measure that mandates a 19 percent drop in European apple imports, to 611,000 tons this year. For Latin America's heads of state, Europe's exhortations about the marvels of free markets are now ringing quite hollow.
 
 
Calls for Trade Reprisals
 "The European Community wants to give us a tremendous blow, one which goes against all the free trade rules and principles which they have been preaching for so long," Panama's President, Guillermo Endara, said at a meeting about the issue in Ecuador in February. The meeting, attended by the Presidents of Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama, echoed with calls for trade reprisals against Europe.
The biggest beneficiaries of the new restrictions -- besides the former colonies in Africa and the Caribbean -- will be American banana eaters.
"After July 1, you are going to have 40 million boxes of bananas loose on the world market," predicted Francisco Swett, general manager of Exportadora Bananera Noboa S.A., Ecuador's largest exporting company. "There could easily be a 10 percent drop in American supermarket prices."
Costa Rica, the world's second-largest producer, has announced that on July 1 it will offer a discount of 50 cents to $1 on its 40-pound boxes. With prices ranging from $4 to $4.50 a box, the discount could be as high as 25 percent.
"If Ecuador does not cut production quickly and sharply, there will be a price war," John M. McMillin, a food industry analyst for Prudential Securities Inc., predicted in a telephone interview from New York. "Everyone is wondering: what's going to happen to the millions of excess bananas that can't go into Europe on July 1? U.S. companies should lobby in Brussels, should cut production growth and should pray for a hurricane in Ecuador."
In one effort to avoid the European restrictions against Latin American bananas, the Del Monte Fresh Produce Company began in the 1990's to supply bananas to Europe from two former European colonies in Africa -- Cameroon and the Ivory Coast.
"We have had our strategy to keep flexible about what happens in Europe," said Brian Haycox, president of the Mexican-owned company, which is based in Florida. "But after July 1, there will still be more fruit around than we will like to see."
In the last six years, the consumption of bananas from European nations' tropical islands and former colonies leveled off while Europe's consumption of Latin American bananas doubled.
Last year, Europeans ate 2.7 million tons of bananas from Latin America. Under the new system, Europe will import only up to 1.35 million tons of Latin American bananas with a 20 percent duty. Any Latin imports over that level will be hit with a punitive duty of roughly 180 percent.
 
Old Colonial Ties
 Although a World Bank report last year described the plan as "grossly inefficient," Europe's goal is to restrict the number of bananas and pump up prices paid to growers in areas that have the greatest influence in Brussels, the headquarters of the 12-member European Community.
These are the banana growers tending the small hilly plots of Europe's tropical islands, like the Greek island of Crete, the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira and the Canary Islands of Spain, and former Caribbean colonies, like Dominica and St. Lucia, once controlled by Britain, and Martinique and Guadaloupe, French islands in the Caribbean.
Under Lome Convention rules first negotiated in the 1960's, Europe's former colonial powers give trade preference to 66 former 20th-century colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.
Latin American growers, with their low labor costs and large expanses of flat tropical land near port cities, grow bananas at half the cost of growers favored by the European Community.
"It's absurd to take measures to protect expensive and inefficient banana producers," said Sergio Hugo Amaya Cordoba, president of Colombia's largest banana exporting company, Uniban. "It makes us angry. We open all our borders to Europe's industrialized products and then our agricultural products are blocked because they are competitive."
 
 
Consumer Backlash
 Growers here hope that the European plan will cause a consumer backlash against high-priced, poor-quality bananas. And there has already been dissent in Europe.
Germany and Belgium are suing to overturn the decision in the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. And Spaniards, faced with eating stubby, expensive bananas from the Canary Islands, cherish Colombian bananas like a forbidden fruit. In three raids since January, Spanish authorities have confiscated 37 tons of Colombian bananas, and news reports use language usually reserved for confiscations of cocaine.
In one recent banana shipment from Colombia, which was hidden among potato boxes from the Netherlands, the Spanish press described the seized contraband as a having "a street value" of $13,000.
The impact is most traumatic for Ecuador, the world's largest banana exporter, because it relies on banana sales for 25 percent of its foreign exchange earnings. During the 1980's, Europe was Ecuador's fastest-growing market, tripling imports in a decade.
 
 
Land Prices Plunge
 With July 1 looming, prices for plantation land near Ecuador's Pacific coast have dropped nearly 40 percent, to $4,000 an acre, from $6,500 an acre just a year ago.
"A number of small banana growers are selling their properties for the salvage value," said Mr. Swett, the manager of the Ecuadorean exporter, in a telephone interview from Guayaquil, where the best hotel is Oro Verde, or green gold -- the local slang for bananas.
Some growers are letting bananas rot. Others are giving the fruit to hospitals, schools and asylums. Exporters are desperately negotiating contracts with nontraditional buyers like China, Iran, Russia and Tunisia. Government ministers have proposed banana barter deals, trading bananas for 2,000 buses or to pay for a river dredging project.
And realizing that production will have to be cut, plantations are exploring new fruits: mangoes and hearts of palm.
 
 
Unemployment and Violence

Here in Colombia, the banana depression is expected to sharpen chronic violence in the growing areas.
"In Colombia, exports will fall by $100 million a year, 10,000 hectares will have to be eradicated, and 7,000 direct and 14,000 indirect jobs will be lost," according to a study by Augura, the banana producers association of Uraba.
Governed by Medellin, this coastal section of Colombia's Antioquia district is expected to become more violent once unemployment spreads through the banana fields. Last year, Europe bought 55 percent of Uraba's production of 50 million boxes.
"In these circumstances, violence will unavoidably return and will fertilize the landscape, allowing drug traffickers and guerrillas to increase their activity," the Augura report predicted.

Excerpts From News Session: Cementing a New Superpower Relationship

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, April 4

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a news conference today at the end of a summit meeting between President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. Mr. Yeltsin spoke through an interpreter.
 
CLINTON'S STATEMENT
 The heroic deeds of Boris Yeltsin and the Russian people launched their reforms toward democracy and market economies and defended them valiantly during the dark days of August of 1991. Now it is the self-interest and the high duty of all the world's democracies to stand by Russia's democratic reforms in their new hour of challenge. 
 The contrast between our promising new partnership and our confrontational past underscores the opportunities that hang in the balance today. For 45 years, we pursued a deadly competition in nuclear arms. Now we can pursue a safe and steady cooperation to reduce the arsenals that have haunted mankind. For 45 years, our nation invested trillions of dollars to contain and deter Soviet Communism. Now the emergence of a peaceful and democratic Russia can enable us to devote more to our own domestic needs. The emergence of a newly productive and prosperous Russia could add untold billions in new growth to the global economy. . . .

 	 	 		. . .	 	Mr. President, our nation will not stand on the sidelines when it comes to democracy and Russia. We know where we stand. We are with Russian democracy, we are with Russian reforms, we are with Russian markets. We support freedom of conscience, of speech and religion. We support respect for ethnic minorities. We actively support reform and reformers and you in Russia.
The ultimate responsibility for the success of Russia's new course of course rests with the people of Russia. It is they who must support economic reforms and make them work. But Americans know that our nation has a part to play, too, and we will do so.
In our discussions, President Yeltsin and I reached several important agreements on the ways in which the United States and the other major industrialized democracies can best support Russian reforms.
First are programs that can begin immediately. I discussed with President Yeltsin the initiatives totaling $1.6 billion intended to bolster political and economic reforms in Russia. These programs already are funded. They can provide immediate and tangible results for the Russian people. We will invest in the growth of Russia's private sector through two funds to accelerate privatization and to lend to new small private businesses.
We will resume grain sales to Russia and extend $700 million in loans for Russia to purchase American grain. We will launch a pilot project to help provide housing and retraining for the Russian military officers as they move into jobs in the civilian economy.
Second, beyond these immediate programs, the President and I agreed that our partnership requires broader perspectives, and broader cooperative initiatives which I will discuss with the Congress . . . .
We also agreed to work in concert to help resolve regional crises, to stem weapons proliferation, to protect the global environment, and to address common challenges to international peace, such as the tragic violence in Bosnia, advancing the promising peace talks we have cosponsored in the Mideast, and continuing our cooperation to end the regional conflicts of the Cold War era.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
YELTSIN'S STATEMENT
 I am fully satisfied by the results and by the spirit and atmosphere of my encounter with President Bill Clinton. It was in all senses out of the ordinary. But it was made extraordinary by processes transpiring in the United States and Russia conditioned by very special relationships developing between ourselves and Mr. Bill Clinton. We met for the first time but yesterday, but became partners back at that meeting in Washington.

 	 	 		. . .	 	At previous meetings, the nations' leaders discussed primarily the disassembly of confrontational structures, but here in Vancouver we talked about building the new, laying the foundations of a future economy. This was the first economically oriented meeting of the two great powers. . . .
We decided to eliminate discriminatory limitations on trade with Russia. We in fact said that we were simply hurt America had embarked upon the path of democracy, whereas America was still treating us as though we were a Communist country. In fact, we're struggling against Communism. I stated that quite clearly, and Bill Clinton agreed.
We are prepared to compete, but compete honestly. We decided to alter our approach to trade in Russian uranium, space technology, access to Russian military technology. We decided to do away with the Jackson-Vanik amendment.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We're looking forward to other steps to be undertaken by the United States of America and other major industrial countries to support real reform in Russia.
The linkage between that set of measures and other political measures was avoided. Of course, military and political problems could not be skirted. We discussed what might be done to see to it that all participants in the Bosnian conflict support the U.N. position. Here our positions match as to the main points. We devoted quite a lot of attention to problems of nonproliferation. We decided to extend our agreements on the avoidance of accidents, such as the near-accident involving submarines very recently.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Another very important result is that we, with President Bill Clinton, did establish some pretty close personal contacts. Bill Clinton is a serious partner.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q. (In Russian, through interpreter): . . . The elimination of restrictions on trade with Russia, if that does happen, will perhaps be the harbinger of the establishment of those relations of partnership which we've been talking about for so long.
Now, I'd like to ask you gentlemen, what particular priority areas are up for partnership and cooperation? And President Clinton, how do you feel? Are there particular areas which the U.S. might like to stress in building up business cooperation with the Russians?
YELTSIN: (through interpreter): On that first point, I should like to say that we discussed something like 50 issues yesterday and today, and practically all of those issues had to do with partnership. . . .
And in discussing those approximately 50 issues, we didn't sweep anything under the table, we didn't set anything aside. We decided either to pass them on for further investigation and analysis or else we resolved them on the spot.
CLINTON: I'd like to answer the question also and respond to what President Yeltsin said. Among the areas in which the United States sees real opportunity for joint activity are energy, space, the environment, nuclear safety.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The second point I'd like to make in response to the comment by President Yeltsin. We did discuss a phenomenal number of issues. We did not agree on everything.
But we did come to agreement on how we would handle these issues, how we would try to work through our disagreements and what we would do in the future.
Q: . . . Mr. President, on another irritant in the U.S.-Russian relationship . . . the patrolling off the Russian coast by U.S. submarines, what have you agreed to now to prevent these kinds of accidents from recurring down the road? Is this another case of old habits dying hard, that the U.S. still finds a need to keep these kinds of submarines off the Russian coast?
And for President Yeltsin, an irritant in the U.S.-Russian relationship is the slow withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic states and from Eastern Europe. Are you committed to withdrawing the Russian soldiers as quickly as possible from those independent nations?
CLINTON: Let me answer first. I don't mind saying to this whole assembly that I told President Yeltsin I very much regretted the submarine incident and that I had ordered a thorough review of the incident as well as the policy of which the incident happened to be an unintended part and that I would -- as soon as that review was completed, I would engage Russia at the appropriate levels to discuss whether the policy should be changed and where we should go from here.
That was a regrettable thing, and I don't want it to ever happen again.
YELTSIN: (through interpreter): . . . In regard to withdrawal of troops from the Baltic states, we are adhering very closely to the schedule on troop withdrawals from Lithuania, and we are completing work on that schedule since Lithuania does not violate human rights and treats the Russian-speaking population fairly. If Latvia and Estonia violate human rights, if their laws are presently so structured that in fact some national minorities continue to be persecuted, and that involves basically Russians, we have on the whole adopted a political decision, a policy decision to withdraw troops from those states. We will be scheduling the actual withdrawal in line with what they decide in the human rights area.
Q. (In Russian, through interpreter): . . . President Yeltsin, you indicated that Bill Clinton's economic package lays the groundwork for partnership between the United States of America and Russia and will provide considerable impetus to the reform process in Russia. In April, we're going to have a referendum in Russia. How here today in Vancouver would you forecast the situation unfolding on the basis of agreements reached here in Canada?
. . . President Clinton, the personal factor is a major element in policy, in politics. Now, what would you indicate by way of your personal contact with President Yeltsin?
YELTSIN: (through interpreter): In regard to the referendum, that's our internal domestic issue. Whether it will be impacted directly or indirectly is another issue, but it's up to us to deal with the referendum issue. It's up to us to work with our people, it's up to us to persuade the citizens of the Russian federation that if they do not vote in favor of confidence on the 25th of April, they will be dealing a major blow not only upon Russia, but also upon the United States of America, upon the other countries of the world. This would be a loss to democracy, a loss to freedom, a rollback to the past, a return to the Communist yoke, something which is entirely inadmissible.
CLINTON: My personal reaction to President Yeltsin based on these two days is, first, that he is very much what he seems to be. He is a person who rose from humble beginnings, who has never forgotten where he came from; and second, that his enduring virtue is that he trusts the Russian people.
The great courage involved in all democracies is that in the end, you have to trust the people, including you have to trust the people if they decide to throw you out.
Boris Yeltsin has put the fate of the government of Russia into the hands of the people of Russia. That is a unique thing in your history. There are few nations in the world that have the spirit, the culture, the richness that the Russian people can claim, and yet for too long, they were never given control over their own destiny.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN VANCOUVER: Not Just Another East-West Face-Off;
Welcome to the Lifestyle Summit

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 4

 BODY:
Vancouver may well be remembered as the first quality-of-life summit meeting -- a couple of world leaders up to their necks in debt, dwelling more on materialism than on the military, and on standards of living rather than life and death.
The meeting had all the drama of a bankrupt businessman applying for a bridge loan from the president of a failing S. & L. In part, this was due to the fundamental change in the relationship between Moscow and Washington since the end of the cold war. Before, Russian leaders presented their American counterparts with a threat. Now, they just present them with a bill. 
 As Mr. Yeltsin delicately put it at the closing news conference: "At previous meetings, the nations' leaders discussed primarily the disassembly of confrontational structures, but here in Vancouver we talked about building the new, laying the foundations of a future economy. This was the first economically oriented meeting of the two great powers."
 
Dull by Design
 But this summit meeting was also on the dull side because the two leaders scripted it that way. Mr. Yeltsin made it clear from the moment he stepped off his Aeroflot jetliner that he did not want this meeting to appear to be what it really was: a proud Russian leader coming to the West with tin cup in hand. Because if it was, his opponents back home, already painting him as a lap dog of Western capitalists, would have a field day.
As Mr. Yeltsin straightforwardly remarked when asked if $1 billion in American aid was enough: "Too little is not good because it is not enough to enable you to solve problems, whereas too much also could be bad, because it can be used by the Communists to target us. The opposition will say we are shackled by the West."
Mr. Clinton and his party, sensitive to Mr. Yeltsin's predicament, played along. In what had to be a first for a Russian-American summit meeting, an American briefer actually went out of his way to tell reporters about friction between the leaders in their one-on-one meeting, to make clear back home in Moscow that Mr. Yeltsin was standing tough.
The White House communications director, George Stephanopoulos, told reporters at the evening briefing Saturday that Mr. Yeltsin had brought up "irritants" in the relationship between the two nations, everything from trade problems to the fact that an American submarine recently bumped into a Russian one in the Barents Sea. Mr. Stephanopoulos went out of his way to note that Mr. Clinton had apologized to Mr. Yeltsin for the incident. Hear that Moscow?
 
Emphasis on Equality
 Mr. Clinton, acting like a sensitive nephew who did not want to embarrass his uncle when he comes for a loan, also never deigned to suggest that there was any asymmetry in his relationship with Mr. Yeltsin, or that this summit meeting was focused heavily on one-sided aid.
When reporters asked Mr. Yeltsin whether American aid would make a difference, the Russian President responded, "You know, it's always useful to help a friend, especially if a friend goes through a difficult period."
At that point Mr. Clinton interjected: "I just was going to say, I don't view this as a talk about aid. This is a talk about a long-term partnership."
This stress on parity at times was taken to amusing, but revealing, lengths. When a senior American official briefed reporters this morning about the details of the American aid package for Russia, he began by saying, "President Yeltsin and President Clinton agreed on a series of American initiatives to aid Russia."
Details of the assistance package itself dominated their first two meetings and the old security-foreign affairs agenda seemed almost like an afterthought, reserved for the last session this morning. The United States Government's press handout about the substance of the summit meeting also reflected this turnabout. It began with pages describing the new loans, housing units, energy, environmental programs and trade and investment initiatives that the Clinton Administration would be offering Russia. Tacked on at the end were a couple of pages about the fate of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties.
Even the local Vancouver newspapers looked at the meeting more like a business convention than something that might affect global stability. The local papers noted that the visiting diplomats and journalists were expected to spend $3 million around town during the two-day gathering, on phones, food and entertainment.
The daily summit newsletter passed out to all the hotels in Vancouver by a local civic booster group, led with the ultimate post-cold-war news story this morning. It read: "Is there life after the Summit for Vancouver's business community once the two days of attention and excitement are over? Experience says yes. Tourism officials estimate that Vancouver received more than $70 million in free advertising world-wide during the buildup to the summit." Cities around the world may soon start bidding for Russian-American summit meetings the way they do for the Olympics.
 
Both a Little and a Lot
 But Mr. Clinton also had his reasons for wanting to keep this meeting, and talk of American aid for Russia, relatively muted. Americans generally like to see their President out leading the free world, but they are not crazy about seeing their President doling out foreign aid, especially in this season of budgetary cutbacks at home. Mr. Clinton has been reading the polls, which are universally negative about lavishing foreign aid on Russia.
Mr. Clinton walked a delicate tightrope during these two days, wanting his $1.6 billion aid package for Mr. Yeltsin to look like a lot in the eyes of his Russian supporters, a little in the eyes of his Russian opponents, a lot in the eyes of America's Western allies, but not too much in the eyes of American voters.
"Both of them needed to low-key this thing," said Robert S. Strauss, a former Ambassador to Moscow. "For Clinton it was wise and for Yeltsin it was wise. Yeltsin could not afford to look like he came running with a tin cup, because he has nothing going for him at home. For Clinton, the duller the better, because he has got to go home and worry about Congress."
What was also striking about this meeting was the way it underscored how much these high-level encounters are no longer the stage for testing the mettle of an American, or even Russian, leader. John F. Kennedy's June 1961 face-off with Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna, or Ronald Reagan's encounter with Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Reykjavik in October 1986, were singular events that played important roles in defining the leadership stature of both men for history. These old summits were tests of political manhood and the press always asked, who blinked? But today's summits are a test of means and the press asks, who paid?
Indeed, Mr. Clinton repeatedly stressed that the "real news," the real big dollars for Russia, will come not in Vancouver but in two weeks in Tokyo, when the Group of Seven major industrialized nations meet to decide on a multibillion-dollar aid package for Moscow. The $1.6 billion package put on the table here by Mr. Clinton is intended to pressure the Japanese, Germans and financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund to give much more than they have before. That is a very different kind of leadership test.
 
An 'Investment' in Change
 Nevertheless, while Mr. Clinton clearly understands that he cannot be seen to be lavishing money on Russians at the same time that he is taking it away from Americans, he has shown himself much more willing than President Bush to sell at least some aid for Moscow to the American people.
Mr. Clinton uses the same vocabulary about his aid package for Russia that he uses in the budget debates for his economic program at home. For instance, Mr. Clinton said today that foreign aid to Russia is an "investment" that will help produce "untold billions in new growth to the global economy, new jobs and investment opportunities for Americans -- we are investing today not only in the future of Russia, but the future of America as well."
Hearing that, Mr. Yeltsin got on the bandwagon and declared that this aid was not a "Christmas present" but would "create more jobs in America, a fuller use of American economic potential and plant capacity."
Indeed, listening to Mr. Clinton in the past two days, it has often been difficult to keep straight when he is talking about his economic stimulus package for the United States and when he is talking about the one for Russia. Mr. Yeltsin added to the confusion when he ostentatiously pronounced that the $1.6 billion aid package offered him by Mr. Clinton is going to be referred to in Russian as "Bill Clinton's economic package -- that is what it is going to be called from here on in."

HEADLINE: Martin Marietta's Defensive Strategy

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md.

 BODY:
For Norman R. Augustine, chairman of the Martin Marietta Corporation, signing up to buy the General Electric Corporation's aerospace division for $3 billion last year was far easier than the monumental task he now faces in consolidating the two businesses under one roof.
That will mean laying off thousands of workers, closing production plants, and selling mediocre operations to achieve the economies of scale that Mr. Augustine promised last November when he agreed to the deal, which creates the world's largest military electronics company. 
 "There will certainly be more layoffs, not so much caused by the merger but by the fact that the defense budget is in free fall," Mr. Augustine said in a recent interview at the contractor's headquarters here.
"Every time they cut $1 million out of the defense budget, about 50 people lose their jobs," Mr. Augustine said. "There are many tragedies that are yet to happen in our industry. There may be a million jobs yet to be lost."
Yet the merger is seen by analysts as a necessary step to guarantee Martin Marietta a cut of what military contracting remains. "A normal part of Martin and G.E.'s life will be layoffs because of the great opportunity to cut overhead," said Phil Friedman, a military industry analyst for Morgan Stanley. "There will be some pain for employees, but Norm Augustine has positioned the company well in terms of the diversified programs it has."
The United States weapons industry, hurt by dwindling Pentagon orders, has entered a new age of consolidation in which military contractors are buying businesses in areas where they can dominate and divesting themselves of the rest.
The Justice Department's approval of the combination last week puts the 57-year-old Mr. Augustine in charge of the largest such consolidation to date. With General Electric's aerospace business, Martin Marietta grows to 94,000 employees, 27,000 of whom are scientists and engineers. Its sales almost double to about $11 billion, including $3 billion in sales from commercial and civil government contracts; its backlog increases to more than $28 billion. Before the merger, Martin Marietta ranked eighth among military contractors, with $6 billion in revenues.
Weapons industry analysts predict that Mr. Augustine will impose cutbacks of at least 10 percent over the next year, as the company eliminates duplication in administrative, research and production costs. That could put another 10,000 aerospace workers -- many of them mid-level managers -- out on the street.
Mr. Augustine said that he had not determined how many jobs would be eliminated as he was awaiting final Government approval of the acquisition. But he said a sizable reduction would be necessary to eliminate overcapacity.
Last spring, before the G.E. deal, Martin Marietta had announced it would cut 6 percent of its work force, or 3,600 of its 60,000 employees.
Mr. Augustine, who worked as an aerospace engineer in southern California nearly 30 years ago, said that he knows firsthand the uncertainty of working in an industry that is highly susceptible to budget cuts.
"There were times when I had no idea if I would be coming back to work the next day," he said. "The only difference was back then if you were laid off by one contractor, you could probably walk right down the street and find work with another one that was starting up a new program."
 
 
Consequences of Budget Cuts
 Those days appear to be long gone. Industry analysts and executives predict that the Pentagon's deep budget cutting will mean that coming layoffs will be permanent.
In the last five years, spending on military supplies -- including everything from Swiss army knives to submarines -- has declined 22 percent, to $161 billion in 1992 from $206 billion in 1987. Some 315,000 military industry jobs have been lost, or 10 percent of the total, and further spending cuts are seen.
As a result, military contractors that consolidate their operations and capitalize on their strengths will be more competitive and ultimately reduce layoffs, Mr. Augustine said. "Job opportunities will be better with a combined G.E.-Martin Marietta than with the two alone," he said.
At the start of the military spending cutbacks in the late 1980s, Martin Marietta decided to concentrate its efforts on so-called "add-on" products like advanced electronics, radar and computer systems that are used to modernize existing planes, ships and weapons systems.
 
Diversified Product Line
 G.E.'s major customer was the Navy, while Martin Marietta is a big supplier to the Army. The combined operation will have a broad customer base and diversified product line that make it less vulnerable to the impending budget cuts.
Martin Marietta's main military products are space equipment and electronics, information and missile systems, including the Titan radar, military and commercial space-launch vehicles and products. From G.E., Martin adds satellites and other space systems, radar and sonar systems, simulation systems, and government technical services businesses.
In the past, the Government thwarted three proposed mergers of military contractors on the grounds that the combinations would leave only one supplier in a particular area, potentially increasing the Pentagon's costs of procuring weapons. That worry did not apply in the case of Martin Marietta and G.E., whose combined operation will be a leader in the missile area, although not the sole supplier.
Having received the Justice Department's approval, Mr. Augustine, who has a reputation for being cost conscious, can begin streamlining. Martin Marietta faces considerable competition in the aerospace electronics field from Hughes Aircraft, TRW and Lockheed. But another challenge will be to continue increasing value for shareholders.
 
 
$750 Million of New Debt
 In adding G.E.'s operations, Martin Marietta assumed $750 million of new debt and was forced to suspend its stock repurchase program because of the acquisition's cost. With the G.E. debt, Martin Marietta's level of debt-to-equity rises to 45 percent, from 19 percent. Mr. Augustine said that the two operations are such big cash generators that he expects the number to fall to about 20 percent in the next three years.
The company has increased its dividend annually for the last 19 years, and Mr. Augustine said that practice would not change.
For 1992, Martin's earnings rose to $345.4 million, or $7.21 a share, from $313.1 million, or $6.30 a share, a year earlier, despite a drop in sales to $5.95 billion, from $6.08 billion. The company's sales to the Pentagon fell about 9 percent in 1992, but sales to civil government customers rose more than 20 percent, surpassing $1 billion.

HEADLINE: STRICTLY BUSINESS;
After the Peace, Finding Customers

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Amid the tidy row houses of College Point, Queens, stands a company that makes minesweeping systems, sonar equipment to track nuclear submarines and a small arsenal of other combat gear.
Hardly growth areas in the post-cold-war era. So the EDO Corporation, a 63-year-old government contractor, is venturing gingerly into bicycle spokes, subway speedometers, golf club heads and filling-station pumps for natural gas-powered vehicles. 
 The trick, still unperfected, is to come up with new products to sell to tens of thousands of disparate customers. Clearly it is a far cry from just filling Uncle Sam's precise prescriptions.
And the stakes are enormous: New York State's defense contracts decreased to $5.43 billion last year from $9.62 billion in 1987. That each $1 billion in contracts provided an estimated 25,000 jobs underlines the urgency behind the company's need to diversify.
 
Search for State Aid
 One of EDO's early moves in diversifying was to seek financial help from New York State. It received $710,000, mainly in loans, with most of the money going for machinery, equipment and renovations.
While many a company might welcome such help, state officials justify the EDO expenditure by saying that they would rather bet limited funds on those with promising projects already under way.
In particular, they say, such loans may be very important to companies that have never done anything but fill Pentagon contracts, and hence have scant relationships with commercial banks for loans of working capital.
EDO was founded by Earl Dodge Osborn, whose fascination with seaplanes led him to begin manufacturing floats in a shed on Flushing Bay in 1925. The company soon numbered among its customers Charles A. Lindbergh, Adm. Richard E. Byrd and Amelia Earhart. It is said to have produced virtually every float used by the Navy and Air Force during World War II. After the war, it diversified into sophisticated electronic equipment, mostly for the military.
EDO's president and chief executive officer, Gerald Albert, said his company got the idea of seeking state aid when the Hazeltine Corporation, a Long Island maker of military antennas, was given $2.1 million to help develop ways to transmit news broadcasts to such things as airliners in flight.
With Pentagon orders dwindling, EDO executives called Albany last May. Within weeks, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo was touring EDO's plant. An assistance package was delivered by November.
 
Competition from Utah
 The state moved quickly because Utah was making overtures to the company about moving its headquarters to that state, where it has several divisions and subsidiaries.
"It was partly a retention decision," acknowledged Vincent Tese, director of the New York State Office of Economic Development.
The company was straightforward about its needs. "We would have had to seriously re-evaluate being a major manufacturing presence in New York State were it not for this," Mr. Kaplan said.
Perhaps more important than money has been the state's ability to introduce EDO to the right new customers, particularly the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is in the process of testing EDO's subway speed sensors and may look at other ideas.
"Just getting them in the room with the procurement people at M.T.A. made them realize they could do a lot of things they didn't think were possible," said Brad C. Johnson, the director of the New York State Office of Federal Affairs, who made the introduction.
"I think EDO is going to be a pretty common story," Mr. Tese said.
A happy ending is by no means certain. For one thing, EDO has not yet had to worry about competition. "If we built a vacuum cleaner, we would build the best $20,000 vacuum cleaner in the world," said Ira Kaplan, EDO's vice president and general manager.
But today's need is flexibility, quickness and competitive prices. EDO executives, as well as their counterparts at other contractors, talk about the need to change their culture to adapt to new products and customers.
"It's not just a mindset," said Seymour Melman, professor emeritus of industrial engineering at Columbia University and chairman of the National Commission for Economic Conversion and Disarmament. "It's the way a whole engineering staff has learned to work."
EDO must reverse a decline in net income to $1.5 million last year from $5.9 million in 1989. Its work force has shrunk by more than a third, to 1,000. At the company's Queens headquarters, more than 480 jobs in have been lost in the last four years.
This is not to say that EDO is in danger of failing. Some defense work continues to trickle in, while some earlier big contracts are still being filled. When asked directly, EDO executives readily admit that the state aid is helpful, not critical.
"To be perfectly candid, if you looked at our balance sheet it would be clear we can afford to do these things," said Mr. Albert.
 
Chances of Succeeding
 But the wisdom of such help obviously hinges on a company's chances of succeeding. EDO points to Federal energy and environmental legislation that will make natural gas-powered vehicles much more attractive. The company has already developed and tested storage tanks that weigh two-thirds less than earlier versions.
And ultralight materials it makes for space vehicles seem to work equally well for bicycle spokes, at least judging by EDO's experience at a recent trade show. "If you can take a half a pound off a bicycle, they go wild," Mr. Albert said.
While searching for new directions, EDO's strategy is to listen to the dozen or more proposals that come from inventors and idea peddlers each week. But it listens skeptically and then defers to outside experts it hires. Everything has to relate to the company's technical expertise.
"We're not going to make sneakers or nonsense like that," Mr. Albert said.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Seeks a Return Of Jobs as Well as Nature

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORWICH, Conn.

 BODY:
The bleak and vacant industrial landscape that stretches along the Shetucket River will never be featured on a Sierra Club calendar, and rats are more likely to be seen than spotted owls. But in Connecticut and a handful of other states, places like this represent a new environmental frontier.
The state wants to clean up the 90-odd years of accumulated pollutants here and in the process is engaged in an unusual example of industrial archeology. But the driving force is not history or ecology; it is economics. 
 With this site, Connecticut is trying to develop a new approach to choosing urban cleanup projects. Although the basic mission of protecting public health is unchanged, the new paradigm factors in the property's economic potential. The dream is not for a return to nature, but for jobs and a new factory.
 
Identifying Sites With Potential
 "Our goal is to try and revitalize the cities," said Connecticut's Environmental Protection Commissioner, Timothy R. E. Keeney. "The key here is identifying the sites with economic potential."
The year-old program, introduced by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. as part of an urban stimulus package, mirrors what environmental groups say is a trend around the nation. Fueled by the arguments of advocates for "environmental justice," who contend that poor urban neighborhoods are often the first to be polluted and the last to be cleaned up, environmentalism is catching on as a tool of economic development.
"There is some sort of a shift going on," said Lois Epstein, an engineer at the Environmental Defense Fund, a group based in New York. "Where originally there was a lot of concern about the health hazards of these sites, people are now looking at these sites more holistically -- everyone has an interest that these properties be used and not turned into dead zones."
At least six states, including New Jersey and Michigan, now have formal systems to speed the cleanup of industrial sites that are dirty enough to raise potential legal liabilities for new owners or developers but not dangerous enough to run afoul of the public health codes. A bill before Congress, submitted by Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, would create a Federal grant system to encourage cleanups.
But Connecticut is taking a more interventionist role, experts say. Under the state's plan, selected sites would be scoured by environmental engineers working under contract with the Department of Environmental Protection, then marketed by the Department of Economic Development. The state would probably bear some of the cost of the cleanup, but in return would have a say in development on the land. As much as $50 million in taxpayer money would be committed this year under an expanded version of the program now before the Legislature.
How it would all fit together in this pilot project on the Shetucket River, however -- even how much it might cost -- remains to be seen. If the pollution at a site is not a threat to the public, for example, then how clean is clean enough for another factory? And how, exactly, will environmental officials apportion the cost between the state and an owner who may not have caused the pollution?
 
'A Lot of Unknowns'
 "I would expect them to be reasonable," said Fred Schimel, a vice president at Household International, an Illinois-based consumer credit company that owns the 55-acre Norwich site. "But there are a lot of unknowns -- a lot of questions remain to be answered."
History also complicates the cleanup. Everything from woolen cloth to gas meters were made on this property since the first mill building was erected around the turn of the century, and all left a sort of vapor trail of man-made abuses, from cleaning solvents to chromium, leached through the decades into the present.
And each of those uses and abuses must be tracked, as much as possible, to determine not only what the pollutants are, but where, and how they may have combined over time. Former employees have been found and interviewed, some even brought to the site to try to recall who did what to the land, and when.
 
Cavalier Attitudes
 "The historical information will help lead us to identify not only what should be sampled, but where the samples should be collected," said Edward Parker, who oversees the program at the Department of Environmental Protection. Sometimes, he said, the folk history of a factory can show the cavalier attitudes about disposal that were common.
"A lot of times what old business and industry used to do is that the guy used to take it out the back door and dump it," Mr. Parker said.
Velvet was manufactured here by a French company until the 1938 hurricane apparently blew the company out of business. During World War II, a shop making airplane propellers was set up as part of the war effort. In the early 1950's, a company tried to weave synthetic cloth out of corn byproducts. Then a company moved in that made ticky-tacky wire ornamentation for clocks and curios. Vacuum bottles were made here, too, for the nation's lunch-box army of blue-collar workers, until that market, too, began to dry up in the 1970's.
 
A Legacy of Pollution
 Test holes have revealed traces of almost all those companies: black partially composted synthetic cloth, degreasing solvents, zinc and copper from the wire-plating process and the entombed remains of three filled-in lagoons that were the settling ponds for the corn processing company, on which vegetation, even 30 years later, does not grow well.
An electromagnetic survey of the land hard along the river, where at least 41 barrels of liquid industrial wastes were found buried in 1980, has shown that it was an impromptu scrap yard. The metal detectors have also found a mass that may be the remains of a 1,542-gallon underground oil tank installed by the United Aircraft Company between 1942 and 1944 and since lost from the maps and believed to have been crushed by later construction.
The state plans to spend $660,000 on research and planning for the cleanup project here.
Still, some Norwich residents and former employees doubt that this property will ever be fully rehabilitated -- not because of the pollution, but because it was never the best land in the first place.
 
'Money Down a Sewer'
 "It's in the flood plain -- I've seen two feet of the water in the basement of the building," said Robert H. Kellogg Jr., who was engineering manager for the wire products company in the late 50's and early 60's. Mr. Kellogg, who is 83, said he believes the whole project is folly. "They're throwing money down a sewer to clean up a sewer," he said in an interview in his home in Niantic.
Mr. Parker at the Department of Environmental Protection said, however, that he believes the forces that once made the Shetucket River site attractive will emerge again when the land is given a clean bill of health. Anyway, he added, the process has to start somewhere.
"We've got old factories gone, vacant, abandoned," he said. "We need to do something."

HEADLINE: G.M. Plans to Shift Officials, Fill Post Vacated By Lopez

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 4

 BODY:
Directors of the General Motors Corporation are expected to announce a series of top executive changes on Monday, prompted in part by the need to replace Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua as head of worldwide purchasing. Mr. Lopez is now the No. 2 executive at Volkswagen A.G.
Following Mr. Lopez's lead, a number of key G.M. executives and managers have defected to VW in recent months, supposedly for higher pay. Several more may follow unless a temporary injunction granted Friday in Frankfurt persuades Mr. Lopez to stop raiding his former employer. 
 If VW does not stop recruiting, it will "ultimately lead to counter-measures," warned David Herman, chairman of G.M.'s Adam Opel subsidiary. He also called on Mr. Lopez to certify that he did not bring any G.M. documents to his new job. Mr. Herman did not disclose what G.M. might do if its demands were not met.
Mr. Herman's saber-rattling suggests that G.M. expects the German government somehow to bring order to an increasingly down-and-dirty struggle among auto makers. "G.M. still thinks that the auto industry is a club," said James Womack, a manufacturing consultant in Cambridge, Mass., "and the members should behave according to certain rules. VW is signaling that it won't play by the old club rules."
Both companies need to transform themselves into lean, responsive, adaptable manufacturers. Mr. Lopez is a proven agent of change, who lopped enormous costs from G.M. in Europe and North America. Clearly, his ability to elicit results and to foster an energetic management style prompted Ferdinand Piech, VW's chairman, to hire him from G.M.
Mr. Lopez has been trying to lure former co-workers from the purchasing department at G.M.'s Adam Opel unit, because he must cut costs at VW quickly and has no time to train new "warriors," as he referred to his G.M. colleagues. Only last week VW posted a $772.9 million loss for the first quarter.
G.M.'s European operations, enormously profitable for the past few years, are slipping badly. Part of the decline comes from economic weakness, but competition is getting tougher as well.

HEADLINE: Antitrust Signal Sent To Airlines

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has signaled to the nation's airlines that it plans to vigorously enforce Federal antitrust laws, in contrast to the previous Republican administrations.
But Administration officials say they do not plan to reverse the course of deregulation under which carriers have operated since 1978. 
 The White House's signal came last week when the Transportation Department forced Northwest Airlines to abandon plans to start three routes in competition with a new airline.
Of the change, the Secretary of Transportation, Federico F. Pena, said: "This Administration has a much different view than the previous Republican administrations about the anti-competitive behavior of airlines in a deregulated environment. Our view is to be more watchful about anti-competitive behavior and to take action on a case-by-case basis whenever appropriate."
 
Competition to Be Fostered
 "This does not mean that we are returning to a reregulated environment," Mr. Pena continued in a telephone interview recently. "We would like to see as many U.S. carriers as possible, and we will take action to foster competition, particularly where we see anti-competitive behavior aimed at eliminating U.S. carriers."
The Administration acted after Reno Air, a Nevada-based line that started flying last July, complained that Northwest was seeking the routes to destroy Reno. Northwest had planned to compete with Reno on four routes, from Minneapolis to Reno and from Reno to Seattle, Los Angeles and San Diego. Northwest dropped its plan for the three routes from Nevada to the West Coast.
The Transportation Department cannot stop a domestic airline from starting a domestic route. But Mr. Pena told Northwest officials he would strongly recommend that the Justice Department take antitrust action if it flew the new routes.
 
Antitrust Enforcement Urged
 Alfred E. Kahn, the economist who was the architect of airline deregulation during the Administration of President Jimmy Carter, said: "I have been insisting for years that enforcing the antitrust laws is not inconsistent with deregulation. On the contrary, once you deregulate, it becomes more important than ever to preserve competition."
But some Congressional leaders fear that the Administration may go to the point of stifling genuine competition. Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota, said that Northwest's action was so egregious that it deserved the Government's response but that the Clinton Administration should be wary about its application of antitrust laws.
"The question is: How far will they go with this policy?" said Mr. Oberstar, chairman of the aviation subcommittee of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee. "I think they would be well advised to consider the action as appropriate to the Northwest-Reno situation and not a harbinger of a new policy of wide-ranging protection of new entrants."
Secretary Pena, asked to speak to this concern, said that if two carriers sought to reduce prices on established routes in a manner not considered predatory competition, the Government would applaud this as a boon to consumers but that it would not countenance such action if the intent was to destroy a competitor.
 
24 Mergers Permitted
 Many experts agree that the Reagan and Bush Administrations did not vigorously apply the antitrust laws to the airline industry.
"Antitrust was minimally enforced during the Reagan years, and that was particularly true of the airlines," said Prof. Robert Pitofsky of the Georgetown University Law Center, an expert on antitrust law. "There may have been a few cases during the Bush years, but under Reagan and Bush the Departments of Transportation and Justice let 24 airline mergers go through."
Not long after Mr. Clinton was elected, the Justice Department filed its boldest antitrust action in years.
"The major enforcement action we took," said Mark C. Schechter, who was in charge of transportation issues at the antitrust division, "is the price-fixing case we brought last December against the major airlines."
The case involved the computerized exchange of the carriers' pricing intentions, which the department said let the major airlines reach agreements to fix prices. It proposed a consent decree under which a carrier would be required to set prices for future travel but offer those tickets immediately.
The Transportation Department hopes that the airline industry gets the message from its intervention in the Northwest-Reno Air case.
"It was an important change in policy, an important decision," said Patrick Murphy, acting assistant secretary of transportation for policy and international affairs. "The academics have complained that we deregulated without enforcing the antitrust laws," he said. "They say we allowed the law of the jungle. From now on, we're not going to allow certain kinds of behavior to go unexamined."

HEADLINE: In a Texas Senate Race, the Really Influential Parties Are Not on the Ballot

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, April 4

 BODY:
As a political spectator sport, the election to replace Lloyd Bentsen as Texas Senator has turned into the kind of wild free-for-all not seen here since 1961, when 71 people vied for the right to succeed Lyndon B. Johnson.
When the filing deadline for the May 1 open election passed last Thursday, 24 people had signed up, ranging from a candidate who gave his occupation as "honest lawyer" to a heart-transplant recipient who insists a vote for him is a vote for "automatic term limitation" because doctors have told him he has only eight years to live. 
 But as the field narrows to the runoff stage, it is likely to evolve into something else: a sneak preview of the 1994 Congressional elections and a kind of early referendum on Bill Clinton's Presidency. And looming on the sidelines here is a Texan who is not running but whose word could affect the fortunes of those who are: Ross Perot.
 
Interim Senator a Favorite
 The race has already provided memorable spectacles like that of 20 candidates trying to "debate" each other in Austin one night last week with Mr. Perot as the host. But the critical question seems to be not so much who will finish first, but who will come next.
The Democrat selected by Gov. Ann W. Richards to be interim Senator, Bob Krueger, a former Congressman and Texas Railroad Commissioner, is widely expected to lead the field in the voting, but to fall short of the 50 percent he needs to avoid a runoff. In a state of 17 million people and with a ballot of so many names (there are no party primaries to narrow the field in the special election), fewer than 400,000 votes could be enough to qualify someone for second place and a subsequent shot at Mr. Krueger.
The most likely scenario is that one of three Republicans -- State Treasurer Kay Bailey Hutchison and Representatives Joe L. Barton and Jack Fields -- now engaged in a brutal intraparty struggle will wriggle into a runoff. But there are plenty of wild-card possibilities, too, including Richard W. Fisher, a Dallas businessman and former policy adviser to Mr. Perot who says he may spend up to $4 million of his own money on the campaign, and Jose Angel Gutierrez, a former county judge who is the sole Hispanic candidate in this race.
 
Those Not on Ballot
 And even when someone does emerge out of a field that is bereft of any household names to begin with, the truly pivotal figures in the race may not even be on the ballot:
*President Clinton, for whom the race, the first Senate contest since his inauguration, will inevitably become a test of his popularity. He and Vice President Al Gore have already appeared once in Texas with Mr. Krueger, and Mr. Clinton has taken several steps to bolster the interim Senator's prospects. At the same time, the President has willingly countenanced Mr. Krueger's vote against some of the tax increases in his plan.
*The new Republican Party national chairman, Haley Barbour, for whom the race is an obvious precursor to a 1994 Republican effort to recapture Senate seats at the halfway point of Mr. Clinton's term. Party leaders, hoping that one of the three Republican candidates comes out as the challenger to Mr. Krueger, have indicated that they may pour millions of dollars into an anti-Krueger, anti-Clinton campaign.
*Texas's two pre-eminent officeholders and possible future Presidential candidates, Governor Richards, a Democrat, and Phil Gramm, a Republican and Texas's senior Senator, for whom the race is a supreme test of political prestige and strength.
*And Mr. Perot, who received 22 percent of the votes in his home state last fall as an independent candidate for President.
 
Wanting Clinton's Support
 Mr. Perot has carefully declined so far to issue any endorsement in the race, but many of the candidates seem to be falling over themselves to win his support. And if he gives even the slightest indication of leaning in any candidate's direction, it could be enough to push that person into a runoff.
Such a nudge could be particularly important because the race, at least so far, has not produced well defined differences between the contestants. And with the possible exceptions of Mr. Krueger and Mrs. Hutchison, who won a statewide race in 1990, no one seems to have high name recognition.
"The issues are so clouded that the voters are going to have a difficult time distinguishing among the candidates," said George Christian, a Democratic consultant and former top aide to President Johnson who is not advising anyone in this race.
"Everyone's running against Washington," Mr. Christian said. "They're either running a far-right campaign or a Perot-like campaign, but they're all running against Washington."
The courting of Mr. Perot and his followers was abundantly evident last Monday in Austin, where the Perot organization United We Stand America sponsored the forum at the University of Texas. All of the announced candidates at that point showed up except for Mr. Krueger, who sent word that he was in Washington waiting to vote on a jobs bill and fighting for "a new approach to our government."
 
Distancing From Congress
 Representative Barton told the audience that he was the first member of Congress to join United We Stand. Mr. Fields, a seven-term Republican Congressman from Humble, described how he had always kept his primary residence in his hometown north of Houston "so I never became part of the Washington establishment."
Herbert J. Spiro, a former American Ambassador to Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea who is running as a Republican, boasted that his United We Stand membership number is 14510. Roger Henson, an engineer running as an independent, promised "no perks, no PAC's, no pork." And Maco Stewart, a former state legislator from Houston who is the candidate with the transplanted heart, said it guaranteed he would limit his time in Congress.
Mr. Perot said the meeting, in which all candidates were allowed about five minutes to speak, was a variation of his town hall approach to government, but he gave no clue of any preferences. "Be sure to vote and vote your conscience," he told the audience.
In Texas politics, the special election amounts to a major event, just the third switch of Senators since 1961. It was touched off when the popular 72-year-old Mr. Bentsen resigned to become Treasury Secretary.
Democrats are, in fact, hoping for a repeat of the 1961 special election, only with the roles of the major parties reversed. In that election, the Democrats essentially committed fratricide, the party so badly splintered that a Republican, John G. Tower, managed to capture a Texas Senate seat for the first time since Reconstruction.
 
Democratic Unity, Mostly
 This time around, Ms. Richards and other party leaders have more or less gotten Democrats to coalesce around Mr. Krueger, a former Elizabethan scholar and Duke University English professor, one of whose major virtues is that he has no big enemies. Mr. Krueger, who failed in two previous runs for the Senate, got a major break when the Democrat who had emerged as his strongest rival, former state Attorney General Jim Mattox, bowed to party leaders' wishes last month and announced he would not run.
But he may yet find himself up against Mr. Fisher, a wealthy investor who bills himself as both a Democrat and a Perot ally. Unveiling a 30-minute town hall style "infomercial" last month that features him taking questions from an audience, the political novice reiterated his willingness to spend millions of his own money.
"The political process shouldn't be just for rich people," he said. "But if that's what it takes to break it down, I'm willing to spend a significant portion of my net worth to do it." In an interview, he said that never having run for office before was a "redeeming feature" of his candidacy.
On the Republican side, Mrs. Hutchison seems to be the odds-on favorite to make the runoff. She is anti-tax and pro-abortion rights, although some opponents have accused her of flip-flopping on the abortion issue. "She's the best organized, the best known and she has the best record of accomplishment," said David C. Beckwith, once a top aide to former Vice President Dan Quayle who is Mrs. Hutchison's communications director.
But in a such a large field, the votes could splinter so much that someone else could sneak past her, and both Mr. Fields and Mr. Barton can claim strong bases in the Houston and Dallas areas, respectively.
 
Early Polls Questioned
 Mr. Barton, moreover, has made a vigorous pitch to the party's right wing, emphasizing his opposition to taxes, abortion, gun control and, perhaps most stridently, homosexuals in the armed forces.
"That's me on the Phil Donahue show, taking the heat and fighting the liberals," he says in one of his television advertisements.
All told, the ballot will include 10 Republicans, 5 Democrats, 6 independents and 3 candidates from other parties. If no one gets to 50 percent, the State Constitution requires the Governor to set a runoff election for late May or early June.
One thing most candidates agree on is that early polls taken last month were largely meaningless, partly because they came out before anyone conducted major advertising blitzes. They showed Mr. Krueger, Ms. Hutchison and Mr. Mattox, who has since withdrawn, at the top with the others all struggling for name recognition.
And they also agree that there is one other wild card on the ballot, but it isn't a candidate. The election will include a referendum on a major constitutional amendment to alter Texas's school financing system by shifting money from rich districts to poorer ones.
Republicans have generally opposed the amendment while Democrats like Governor Richards and Mr. Krueger, although not Mr. Fisher, are for it. And while polls suggest that most Texans are just beginning to focus on the measure, a strong turnout for or against could have an impact on who makes the runoff.

HEADLINE: Republicans Redux

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 4

 BODY:
The stalemate in the Senate is not really about whether spending $16.3 billion will save the economic recovery, as Democrats say. Nor is it fundamentally about the national debt or the folly of taxing and spending, as Republicans maintain.
There is not enough money in the bill to explain the passion displayed on either side. 
 The fight is about Republican power, collectively and also individually.
Collectively, the Republican fight is over being treated as significant players on day-to-day Senate matters and as a serious force on major national issues looming on the political horizon, like health care.
 
A Republican Filibuster
 Individually, it also seems to concern Presidential ambition, as Republican senators seek to claim the leading role in opposition to President Clinton.
The 43 Republicans seem determined to continue their filibuster and keep preventing a vote unless the bill is cut back. Democrats know that, and will talk about cuts. But nobody yet knows how much of a cut.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said today on the CBS News program "Face the Nation" that the Administration would be "really concerned" if Republican pride was cutting the program in half. He said, "It is not a big package to start with, and there are some things in there that are quite important to the economy and to the President himself."
Negotiations among Senate leaders will resume Monday. Some settlement is likely by Wednesday, so the Senate can turn to raising the statutory limit on the national debt that day, or else Government checks might bounce, and senators would get no spring break.
 
Surprised by Attack
 The Clinton Administration was surprised by the ferocity and persistence of the Republican attack. It tends to dismiss Republican motives as petty. Its readiest explanation is that Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, is being pushed to confrontation by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, in a preliminary round of the 1996 Presidential contest.
That seems to be part of it, but it doesn't explain the unified Republican front. Joining in the filibuster, after all, are Senators who dislike Mr. Gramm and his comrades in confrontation, like Trent Lott of Mississippi and Larry Craig of Idaho, more intensely than they dislike Mr. Clinton or his policies.
The Republican explanation, propounded Friday by Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, the party whip, is that Republicans rose up in righteous "indignation" at a series of parliamentary indignities.
Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, did invoke a severe parliamentary approach to bar amendments to the spending bill. But he later withdrew it. By then, Republicans were angry at the method chosen to ram the debt limit bill through when its turn comes. In the Finance Committee at least, that anger seemed intended for show.
 
No Popularity Contests
 Mr. Byrd does not try to win popularity contests, and in trying to pass Mr. Clinton's bill he may have shown more parliamentary than diplomatic skill.
But in fact, the self-portrait Republicans draw of a cooperative, helpful minority suddenly shocked at parliamentary hard ball is not one that Democrats can recall seeing on the Senate floor lately. After agreeing to quick Cabinet confirmations, Republicans have delayed just about every bill that came up.
Mr. Dole has varied those delays strategically. Republicans cut short their obstruction of family leave, a very popular measure. But on the less-noticed "motor voter" bill to ease voter registration, their filibuster won them major concessions.
 
Probing for Weakness
 In fact, throughout the session Republicans have been probing for weakness, looking for opportunities to show the Democrats they matter.
They try to pick subjects where they sense the public is not engaged, and therefore where Republicans do not run a severe risk of being seen as guardians of "gridlock." Mr. Bentsen and George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's spokesman, tried to make that label stick today, just as Mr. Clinton and Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, had tried Friday. But most senators find no public clamor for, or against, the bill.
For some Republicans, especially veterans of the House where cooperation and even civility between parties is in short supply, fighting the Democrats and appearing on C-SPAN's Senate coverage is an end in itself. Senators Gramm, Lott, Craig and John McCain of Arizona fit that category.
But there is another motive for other Republicans to try to prove to Democrats that they matter.
 
Cause Is Health Care
 Take the suddenly furious John Chafee of Rhode Island. He said Friday a little gridlock was the only alternative to "us being a bunch of doormats around here, who roll over and just let everything go on through."
His cause is health care, and like many of the Republicans who have immersed themselves in that subject with him for two years, he seems doubtful that the Clinton Administration means what it says when it promises to consult seriously.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, who as chairman of the Finance Committee regards Republican help as essential to any serious legislating on health care, said of the minority: "The simple matter is that they have not been consulted. They have the feeling they are not going to be, and they say to hell with it."
 
Few Concessions Likely
 By now each side has made its point, and Mr. Clinton will be back in Washington to decide how much he is willing to give up. His aides insist they are prepared for a few concessions.
Mr. Dole is expected to offer Mr. Mitchell a proposal Monday, retaining money for unemployment benefits and some obvious job-producing elements of the bill. And then, after consulting with the White House, Mr. Mitchell is likely to make a bigger counter-proposal.
Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Byrd can coordinate easily enough with the Administration. But different Republicans may have different standards of what deal is acceptable.
As for Mr. Mitchell, he said today, "We'll do the best we can to pass the President's bill, or as close to it as we can come."

HEADLINE: Ludwig Jesselson, 82, Commodity-Trade Executive

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Ludwig Jesselson, a philanthropist and retired commodity trading executive who was chairman of the board of trustees of Yeshiva University, died Saturday at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem. He was 82 and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
Sam Hartstein, the university's director of public relations, said he died after suffering a heart attack in an apartment he maintained in Jerusalem, where he had gone for Passover. 
 Mr. Jesselson was the longtime chairman and chief executive officer of Philipp Brothers, a Manhattan-based commodity-trading company.
In early 1980, not long before Mr. Jesselson's retirement, Philipp Brothers was one of the world's largest marketers of raw materials, bartering more than 150 basic commodities, including steel, crude oil and cement. It was then a division of Englehard Minerals and Chemicals Corporation.
 
Helped Finance Museum
 After stepping down from the Philipp Brothers posts, Mr. Jesselson remained for some years a director of Englehard Minerals and Chemicals and of its successive descendents, Phibro Corporation, Phibro-Salomon and Salomon Inc.
Mr. Jesselson became chairman of Yeshiva's board in 1989 after serving as a trustee since 1961. He and his wife of more than 40 years, the former Erica Pappenheim, helped the university pay for the construction of its museum, for the museum's operating expenses, and for many of the museum's acquisitions.
In 1987, Mr. and Mrs. Jesselson gave the museum a letter written in 1818 by Thomas Jefferson in which the former President condemned prejudice toward Jews and all racial intolerance. Mr. Jesselson, a collector of Judaica and Hebraica, bought the letter in 1986 at Sotheby's in Manhattan for $396,000, which was the highest price paid at auction for any letter or any Presidential document.
In his honor, Salomon Inc. established the Ludwig Jesselson Chair in Economics at Yeshiva University in 1986.
 
Philanthropic Activities
 Mr. Jesselson's philanthropic and volunteer activities included fund-raising for the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of Greater New York and serving as a director of the Riverdale Jewish Center. In addition, he contributed to many nonprofit organizations and activities in Israel and financed several archeological excavations there. He was the retired chairman of the Global Board of Trustees of Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, east of Tel Aviv.
At his death, he was also chairman of the board of the American committee of Shaare Zedek Medical Center, having retired earlier as chairman of its international board.
Morris Talansky, the medical center's executive vice chairman, said yesterday that Mr. and Mrs. Jesselson had provided the money for much of its construction and for the operating expenses of several of its departments.
Over the years, Mr. Jesselson received many honors for his philanthropy, including the Kesher Shem Tov Award of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America.
He was born in southwestern Germany, in the small community of Neckarbischofsheim in what became the state of Baden-Wurttemberg. He went on to attend school in Heidelberg before entering the commodities-trading world as a teen-age apprentice trader in a Berlin company.
Mr. Jesselson emigrated to the United States in 1937. He joined Philipp Brothers in 1938, became one of its prime movers by 1950 and was named its chief executive officer and chairman in the early 1960's.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Jesselson is survived by three sons, Michael and Daniel, both of Manhattan, and Benjamin, of Jerusalem; 13 grandchildren, and a brother, Sigmund Jeselsohn, of Zurich.

HEADLINE: GATT Chief Says U.S. Delays Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, April 4

 BODY:
An international trade agreement that would stimulate the shaky world economy is being delayed while the Clinton Administration devotes political energy and negotiators to the North American Free Trade Agreement, the departing head of the world's free trade body says.
The remarks by Arthur Dunkel, the director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is based here and administers international free trade rules, underscore the problem the Clinton Administration faces as it tries to reach two free trade agreements at the same time. 
 Concessions in the GATT negotiations, for example, could antagonize the textile industry and other business groups in the United States whose support is needed by the Administration for the difficult struggle this fall of winning Congressional approval of the North American agreement.
In an effort to restart the world trade talks, which began in Uruguay in 1986, American and European officials plan to hold several meetings by early June, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, announced last Monday. But in an interview on Friday, Mr. Dunkel discounted Mr. Kantor's efforts.
"The message given is that the Uruguay Round is still very high on the agenda," Mr. Dunkel said, "but the reality is that, of course, if the officials of U.S.T.R. get to their office in the morning they generally have an urgent file on Nafta which comes before the urgent file on GATT, that is clear."
Stephen L. Engelberg, the acting chief of staff for Mr. Kantor, said that Mr. Dunkel was mistaken and that only Mr. Kantor and a handful of other officials were involved in both agreements.
Mr. Engelberg said that Mr. Kantor had spent as much time on the Uruguay Round as on the North American pact. "There is no strategy here to put off anything in terms of negotiations until the Nafta is voted on," he said. Mr. Kantor and several of his aides flew to Ottawa on Friday to discuss the North American pact with Canadian officials and were not available for comment.
The North American pact would eliminate trade barriers among Canada, Mexico and the United States. The international trade pact would reduce import tariffs around the world for GATT's 112 nations and apply free trade rules for the first time to agriculture and services like shipping and insurance.
 
Other Delays Cited
 Mr. Dunkel cautioned that the North American agreement was nonetheless "worth concluding" and said that the European Community's preoccupation with further economic and monetary integration during the last year had also delayed the Uruguay Round.
European officials have been following the North American pact's progress but expressed little sympathy last week for the Administration's predicament. Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's vice president for external economic affairs, said in an interview on Wednesday that quick compromises were needed in world trade talks regardless of the political damage this might cause to the Congressional prospects of the North American pact.
"I think we'll have to get serious agreements going before November, simply because this is not just a bilateral process, we've got to involve the rest of the world and take what they say seriously and produce a package that is acceptable to everybody," Sir Leon said.
Sir Leon also said in the interview that when Mr. Kantor visited Brussels on Monday the two men agreed to try to make trade issues prominent on the agenda when the leaders of the world's seven leading industrial nations meet in Tokyo on July 7 to 9.
 
Getting Japan Involved
 Sir Leon said he hoped that such an emphasis would put new pressure on the Japanese to make fresh offers and play a more active role in the world trade talks. Sir Leon and Mr. Kantor called for such a role by Japan when they first met six weeks ago in Washington. Japanese officials contend that they have been active participants in the Uruguay round.
Key members of Congress and the Administration have been discussing for weeks a possible renewal of 8 to 10 months of the fast-track Presidential negotiating authority needed to conclude a world trade agreement. Such a timetable would allow politically sensitive compromises to be reached after Congress votes on the North American pact, mostly likely in October or November.
A big problem still ahead of the Administration is that a GATT deal at the end of the year, a deadline set by President Clinton, would reach the floor of the House and Senate under fast-track rules shortly before the 1994 Congressional elections. Conventional wisdom in Washington holds that controversial trade pacts are more readily approved in odd-numbered years, when support may be easier to muster.
One key European demand in the world trade talks has been for steep reductions in American tariffs on imported textiles. Yet any concession in this area before the vote on the North American pact could alienate legislators from textile states who might have wanted to support the North American pact, said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who supports both trade pacts and is on the Ways and Means Committee's trade panel.
 
Textile Group's Position
 The American Textile Manufacturers Institute, a Washington-based trade group that represents fabric producers and has a long protectionist history, has enthusiastically endorsed the North American pact.
The agreement would eliminate American restrictions on imports from Mexican clothing producers -- who rely on American fabric. This would give the Mexican producers an advantage over Asian producers, who face strict quotas on shipments to the United States and who tend to cut and sew fabric made in Asia. So the North American pact could help American textile producers.
But Carlos Moore, the institute's executive vice president, said that if the United States made any concessions soon in the world trade talks then "our focus is going to be on defeating that -- and will certainly take away some of our direction, some of our concerted action, on behalf of the Nafta."
Mr. Dunkel officially confirmed today what trade officials had been predicting recently -- that he would step down when the latest extension of his term expires at the end of June. Named to a six-year term in 1980, Mr. Dunkel has won a series of extensions as member nations of the trade group kept hoping that the Uruguay Round might be concluded soon.

HEADLINE: A Strong First Quarter For Foreign Portfolios

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
For the first time in four years, Americans who invested their dollars in foreign stocks in the first quarter instead of here at home had cause to be satisfied.
The quarter was characterized by falling interest rates in many industrialized countries, generally benign swings in the value of the dollar and a Japanese Government-led surge on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the world's second biggest. 
 All these factors helped to raise stock prices outside the United States by nearly 12 percent in dollar terms, according to the Financial Times world index.
 
Overseas Gains
 "On balance, this was a very good quarter for international investors, even dollar-based investors," said Jeffrey Russell, a portfolio manager at Smith Barney's World Funds International Equity portfolio.
Americans who used mutual funds as their ticket overseas did nearly three times as well as those who invested their money at home.
In the first quarter, the 287 world equity funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services rose by 9.74 percent, while the 1,080 general equity funds that invest in American companies rose by 3.29 percent, slightly less than the 3.7 percent increase posted during the first quarter by the Standard & Poor's 500 index.
"This is the first time in four years that world equity funds have outperformed the domestic ones," said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical.
Much of the gain abroad reflected a strong performance in Japan.
In dollar terms, Japanese stocks rose by more than 18.50 percent in the quarter, a gain that was helped by the strength of the yen against the dollar. (In terms of the yen, Japanese stocks rose by slightly more than 9 percent.)
 
An Artificial Surge?
 The Japanese Government assisted the rally by introducing fiscal stimulus packages and encouraging giant insurance companies to buy shares. Foreign portfolio managers who had lightened up on positions in Japan during the market's long downward spiral provided additional momentum by coming back in once the rally began.
 Despite the strong performance, analysts were left wondering just how much longer Japanese stocks could continue to rise.
"The $64 question is just how real the rally there is," said David Testa, chairman of T. Rowe Price International Funds, with nearly $7 billion under management.
Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, said he thought the rise in Tokyo was way overdone.
"I think the Japanese market is grossly overpriced," Mr. Metz said. "The powers that be succeeded in getting prices up, but keeping them up there is another matter."
Mr. Metz and others extolled the virtues of other Asian stock markets, including Hong Kong's, which in dollar terms rose by almost 16 percent in the first quarter, and Malaysia's, which was up by more than 7 percent.
 While interest rate cuts in Germany helped to raise prices on the Frankfurt stock exchange by more than 10 percent, and by more than 12 percent on the Paris Bourse, some analysts said even greater returns were likely on European markets.
'It doesn't yet look like a big bull run," Mr. Testa said, "but they are making progress, and even with the weak economic environment there is not a lot of risk in those markets. If the rate cuts continue, we should have a good year in Europe."
Mr. Metz was even more enthusiastic. Short-term interest rates in Germany and France are still higher than long-term rates, he noted, leading to an "enormous" overweighting in short-term investments.
"As interest rates come down, we believe there will be an enormous swing into equities, particularly in France," he said.

HEADLINE: Essay;
In the Cruelest Month

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"April is the cruelest month," wrote the poet T. S. Eliot, ". . . mixing Memory and desire."
In the April that features the first global presidential campaign, Boris Yeltsin is reminding both his compatriots and former superpower competitors of the threat to freedom of revanchist apparatchiks, while fanning the desire "to move from general assurances to pragmatic, specific acts." 
 In this noble enterprise, Bill Clinton has joined what amounts to the Friends of Boris, a network of shallow-pocketed political leaders, cautious entrepreneurs and many of us gung-ho multimedia types. The immediate goal of the new F.O.B.: without appearing intrusive, to help the Russian reformers win the April 25 referendum.
That was the sole purpose of the Vancouver summit. Such outside political aid has its precedents: Khrushchev confessed he tried to help Kennedy defeat Nixon, and Brezhnev later tried to prop up Nixon at a summit after Watergate; in the other direction, Reagan and Bush tried to support Gorbachev against Yeltsin's challenge. The success rate of intercontinental carpetbagging has not been high.
But an unbroken string of flops is no reason not to give the April referendum our best shot. Last weekend's meeting -- more a pep rally than what Churchill called "a parley at the summit" -- should be judged in the light of what it set out to do.
Did it send inspiring pictures home to Russia? Yes; the shot of Yeltsin disdaining an umbrella, that symbol of weakness and appeasement, preferring to stand in the cold Canadian rain hatless and fearless, was as close as he could come to climbing on a tank. (Clinton had to follow suit; only their host, Brian Mulroney, classily stepping down as Prime Minister to preserve his party's national leadership, could afford to take cover like a sensible person.)
And at the joint press conference at the conclusion of their worldwide photo op, Yeltsin came off not as a mendicant but as a proud, forceful statesmen leading a potentially rich country. "These are not Christmas presents," he said of what he called "the Clinton package." Not the Bush-era pie in the sky: "These are real figures that are doable."
The Vancouver meeting was a telegenic campaign event, milked beforehand with a send-off rally of 50,000 Siberians, and presumably to be followed by a welcome-home-Boris, you-did-us-proud rally upon arrival home.
In coming weeks, Russians should be treated to tangible evidence of the trip's results: not another multibillion-dollar promise, but food on the docks and visible deals in the works. The first priority makes business sense: to get Western investors to develop Russia's oil and gas resources.
Before the referendum, Japan should drop its humiliating demand for the return of territory before joining in economic aid; Richard Nixon, an original Friend of Boris, is not on his way to Tokyo this week to sniff the cherry blossoms. The G-7 ministerial meeting in that city will be held April 14, involving the rest of the industrial world in the Russian referendum.
How does the coming show of global support for Yeltsin affect Clinton's image? At past summits, the spin doctors of both sides made their man look good at the expense of the other; this time, however, pundits everywhere were serviced by high-level American spin doctors marveling at the wit, wisdom, dignity and sheer gutsiness of the Russian leader.
Of course, a pitch is also made about the skill and grace of the young American President at his first superpower outing, and it cannot be denied that he did his homework, showed due deference, and made no mistakes at his joint press conference.
But despite the tut-tutted unpopularity of foreign aid, Clinton is expending little political capital in the bipartisan backing of Boris. The summit in the cruelest month was neither a test of diplomatic skill nor an exhibition of national nerve. There may come a day when Clinton has to negotiate strongly from a weak position, or to face down a foreign leader at a tense summit; this was not that day.
Vancouver was an early moment in a momentous political campaign, and Clinton the experienced campaign consultant zeroed in on candidate Yeltsin's central message and his opposition's weakness: "He trusts the Russian people. Boris Yeltsin has put the fate of the government of Russia into the hands of the people of Russia. That is a very great thing."

HEADLINE: In Russia, Employee Ownership Is Succeeding

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Russia's Unnoticed Revolution" (editorial, March 25) applauds the rapidity of Russian privatization, but misinterprets Russia's main method of privatization, employee ownership. 
 You complain that employee and citizen ownership "might produce companies that are ungovernable" and that businesses will be "controlled by no one." Just the reverse is true, as is demonstrated by Russian companies that have been employee-owned for several years, like Moscow Ventilator, Veshky Enterprises and Saratov Aviation. Their profitability, quality and productivity have improved dramatically.
The same is true in the United States. Last year the value of stocks in employee-ownership companies listed on American exchanges rose 23 percent, compared with an increase of only 4.2 percent for the Dow Jones index stocks, according to a recent study by Prof. Joseph Blasi at Rutgers University.
The Russian Parliament understood in the drafting of the privatization legislation that encouraging employees to hold the majority of the common stock is a superior form of ownership.

HEADLINE: In Russia, Employee Ownership Is Succeeding;
A Credit Union Link

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The Right Stuff for Russia" (Op-Ed, March 24), Senator Bill Bradley suggests that Americans should "reach out generously toward the peoples of Russia, Ukraine and the other republics." Such action is already taking place within the credit union movement. 
 There is a serious lack of consumer financial services in Ukraine and Russia. Credit unions, with their emphasis on self-help, are ideal to help meet these needs.
An association of credit unions of Ukrainian heritage has jumped in to help. American and Canadian credit union executives of Ukrainian descent or birth have made several trips to lay the groundwork. The first Ukrainian interns to be trained in the United States should arrive shortly. The effort is coordinated by the World Council of Credit Unions.
These actions echo those taken over the last three years in Poland. After visiting credit unions in the United States, Canada and Ireland and welcoming educational missions from the World Council, Poles set up their own distinct model of credit union. There are 21 credit unions registered, with 85 more in the pipeline. American credit unions continue to sponsor Polish interns, and have begun signing partnership agreements that commit them to support and share information with a Polish credit union.
The great need in Ukraine is for funds to provide more technical help. A fund-raising campaign is under way among credit union members. The Agency for International Development can help by approving a grant for Ukrainian credit unions as quickly as possible.
Although the number of people involved does not approach those Sena
tor Bradley calls for, the exchange of ideas, people and training has now begun.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In recent days the importance of continuing and expanding American investment in Russia, despite the internal tensions and uncertainties in that country, was underscored by President Clinton at his first press conference, by Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher, addressing the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, and by Senator Bill Bradley in "The Right Stuff for Russia" (Op-Ed, March 14). All three make the point that the United States has a vital and strategic interest in helping Russia achieve a stable democracy with a free-market economy. 
 Senator Bradley, in setting goals, states that "there should be 30,000 Russian high school students living with American families for a year, 10,000 Russians in small businesses in towns across America, 10,000 college students at our universities and thousands of former military officers learning modern banking, finance and accounting in the West."
For years, Webster University has been engaged in educational exchange designed to achieve the objectives articulated by Senator Bradley, President Clinton and Mr. Christopher. Since 1990, under an agreement between Webster University and the former Soviet Academy of Sciences and through other initiatives, Russian students have studied at Webster University's campuses in Geneva and Vienna, as well as our home campus in St. Louis; groups of Webster students and faculty members have gone from Geneva to study in Russia, and Russian faculty members have taught at the Geneva campus.
These activities have increased with a new commitment between Webster and the St. Petersburg branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences to help prepare former military officers for managerial and entrepreneurial careers, including a knowledge of modern banking, finance and accounting. The joint venture, known as the Webster Academy, is incorporated in Russia under a board of Russians and Americans. This collaboration is expected to continue irrespective of the outcome of the political tug-of-war in Russia.
American universities will form an important link in uniting nations by trade and commerce, by better cultural understanding and by a common commitment to open markets, an open society and the exchange of ideas.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN VANCOUVER: The Overview;
Yeltsin Leaves Talks With Firm Support and More Aid

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 4

 BODY:
President Clinton today threw his full political support behind Boris N. Yeltsin in Russia's fateful political struggle and pledged a larger-than-expected $1.6 million in assistance intended to show "immediate and tangible" support for Russia's reforms.
"Mr. President, our nation will not stand on the sidelines when it comes to democracy in Russia," Mr. Clinton pledged in a statement that drew on Walt Whitman to bolster the President's insistence that it was the "high duty" of the world's democracies to rise to Russia's support. 
 "We know where we stand," he said. "We are with Russian democracy. We are with Russian reforms. We are with Russian markets. We support freedom of conscience and speech and religion. We support respect for ethnic minorities. We actively support reform and reformers and you in Russia."
Later, bidding farewell to the Russian President, Mr. Clinton ardently pumped his hand and exhorted Mr. Yeltsin: "Win! Win!"
 
'Democratic Partnership'
 The two leaders addressed a news conference on the conclusion of a weekend summit meeting held against the arresting backdrop of Vancouver's mountains, bays and skyscrapers. In their closing statements, both issued strong declarations of mutual admiration and proclaimed a "new democratic partnership" rich in promise for both nations.
The centerpiece of the summit was the announcement of a package of American aid that was boosted from the $1 billion previously reported to $1.6 billion. The difference was $700 million in long-term, low-cost credits that clear the way for immediate resumption of grain exports that were blocked by Russia's inability to meet its payments.
The package also included increased food and medical assistance. But the elements most strongly stressed by both leaders were those that supported fledgling businesses and a market economy in Russia.
 
Lift Trade Limits, Yeltsin Asks
 At Mr. Yeltsin's bidding, Mr. Clinton also said he would reopen the question of various limitations on trade with Russia left over from the East-West rivalry. These specifically include the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which links most-favored-nation trading status with the emigration of Russian Jews, and restrictions on trade in high technology and strategic minerals.
Mr. Yeltsin said he had complained that "America was still treating us as though we were a Communist country." Mr. Clinton promised that he would issue a "comprehensive" position within days.
Among the new elements of the package was a "Democracy Corps" intended to coordinate the activities of the innumerable private and governmental agencies now trying to assist Russia, and a new Commission on Technological Cooperation in energy and space whose chairmen will be Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.
Mr. Clinton put special stress on the fact that the package consisted entirely of money that was already allocated and immediately available, in contrast to previous collections of pledges that never materialized. He said it was the first stage of a long-term commitment that he would take up with Congress on his return to Washington.
 
Call for Allies' Help
 The American President said he was also calling on industrialized nations in the Group of Seven "to come forward with their own individual bilateral initiatives" when foreign and finance ministers of the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan meet in Tokyo on April 14-15 to discuss ways of stabilizing Russia's economy and currency.
Also in the spirit of the "partnership" they proclaimed, Mr. Clinton said that he had expressed his regret to Mr. Yeltsin over the collision of American and Russian submarines in the Barents Sea off the Russian coast, and had ordered an investigation into the incident.
The dominant question looming over all the pledges and declarations of the last two days was whether American and Western aid could help Mr. Yeltsin and his program at this critical stage of his struggle with a hostile legislature dedicated to removing him and slowing the drive for a market economy.
Mr. Clinton made clear he was aware of the limits of American influence: "The ultimate responsibility for the success of Russia's new course, of course, rests with the people of Russia. It is they who must support economic reforms and make them work. But Americans know that our nation has a part to play, too, and we will do so."
Mr. Yeltsin ventured no prediction on the value of the summit talks for the next battle he faces, a vote of confidence on April 25. "It is up to us to deal with the referendum," he said. "It is up to us to us to work, to persuade citizens of the Russian Federation that if they do not vote their confidence in us they will be dealing a blow to democracy and rolling back to the past, returning to the Communist yoke."
 
Campaigning in Siberia
 Having come to the summit from a session of the Congress of People's Deputies at which 1,000 hostile legislators came within 72 votes of ousting him, Mr. Yeltsin left directly to campaign in Russia's Far East and Siberia.
But it was evident that the Russian leader had been bolstered by the Vancouver meeting. His delivery determined and strong, Mr. Yeltsin declared that he was "fully satisfied by the results and by the spirit and atmosphere of my encounter with President Bill Clinton."
"We immediately found common language in Vancouver, possibly because we're both businesslike people, and at the same time, to some extent, idealists, both," he said.
Mr. Yeltsin spoke of a "very special relationship" developing with Mr. Clinton, and he hailed the aid offered him as "a very large and wise package, which is going to make history."
 
Shift to the Specific
 "The meeting in Vancouver signals a shift from general assurances of support to Russia to pragmatic, specific, nitty-gritty projects," he said.
Mr. Clinton reciprocated with a strong personal endorsement of the Russian leader. "We have interests and values," he said. "They are embodied by the policies and the direction of President Yeltsin. They are enduring. He is the duly-elected president of Russia. And as long as he is, I intend to work with him and support him, because he reflects those enduring values."
As he had in his first major speech on Russia in Annapolis on Thursday, Mr. Clinton seemed to make special efforts to convince Americans of the historic importance of helping Russia at the current juncture.
He recalled a line from Walt Whitman about the East River: "Flow on, river; flow on." America's support for Russia's course was the same, he declared, a bellow of enthusiastic support for a process that no tyrant could stop.
 
Dramatizing U.S. Support
 The last-minute increase in the American assistance package was evidently intended to give an extra dollop of drama to the announcement, since on its own, the sum of $1.6 billion was not extroardinary.
American officials said Mr. Clinton was determined in the first stage of his effort to help Russia to pledge only money that he was certain he could deliver, to avoid repeating the politically damaging experience of the Bush Administration, which pledged $24 billion and ended up disbursing barely half of that.
"There are no smoke and mirrors here," said a United States official who was directly evolved with designing the package. "We wanted to make the point that these are funds that we have, that we're going to do what we say we're going to do. The President is determined to carry out every single program. We also have a long-term commitment, we'll be looking for Russian ideas that most effectively support reform."
Mr. Clinton said three-quarters of the money would be distributed not Government-to-Government, as in most previous aid packages, but "will go to benefit the emerging private sector in Russia."
 
Resumption of Grain Shipments
 The largest portion of the package, however, would come in the form of resumed American grain shipments in the seven months left before Russia completes its own 1993 harvest.
Shipments to Russia had been halted because of Russia's failure to make its payments to the United States Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corp. The $700 million credit came from the Food for Progress program, which has more liberal conditions and repayment schedules.
In all, the package consited of $690.9 million in grants and $932 million in credits. While all the money was from existing programs and allocations, an American official stressed that no more than half of it would have been spent in Russia if the Administration had not spent the last seven weeks combing through every existing and related program.
Americans said the focus of the package were programs intended to assist areas that Russia had outlined as its priorities: support for private enterprise and a pilot program to build housing for military officers.
The program called for the creation of a "Democracy Corps" to coordinate the thousands of private organizations and the dozen Government agencies now working separately in Russia. This and other similar programs were allocated $48 million.
 
Cooperation on Energy
 American officials said the Commission on Technological Cooperation in energy and space, which would be headed jointly by Vice President Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin, the Russian Prime Minister and a former Soviet minister of the gas industry, was intended to give energy cooperation a priority similar to the arms negotiations of the past.
American oil companies have reported enormous and constant frustrations in dealing with Russian officials, both local and federal.
The Administration further earmarked $50 million for a "Russian-American Enterprise Fund" which would issue direct loans to Russian small businesses and joint ventures; $95 million in privatization support, including for military conversion, and $4 million for the "Eurasia Foundation," a private foundation that finances democratic projects in Russia.
These were other elements in the package:
* An additional $194 million was allocated to food aid, bringing the total for this year to $425 million, along with $30 million more in medical aid.
* $6 million was allocated for a pilot program to built 450 units of housing for Russian officers. Officials said the program would be increased if the demonstration project succeeded.
* In addition to the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission, the package called for a Business Development Committee headed by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and the Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Aleksandr H. Shokhin, and for the appointment of a full-time "investment ombudsman." The package included extension of $82 million in export-import credits for the Caterpillar Co. to finance sale of pipeline construction machinery, and $150 million in loan guarantees for the Siberian energy exploration by Conoco.
* $38 million was earmarked for programs to increase energy production and reduce pipeline pollution.
* $215 million was provided for dismantling Russia's nuclear arsenal under the Nunn-Lugar bill.
In all, Mr. Yeltsin said the two leaders had discussed 50 different subjects, ranging from the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic states to arms control.

HEADLINE: Serbs' Strategy: War Gets More Than Diplomacy

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, April 4

 BODY:
In rejecting the peace plan for Bosnia negotiated by the international community, the Serbs have evidently concluded that they have enough military strength on the ground and enough stoicism to withstand whatever is coming.
Though the United Nations is still groping for a way to induce them to sign the draft accord, the Bosnian Serbs have opted for hard facts over diplomacy. After a year of fighting they hold about 70 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina and their forces are much better armed than their Muslim and Croatian foes. And any notion of Western military intervention is filled with potential pitfalls and could have explosive repercussions. 
 "The international negotiating process is on the rocks and shipwrecked," one Western diplomat here said. "The Serbs have decided that the proposals for Bosnia are unacceptable and that they are going to tough it out and wait for the world to come to its senses."
For the Bosnian Serbs, that would involve an admission by leading Western nations that the notion of a sovereign state of Bosnia and Herzegovina was a mistake now buried in the rubble of a year of civil war in the former Yugoslav republic.
In a formal vote on Saturday by their self-styled parliament, the Bosnian Serbs specifically rejected the outlines of 10 semiautonomous provinces within a sovereign Bosnia proposed in the peace plan by international mediators Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen. But from Radovan Karadvic on down, the Serbs' leaders have in recent days made clear their more fundamental conviction -- that Bosnia should simply be carved into three parts among Muslims, Croats and themselves.
That idea is unacceptable to the United States and other Western nations as well as to the Muslim-led Bosnian Government because it would appear to reward Serbian aggression. In a pattern that their nationalist fighters describe as "ethnic cleansing," Serbs have driven Muslims from wide swaths of the republic.
 
Precedent for Hanging Tough
 Precedent gives the Serbs support in their determination to hang tough and put force before talk. Although fighting in neighboring Croatia largely stopped more than a year ago, the Serbs still hold close to one-third of that former Yugoslav republic's territory, just as they did when the truce began in January 1992.
In that case Serbs did accept a peacemaking process involving the stationing of United Nations troops in four Serbian-occupied areas. But that did not deter the Croatian Serbs from digging in and declaring their own Serbian Republic of Krajina.
Western analysts now expect the Bosnian Serbs to try and circumvent the peace efforts of the United Nations and European Community through direct talks with the other warring parties in Bosnia.
A meeting between the three military commanders is scheduled on Wednesday at the airport at Sarajevo, the capital. In the talks, the Bosnian Serbs' commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, is likely to press publicly for maintaining the tenuous cease-fire.
That would be good public relations and would put the Bosnian Government of President Alija Izetbegovic in a delicate position of being obliged to take up the offensive if it loses patience.
The analysts see some likelihood that the Serbs may try and reach a deal with the Croats to put the Muslims on the defensive in Bosnia. They have some bargaining chips.
The most important thing to the Croats is securing their position around Mostar and other towns in the Herzegovina region and insuring that Serbs do not resume their shelling of the Dalmatian coast. Recently the Serbs lobbed a few shells from Trebinje into the suburbs of Dubrovnik, a Croatian resort that was heavily damaged in the fighting in 1991.
The most important thing to the Serbs is securing a corridor through northern Bosnia connecting Serbia to the big Serbian population around Banja Luka in western Bosnia -- something denied them by a Croatian enclave on the Vance-Owen map. A trade-off on these points appears possible because only the Serbs can offer the Croats security in Herzegovina and the Dalmatian region, and only the Croats can guarantee the Serbs their corridor.
Fundamental to the thinking among the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbian leadership in Yugoslavia is an attitude that any steps the international community is likely to take now to make life here more painful will not in fact make much difference. The only thing that would do so -- Western military force -- has not been used, and the Serbs' calculation is clearly that the same doubts and fears will continue to prevent it for the foreseeable future.
Nine months of crippling United Nations sanctions have already left the Yugoslav economy in ruins, with inflation running at more than 250 percent a month, industrial production down by more than 50 percent last year, and a third of the work force idled. A defiant sentiment has grown that things cannot get much worse, so let the world do what it will.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, the dominant politician in what remains of Yugoslavia, knows that if the United Nations tightens sanctions against his Government, which it will consider doing this week, it could play to his advantage, since he would portray it as another flagrant example of the world's injustice toward the Serbs.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
U.S. Discusses New Sanctions
 WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) -- Secretary of State Warren Christopher criticized Bosnian Serbs today for "failing to grasp an opportunity for peace" and said he had discussed the possibility of new sanctions against the Serbs with the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev.
 "We're not at the present time contemplating the use of ground troops in Bosnia," Mr. Christopher said on "This Week," an ABC News program. But he said later that the United States was "certainly giving" its attention to the possibility of lifting an embargo against arms deliveries to the region.
 
 
 
Balkan Update"
 A United Nations convoy carrying food and medicine made its way to Srebrenica, Bosnia, but a Bosnian officer would not permit emptied trucks to be used to evacuate wounded people and refugees, saying such action would further Serbian nationalists' plans to remove Muslims from the enclave.
Relief flights to Sarajevo resumed after a two-week hiatus, but a truce in the capital unraveled further as a Serbian shell killed 2 children and injured 15, and snipers killed at least 5 others.
President Clinton, at a summit meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, said he would seek tougher United Nations sanctions against Serbia. President Boris N. Yeltsin said Russia would cooperate in working to end ethnic conflicts like the ones that have torn the Balkans.

HEADLINE: SENATE SUSPENDS EFFORT FOR ACCORD ON CLINTON'S PLAN

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 5

 BODY:
Nine days into a filibuster and miles from any hint of agreement, Senate Democrats and Republicans abandoned the hunt for a compromise on President Clinton's economic stimulus package tonight, and decided to try again in two weeks.
The Democratic majority leader, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, said he decided to stop talking and send the Senate on a long-postponed vacation after Republicans refused to make an opening offer to resolve differences. 
 His Republican counterpart, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, said the two sides informally discussed a settlement, but that "we didn't think it was the right time" to suggest a compromise.
 
Time for a Breather
 "Some of my members don't want any compromise at all," he said.
Mr. Mitchell put a good face on the break in talks late tonight, saying it would give Mr. Clinton and other Democrats a chance to press the case for the spending package nationwide, and provide both sides a breather in which some compromise might yet materialize.
But in practical terms, the delay underscored the power Mr. Dole and the Senate's 42 other Republicans now hold over the package, which Mr. Clinton calls crucial to a continued economic recovery and the Republicans call both wasteful and extravagant.
Three times in four days, including today, Senate Democrats have tried to break the Republican filibuster against the bill, and three times they have failed to muster the 60 votes they need to end debate. Today, with more senators leaving town almost hourly, the vote to end debate was 49 to 29, 11 short of what was needed.
 
Debt Ceiling Raised
 The Senate will meet briefly on Wednesday to adjourn, then take up the debate anew when it returns on April 19. Each side appears likely to offer new and competing versions of the stimulus package then, and then to make another attempt to shut off debate and conduct a final vote on the measure.
The lawmakers quit tonight about 11:30 after completing the only action that they could agree on: a measure raising the Federal debt ceiling and allowing the Government to sell enough bonds to finance its operations through Sept. 30. Treasury officials had warned that the Government could go bankrupt if the measure was not passed by Wednesday.
Earlier today, Mr. Clinton's top aides had roamed the Capitol, showing new willingness to strike a deal with the Republicans. His budget director, Leon E. Panetta, said after today's vote that the White House was "prepared to offer whatever cooperation is necessary to see that this bill moves," and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, once one of the Senate's top deal makers, showed up later in the day to offer the Democrats advice.
Republican lawmakers said -- and Mr. Mitchell and the White House later flatly denied -- that Senate Democrats had informally floated a compromise involving relatively small cuts in White House spending plans, led by a $1.8 billion allotted to make up deficits in the Pell grant college-aid program. That money must eventually be spent, but it would create no jobs and thus is inconsistent with what Mr. Clinton says is the overarching purpose of his bill.
Whatever the nature of the compromise, Mr. Dole and the Republicans rejected it outright as far too small. Asked at midday what kind of compromise was needed to end the talks, he was succinct: "Big one."
The parties are fundamentally at odds over the proposal. Although both sides agree it is a minuscule amount of money to filibuster over, especially compared with the $1.5 trillion Federal budget, the specifics have been overwhelmed by political and philosophical considerations that defy easy bargaining.
Even the cost of the package is a matter of semantic dispute. Democrats say, accurately, that it approves $16.3 billion in new spending. Republicans add, also correctly, that it allocates $3.2 billion more in road and airport spending previously authorized, but never taken out of special accounts fed by gasoline and air-travel taxes.
 
Legislation at Risk
 The filibuster calls into question the White House's early confidence that one-party government would be a smooth affair. Instead, it now seems clear that any controversial legislation, including most of Mr. Clinton's tax and spending proposals, is at risk unless it can attract 60 votes in a Senate that has only 57 Democrats.
Democrats say the bill and the programs it creates are urgently needed to prop up a sagging economy, and they point to the March unemployment report, which showed a slight decrease in jobs. The package would spend $4 billion for additional unemployment benefits and billions more to create jobs, most of them temporary, for construction workers, manufacturers and inner-city youngsters.
Republicans say the money would be wasted in part on low-priority projects and political pork, including things like a $6 million proposal to capture escaping methane from landfills and cow manure and a proposed allotment for a film on early Louisiana culture. Even worse, they argue, it would raise the deficit because none of the spending would be offset by corresponding cuts in other Federal programs.
The Administration normally might have won over some Republicans with small compromises. But the opposition was calcified early in the debate, when Senate Democrats used parliamentary tactics to prevent Republicans from even offering amendments. That left them with the filibuster option.
Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, one moderate Republican who can occasionally be pried from his more conservative colleagues, said today that he doubted that he or other Republicans could be lured to Mr. Clinton's side this time.
Tonight, Mr. Dole said the Republicans were insisting on a pared-down spending package that would include $4 billion in extended unemployment benefits, about $3 billion in highway and mass-transit money, roughly $1 billion in summer jobs for inner-city teachers and youths and $300 million for childhood immunizations.
Even more troubling for Mr. Clinton and Mr. Mitchell is that the Republicans want all of those programs, save the unemployment benefits, to be offset by new cuts in spending.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Inside the Spending Package"
 
Democrats say the $19.5 billion spending package now in the Senate would give the economy a lift, creating more than 200,000 temporary jobs, even as it helps rebuild national assets like highways and airports. Republicans say the measure is laden with pork-barrel projects and that the economy doesn't need a jolt of more deficit spending. Here are some of the programs on which the Administration has proposed to spend the money. Estimates of the number of full-time jobs they would create, when available, are in parentheses.*

Highways $3 billion parceled out by formula to the states. California would get about 10 percent; Texas, 7 percent; New York and Ohio,4 percent (13,100 jobs this year; 45,200 in fiscal 1994).

HEADLINE: $32 BILLION BUDGET IS VOTED IN ALBANY AS REVENUES CLIMB

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 5

 BODY:
After the most harmonious round of budget negotiations in four years, the State Legislature approved a $32.08 billion budget today that many lawmakers proclaimed as the start of a fiscal recovery for New York State.
A late infusion of new money, generated at least partly by an economy that is growing faster than originally projected, allowed the Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to provide an increase of $330 million to the state's schools over the last school year, to eliminate suggested cuts in Medicaid programs and to kill a number of proposed tax increases. 
 The budget meant good news for many residents of New York City, particularly its schoolchildren, but disappointment for Mayor David N. Dinkins, who said today that the state budget would make the city's budget even more difficult to balance.
 
A Bigger Surplus
 As bills were being passed today, it became clear that negotiators managed to strike a budget deal last week only after Mr. Cuomo disclosed that the state would end the 1992-93 fiscal year with a surplus of about $140 million more than had been projected in early March.
When money suddenly appears to help close a budget deal in Albany, suspicions arise that the cash may not really exist. But Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin and the State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, said today that they were confident that the budget would be balanced.
"We didn't go out and find money that's illusory or doesn't exist or is monopoly money," said Mr. Weprin, a Queens Democrat. "It's real money."
Some state officials and Wall Street analysts have suggested that the surplus for the fiscal year that ended on March 31 may climb even higher when the State Comptroller releases a final accounting later this month.
 
An Upbeat Mood
 "The tone we've been hearing is that the tax revenue side appears to be strengthening and that the year-end cash balance will be higher," said George W. Leung, managing director of Moody's Investors Service.
Given that the state had to close a budget gap of nearly $3 billion this year, legislators were reluctant to proclaim that the days of wine and roses had returned. But compared with the last three years, when the state's budget recipe has been equal parts of tax increases, spending cuts and political acrimony, the mood in the Capitol today was notably upbeat.
"This is a real turnaround budget," said Assemblyman G. Oliver Koppell, a Bronx Democrat. "It's not a huge improvement in terms of support for the city or for institutions. But it clearly is the end of the deterioration of support."
Mr. Cuomo, who may run for a fourth four-year term next year, declared in a statement that "New York State is on the way back."
The general fund budget of $32.08 billion passed by the Legislature represents an increase of 3.5 percent over last year's budget and of 1.8 percent over the $31.5 billion proposed by Mr. Cuomo. The general fund consists of money raised by state taxes, fees and other revenues.
The total state budget of $59.99 billion, which includes Federal money, is an increase of 8 percent over last year and of 1.5 percent over Mr. Cuomo's proposal of $59.1 billion.
The budget features a four-year, $21.2 billion transportation program, a constitutional amendment to change the state's debt practices and an increase of 17 cents a pack in cigarette taxes. But Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders said the most enduring success may be the change made in education financing.
The state's complex school aid formula was changed to direct more money to districts with high percentages of poor students and high property tax burdens. Because of the new money available, only a handful of districts lost money in the process.
New York City's proportion of the state's total school aid rose for the first time in a number of years, to 35.1 percent from 34.8 percent. Long Island's percentage fell to 12.8 from 13 percent. Districts in upstate New York stayed steady at 52 percent.
New York City officials conceded that the increase this year would be incremental. But they said the new formula should eventually help the city, which has 37 percent of the state's students, to receive an equitable share of state aid.
While city school officials were pleased, Mr. Dinkins was not. He said his budget would be hurt by inaction on Mr. Cuomo's proposal for the state to take over local Medicaid costs, by heavy cuts in probation funds and by the state's demand that the city increase its financing for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
"An initial review of the state budget suggests that it does not make our own decisions easier but, instead, tougher," Mr. Dinkins said.
The money that appeared since Mr. Cuomo proposed his budget in January allowed the Legislature to add significant funds to a variety of programs of particular importance to New York City.
It added $8.2 million to the $10 million increase proposed by Mr. Cuomo for AIDS prevention and treatment programs, meaning an increase of 46 percent over last year's level. It restored almost $25 million the Governor had proposed cutting from the Tuition Assistance Program, meaning there will be no change in eligibility standards for needy college students.
The budget for the State Council on the Arts, which Mr. Cuomo proposed cutting by $2.8 million, now will get an increase of $3.2 million over last year for grants to local arts organizations. The Liberty Partnerships program, aimed at keeping students from dropping out of school, received a $2 million increase instead of the $7.5 million cut proposed by Mr. Cuomo.
Perhaps the best indication of the improved economic climate is that the Democratic-majority Assembly, never known as a friend of commercial landlords, agreed to make changes in the way that the state's gains tax is calculated on the sale of expensive buildings, saving property sellers an estimated $25 million.
As in even the toughest budget years, the legislators found plenty of money for pork. Among the hundreds of additions made by the Legislature to Mr. Cuomo's budget were a $250,000 grant to the National Soccer Hall of Fame in Oneonta and $2,500 to Farmingdale Midget Football.
Those grants are in addition to the $48 million in so-called member items that legislators will appropriate later in the year, with much of the money for favored projects in their districts.
Shortly after the budget was passed, Mr. Weprin and Mr. Marino said in separate news conferences that they would support formation of a commission to study the possibility of giving raises to legislators. New York's lawmakers, who currently make a base salary of $57,500 a year and leadership stipends of between $6,500 and $30,000, are the highest paid in the country. They have not received a raise since 1989.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "HIGHLIGHTS: The 1993 New York State Budget"
 
The budget totals $59.99 billion, including $32 billion in the general fund. Among its highlights, the budget agreement does the following:
 
TAXES - Increases the tax on cigarettes to 56 cents a pack.
 
EDUCATION - Changes school-aid formula togive $330 million more to local school districts, with a higher proportion going to poorer ones.
 
TRANSPORTATION - Calls for spending $20.9 billion over four years, including $10 billion for highways, roads and bridges and $9.56 billion to fully finance the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's capital plan, as well as other money to avert fare increases on subways, buses and commuter railroads in and around New York City.
 
DEBT REFORM - Calls for a constitutional amendment on the ballot, probably in 1995, to change the state's debt practices, eliminating "backdoor borrowing," where the state uses a public authority to finance capital projects rather than direct money.

HEADLINE: EUROPEANS URGED TO PRESSURE SERBS

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, April 5

 BODY:
Lord Owen, the European Community's mediator on the Balkans, called today for "relentless pressure" to be placed on Bosnian Serbs to make them accept a peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina, but he cautioned against lifting the arms embargo on Bosnian Muslims.
After briefing community foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg, Lord Owen said a political solution was still possible in Bosnia, and he criticized a suggestion by Secretary of State Warren Christopher that the arms embargo on Bosnian Muslims might be lifted "quite soon." 
 "I think you've got to be very careful about this idea," he said, recalling a warning by the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, that such a policy could produce "a level killing field."
Interviewed on the NBC News program "Today," Mr. Christopher said the Bosnian Serbs' refusal to accept the peace plan, which has already been signed by Bosnian Muslims and Croats, could lead Washington to go "to our allies and see if we could find a consensus for lifting the arms embargo."
Lord Owen said at a news conference in Luxembourg that delivery of advanced weapons to Bosnian Muslims could backfire if they fell into the hands of Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs.
When the Clinton Administration broached the idea of lifting the arms embargo earlier this year, Britain and France, fearing Serbian retaliation, threatened to withdraw the troops they have sent to Bosnia to guard the delivery of relief supplies.
A senior Western official said London believes if the arms embargo was lifted "the plug would probably have to be pulled" on the relief aid effort.
Lord Owen said, "This is a time to put relentless pressure on the Bosnian Serbs and on the governments of Serbia and Montenegro to come and accept the plan which has been placed before them."
Earlier today, the Western European Union, a 10-nation regional defense group, stepped up pressure on Belgrade by agreeing to send speedboats manned by police and customs officers to patrol the Danube in Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria to tighten sanctions against Serbia.
The move followed persistent reports that barges and other vessels were carrying oil and other necessities to Serbia and Montenegro through the Danube's international waters.

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Climbs Out of Fiscal Depths and Builds by Sharing Sacrifices

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, April 5

 BODY:
This city, long known for incompetent government, has made one of the most stunning turnarounds in recent urban history, experts say. Last week, its leaders announced it would end the year with a balanced budget for the first time in seven years.
Almost as startling, urban specialists say, Philadelphia has ended its prolonged fiscal crisis in just 15 months and has done it with an unprecedented amount of political harmony and public support, in spite of asking voters to absorb a higher sales tax and public employees to agree to wage concessions. 
 "Philadelphia is really showing the rest of America's major cities what you can do without help from the statehouse or the White House," said George Sternlieb, a retired professor of urban planning from Rutgers University. "Hopefully, the macabre burlesque that masqueraded as politics in Philadelphia is over."
 
A City in Collapse
 Flashing back to January 1992, here is where the burlesque stood when the new Mayor, Edward G. Rendell, came on stage:
With the city nearly a quarter-billion dollars in debt, City Hall had run out of virtually everything, from postage stamps for its letters to trousers for its police recruits. Elected officials were bickering, union leaders were refusing to concede anything and Wall Street investors had long since shut off the city's credit. Pennsylvania refused to bail Philadelphia out, and local officials were at loggerheads with a new state agency that was supposed to oversee the city's finances.
Mr. Rendell, a former prosecutor who had been elected Philadelphia's 127th Mayor with 68 percent of the vote in November 1991, took office with what seemed an impossible proposal. He said the city could save $1 billion over five years by freezing the wages of unionized city employees, slashing health-care spending, laying off scores of political appointees and bringing efficiency to city agencies.
This week it no longer seemed impossible. City officials said there would be no deficit in this year's budget, or in the $2.4 billion budget for next fiscal year, which begins July 1. The new administration has been able to achieve about $220 million in savings in its first year and expects to do the same in each of the next four years.
The traditionally fractious City Council has supported the Mayor's budgets and recovery plan with an unprecedented series of unanimous votes.
And last Tuesday, an arbitration panel forced police officers to accept a contract, similar to agreements negotiated last fall with non-uniformed city workers, that freezes wages for three years, eliminates four holidays and reduces the cost of health benefits without reducing care.
 
Wall Street Nods Approval
 Philadelphia's fiscal crisis is not officially over, but experts here and on Wall Street say it is under control and could end as early as the middle of next year. That is when credit-rating agencies will consider giving the city a rating that could guarantee it access to the municipal bond market.
"The only test for the city is to keep up the momentum," said Michael L. Johnston, a vice president of Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency on Wall Street.
Mr. Rendell said the fight to save Philadelphia had just begun. For one thing, the city's economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. Last year it lost 17,700, or 2.5 percent of all the jobs in its economy. The planned closing of the Philadelphia Navy Base by 1997, plus other proposed closings of military installations, would cost 17,500 jobs directly and an estimated 40,000 related jobs.
But last week was a time for most Philadelphians, who have felt saddled with inept government for decades, to take a vacation from worry and cynicism and even dare to say something nice about their leaders.
"Ed Rendell has even made me believe that it is possible for government to solve some of these intractable urban problems," said Randall M. Miller, a political analyst and professor of political science at St. Joseph's University here.
 
Coalition With Business
 Nowhere is this sense stronger than among business leaders. Mr. Rendell formed a committee of people from business and universities to recommend improvements, and he promised to use their suggestions. So when the panel reported that 40 percent of the Parking Authority's 750 employees were not on the job at any given time and recommended eliminating many patronage jobs, it resulted in the city administration's laying off 123 political appointees last month, for a saving of $4.6 million a year.
Mr. Rendell gives credit to the City Council President, John Street, who helped mold the recovery program and then led the Council in its series of unanimous votes. "Without him, we wouldn't have made it," the Mayor said.
The Council votes were won with tough and clever politics and public relations. With his two-thirds electoral victory, Mr. Rendell has a powerful mandate from voters to make changes, as do the 6 newly elected members of the 17-member council. The newcomers all campaigned on the need for changes in city government.
Similar pressures were brought to bear on city-employee unions. In his campaign, Mr. Rendell emphasized that 60 percent of the city budget was in personnel costs and that concessions would have to be made. When non-uniformed city employees resisted and went on strike, they were met with resounding public antagonism, and called off their strike after 16 hours.
 
Spreading the Sacrifices
 Mr. Rendell, a Democrat, was born in Manhattan 49 years ago and served as District Attorney of Philadelphia from 1977 to 1985. He ran unsuccessful races for governor and mayor, losing to W. Wilson Goode in the 1987 mayoral primary. Mr. Goode, the city's first black mayor, served two four-year terms and was barred by law from seeking a third term.
Mayor Rendell has retained his popularity by asking for sacrifice across a wide spectrum, said Frederick L. Voight, executive secretary of the Committee of Seventy, a not-for-profit organization that monitors city government.
"The beauty of the plan is that it spreads the pain out so that no one neighborhood is taking it on the chin," he said. "Rather than close a fire house, he cut back on the manning of fire trucks. Rather than close a library or district health center, he curtailed services."
This is not to say there are not voices of dissent. "Recall! Recall!" hundreds of demonstrators chanted at City Hall in January after Mr. Rendell outlined a new round of service reductions.
Fiscal experts say the city's budgets, previously based on wishful thinking and accounting gimmicks, are now realistic. "There are no smoke or mirrors in these budgets," said Bernard E. Anderson, chairman of the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority, the state fiscal agency that monitors city finances.
Last year the authority helped put the city on the road to recovery by raising money on Wall Street on Philadelphia's behalf to help the city pay its debts of $225 million and to also finance $250 million for capital improvement projects. The sales tax increase of 1 percent is paying for this borrowing.

HEADLINE: Fujimori Sees a Peaceful, and a Prosperous, Peru

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, April 5

 BODY:
Expressing "not the slightest regret" about seizing expanded powers one year ago today, President Alberto K. Fujimori says his authoritarian moves are rapidly pacifying Peru and setting the stage for a free-market economic boom here in the mid-1990's.
"Today we have 95 percent of the Shining Path leadership behind bars," the Peruvian leader said in an interview on Sunday night. "By 1995, the Shining Path will be completely eradicated as an organized group." 
 "There's a close relationship between the fight against terrorism and the fight to restore economic growth," Mr. Fujimori said. "No amount of foreign aid, no economic plan -- no matter how well designed -- will have a beneficial effect if terrorism is not stopped."
On April 5, 1992, Mr. Fujimori closed courts and the congress, asserting that he needed greater powers to combat corruption, cocaine trafficking and a surging rebellion by the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas. The moves pushed his local public approval rating to 81 percent. But the outside world recoiled in face of the constitutional break.
 
Scores High in Polls
 One year later, Peru's austere leader seemed relaxed and confident as he fielded questions. Today, polls still give Mr. Fujimori approval ratings of 62 to 67 percent, among the highest for any leader in the Americas.
"What has been demonstrated is that here in Peru the people want a strong government that creates social and economic order," he said in the clipped Spanish of a man whose parents immigrated here from Japan in the 1930's. "People want a government that gives security to all the population and that gives guarantees to investors. I am confident that Peru is going to be one of Latin America's most developed nations in a few years."
Endorsing the President's claim to have improved public order, a private human rights group reports that guerrilla attacks nationwide fell from 126 in January to 36 in March. Indicating that 12 years of guerrilla violence is far from ending, however, 11 people -- 7 police officers, 3 soldiers and 1 civilian -- died today in a guerrilla attack near the northern city of Trujillo. On Friday, 12 guerrillas were killed in a battle with soldiers in the Amazon.
On the international front, the inauguration in January of a new Congress thawed aid that had been frozen last year. Last month, with the United States providing crucial financial and political support, Peru repaid debts to the World Bank and to the International Monetary Fund and re-entered the international financial community after a six-year absence.
But Peru's human rights record is expected to cause continued friction with the United States and Europe.
"Peru's already troubled human rights situation has become significantly worse," Americas Watch, a human rights group based in New York, asserted in a report made public today.
The report criticized Mr. Fujimori for closing prisons to international human rights observers, for instituting a "rubber stamp" Congress, for publicly branding human rights leaders as "tools" of terrorists and for allowing the police to kill 39 guerrilla inmates in a prison crackdown last May.
"A series of antiterrorism measures virtually do away with due-process rights for those accused of terrorism, crimes whose definitions have been broadened to encompass peaceful dissent, human rights defense and investigative reporting," the report continued. "Peruvian human rights groups believe that hundreds of innocent Peruvians are now jailed."
Mr. Fujimori defended the antiterrorism decree on Sunday, saying the military courts had allowed his Government in the last six months to try and to sentence to life in prison the top leadership of Peru's two guerrilla groups, the Shining Path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
"Before April 5, judges freed no fewer than 200 terrorists who returned to committing crimes," he said, echoing a common complaint about the inefficiency of Peru's old court system.
"In 1991, the Supreme Court even declared Abimael Guzman free of any guilt," he continued, referring to the Shining Path's leader, now serving a life sentence in a specially built prison.
Admitting that his Government had suffered from "inertia" on human rights, the Peruvian President promised to improve his country's record. He said that the International Committee of the Red Cross could resume visits to prisoners convicted of terrorist crimes and that he hoped to see convictions for the forced disappearances of prisoners.
Although Peru continues to lead the world in recorded disappearances, the number of prisoners who disappeared after arrest dropped sharply last year, to 112 from 304 in 1991. Mr. Fujimori predicted that the new Congress would approve a law instituting the death penalty for terrorist crimes.
"In the presence of the crimes that these gang leaders commit, I think its application is necessary," Mr. Fujimori said.
Already, he said, the threat of life imprisonment had encouraged 200 guerrillas to desert in the first three months of this year.
 
A Conflict Over Drugs
 On another point of friction with the United States, the cultivation in Peru of the raw material for cocaine, Mr. Fujimori said cooperation between the two countries had "very poor results."
The United States Congress is moving to cut in half a $387 million request by the Bush Administration for antidrug aid to the Andean countries. But Mr. Fujimori said coca leaf production can only be reduced through more aid -- more radar for airborne interception and more highway construction to make profitable the cultivation of legal crops like rice and corn.
"The new American policy sounds like a big mistake," he said.
With terrorism easing, conditions are more attractive for foreigners to invest, Mr. Fujimori said.
Over the next year, the Peruvian Government's plans to auction off state-run mines and electricity and telephone companies. The sales will not only help Peru balance its budget and reduce inflation, now running at 57 percent a year, but will also provide more cash for social spending. In one highly popular program, the President recently started to inaugurate one new school a week.

HEADLINE: Aid Recipe For Russia: Add a Ton Of Savvy

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARATOV, Russia

 BODY:
Charles Bennett, West Point class of 1962, trained as a navigator bombardier on a B-52, preparing to drop nuclear bombs on the Soviet Union. Today, at 54, he is a Peace Corps volunteer in the small city of Kamyshin on the Volga River, teaching Russians how to create small businesses in a market economy.
"I had a military flavor to my life," he said, rubbing a hand over his graying mustache. "The idea was to protect America, kill the enemy and not be friends. But now the big threat is over, and it's a hell of a reversal. Here I am now eating dinner at the tables of people I was willing to turn into dust." 
 Well before the Vancouver summit meeting, President Clinton promised more aid to Russia, including exchanges of retired American business executives and other experts to help Russians make the transition to a market economy. Mr. Bennett is an example of the help that the United States has already provided.
Still military trim, he came from Salem, Ore., one of the first Peace Corps volunteers sent to Russia. Two offices have been set up under the program, which is a result of President Boris N. Yeltsin's visit to Washington last June. The first opened here, with 45 volunteers working in five cities along the Volga River, and the second, in Vladivostok, is the base for 49 volunteers in the Far East.
 
Nuclear Target for U.S.
 Both Saratov and Kamyshin were closed cities, and Saratov, an ICBM center of about 950,000 people with up to 70 percent of its industry military-related, was almost surely an American nuclear target. Mr. Bennett, more than most younger volunteers, is aware of the distance already traveled in the nascent Russian-American friendship, as well as the stakes involved.
"For the younger people, it's a thrill for them to be here," he said. "But they don't understand what it was like. To be ready to punch the button, and now to try to make Russians' lives better, to turn it around enough so it can't be turned around again. There are a lot of assumptions in the West that the ball game is over. But it's not over."
Karen A. Woodbury, 50, the Peace Corps director for western Russia, has been in and out of the organization for the last 15 years, most recently in Mali. "When they offered me Russia," she said, "I almost hung up the phone."
She's been in Saratov since Novemner, setting up with 4 American and 15 Russian staff members. They provided volunteers a three-month language and culture course in a rest house of the SEPO company, a military behemoth now turning out more Saratov-brand refrigerators than sophisticated electronics.
"The strong point is that the volunteers don't work for the Peace Corps, but for local authorities," Ms. Woodbury said. She is aware that Russians were told that the Peace Corps, started by President Kennedy in 1961 as another weapon in the ideological struggle with the Soviet Union, was used to gather intelligence. "Some of the old guard would rather we not be here," she said, "but most people are very receptive."
 
Advice Center Set Up
 The volunteers range from Harry Langerman, 79, a retired businessman, to Asad Haroon, 29, of the San Francisco area, who emigrated from Pakistan at 17 and signed up for the Peace Corps a week after becoming an American citizen. Sworn in on Feb. 13, they are expected to work here for two years, but as volunteers may leave when they like. But they have already been overwhelmed with Russian hospitality and curiosity, hardly surprising in a city that was closed to all foreigners until last year.
The five volunteers in Saratov have set up a small-business advice center on the sixth floor of a government building, living in a hostel in a former Communist Party training center and looking for apartments. They are paid in rubles at roughly the rate of a local employee; they are already struggling to cope with Russia's 25-percent-a-month inflation.
"So we've got to get out of the dollar mode," Mr. Bennett said. "When we pay 250 rubles for a Snickers bar," or about 38 cents, "it's a big decision."
Mr. Bennett, who has been eating a lot of Russian salami and eggs, has already cracked a tooth on a chunk of bone, so he came to Saratov to have it seen to. "Well," he said, "I joined the Peace Corps, not Club Med."
David Robeck, 39, a banker who grew up "a preacher's kid in sin city," Las Vegas, has already moved in with a local family. The mother is a nurse and gives him an evening massage. "They only speak Russian," he said, grinning, "so I can't really say no."
Kristina Gunnill, a New Yorker who worked for Young & Rubicam for 20 years, shook her head. "In the hostel we haven't had any heat or hot water for two days."
Already advising local advertising agencies, she said: "In a way, I felt I was living too well in New York, that my world was trivial. I didn't really need three closets full of clothes. There is an element of spiritual development to it all, no question. I didn't get all the credentials I've got to serve no one but myself. And advertising is the leading edge of the capitalist economy."
It is difficult to scale down to a ruble salary, she said, to general sighs of agreement. "But I haven't had one minute of wondering if it was a bad decision."
 
Expertise Is in Demand
 Richard Gonzalez, an industrial quality engineer from East Lansing, Mich., who worked for General Motors, I.T.T. and Roper, laughed and said he had second thoughts every second. He had come to a point in his career where "I got a lot of recruiting calls, but actually it was for the same old job, just a different city with a different desk," he said.
His expertise is in much demand by Saratov's many foundering factories. "But everything here needs so much attention all at once," he said. "They've all got no raw materials, no product, no market and no clear idea what to build."
Mr. Gonzalez threw up his hands. "You know in America we say, 'It doesn't take a rocket scientist.' Well, I'd never met one. Now I've met hundreds, and a lot of them are driving taxis."

HEADLINE: New York Library Nears Start on Science Center

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The New York Public Library's proposed $100 million Science, Industry and Business Library will provide computer access to worldwide information networks as well as books when it opens in 1995, library officials said yesterday.
At a briefing for contributors and potential contributors, the officials also announced that $59 million of the projected cost had already been raised, before the opening of a formal campaign later this year. The library, which officials said would be the largest public information center devoted solely to science and business, is to be in part of the B. Altman building at East 34th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues. 
 It will be equipped with 100 computer work stations for users to tap into data bases both within and outside the library. There are also plans for an electronic information training center with 26 work stations that will help the public learn how to use data bases. Even the tables in the reading area will be wired to allow users to plug in their own laptop computers, officials said.
 
Round-the-Clock Access
 The library will also offer 24-hour dial-in access for computer users and will provide gateways to the Internet system, a worldwide communications network, as well as electronic journals and electronic bulletin boards.
Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the new chairman of the International Business Machines Corporation, who is chairman of the library's fund-raising campaign, said the library would help New York City continue as a center for the financial and communications industries.
He also said the library would help people up the economic ladder by providing easy access to computers and data bases.
"There is a barrier of entry to information technology; you need the hardware and software and an investment of time in training," he said. "We have to overcome those barriers, because computer literacy will be a requirement for a successful career."
The library is to be housed on seven floors in the B. Altman building, a turn-of-the-century structure that has landmark status. Two floors are to be open to the public, with the other five housing 2.5 million books in a research collection. In addition, 80,000 books will be in circulation and 60,000 additional reference works will be available. The library will also contain 110,000 business and scientific journals and periodicals.
 
 
Opening Planned for '95
 Plans for the library were first announced in November 1991. Construction is scheduled to begin in July, and the opening is planned for the fall of 1995.
Officials said they were planning to raise funds from both government and private sources. The city has pledged $10 million and the state $7.5 million, and project officials are trying to raise $7 million from the Federal Government, although only $1.9 million has so far been secured.
The $24.5 million of government financing would be augumented by $25.5 million in long-term debt financed by bonds issued by the State Dormitory Authority. The plan calls for $50 million in private contributions, $14 million of which has been pledged. The largest single private contribution, $7.5 million, was made by Lewis and Dorothy Cullman. He is president of Cullman Ventures Inc., the company that owns Keith Clark, a manufacturer of commercial calendars and diaries.
Marshall Rose, chairman of the New York Public Library, said the new center would ease crowding at the main building at 42d Street and Fifth Avenue. "Right now we have people sitting on the floors waiting to use our equipment," he said.

HEADLINE: Mayoral Rivals Debate Crime Fears and Statistics

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins, a mathematician by training, believes numbers do not lie. So he paused during a recent campaign speech to explain at length, once again, the verity that to him is as plain as day: crime is down in New York.
"Look at the numbers," he implored the audience. "Twenty-seven months of straight decline." 
 The Mayor's frustration is understandable. While he has tried to take credit again and again for the 12 percent decline in reported crime since he took office, his political rivals continue to scoff at the statistics and to insist that his administration has failed to stanch lawlessness.
 
A Dominant Theme
 As the mayoral campaign evolves over the next seven months, the debate over crime is likely to be one of its dominant themes. The crime figures can be expected to be a flash point of dispute among the candidates, but what may count more than the statistics is the public's perception of crime. Mr. Dinkins's challengers, reading their private polls, argue that people do not feel safer, no matter what the Mayor's numbers show.
"He declares victory on crime, and people laugh at him," said Rudolph W. Giuliani, the likely Republican candidate, in a recent interview.
Mr. Dinkins, having won office on a promise to be tough on crime and having weathered a first year as Mayor dominated by a vicious wave of violence, now would clearly like to claim a modest victory and divert the debate in this year's election to education and jobs.
"We know the perception in some quarters may be different," he said almost apologetically in a speech to the Citizens Budget Commission, a private organization. "Without suggesting we are satisfied, people need to know that crime is in fact down. The fact is there is not a crime wave, and crime is down and we have got to some way or other make that point."
 
'Reality on the Streets'
 Andrew J. Stein, the City Council President, who is challenging Mr. Dinkins in the Democratic primary, says Mr. Dinkins is out of touch with the fears of most voters. "People will judge this issue by their everyday lives and what they really feel and not by statistics," he said. "Dinkins is only going to lose on this issue. The reality on the streets is that people are worried about crime."
Mr. Dinkins contends that he has effectively responded to the crisis that confronted him as he took office, when a record 2,245 homicides were reported in his first year in office. He has hired more than 3,000 new police officers at a time when fiscal hardships forced him to cut other agencies and has pressed the Police Department to shift to a "cop on the beat" policing strategy. The result, he asserts, is that the number of major crimes reported to the police has steadily declined in every category for the first time in 36 years.
But Mr. Dinkins's rivals are quick to point out that the drop in crime rates for the last two years comes on the heels of record high numbers. Even with the improvement, they argue, crime in the city stands where it was during the Koch administration.
 
Fewer Arrests
 They also say reports of crime are down in part because the Police Department is arresting fewer people, a consequence of the Dinkins administration's shift to preventive policing practices aimed at deterring crime rather than arresting droves of street-level addicts and drug dealers.
Since Mr. Dinkins took office, arrests for narcotics possession and trafficking have dropped by 31 percent, while arrests for other felonies have declined nearly 17 percent, Police Department statistics show.
Mr. Giuliani and Herman Badillo, the former Congressman from the Bronx who is also challenging the Mayor, have argued that fewer arrests translate into fewer reported crimes because arrested criminals often turn in their colleagues or confess to unreported crimes.
But several criminologists disputed that argument. Hubert Williams, the president of the Police Foundation in Washington, said the drop in arrests could not account for an across-the-board decline in reported crime. That is because some crimes, notably murder and car theft, are almost invariably reported to the police and the number of such reports would not be affected by the overall rate of arrests in the city. "It has to be more involved than that," he said.
Several other crime experts said the city's sustained two-year decline in reported crime must mirror some decrease in actual crime because the amount of crime that goes unreported nationwide has stayed fairly stable for the last 10 years -- about 38 percent of all crimes and about 48 percent of violent crimes, according to Justice Department surveys.
While Mr. Dinkins will never be able to prove his policies have curbed crime, many crime experts said the changes the Mayor has made in the police force are a plausible explanation for at least some of the decline.
In the end, the truth about whether the Mayor has managed to cut crime may not matter in the world of campaigning, political strategists say. Politicians must grapple first with voters' perceptions, and polls have told Mr. Dinkins's challengers that most people are still afraid of crime.
"The crime issue is almost a constant," said Lou Harris, the poll taker. "It kind of lives with people all the time."
He said that for the last decade about two-thirds of New York City voters have consistently ranked crime as their top worry, although other issues like the economy and education have risen in importance in the last year. In general, he said, the public's perception of crime lags far behind statistical trends.
That perception could spell trouble for Mr. Dinkins, Mr. Harris said. Polls indicate that voters most fearful of crime are also those most likely to vote against Mayor Dinkins, especially among white voters. "In that sense, it is a cutting issue," he said. "There is no question that those who feel the most insecure about crime are not voting for the Mayor."
So far, Mr. Giuliani's tactic has been to play down the statistics, arguing that the decreases are too small to make a difference in most people's lives. He also points out that crime in schools, contrary to the citywide trend, has risen sharply. "The real problem for the Mayor is that the numbers he's talking about you just can't declare victory," he said.
Mr. Stein, a liberal on most social issues, has tried to turn the issue to his advantage by criticizing Mr. Dinkins for not having enough drug arrests made to fill city jails to capacity. He would return to a policy popular under Mayor Edward I. Koch of making mass arrests of low-level drug dealers and users, he said.
"These jails he closed I would open and fill them up with the drug dealers," he said.
Mr. Badillo has accused Mr. Dinkins of abandoning some streets in poor neighborhoods to small-time drug dealers. "There is no value to having community policing unless community police are authorized to make street drug arrests," he said.
 
A Green Light?
 Roy Innis, a conservative candidate for the Democratic nomination, said Mr. Dinkins was trying to delude the public. He said making fewer lower-level drug arrests would be a misguided policy that would give a green light to youths considering going into narcotics trafficking.
Suzanne Trazoff, a Police Department spokeswoman, acknowledged that the police have backed off from making mass arrests for trafficking in or possessing narcotics, mostly because the ranks of narcotics officers have been winnowed to put more uniformed officers on the street.
For his part, Mr. Dinkins said of the crime figures: "If they were up in all seven major index categories, I'm sure it would be my fault."

HEADLINE: A PLUTONIUM PACT WILL AID DISPOSAL

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Seeking a new path to East-West disarmament, Russian and American experts have agreed to team up to develop and build a new type of reactor that can burn plutonium from nuclear warheads and turn the deadly bomb fuel into electricity. The $1.5 billion nuclear reactor would be built in Russia and fueled at least partly by plutonium from Moscow's huge stockpile of scrapped nuclear arms.
The initiative, led by General Atomics of San Diego, requires up to $100 million over five years from the American Government, which is studying the general idea of burning plutonium and, separately, whether to support the East-West reactor plan. The small reactor would be cooled by helium and is advertised as immune to meltdown. 
 Until the plan was unveiled yesterday, excess plutonium from Russian nuclear disarmament was largely slated to be stored, leading some specialists to fear it could fall into unfriendly hands. The reactor plan is seen as offering an alternative path of disposal.
 
Issue Pushed for Summit
 An agreement between General Atomics and the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy to form a reactor-building venture was signed in Moscow Thursday and made public by General Atomics yesterday. Top Russian officials are said to have pushed hard to have the issue discussed this past weekend at the Vancouver summit.
It is not known whether the topic was aired, although President Clinton made clear he favors expanded technical cooperation.
"This reactor offers a very attractive opportunity to destroy weapon-grade plutonium and simultaneously to produce electricity," Neil Blue, chairman of General Atomics, said in an interview.
"The joint venture will provide stabilizing employment of Russian scientists and engineers previously engaged in making nuclear weapons and will contribute to the conversion of Russia's nuclear-weapons industry into a force for peaceful economic reconstruction."
 
Some Are Opposed
 In contrast, Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, a private group based in Washington, said he was strongly opposed to any form of plutonium burning.
"We see this as a major diversion in trying to get plutonium out of commerce," he said in an interview. "It's better to turn it into glass and bury it," a reference to the process used for disposal.
The initiative parallels joint plans already under way to burn Russia's vast surplus of uranium, another fuel of nuclear warheads.
Last year, the Bush Administration announced a deal with Russia to buy much of its highly enriched uranium from nuclear arms so it could be diluted into fuel for civilian power plants. That agreement is snarled in bureaucratic red tape.
 
A Nuclear Pioneer
 General Atomics is a pioneer in the nuclear industry with a strong track record of working successfully with the Russians. Last year it became the conduit by which the Federal Government began to tap Russia's scientific talent, hiring more than a hundred Russian scientists to help America harness the vast energy of nuclear fusion.
Now General Atomics says it has a design for a modular, high-temperature, gas-cooled, fission reactor that could burn weapons-grade plutonium, destroying up to 95 percent of the fuel and leaving the residue mired in a radioactive brew highly unattractive for turning back into bomb fuel. Unlike uranium, weapons-grade plutonium cannot be easily diluted into reactor fuel but can be burned directly in its concentrated form.
The new reactor is seen as highly efficient, turning about 50 percent of its generated heat into electricity. Most commercial nuclear power plants have an efficiency of about 33 percent. The reactor's super-heated helium would directly turn a turbine to produce electricity, rather than heating an intermediary such as water to do that work.
The reactor should take ten years to design and build. Its designers say the machine is intrinsically safe because its physical characteristics make it immune to meltdown, the most feared reactor accident.
 
Sealed Off From Surroundings
 The key safety feature is that plutonium fuel, while not chemically dilutable, is broken into billions of tiny bits, each of which is the size of a grain of salt and is covered with a tough ceramic shell that can withstand unusually high temperatures. The grains are repackaged in a way that allows them to serve as a fuel element.
The new reactor is seen as the first of a new generation of small reactors that could be built not only in Russia but around the world.
Reactors that can burn weapons-grade plutonium are now under study by the Federal Department of Energy, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment and the National Academy of Sciences, a private group that advises the Government.
Dr. Thomas B. Cochrane, a nuclear specialist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group in Washington, said it was unlikely the Clinton Administration would move rapidly to back the reactor plan since the general idea of burning weapons-grade plutonium was currently being studied intensively.
He added that the idea had merit, but only if burning plutonium from nuclear weapons could be done without spurring the growth of a commercial market in the deadly material.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Marlboro's 2-Fisted Pitch

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Ever see a cowboy try to walk a tightrope? Philip Morris is about to ask the Marlboro cowboy -- perhaps the world's best-known advertising icon -- to perform that daunting feat.
Philip Morris is trying to pull off two seemingly contradictory strategies for its best-selling but troubled Marlboro cigarette brand. The company is promoting Marlboros with cents-off coupons, discounted pricing and merchandise giveaways, which tend to increase sales and market share in the short term at the expense of profitability. At the same time, however, it will continue to run slick, image-building advertisements in the mainstream media to enhance the brand's personality over the long haul.
 
 
Like a Political Candidate
 It's not unlike a candidate who tries to win an election by attacking his or her opponent in a fiery speech in the morning and then pays for warm and fuzzy, mom-and-apple-pie commercials to appear that evening. 
 Philip Morris stunned the consumer marketing world last week when it disclosed an extensive and aggressive promotional program to revive sales of Marlboros, which have wilted under a relentless onslaught from cheaper brands. The promotion will come atop a relentless flood of magazine and newspaper ads, bus shelter posters and store displays, inundating consumers with the latest versions of its famous 29-year-old Marlboro Country campaign, replete with Western imagery from cowpokes to spurs.
Whether the cowboy can keep his footing remains to be seen. "From a strategic standpoint, it's a very gutsy move," Ellen Merlo, vice president of corporate affairs at Philip Morris U.S.A. in New York, said yesterday. "It shows we've made a long-term commitment to our flagship brand and our business."
Ms. Merlo, who formerly served as vice president of marketing services, acknowledged that Philip Morris's ardent pursuit of both strategies at once had its risks.
"But we're committed to doing both," she said, "and I think we're very capable of doing both."
"There may not be a lot of trademarks in the world that could do it," she added. "But Marlboro has such a strong image, we are able to overlay the promotions with our advertising."
Gary Stibel, founder and principal at the New England Consulting Group, a marketing management consulting company in Westport, Conn., agreed with Ms. Merlo's optimism.
"Philip Morris defended the profitability of its cigarette business as long and hard as it could," he said. "Now they've recognized the handwriting on the wall."
His reference was to the way cheaper brands, like Doral, Bucks, Viceroy and Bull Durham, have drastically altered the rules in the nation's $45 billion cigarette market. These brands can cost as much as a dollar a pack less than premium brands like Marlboro.
"You can argue till hell freezes over that they waited too long," Mr. Stibel added. "Still, it's smart. And, rather than pussyfooting around, they're taking aggressive action."
Chris Sutherland, executive director of the Promotion Marketing Association of America, a trade organization in New York, said Philip Morris's radical shift in strategies typified the changes overtaking consumer marketing as a result of the weak American economy.
"It's a new world," he said, citing a recent survey by the association in which 88 percent of senior marketing executives responded that promotions aimed at consumers could help, rather than hinder, the brand-building aspects of television commercials and print advertisements.
"It's no longer either-or," Mr. Sutherland added. "You now see marketers doing both all the time."
Mr. Sutherland emphasized that for promotions and advertising to work in tandem, they must be carefully created and planned to be complementary. "If you design it poorly, the promotion can hurt a brand's equity," he said.
"But guess what, so can bad advertising -- or a bad product."
Ms. Merlo said that as part of Marlboro's sales strategies, a huge promotion that began in January, called the Marlboro Adventure Team, would be extended, offering consumers merchandise like jacket and watches adorned with Marlboro logos in exchange for product codes from packages.
The promotion has already generated orders for 600,000 items of merchandise, she said, as well as more than 300,000 entries in an Adventure Team contest. Estimates are that Philip Morris has already spent up to $200 million on the promotion -- which is believed to be a record sum for such a short-term sales strategy.
And Marlboro's ad campaign, by Leo Burnett U.S.A. in Chicago, will be maintained, and spending will increase this year, Ms. Merlo said. The brand's ad budget is already enormous, with spending reaching an estimated $125 million last year.
Burnett in recent months has been bringing out fresh executions of the familiar Marlboro Country print and outdoor efforts, including revamped designs for ads for Marlboro Lights and regular red Marlboros.
Although Brandweek, a trade publication, reported this week that Philip Morris would introduce later this year a lower-priced filtered version of Marlboro called Marlboro Express, Ms. Merlo described it as only "one of the options we looked at" before deciding last week to proceed with the twin strategies of promotions and ads for existing varieties of Marlboro.

HEADLINE: Fundamentalism: the 20th Century's Last Ideology

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
Scholars used to dismiss fundamentalism as a fossilized form of old-time religion, destined to dissolve in the acids of science and skepticism.
But from the Iranian revolution and the rise of the religious right in the United States to the militancy of Jewish settlers on the West Bank and the riots that followed a Hindu-led destruction of a mosque in India, events of the past two decades make it clear that religious fundamentalism has done anything but dissolve. As one scholar recently put it, fundamentalism is "dynamic, adaptive and modern," perhaps the last great ideological upsurge of the 20th century. 
 What were once viewed as unrelated religious movements -- indeed, often condemning one another's doctrines -- are increasingly recognized as sharing a set of fundamentalist "family resemblances" that cut across religious traditions. Scholars and policy makers hope that by comparing fundamentalist movements, a new field of study will afford insights into the dynamics that spark militant religious revivals, drive them into politics, fuel their growth or brake their influence.
 
Threats and Outsiders
 No one expects these studies to yield neat "laws" of fundamentalism, and scholars insist that the specific traits of movements as different as Pentecostal Christians in Central America and Muslim guerrillas in Afghanistan should not get lost in a stretch for common denominators.
But when 35 political scientists, sociologists of religion and specialists in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America gathered in Chicago in March for the final session of a five-year examination of fundamentalism, most agreed that there were common threads. Unlike traditional believers, the scholars said, fundamentalists are consciously counterattacking against the threats of secularism and modernity, threats often identified with outsiders.
Most fundamentalists do not reject modernity in principle. Often they embrace the most up-to-date techniques of communications and organization to spread their message. But they may well seize on minor elements of a religious tradition, like a specific way of dressing, to symbolically distinguish the faithful from the uncommitted.
These conclusions emerged from the Fundamentalism Project, a broad effort sponsored by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences that enlisted more than 200 scholars since 1988 to examine fundamentalist movements in seven major religions and across five continents.
Other "family resemblances" outlined by the group, which met at the University of Chicago Divinity School, included moral dualism -- a view of the world as sharply divided between embattled camps of good and evil -- in which fundamentalists see themselves as a divinely called group, set apart from others, bound to a strict code of behavior and frequently subject to a charismatic leader.
The scholars said the "Abrahamic" forms of fundamentalism -- Jewish, Christian and Muslim -- constantly affirm the absolute truth of a sacred text or authoritative tradition. These fundamentalisms also emphasize messianic or millennial beliefs in a miraculous culmination of history, with good reigning triumphantly.
Similarly, some Hindu and Buddhist movements are beginning to create a "synthetic fundamentalism" by highlighting crucial texts or looking toward a coming triumph.
Yet, even after five years of the Fundamentalism Project, not all the scholars were comfortable with stretching a single label from American Protestant adherents of a strictly literal reading of the Bible to politically resurgent Muslim groups in North Africa, Sinhalese Buddhist fighters in Sri Lanka and Hindu nationalists in India.
Some warned that the popular equation of fundamentalism with fanaticism was leading governments to develop an ideology of "anti-fundamentalism," justifying human-rights abuses against religious opponents.
 
Divided Over Strategy
 The group also divided over whether fundamentalist movements aggressively seeking power could be nudged toward moderation by outsiders.
Martin Kramer of Tel Aviv University questioned whether moderate fundamentalists could be disentangled from extremists. "If there is anything we have learned, it is how unpredictable these movements are and how little we know," he said.
Doug Johnston of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington replied: "I don't accept that fundamentalism is monolithic. There are certain entities you can play to more than others."
The scholars agreed that while fundamentalist movements in many nations have mobilized frustration by denouncing greed and corruption, these movements have proposed only vague remedies of their own and have varied greatly in their support or suspicion of market economics.
"All major religions are capable of supporting both pro-market and anti-market ideologies," said Timur Kuran, an economist at the University of Southern California who gave a skeptical overview of such fundamentalist economic doctrines as "interest-free" Islamic banking, the "Buddhist socialism" of Myanmar, formerly Burma, or the anti-government stance of fundamentalist leaders in the United States.
 
Puzzle, Problem or Peril
 Prof. Samuel Heilman of the City University of New York said the encounters of scholars from around the world, and often from religious backgrounds that have been antagonistic, was itself "a human drama we haven't written about."
But the project did not succeed in integrating fundamentalist representatives themselves in its work, he said.
For most participants in the Chicago meeting, fundamentalism remained at least a puzzle to be explained, if not a problem to be solved or a danger to be parried. For some, however, the years of study may have produced an increasingly critical attitude toward modern secular assumptions.
Nancy T. Ammerman, a sociologist at Emory University who has written several books about American fundamentalists, said she had a greater appreciation of fundamentalists' power "in critiquing the culture, in imagining a world that is different," and in "contesting the powers of those who claim the right to tell the culture's story."

HEADLINE: China Applauds as Its Officials Plunge Into Profit

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YANTAI, China

 BODY:
Happily married, his career flourishing, a 31-year-old midlevel city official named Lu Zhoukui abruptly decided last August to xia hai, or plunge into the sea.
Mr. Lu was not feeling suicidal, and in fact it may have been the best decision he ever made. "Plunging into the sea" is the new slang in China for going into business, and it is becoming a nationwide craze. 
 Tens of millions of Government and Communist Party officials are plunging into the sea. Deng Xiaoping's youngest son has dived in, along with the children of most other top leaders, and the official newspapers are full of praise for the phenomenon.
"From top to bottom, the Government is encouraging us to do business," Mr. Lu said as he sat in the anteroom of his plush new office in this eastern Chinese city. "The only restriction is that the business must be legal."
 
Cash Over Politics
 It says something about the giddiness of the economic and social revolution under way in China that the Communist Party is hailing its officials for abandoning their posts to the temptations of capitalism. More fundamentally, the rush to plunge into the sea reflects the growing sense among China's elite that power and comfort and prestige in the coming years will no longer derive from political position, but rather from hard cash.
One measure of the trend is that the number of registered companies in China soared 88 percent last year alone, rising to 486,000. The registered capital of private enterprises surged 79 percent in the year, to $3.9 billion.
Fragmentary statistics suggest that about one-third of China's 103 million Government employees have leaped into the sea, or at least waded in far enough to get a second, part-time job. Many more Chinese are expected to take the plunge, for the word is getting out that the sea is warm and inviting -- and that almost no one sinks.
Mr. Lu, for instance, started a company in August to engage in everything from running restaurants to placing Chinese laborers in foreign jobs. The company turned a profit of $219,000 in the four months it was operating last year, and this year Mr. Lu is expecting a profit of almost $1 million.
By comparison, his income at his old Government job was $46 a month.
 
Some Troubling Questions
 Nevertheless, the trend toward leaping into the sea raises some troubling questions. Some people worry, for instance, that China is becoming a nation of money-grubbing materialists, in which intellectuals are obliged to sacrifice more important work just to keep up with the Wangs.
There was considerable disquiet when a Beijing newspaper reported that a Communist Party secretary at the Forestry University was selling meat pies on the side. It is not clear which of two items bothered readers more: that the man would stoop to be a vendor or that by doing so he tripled his income.
"I am totally appalled," a commentator wrote in The Guangming Daily News, a newspaper for intellectuals. "I'd like to read the professor's works rather than eat his meat pies."
A broader question is whether those leaping into the sea are unfairly taking advantage of their guanxi, or connections. Good guanxi are paramount in China, for they make the difference in getting bank loans, electricity, running water and tax waivers. Guanxi are often more important than rules.
 
How He Hired Russians
 Mr. Lu, for instance, is about to open a restaurant with Russian waitresses. Many other bars and restaurants around China have lately been forbidden to hire Russians, partly because of concern that some engage in prostitution.
Perhaps Mr. Lu has obtained permission through luck, or through astute preparation. But it cannot hurt that he knows all the city officials, and that calligraphy given to him by the provincial governor is hanging in his office.
"Some of these people going into business worked for many years in Government offices, and they have lots of contacts," said Zhang Huafu, the Deputy Mayor of Yantai. "I can't deny the problem. But because of this problem, we shouldn't oppose the whole idea of people going into business."
The term "plunging into the sea" reflects the sense of daring and uncertainty that is associated with business in China. Much of that is dissipating, but one recurring problem is finding housing.
 
Having to Return Apartments
 Government employees normally get low-cost apartments from the state, and unless they have good guanxi, they often have to return their apartments when they go into business. Private housing is difficult to obtain and extremely expensive.
Wang Quanjie, a 42-year-old engineer in Yantai, is now grappling with the housing question. Mr. Wang, who used to oversee leather factories for the city government, left his job in July with 10 colleagues to form a leather research institute.
Mr. Wang and his friends have done extremely well, winning consulting fees from factories and making back their starting capital of $17,000 five times over. Like most Chinese who plunge into the sea, they raised the money by dipping into savings and by borrowing from friends and relatives. Also like most, they are trying to use their guanxi with friendly officials to get large loans from Government-run banks.
The problem is that the Government gave them a one-year grace period to leave their housing. So the staff has to find new apartments this summer.
"That's a huge headache for all of us," Mr. Wang said. "I've got to figure out how to house all my staff."
 
Quitting Is Avoided
 Partly to avoid losing their apartments, many Chinese leap into the sea without formally quitting their other jobs. They neglect their work, but keep the salaries and housing, knowing that it is very difficult to be dismissed.
A result is that while not enough officials have resigned to create staff shortages, many schools and offices have a very clear shortage of employees concentrating on their work.
Policemen moonlight as pimps. Factory workers wave rags on street corners as an offer to wash cars. University students sell photocopiers and X-ray machines on commission. Professors become corporate consultants, working with such enthusiasm that The Economic Daily complained recently about faculty members who rush out of class when their beepers go off.
As for Chinese journalists, a joke going around says there are now five kinds of reporters. The top tier is made up of those who run a business on the side, and they are followed by those who play the stock market.
The third kind sells advertisements as a sideline, winning a typical commission of 7 to 12 percent from their business departments. The fourth kind freelances for other publications.
"The bottom rank of journalists is the least respected," said a reporter for one of China's most distinguished newspapers. "They're the ones who actually do the work and write the front-page stories."
 
Traditionally Demeaned
 Traditionally in China, Confucianism looked down on business people, and until recently officials and intellectuals disdained commerce as demeaning. Many Chinese also regarded business as risky, because of fears that private enterprises would be confiscated if hard-liners returned to power.
The term "plunging into the sea" apparently originated early in this century in Shanghai but then migrated to Taiwan, where it was a pejorative expression for young women working as prostitutes. The term returned to mainland China last year, and fell into common use only in the last six months.
But on the journey from Taiwan, the meaning of the phrase was twisted to reflect the broader concept of going into business in any way. Now it encompasses moonlighting professors as well as prostitutes.
Because of the traditionally negative associations of engaging in private business, in the early and mid-1980's a hugely disproportionate share of entrepreneurs in China were ex-convicts. They could not get any respectable job and so were forced into business.
 
Ex-Convicts Are Prosperous
 A result is that perhaps in no other country are ex-convicts so prosperous. China often boasts about its low recidivism rates; one reason is that released prisoners -- mostly common criminals, but also some dissidents -- are part of an old-boy network that offers some of the most lucrative jobs in the country. For making useful business connections, Beijing No. 1 Prison is the Harvard Business School of China.
As time passes, fears of a major policy reversal by the hard-liners are diminishing, and so is the scorn for private business.
A well-known writer, Zhang Xianlang, has just started his own holding company, setting up a huge billboard as its first project. And China's most famous movie actress, Liu Xiaoqing, has started the Xiaoqing Industrial and Commercial Company, with interests varying from cosmetics to real estate.
 
Favorite Job Preference
 A survey of young people found that their top job preference was to be an entrepreneur. National Government work ranked 8th out of 16 choices.
All this is very heartening to those who have plunged into the sea, like Wang Qian, who left her Government post last summer to join the private leather research institute in Yantai.
"A few years ago, it would have been tough for somebody in my present situation to find a boyfriend," said Ms. Wang, 24. "Then a woman in business could look for a boyfriend only among other traders."
"But now it's very different," Ms. Wang added, beaming. "People accept the fact that it's a market economy. Anybody will go out with you."

HEADLINE: The Outlook Is Still Risky For New York Office Space

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
As the American economy heads into what appears to be an ever-more-solid recovery, the New York commercial real estate industry continues to reel from the shocks of the overbuilding of the 1980's and the job losses of the recession.
In a market characterized by vast swathes of empty office space and desperate owners seeking buyers or tenants for troubled buildings, each new report of a big lease, of an offer to buy a distressed building or of a dip in the vacancy rate is analyzed as perhaps the sign of the market's recovery. Each time, anxious owners and other industry insiders ask: is this the crocus that signals the start of spring? 
 Like spring, however, the overall market -- the country's biggest -- still feels a damp chill despite some rays of sunshine.
"We've probably bottomed in vacancy rates, and we've probably bottomed in rent rates on new leases," S. Michael Giliberto, head of real estate research for Salomon Brothers, said. "But we probably haven't bottomed on average rents, and it's not clear we've bottomed in value."
The building boom and economic crunch have left the prime office areas of Manhattan, midtown and downtown, with a total of 57.6 million square feet of empty office space, according to the Edward S. Gordon Company, a brokerage firm. If all that unoccupied territory were put on a flat surface, it would total roughly 1,322 acres, or about half again as large as Central Park.
Despite Manhattan's many "see-through buildings" -- the name given to the partly filled office towers -- and the tentative nature of the economic recovery, Stephen B. Siegel, president of Gordon, is fairly optimistic.
"Yes, we are on the way up," he said. "Rents are beginning to firm up, and certainly concessions on leasing transactions are less generous. But the firming up is extremely tentative and is subject to any economic upheaval that might occur."
What he describes as a pickup in the market started in the second quarter of last year, and has continued through the first quarter of this year, he added. Last year, Gordon's figures show, for the first time in four years more space was rented in midtown Manhattan than was vacated -- 2.4 million square feet more.
But rental prices still show the degree of distress. According to Chris Kraus of Cushman and Wakefield, at the peak of the market in the early 1980's the average effective rent -- including free rent, improvements and the like -- for a good, newer building in midtown was around $35 to $40 a square foot; that figure is now around $25 to $30 a square foot.
 
 
No Dramatic Change
 Even with some of that vacant space being absorbed -- and even with big tenants encountering growing difficulty in finding choice blocks of space bigger than 100,000 square feet in midtown -- the situation has not changed drastically.
Steve Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said, "The deals that are being done are still marginal deals for owners, so it remains a tenant's market."
The long-term prospects for a recovery in property values depend on basic economic truths: when hiring picks up and new companies start, demand for office space will rise.
But hiring may not expand, given the severity of the recession and factors such as technological advances, increased productivity, the leaner corporation and the fact that the baby boom and the influx of women into the workplace have passed.
 
 
'Musical Chairs'
 "There appears to be no new demand coming into the New York market in terms of growth in industry," said Peter Hauspurg of Eastern Consolidated Properties, a Manhattan real estate investment banking firm. "Most of the trading now is tenants trading up to better properties. But it's just musical chairs."
The magnitude of distress in evident in recent building sales. Mr. Hauspurg said properties are now changing hands, but at deep discounts.
"Prices of commercial buildings have fallen from between 40 to 70 percent," from the peak of the market in the 1980's, he said, depending on their location. Mr. Giliberto's research unit says recent sales suggest that financial institutions' troubled properties are selling at 45 percent to 55 percent of the previous value, and that many would-be sellers prefer to wait and hope that prices will rise.
 
 
Some Arresting Numbers
 Although differences in building make comparisons difficult, some of the numbers are arresting: in 1986, the 67,000-square-foot building at 1 East 57th Street, at Fifth Avenue, sold for about $820 a square foot. In 1992, the nearby 57,500-square-foot building at 3 West 57th Street sold for $298 a square foot, one of the higher per-square-foot sales of the year.
Owners and developers were not the only people left bereft by the crash; financial institutions and other lenders have been watching the value of their real estate holdings and loans plummet.
But despite the crash in prices and the ripples throughout the world of real estate and beyond, John H. Alschuler Jr. of Hamilton, Rabinovitz and Alschuler, a consulting firm, sees some silver lining: office space is available and affordable for expansion or entry into New York, where rents were so prohibitively high for so long.
"Though deeply painful to investors and to the city, the restructuring of the cost base of New York's real estate markets has had the effect of making Manhattan and the boroughs more competitive, which should sustain our long-term growth," he said.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
Planner's Vision of a People-Friendly Arts Plaza on the Passaic

BYLINE: By Glenn Collins

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
SO many people suffer from so much unnecessary agita when they see the word Newark. Larry Goldman knows everything there is to know about that one. He is stepping carefully down Saybrook Place in his cordovan wing tips, dapper, restless, the irresistible force personified.
A visitor sharing that walk sees only the immovable object: a corner of downtown Newark. It is a landscape of forlorn, weedy Park-Fast-All-Day lots ringed in razor wire. There are boarded-up buildings and a doomed, gutted hotel. But this Goldman fellow, his face radiating anticipation as he talks about his vision, sees none of it. As he walks, he is crossing a gloriously verdant public square bordered by umbrella-topped cafe tables. He is watching a polite crowd clustered around a string quartet near a sparkling fountain. He is surrounded by concertgoers hastening toward a performance by Itzhak Perlman. 
 Instead of the phosphoresence of decay, he sees Lincoln Center on the Passaic River. An arts center alive with activity. To fully appreciate the degree of difficulty of his daydream, try taking today's pop quiz: When you see the word "Newark," do you (1) Lock your car doors? (2) Curse yourself for failing to buy the Club? (3) Think of buildings that are burning and/or abandoned? (4) Eagerly await an evening at the Bolshoi Ballet?
If you answered "yes" to the first three questions and "no" to the fourth, Larry Goldman -- Dr. Lawrence P. Goldman, that is -- understands. And he has your number. He vows to win you over to a "yes" on question No. 4, and a "no" on questions Nos. 1 through 3. His track record so far is persuasive in such matters.
How so? Recently Dr. Goldman's team reached a milestone: in the dead grip of a stubborn recession, it raised $100 million of the $150 million needed to further the organization of which he is president: the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. The plan (at first it was described as "scheme") is to build a world-class 2,700-seat multipurpose hall and a 500-seat theater on a 12-acre site in Newark.
Right. Newark. The design includes a people-friendly plaza called Theater Square, which would extend a permanent welcome mat to people in the city and the suburbs beyond.
The money details are not boring. Gov. Jim Florio, not renowned for his support of the arts at budget-cutting time, kicked in $62.5 million. The city donated $10 million, and the Federal Government $1.2 million. So far $26.5 million has come from private contributors, including foundations that carry the name of A. T.&T., Matsushita, Merck, Prudential, Johnson and Johnson, S. I. Newhouse and Warner-Lambert. Not the usual suspects.
"I didn't say he was crazy when he approached me, but I was skeptical that it could be done in Newark," said P. Roy Vagelos, chairman of Merck and Company. "Now I don't think there's any question that it will happen."
Out on Saybrook Place, with a gesture sweeping beyond the wasteland before him, Dr. Goldman says that ground-breaking will occur this summer. The opening? In the 1996 season. "People have stopped asking whether it will get built any more," he said. "Now they ask, 'when it gets built, who's going to come?' "
The answer, market research suggests, is a pool of 650,000 New Jersey arts-lovers who might prefer not to cross the Hudson River. One of them is Dr. Vagelos, a director of the Metropolitan Opera. "It would be very nice to have a truly great performing arts center much closer," he said.
To lure the anxious into Newark, Mayor Sharpe James promises protected streets and Dr. Goldman vows to create, "hands down, the safest and most congenial parking lot on the East Coast." Couldn't hurt. A visitor remembers his own first impression of Newark as a reporter after the disturbances in 1967. A world of rubbled buildings and smoking dreams. Some of the dead zones persist, but Newark cognoscenti have long known about the city's renaissance as well.
The explosion of recent building, bringing thousands of people downtown, is more significant than headlines about stolen cars doing doughnut spins. Only last week a six-plex cinema opened in the riot-scarred Central Ward. And Newark has been designated as (don't laugh) one of America's most livable cities by the United States Conference of Mayors.
The arts center could accelerate that revival. But only if this bow-tied, 47-year-old Princeton-educated urban planner and his power-hitting board of directors can make it happen.
So for now, to walk down Saybrook Place with Dr. Goldman is to span the entire history and future of this city. No exaggeration. Here at the margin of the block, in a tiny park that is a longboat's portage from the Passaic River, is a stone marker celebrating the 1666 landing of Newark's Puritan founders.
The commemorative brass plaque has been ripped out by junkies. The stone has endured. Even as the city. "This monument will be an important part of Theater Square," Dr. Goldman said. And for just a moment, you can see what he does: arts mavens lingering over decaf cappucino. Where only rusty chain-link fence and a forgotten monument had been.

'There's Just a Lot of Pressure'

 BODY:
The following text was taken from more than 20 hours of discussions with teen-agers from the New York City region. Excerpts appear with each article.
Q What are the biggest problems facing young people?
 
EMMA KRAMER-WHEELER , 16, Brooklyn (Edward R. Murrow High School): Lack of direction.
BERNARDO VASQUEZ , 17, Manhattan (A. Philip Randolph High School): If you don't have the right guidance . . . then you end up going the wrong way.
Q What kind of help is available in terms of institutions, like schools or churches ----
WUBNESH HYLTON , 19, Brooklyn (Hunter College): Not school.
EMMA Most of the guidance counselors are these 60-, 70-year-old women who sit in their offices or go to lunch. And don't do anything else.
Q What about churches or synagogues?
WUBNESH I don't know any young people who go to church.
Q Why don't young people go to church?
WUBNESH Because churches don't do anything. They serve no purpose. They're just like a big fashion show, hands clapping and foot stomping.
JUAN RIVERA , 18, Brooklyn (Bushwick High School): I'm a big part of my church. . . . I run the sports program there. . . . I've developed a relationship with just about everyone there. . . . And I found out more about myself.
Q Do you know people who are giving up? For instance, the suicide rate has gone up dramatically for young people.
EMMA I think a lot more people give up in less dramatic ways also. People just go into their shells. There's just a lot of pressure.
Q Do you think life is tougher now than it was for your parents' generation, or even 10 years ago?
BERNARDO Economically is it tougher? Maybe because there are less factory jobs. There might be more opportunities in professions . . . then I have it harder, because racism is rising again.
Q What has been the impact of AIDS and crack on your generation?
WUBNESHWell, crack, I see it affecting more of the older generation. Young people were selling it, but young people don't really use it because they know it's not like a party recreational drug, because you die too quick.
JUAN I know someone who has AIDS and she's taking care of herself. She's about 26.
EMMAIt's amazing to me that not everybody knows this, but it can kill you.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Sales Abroad Set Record

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Private investors overseas bought a record $31 billion of Treasury bonds and notes last year, with much of the demand coming from buyers in London and the return of the Japanese.
Private purchases in the fourth quarter, at $20 billion, also set a record. 
 The data, compiled by R. H. Wrightson & Associates, show that after two years of being net sellers, Japanese investors were "modest" buyers of notes and bonds by the second half of last year. But, Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson, said the buying probably did not have much impact on the market.
 
 
Buying in London
 The largest buyers for Treasury bonds and notes were investors who bought through the London market. That buying, he said, "certainly helped the market; it helped absorb some of the increased Treasury issuance."
There are data for total purchases by private investors overseas, but they are not broken down by country. So Wrightson has to use other data -- including official buying by central banks and statements from the Treasury and foreign governments -- to reach its conclusions about private foreign purchases.
The totals for private and official buying show $24.2 billion of purchases of bonds and notes in London last year, the highest amount ever and about four times the 1991 total. As for Japan, the 1992 total was $9.5 billion in net buying, in contrast to the net selling of $4.1 billion in 1991 and $15.5 billion in 1990. Still, that is well under the $21.8 billion of net buying in 1988.
 
 
Impact of Foreign Buying
 The impact of foreign buying can be seen in the performance of the yields on the 30-year bond and the 10-year note at the end of 1988 and the beginning of 1989. The buying by the Japanese helped to pull the yield on the 30-year bond to below that of the 10-year note, the opposite of the usual relationship.
In December 1988, for example, the yield on the 30-year bond was 8.99 percent, while the yield on the 10-year note was 9.14 percent, or 15 basis points, higher. (A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.) In March 1989, the 30-year yield was 9.09 percent, compared with 9.28 percent on the 10-year note.
Mr. Crandall noted that the Japanese bought both notes and bonds, but that the size of bond purchases was so large compared with the total sold that yield relationship was reversed. Since the Japanese became net sellers in 1990 and 1991, the relationship between the bond and the note has reversed, with the yield on the 30-year bond now about 90 basis points higher.
The Japanese sold Treasury securities in 1990 and 1991 because they needed to bring cash home to offset huge losses when the Tokyo stock market crashed.
While the foreign buying through London appears to be close to the size of the Japanese buying, Mr. Crandall said the London buying was more evenly spread among maturities, so it had not had a skewing impact.
 
 
Treasury Market
 Prices of Treasury bonds and notes were little changed yesterday in light trading as traders and investors marked time, waiting for the release of two inflation measures at the end of the week.
But traders were also getting ready for a down-to-the-wire debt ceiling ritual because Congress has failed to approve an increase in the Government's borrowing limit.
In late trading, the price of the 30-year bond was up 13/32 , to 1018/32 , as the yield fell to 7.02 percent, from 7.05 percent on Friday. The price increase managed to erase less than half of the loss on Friday, after the March employment data apparently made many investors decide that the economy was strong enough to prevent inflation from declining below the 3 percent rate of last year.
As usual, the debt ceiling is the hostage of political infighting, this time in the Senate, where Republicans have blocked approval of President Clinton's economic stimulus program, contending that it is too large and that some of its spending is wasteful. But the crux of the battle is that the Republicans, who have 43 of the 100 members, want to have a stronger role in policy. Because the Democrats need 60 votes to end a filibuster, the Republicans have leverage if they stick together.
The stalemate forced the cancellation of the regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills yesterday and the auction of $14.25 billion of one-year Treasury bills last week.
The Treasury says it will bump up against the current borrowing ceiling of $4.145 trillion tomorrow. At the same time it runs out of borrowing authority, the Treasury estimates that it will also run out of cash to pay bills and government checks, like Social Security. The Treasury has asked for an increase that would temporarily raise the borrowing limit to $4.37 trillion, enough to accommodate expected borrowing through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.
The Government has not defaulted before, although it has managed to delay approval of a borrowing increase until the last minute. And traders in the bond market do not expect the worst to happen this time.
"They don't want that on their heads," said Joel Kazis, managing director for government trading and sales at UBS Securities.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Sinks Against Yen, Despite Bank of Japan Effort

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted broadly lower yesterday, hitting another record low against the Japanese yen despite a further attempt by the Bank of Japan to stem the American currency's decline.
Activity was light as traders searched in vain for news that might change the market's generally bearish sentiment toward the dollar. Participants were awaiting further clues in two important inflation reports due for release later this week.
 
 
Gold Prices Slip
 Gold prices retreated after last week's rally. Gold for current delivery, which rose $8.70 an ounce over the last four trading sessions on New York's Commodity Exchange, fell $1.40 to close at $339.50. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $339.10 an ounce, off 90 cents from late Friday. 
 Dealers said the intervention by the Japanese central bank, which came during overnight trading in Tokyo, was bigger in scope than its move on Friday to support the dollar.
But the move failed to spur a rebound in the dollar, which repeatedly hit postwar lows against the yen last week amid apparent support by the major industrialized nations for a stronger yen as a way to cut Japan's huge trade surplus.
The dollar continued to slip against the German mark, as traders found little new in remarks by the Bundesbank's president, Helmut Schlesinger, that the bank would continue to cut German interest rate cuts slowly and gradually.
 
 
Third Consecutive Record Low
 The dollar closed in Tokyo at 113.83 yen. In London, the dollar was quoted at 113.55 yen. By late afternoon in New York, it had slipped to 113.70 yen from late Friday's 113.75 yen, its third consecutive record low.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5210, from $1.5175 late Friday. But late yesterday afternoon in New York, the pound fetched $1.5210, slightly less than late Friday's $1.5220.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday, included: 1.5950 marks, down from 1.5975; 1.4770 Swiss francs, down from 1.4780; 5.4125 French francs, down from 5.4400; 1,586 Italian lire, up from 1,584, and $1.2623 (Canadian), down from $1.2641 (Canadian).

They Came and Saw And They Learned

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS

 BODY:
ASIDE from debating who might be the new national champion, the multimillion dollar question here last night was whether Chris Webber of Michigan would turn pro this spring. Would the Five X's be broken up?
There was a feeling among some that if Michigan had won, Webber was history; if the Wolverines lost, he might stay and try again until they won it. 
 Others felt that win or lose, Webber was leaving. In two seasons, he had proven himself, outgrown the field and, in any event, wouldn't risk suffering a third heartbreak. After losing by 20 points to Duke as a freshman in the national championship game, Webber sat and wept uncontrollably.
Last night, as a sophomore, Webber capped a riveting 23-point, 11-rebound performance by grabbing a rebound off a missed Carolina foul shot, then streaking down the left sideline with Michigan trailing, 73-71, and with 11 seconds left in the game.
Then he stopped, appeared to slide and signaled for a timeout that Michigan didn't have.
Technical foul. Loss of ball. End of comeback. Loss of game.
End of career?
After the game, Webber, obviously distraught again, spoke at a news conference but did not address his basketball future. His teammate and best friend, Jalen Rose, wondered if such a proud player would want to end his career on such a dismal note.
"You don't expect somebody to make a decision off one game," Rose said. "He'll do all right. he's going to feel down about himself, like we all would in such a situation. But if it weren't for Chris Webber, who knows where we'd be?"
Still, the questions persist: Will Webber return next season, not to the Fab Five but to a hungry team twice denied?
Or will he jump feet first into the rapidly evolving world of pro basketball -- a world built by Magic and Bird, redefined by Jordan and now being reconfigured by Shaq.
It's a difficult world to resist. Especially now.
National Basketball Association people say that should Webber come out this season, he will be a first or second pick.
When you analyze the current situation, the dismal economy, dismal prospect for jobs, there is no defensible position for advising someone to turn down a million dollars. Especially once its's determined that a "million" is a legitimate possibility. The National Collegiate Athletic Association should see to it that an athlete can put himself in the draft without losing eligibility.
Of course, there's an instinctive reflex against an athlete exchanging education for silver and gold rather than following the solid road to a degree. The problem is whether the athletes are even able to get everything a university has to offer academically.
When Anfernee Hardaway of Memphis State declared himself eligible for the draft, his coach, Larry Finch said, "Amen." But while Finch said he didn't have a problem with players leaving early, he added, "I'd like for it to be a real hardship, versus just chasing the money."
In fact, the idea of "going hardship" began with Spencer Haywood, a former Olympian and All-Pro player whose suit against the N.B.A. in 1970 opened the pro draft to underclassmen. Haywood at first had to actually prove that remaining in school was a hardship, but that no longer is required.
Perhaps one day our system of education will become as effective as our sports system in preparing young people for the future.
Think about it: Our scholastic sports system has become so refined that it can produce young people who, after four years of high school and two to three of college, can embark on a professional career.
The academic process, by comparison, is in the Stone Age.
In any event, the N.B.A., is being replenished with great young players: Kenny Anderson, Harold Miner, Shaquille O'Neal, Jimmy Jackson, Chris Jackson.
Webber and Jamal Mashburn, who has already announced his plan to enter the draft after three years at Kentucky, are sharp young athletes with a strong sense of direction. Are they ready for professional basketball? Definitely. The critical question is the extent to which they are ready for the ups and downs of the pro life.
This seems to be a far more critical issue than whether or not to leave school early for hefty sums of money and the prestige of making an N.B.A. team.
In a way it would be nice to see Webber back. He is growing, as a player and as a person by such leaps and bounds that one would like to see him -- and his teammates Jalen Rose, Ray Jackson, Jimmy King and Juwan Howard -- as a senior team at Michigan.
In an ideal world, with all things being equal, Webber perhaps would stay, earning his degree in four years and savoring the relative innocence of campus life.
In this world, where muscle reigns, it becomes increasingly imperative to get what you can while you are able.
Heaven can wait.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
For Openers, Gooden and Key Close Down the Batters

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, April 5

 BODY:
On a chilly April day when emotions were intense because the Indians remembered two of their athletes who died young, it would have been possible to ignore the developments that unfolded for the Yankees as they started the 1993 baseball season. Possible, but not probable.
Maybe the Yankees will gaze back on this opening day sometime in July or August and realize how perfectly their season started in an impressive 9-1 victory over the Indians. But if they want to reminisce on this day with a smile, instead of a frown, the Yankees must continue getting performances like the bushel they received on this 36-degree day. 
 From Jimmy Key twirling eight innings of three-hit baseball in his Yankee debut, to Matt Nokes smacking a three-run homer, to Pat Kelly discovering he was the New York second baseman four hours before the first pitch and responding with a two-run homer, to Danny Tartabull initiating the 16-hit rampage with a homer off Yankee nemesis Charles Nagy, it was a stylish way to begin. It was the first time in 31 years that the Yankees had homers from three players on opening day.
 
Everything Works
 The game -- played before 73,290, the second-largest opening-day crowd in American League history -- was a blueprint for how the Yankees must perform if they want to seriously challenge in the American League East. Key and the other starters must be superb, Tartabull and Nokes must provide power, Kelly and Spike Owen must ignite the bottom of the batting order as they did today with three hits each and Wade Boggs and Don Mattingly must hit and hit. This afternoon, everything meshed neatly for the Yankees. Today, everything they did was gorgeous.
"I'm proud of our club today," said Manager Buck Showalter. "It was a lot of fun as far as the game was concerned. It was a tough emotional day."
With the opportunity for both teams to be distracted as the Indians presented the uniform jerseys of Tim Crews and Steve Olin, who were killed in a boating accident last month, to their widows and parents before the season opener, the Yankees, especially Key, remained very much in focus. After the service for the two pitchers, Key returned to the bullpen to throw more. What a shrewd move.
Key was poised, precise and professional and was also the main reason the game lasted an economical 2 hours 18 minutes. He threw 71 pitches in his eight innings, did not walk a batter, struck out three and retired the last 11 batters he faced before John Habyan handled the ninth. As a replacement for the injured Melido Perez, Key also made friends with his freezing fielders by keeping the contest moving at a crisp pace.
"Awesome and outstanding," said Owen. "He works very fast, he moves the ball around the plate and he knows what he is doing out there. On a day like today, you don't want to be standing out there for 15 minutes."
Boggs, a former foe who is now a friend, said: "You just bang your head against the wall when he pitches. He frustrates you. He doesn't just throw, he pitches. He's one of the best."
 
Just Doing His Job
 Key refused to let the cold or the sight of the families of two fallen pitchers affect his first game with the Yankees. Although Key called the service touching, he also said, "Once I'm between the lines, I do my job."
After Tartabull's opposite-field homer in the second inning pushed the Yankees ahead, 1-0, Key was sharp in the third. The Indians had tied the game on Sandy Alomar's sacrifice fly and had Glenallen Hill on first base with the top of their batting order to contend with. Before the Indians could whisper rally, Key induced the speedy Kenny Lofton to hammer into a second-to-short-to-first double play.
That was about as dangerous as it got for Key. Kelly's run-scoring single in the fifth made it 2-1 and Nokes hit a three-run homer to ignite a five-run sixth and transform the game into a rout. It was a shocking blast because he smoked it off Nagy, who had retired Nokes in 16 of 17 career times at bat. Actually, it was a day for reversing trends because the Yankees beat Nagy after being humbled by him on three different occasions last year.
Yes, it was a game the Yankees will cherish. Although the day brought sadness, the Yankees managed to begin the season with enough positives to last a week. The trick for them now is to make pitching, power and sturdy defense reappear as the year progresses. As Kelly noted, "It's one game out of 162."
 
INSIDE PITCH
 GEORGE STEINBRENNER walked on the field before the game to speak with players and was almost beaned by DON MATTINGLY's batting-practice line drive to left field. He also happily congratulated the team in the clubhouse. . . . The Yankees have won seven of their last eight season openers. . . . JIMMY KEY, who was the ninth different opening-day starter for the Yankees in nine years, is now 4-0 with a 2.42 e.r.a. in first-game assignments.

HEADLINE: Tank Parts, Off the Shelf

 BODY:
As the Pentagon slims down to fit a much diminished threat, it won't be buying weapons at the same expansive rate. The resultant downsizing and consolidation in defense industries pose a tough puzzle for the Pentagon: how to preserve technological know-how and a skilled labor force against the possibility of resuming defense production.
The best answer is to try to turn defense and civilian producers into a single industrial base. That can't be done without a long-overdue reform of Pentagon procurement practices. 
 Consider the problem of tank production. The Army already has enough M1 Abrams tanks, the most capable in the world, in its inventory. Since the useful service life of a tank is about 30 years, and the oldest Abrams tank will be 15 in 1995, the Army won't have to begin replacing them until 2010 at the earliest.
One alternative, according to a Congressional Budget Office study, is a makework contract to produce 120 tanks a year, just to maintain the capacity to manufacture new tanks in 2010. But that costs a lot -- $3.8 billion from 1994 to 1998 -- and the Army doesn't need the tanks. Moreover, the tank of the future may have a ceramic engine and stealth technology that current plants can't make.
Another option is to upgrade older M1 models, turning them into M1-A2's. Congress has gotten the Army to begin doing that. But that, too, is expensive -- at least $2.2 billion for just the next five years.
The most sensible option is to mothball key production facilities -- at a five-year cost of just $200 million. Restarting the plants and getting them up to full speed would take six years and $1 billion. If the Red Army should somehow revive in the meantime, older but still serviceable M-60 tanks can be taken out of mothballs.
What about the 18,000 suppliers of tank parts? Many can convert to civilian production. But conversion is a partial answer at best. Defense contractors, long accustomed to meeting the requirements of a single customer, the Pentagon, are often ill prepared to satisfy consumer demand. And they can't always find compatible products that would allow them to shift back to tank-making.
What's needed is a more thoroughgoing reform of defense acquisition. Instead of designing tank parts to its own specifications, the Pentagon could purchase them just like any private company. Students of the problem now believe that could even improve the quality of weapons. In the fast-moving world of computer chips central to the operation of many weapons, for example, off-the-shelf technology is often more advanced and reliable than the chips produced to Pentagon specifications. By the time those specifications have been drawn up and met, superior chips may be on the market.
The shift to more purchasing of commercially available components would make it unnecessary to maintain much of a separate defense industrial base. It would also generate enormous savings. Some $50 billion a year goes to overhead -- to pay Pentagon and industry bureaucrats and accountants who draw up the specifications and do the paperwork to police them. That's about 40 percent of the total acquisition budget, and it could rise to 70 percent if steps to deregulate defense purchasing are not taken soon.
The Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology and Government has urged such a change. Its chairman, William Perry, now Deputy Secretary of Defense, is in a position to get on with the job.

HEADLINE: Now It's Bill Clinton's Package

 BODY:
Stepping out from the large foreign policy shadow of his predecessor, President Clinton now assumes the risks, and courts the dividends, of embracing a Russian leader who's in deep political trouble at home. It's the right move -- an unstinting bid to encourage the best possible outcome, even while beginning to hedge against the worst.
"From here on in," Boris Yeltsin declared at the closing press conference in Vancouver Sunday, it's going to be called "Bill Clinton's economic package." Russia's first democratic politician appreciated the large political bet Mr. Clinton had just placed on him and on the future of Russian reform. 
 Support from Washington and other Western capitals can improve Mr. Yeltsin's prospects only at the margin. But with Russia's opposing forces closely balanced as the April 25 referendum nears, the margin may matter mightily. Mr. Clinton is right to mobilize all the Western support he can.
The $1.6 billion package announced Sunday is the first of two installments expected from Washington. The second will consist of new Congressional appropriations and, probably, changes in cold-war laws restricting Russian trade. A far larger, multinational effort will be unveiled when foreign and finance ministers from the world's richest nations meet in Tokyo next week.
Bill Clinton's package is meant to help Mr. Yeltsin, but is designed in a way that could nurture elements of reform even if the reformist Russian President should fall. Mr. Clinton has prudently begun unbundling three separate American interests -- markets, democracy and denuclearization.
Previous aid packages made the transfer of funds largely contingent on economic reform. Money that might have helped woo key constituencies, like the military, unintentionally became hostage to obstructions by anti-reform elements in Parliament. As a result, much of the aid pledged by the Bush Administration and other Western governments still remains undelivered. And much of what was delivered was not spent in ways ordinary Russians could appreciate.
Mr. Clinton made a virtue of these past delays. His first installment is entirely based on already appropriated money, allowing speedy disbursement. He has also channeled this money in politically conspicuous ways, for example into housing and training for demobilized military personnel, medical supplies for hospitals and food for needy mothers and children. Washington will also try to speed up spending under the Nunn-Lugar Act to help dismantle nuclear weapons.
Mr. Yeltsin's survival is the best assurance of America's interests. His enemies in Parliament have already made plain they would recklessly expand the money supply, purge reformist ministers and retain the Soviet-era Constitution.
In foreign policy, they would at a minimum press a more nationalist agenda, raising tensions with Ukraine, Georgia and the Baltic countries and chilling cooperation with the U.S. on issues from Bosnia to the Middle East. At worst they might drag their feet on arms control, raising global tensions and diverting some American resources from economic construction back into defense.
Even in the worst case, of course, no one expects cold-war adventurism, five-year plans or Stalinist repression to return. Some elements of reform would probably survive, and probably warrant American encouragement. Still, Bill Clinton's package recognizes Mr. Yeltsin's special virtues -- even as it acknowledges America's continuing interests should he fall.

HEADLINE: How One National Health System Collapsed;
Rationing's No Panacea

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Readers of "Those Who Pay Health Costs Think About Drawing Lines" (The Week in Review, March 28) will get the impression that rationing medical care is a realistic health policy option. It is not. "Rationing" is a buzzword, a provocative idea -- not a realistic or workable proposal.
Rationing would not save money without a fixed budgetary limit on total spending for health. Otherwise, any saving from a prohibition on the use of a particular technology would easily be offset by increased use of other technologies that were not prohibited. Furthermore, there are almost always cases in which a proscribed procedure would be unequivocally helpful and cost-effective, although it might be only marginally helpful in most other cases. 
 Even in capped health-care systems like Britain's, there is no absolute prohibition on the use of technologies that might be medically helpful.
We need to reform our health-care system first, capping total costs and eliminating the perverse incentives and dysfunctional structural features that produce excessive overhead costs and profligate use of medical resources. It would then remain to be seen whether or not such reform would significantly slow the rate of medical cost inflation or simply produce a onetime saving. Despite claims to the contrary, no one really knows.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Clinton's Health-Care Plan: A Push to Sell Peace of Mind

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's new health-care policy is still in development, but the packaging has already begun.
So far, the drive for health-care reform has been a discussion among policy makers, conducted in an arcane and highly theoretical language of "managed competition" and "global budgets." But sometime in May the plan will go public, and the President Clinton's political advisers are now deep in the world of focus groups and polling data, preparing for the day. 
 The strategic imperative, these advisers argue, is clear: This must be seen as a plan that helps the middle class, an important new benefit program that is as broad-based and significant as Social Security. Like Social Security, it will be presented as a plan that brings working Americans a fundamental peace of mind: They will never again have to worry about losing their health insurance.
"The primary sales pitch has to be, 'This is real insurance, unlike what you have now,' " said one political aide to the President, who like many interviewed spoke on condition that he not be identified. "The whole purpose of insurance is selling peace of mind. And there is no peace of mind with a policy you can lose when you lose your job, or get kicked off of when you get sick."
This theme will cover what are expected to be some of the important elements of the plan: some forms of cost control, a basic benefits package that is guaranteed all Americans, the portability of health insurance from one job to another and the coverage of 37 million Americans now uninsured.
 
Risks of Status Quo
 As the adviser suggests, the coming campaign will highlight the risks of the status quo, costs spiraling out of control and huge holes in the system. According to those close to the planning, Clinton advisers have found in their focus groups (representative groups of voters chosen to test policies, issues and themes) that people are already intensely aware of the strains in their coverage.
They know, for example, how their deductible has changed in recent years and have kept track of their out-of-pocket costs for health care. They talk about running into uninsured people in emergency rooms who have conditions that could have been headed off with primary care. The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, taken last week, found that nearly 6 in 10 of those earning $30,000 to $50,000 a year had some experience in their household with cutbacks in health benefits in recent years.
"They know how bad the devil they know is," said James Carville, a Clinton strategist now working on health care. "And it appears to me they're willing to take a chance on the devil they don't."
 
Fears to Be Confronted
 In short, the Clinton team once again seems to be preparing to depict a simple struggle between change and the status quo with a simple question: "Which side are you on?"
Still, most advisers acknowledge, they have to confront the fears people have about restructuring the system: fears of waits for medical care, rationing, limits on the right to choose one's own physician and job losses resulting from a requirement that small businesses provide insurance to their workers, an issue that is considered something of a sleeper.
"No matter what our plan is," one White House official said, "the status quo types will say we're advocating government interference, that health care could be rationed, that we're going to deny people their choice of doctor, and that the quality of health care is going to suffer."
The doctor-patient relationship is clearly an area of some sensitivity. Stan Greenberg, the President's poll taker, now under contract to the Democratic National Committee, declined to discuss the findings of his focus groups but offered a hint of the argument to come. "Our goal is to maintain the essential relationship between patients and doctors," Mr. Greenberg said, "to in fact unfetter it from the red tape and all the things that have kept doctors and nurses from focusing on care."
 
Checking With the Doctor
 Another aide, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said he was wary of "doctor-bashing," despite the medical profession's image problems. This aide says that people will turn for advice to their own doctors.
The most recent New York Times/ CBS News Poll found that most people did have a doctor whom they considered their own; this was particularly true among the elderly, nearly 90 percent of whom felt connected with one or more physician. Most people polled drew a clear distinction between doctors as a group and the doctor they knew.
One of the most difficult parts of the White House campaign may be the taxes necessary to pay for the health-care program. With the basic decisions on financing not yet made, strategists said it was hard to talk about the politics of it. But the President's aides are clearly leaning toward "sin taxes," particularly on cigarettes, although that may be only the most politically palatable parts of the financing solution.
Like the taxes in the budget plan, these costs will be presented as fairly shared for the greater good. This is shaping up as another exercise in middle-class populism. But this campaign will make the effort around the budget plan look modest, say many close to the planning.
 
A New Vocabulary
 The public education job it will require, they say, is stunning. People have a frame of reference for talk of deficits, spending cuts and stimulus measures; the health-care package will bring a new vocabulary, as well as new entities like regional health-insurance purchasing cooperatives.
Already, one Democrat close to the planning predicted that the phrase "managed competition," describing the blend of market forces and government regulation that the White House endorses, may go. "It ain't exactly, 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,' " Mr. Carville said.
Another aide said: "This is going to call on all of Clinton's skills, as a teacher, a communicator, a talk-show host. You'll see lots of town hall meetings, lots of long-format media. If a network will give us an hour, two hours, to explain this thing in detail, we'll take it."
The advisers are talking about an intensive round of appearances by President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton and members of the Cabinet. They are talking about television time, long and short, and a vast distribution of videotapes about the plan. The Democratic National Committee will coordinate a grass-roots effort on behalf of the plan, aware that the struggle over health care will be waged largely Congressional district by Congressional district.
Each of those districts has its own hospitals and doctors, extremely attentive audiences for the health-care plan, with opinions of great detail. "The Texas Medical Center is in my district, and it's the No. 1 employer in Houston," said Representative Mike Andrews, a Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. "I'll bet if you went around the country to different cities, you'd find health care a big economic engine."
 
Who Are the Villains?
 The grass-roots campaign is expected to build on the work of advocacy groups like Families U.S.A. One Democrat close to the planning said the effort could range from door-knocking to petition drives, from call-ins to members of Congress to the formation of electronic speaker bureaus that will carry the Clinton plan to local television and radio shows.
The villains, in the Clinton script, may once again be those interest groups that howl against one part of the plan or another. As was the case with the Clinton budget plan, opponents will likely be cast as special interests. "Every attack that comes to this plan, they'll say, 'Let's consider the source,' " said one political adviser. Drug companies were the earliest target.
"It's easy to demagogue the issue," said Michael Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems, which represents for-profit hospitals. "If their strategy is going to be that anyone who opposes part of the bill is a special interest, we've got to be ready to have a public debate back home."

HEADLINE: RUSSIANS INVITED TO HELP IN DESIGN OF SPACE STATION

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Seeking to cut the costs of the nation's most expensive space project, the White House has ordered NASA to work with the Russians in designing a smaller and cheaper space station. The move could bring to a decisive end decades of cold war rivalry and signal a new era of cooperation in space.
In announcing the cooperative plan yesterday, NASA disclosed that the Clinton Administration had told the agency to cut the price tag for building the station by as much as two-thirds. 
 The Russians have previously suggested several cooperative ventures and are expected to welcome this overture warmly. NASA experts say the contribution by Russia to the effort may include use of its 20-story Energia rocket, the world's most powerful, to put the station into orbit, instead of the nation's fleet of space shuttles. The shuttle fleet has recently been grounded by technical glitches, among them an aborted launching yesterday.
 
Merging the Stations?
 Also under consideration is the physical merger in space of a new Russian station with the planned American one, the joint outpost housing up to nine astronauts.
"With the end of the cold war this kind of cooperation is inevitable," said John E. Pike, head of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington. "The only way to get a low-cost station is to build it with the Russians."
The cooperative plan could serve several purposes for Mr. Clinton. By continuing the space station he keeps contractors happy, by involving the Russians he lends support to the troubled presidency of Boris N. Yeltsin, and by trimming the space station budget he may reduce the Federal deficit.
 
Secrecy in Redesign
 In February, Mr. Clinton ordered a redesign of the 350-foot-long Space Station Freedom, saying its $31 billion cost was too high given the nation's economic woes. Since then, the redesign effort have been vague and at times wrapped in secrecy.
In a statement yesterday, NASA said that Dr. John H. Gibbons, the White House science adviser, told the agency's station-redesign panel on Saturday that the United States and its partners in the station -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- had decided to give "full consideration" to use of Russian hardware in the revamped station. The hardware, he said, would include the Russians' Mir space station "and other Russian systems and technology." He did not spell out the other technologies, although NASA recently studied the Energia rocket.
To expedite the possible use of Russian hardware, Dr. Gibbons said, the Russians themselves will be asked to take part in the redesign effort.
The NASA Administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, said yesterday in the statement that Russian participation will be coordinated by the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Dr. Roald Z. Sagdeev, an Russian scientist now living part time in the United States.
Vladimir Derbenev, a spokesman at the Russian Embassy in Washington, applauded the announcement.
"Our general feeling is that the more Russia is involved in this project the better," he said in an interview.
Space News, a weekly industry newspaper, said Monday that high Russian officials, in a March 16 letter to the NASA Administrator, detailed a plan for a cooperative space station that would house three astronauts by 1997 and nine astronauts by the year 2000. Under that plan Russia would merge an upgraded Mir station with the outpost planned by the United States.
The newspaper added that the plan had won serious consideration from the Federal Government and prompted it to ask the international partners in space station Freedom to endorse Russian participation in the outpost's redesign. It also reported that some partners, especially Japan, were cool to the request for Russian participation.
The reaction within NASA could be similar. Some officials at the agency favor autonomy, but others feel that in a time of budget constraints that a partnership with old rivals is necessary for the survival of the project.
 
3 Options for Station
 Again quoting Dr. Gibbons of the White House, NASA spelled out the revamped station's budgetary goals, saying that three financial options in the redesign process were being weighed for 1994 to 1998. The low option is $5 billion, the middle option is $7 billion and the high option is $9 billion for the five-year period, Dr. Gibbons was quoted as saying.
Sarah Keegan, a NASA spokeswoman, said in an interview that a comparative figure for the defunct space station Freedom was $14.6 billion. The low option, therefore, if adopted, would slice away about two-thirds of the previously budget.
The final recommendations of the space-station redesign panel are to go to the White House by June. The 50-person panel is headed by Dr. Joseph F. Shea, a NASA official.
The low option of $5 billion over the five-year construction period would be far less than the $8 billion already spent on station design studies and the fabrication of prototype hardware. The station project was begun by President Ronald Reagan in 1984.
Space Station Freedom would have been carried piecemeal on 18 or so shuttle flights, at a cost of about $1 billion each, adding a large hidden cost to the outpost's advertised $31 billion price.
In contrast, NASA experts calculate that huge Energia rockets, for about $500 million each, could place a similar station in four or five flights, sharply cutting the overall cost.
Last month, Dr. Gibbons, the White House science adviser, explained the need for a outpost redesign by comparing the space station Freedom to an insatiable gnome in an electronic arcade game.
"It was going to eat everything that NASA had," he said, referring to the program's budgetary appetite.

HEADLINE: Drop Seen in Old-Age Disability, Challenging Idea of Fading Health

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
The common assumption that old age in America brings with it unremitting deterioration is being challenged by a new study that shows disability rates among the elderly decreasing during the 1980's.
Findings by three Duke University researchers, Kenneth G. Manton, Larry S. Corder and Eric Stallard, being published in the forthcoming issue of the Journal of Gerontology, have generated a whirlwind of discussion. Demographers were taken aback by the extent to which the disability rates had shifted. 
 While many researchers said they were waiting to see Dr. Manton's work duplicated by other demographers, they also said that the shift made sense, particularly in light of the increase in commonplace surgical techniques -- like cataract removal and joint replacement -- that allow disabled older people to resume the normal activities of daily life.
 
Education Is Factor
 Another factor in the decline in disability rates may be the higher educational levels of those now entering retirement. Several studies, including those by a University of Pennsylvania sociologist, Samuel Preston, have found that higher levels of education go hand in hand with higher incomes, which are associated with better nutrition and health care.
"Education has lifelong implications, from having access to medical care to likelihood that you will take good care of yourself throughout your life," said Cynthia Taeuber, a demographer specializing in the elderly for the Federal Census Bureau.
Eileen Crimmins, a professor of gerontology at the University of Southern California, said that while it would be important to replicate Dr. Manton's findings a belief was emerging that the idea of old age as a time of steady deterioration should be replaced by the notion that the health of old people, like that of young people, goes through phases, for better or worse.
"Now, more and more people believe there's an ongoing change in both directions," she said. "Sometimes people get better, sometimes worse. Some things can get better while others get worse."
 
Effect on Policy Questions
 The Manton study showed that, while the population of those past their 65th birthday increased by 14.7 percent from 1982 to 1989 -- to 30.9 million from 26.9 million -- the chronically disabled elderly population increased by just 9.2 percent.
Over all, the proportion of the elderly population reporting no disabilities rose from 76.3 percent in 1982 to 77.4 percent in 1989.
The new findings, which have been circulated in academic forums for more than a year, have obvious relevance to the discussions under way in President Clinton's Task Force on National Health Care Reform, several experts said.
"Manton's research findings are quite germane to the question of how many Americans will need long-term care in the future," said Alan Garber, an associate professor of medicine and economics at Stanford University.
Until recently, he said, it was standard to assume that elderly people whose life was prolonged by medical intervention would live longer but that the extra time would mostly be spent in a disabled and dependent state.
Dr. Garber and others say Dr. Manton's study modified that thinking somewhat. As baby boomers age, Dr. Garber said, "no matter what, we'll need more long-term care." But lower disability among the elderly may slow the increase in demand for costly nursing home care.
A companion study by the Duke researchers, just published in the journal Gerontology, shows that the number of elderly people requiring personal assistance declined by 10 percent from 1982 to 1989, even as the number of elderly was increasing. At the same time, the number of people using mechanical aids but living independently, without personal assistance, increased by 5 percent.
Richard Suzman, director of demographic studies at the National Institute of Aging, said in an interview that "the general consensus" among gerontologists once held that increased life expectancy would mean that an individual could expect that a longer fraction of the years after retirement would be spent dependent on someone else for basic needs like taking a bath, getting dressed or going to the toilet.
The extent of an older person's disability is usually gauged by measuring how many such tasks a person can manage independently. The new findings, which are based on raw data from Dr. Suzman's National Long-Term Care Survey, are particularly surprising, he said, because "we find that the improvement in health seems to be greatest for those 75 and over and as great at 85 and over as it is 75 and over." He added, "This is a big change in terms of expectations."
Dr. Manton cautioned that his findings did not change the underlying facts about aging or mean that future elderly populations can expect to be as healthy, on average, as their children or grandchildren. "We've not talking about all these people jumping up and running 100-yard dashes," he said.
 
Trend Is Unclear
 But he said the study indicated a substantial possibility for increasing older people's activity.
"For a lot of people with problems primarily related to joints, vision or sensory function, you could have biomedical intervention or nutrition therapy and have a larger potential for improvement," Dr. Manton said.
Dr. Suzman said it was impossible to say whether the decline in disability rates would be an enduring trend.
"We won't know till be get more data. There were three points in time in this study," he said, referring to the survey dates -- 1982, 1984 and 1989. "The effect seems to be stronger in the 1984-to-1989 period."
The most important part of the study, Dr. Suzman said, was the suggestion that disability was not an inevitable part of aging, and that it might be possible to find a way to slow or prevent such loss of function.
"If we can get our hands on those, you've got a much better chance of affecting the future course of the demography of the older population, in terms of its functional capacity," he said. "It means that demography ain't necessarily destiny."

HEADLINE: U.S. Urges Radon Curbs in New Houses

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency today proposed voluntary guidelines calling on builders to install protective measures in hundreds of thousands of new houses in more than a third of the country to prevent radon, an invisible and odorless radioactive gas, from seeping in.
The E.P.A. also published a new information pamphlet warning people of radon's potential to cause lung cancer and urging buyers to require sellers to test houses for radon, just as they are for termite damage, before a sale can be completed. 
 The agency said today that it regarded radon as being among the most serious environmental threats to public health, accounting for 7,000 to 30,000 cases of lung cancer each year in the United States. But that view has been disputed by a growing number of scientists, some of whom said today that the money the agency expected the public to pay for reducing radon in houses was out of proportion to the risk posed by the gas.
The agency said the construction standards were voluntary and subject to change after a public-comment period of 60 days. Agency officials said that if the standards were put into effect, they would urge states and local governments to write them into law and building codes.
 
Costs Estimates Vary
 The agency said that some of the standards were already included in local building codes and the cost of putting them into effect would be less than $100 million. But some agency economists and builders said the cost of new construction standards and testing requirements for radon could be as much as $1 billion to $2 billion a year nationwide.
Testing for radon in a house costs $15 to $50, and taking steps to remove radon in existing homes by venting the gas outside the houses can cost up to $3,000, building contractors said today. Installing measures to prevent radon in new homes can cost $500 to $1,000, builders said.
Taken together, the actions represent a new and politically risky step by the E.P.A. to expand its authority to protect people from a potential environmental hazard in their homes. In the agency's 23-year history, most of its efforts to reduce environmental threats to health have focused on limiting or eliminating pollution from industry, automobiles, sewage treatment plants and toxic-waste sites.
 
Data Seen as Clear
 Much of the $140 billion spent on environmental protection in the United States each year is borne directly by industry or indirectly by taxpayers. By proposing the radon guidelines, the E.P.A. is asking homeowners to bear the cost of protection, thus exposing the agency to much more widespread pressure from the public to defend its position that radon is a serious danger.
An agency spokesman said Carol M. Browner, the E.P.A. Administrator, was briefed about the agency's action today and raised no objections. Ms. Browner was unavailable for comment today because of an illness.
Stephen D. Page, the director of the agency's radon division said that the scientific data on which the action today was based clearly indicated that radon in homes was a threat. Those data are largely an accumulation of studies conducted on miners who developed lung cancer at far higher rates after being exposed to concentrations of radon 50 to 100 times higher than people were exposed to in their houses.
"Radon has been identified by the Surgeon General and other national and international health organizations as a serious environmental health threat," Mr. Page said. "And this is a threat that people can do something about, unlike a lot of other environmental problems. People can take action in their own homes to prevent the problem."
 
Questions About Risk
 But scientists inside and outside the Government question the risk from radon in houses. Dr. Jan A. Stolwijk, a professor of epidemiology and public health at Yale University, said that the low levels of radon that people are normally exposed to in their homes do not pose an exceptional risk of lung cancer, particularly for people who do not smoke. And for those who smoke, he said, exposure to low levels of radon is a minor factor in their already high chances of developing lung cancer resulting from smoking.
"If I'm worrying about lung cancer, I have a much better way of clearly lowering my risk than spending a lot of money preventing radon from entering homes," said Dr. Stolwijk in an interview today. "And that is to stop smoking. If the E.P.A. wants to wipe out lung cancer, they would be much more effective if they banned cigarettes."
Some scientists said today that the differences of opinion between the agency and independent researchers may make the radon issue a test case for a new approach to environmental policy urged by such outsiders. The new approach would weigh the theoretical potential for health damage against the economic and social costs for eliminating the threat.
"We have more data about the effects of radon than just about any other carcinogen that we know about," said Dr. Jonathan M. Samet, a professor of medicine and a radiation health specialist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. "We know how many people might die at which level of exposure. What we lack is the decision-making mechanism to decide at what level of risk we're comfortable and how much we should pay for it."
In Washington, Charles Field, a vice president of the National Association of Home Builders, which represents contractors who build more than one million new houses a year, said that he had not studied the guidelines but that they appeared to be reasonable.
But outside Washington, several builders said they were concerned.
"We already can't build houses at an affordable price so that the people who build them, the carpenters, can buy them," said Eugene Graf, a home builder in Bozeman, Mont.
Under the authority of a radon protection law passed by Congress in 1988, the E.P.A. has been expanding its efforts to reduce Americans' exposure to the radioactive gas, which is produced from the decay of uranium in soil. Because the law gives the agency's radon division only the authority to advise the public and not to issue regulations, a fifth of the division's $17 million budget is devoted to education materials.
Since 1988, the Government has advised all homeowners to test for radon, but several surveys have found that only 5 percent have done so.
Mr. Page, the radon division director, said the new standards for construction were aimed at the 1,000 or so counties across the country that are believed to have the highest potential for radon to seep into houses. Those counties are primarily in New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the upper Midwest and through the northern Rocky Mountains.

HEADLINE: Fear Gives Los Angeles Race an Edge

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 6

 BODY:
Two weeks before Angelenos vote for a new mayor, an extraordinary possibility is emerging: the leading candidate in this heavily Democratic and liberal city is a New York-born Republican who vows to put more police officers on the streets, trim the rest of local government and turn over many city services to private enterprise.
He is Richard Riordan, a 62-year-old lawyer, self-made millionaire, philanthropist and long-time power broker here who has never held public office. Mr. Riordan, who lives alone in a book-cluttered mansion in the exclusive Brentwood section, says he wants the job because "all my life I've been a rescuer." 
 Though he avoids any racial overtones in his campaign, the hard-charging Mr. Riordan has benefited from the fear that is sweeping the city as two racially charged trials converge: the expected conclusion this week of a Federal trial of four police officers in the Rodney G. King beating and the beginning, on Monday, of a trial of three black men in the beating a white trucker last year.
The beating of the trucker occurred in rioting that followed the acquittal of the officers on state charges in the King beating. It is widely believed that renewed violence could strengthen Mr. Riordan, whose motto is "Tough Enough to Turn L.A. Around."
With a campaign financed by $3 million of his own money, earned primarily through investments, Mr. Riordan has flooded the city with advertisements and slick mailings. And while there are no public opinion polls yet to document the prediction, his opponents agree he is almost certain to come in at least second, possibly first, in a field of 24 candidates in the April 20 election.
 
Largely White Electorate
 His most likely opponent in a June 8 runoff is Michael Woo, a 41-year-old City Councilman who is a Los Angeles native. Mr. Woo is a liberal Democrat and as a Chinese-American is representative of the multi-ethnic melange that is Los Angeles today.
In such a runoff, Mr. Riordan would face an uphill but not impossible fight. Though Los Angeles is overwhelmingly Democratic and two-thirds of its residents are black, Hispanic and or other minorities, the electorate is still two-thirds white, concentrated in the San Fernando Valley and the West Side, where even liberals are arming themselves against possible racial disorders, and where the recession has hit hard.
"I am stunned by the possibility in this day and age that the next mayor may be another white male establishment figure, and a Republican, in a minority-majority city," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the Claremont Graduate School in suburban Pomona. "But the arithmetic is such that it cannot be ruled out. If the turnout is low, the voters more likely to turn out are the Riordan voters."
If Mr. Riordan wins, it would mean the final dissolution of the powerful but frayed alliance among blacks, Jews and downtown business interests that kept Mayor Tom Bradley in office for 20 years.
 
Other Candidates
 None of the other candidates has caught on yet. Among them are Assemblyman Richard Katz from the San Fernando Valley, who portrays himself as a Democrat tough on crime; Nick Patsaouras, a businessman and Transportation Commissioner whose plan to revive the city is heavily based on broadening public transit; Joel Wachs, a City Councilman from the San Fernando Valley with strong backing from the arts community, and Linda Griego, a businesswoman and former Deputy Mayor who has gotten financial support from women's groups.
"This is a classic example of money being the mother's milk of politics," said Jay Severin, Mr. Wachs's campaign consultant. "Riordan's doing all the right things. It's very tough to compete with him."
Though the election is technically nonpartisan, Mr. Riordan is the only Republican in the field. His strategy is to make the runoff by consolidating the 29.8 percent of voters who have registered as Republican, then seek to broaden his appeal later. The literature he sends to Republican households stresses his ties to Republicans like Ronald Reagan. His latest television commercial uses the word "tough" six times in 30 seconds.
And though he promises to "kick out the politicians who have led us into decline," Mr. Riordan has long been a major contributor to most of California's leading politicians, including Mayor Bradley, a Democrat, and Gov. Pete Wilson, Republican.
A Roman Catholic, he says he supports a woman's right to choose an abortion, but he gives to anti-abortion groups.
A major plank in Mr. Riordan's platform is to put 3,000 more police officers on the streets without raising taxes. He proposes paying for them by renting out Los Angeles International Airport to private operators rather than have the city run it.
 
A Neighborhood Campaign
 His appeal was apparent at a picnic lunch for volunteers Saturday afternoon in a park in the Westwood area. The nearly all-white crowd voiced approval as he outlined his plans to fight graffiti and crime, to break up the Los Angeles Unified School District and to fight illegal immigration. "We have to put tremendous pressure on the Federal Government to keep illegal aliens out of this country," he said.
Among the volunteers were Janice and Roland Behny, residents of the Hancock Park neighborhood, a mostly white area near downtown. "We've had people murdered in front of our house," said Mr. Behny, a sales manager for a publishing company. "The savages are taking over the city."
Then Mr. Riordan went knocking on doors on an street of neatly manicured $1 million homes in Westwood, visiting mostly Republican households, where there was palpable fear of crime.
But in an interview, Mr. Riordan said he did not pander to racial fears, and pointed out that he had donated thousands of dollars to set up educational programs for minority youngsters and was the only white member of a leadership group called 100 Black Men.
 
Bundle on Contradictions
 Crime, he said, is not the exclusive concern of affluent whites. "It's intolerable that a mother has to tell her child in South-Central Los Angeles to duck behind cars when there is shooting," he said. "The issues throughout the city are the same."
A bundle of energy and contradictions, Mr. Riordan has bought his way into Los Angeles politics with a combination of charm, determination and money. After graduating from Princeton University and the University of Michigan Law School, he came here in 1956 to join a law firm. Through investments, he turned a moderate inheritance into a fortune estimated at more than $100 million.
He became a venture capitalist, engaging in restructuring insolvent companies and in leveraged buyouts financed by junk bonds issued by his friend Michael Milken, recently released from prison after serving a term violating securities law.
In an interview, Mr. Riordan, who is divorced from his first wife and separated from his second, said he wanted the job because, "I care." He vows to work for $1 a year as Mayor.
"All my life I've been a rescuer," he said. "There is a vacuum of leadership. I am going to fill it."
But even Mr. Riordan's admirers wonder what kind of mayor he would make. "He gets things done by cutting through red tape" said Mary Nichols, who served with him on the city's Recreation and Parks Commission. "But within city government, there is a tremendous amount of detail. I'm not sure if he would not get bored with it pretty fast."

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Tougher Sanctions on Yugoslavia

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 6

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is seeking United Nations Security Council approval for three additional sanctions against the Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro to further tighten the economic embargo imposed last year.
It has suggested imposing a maritime exclusion zone along the Adriatic coast of Yugoslavia as part of its drive to strengthen the new and tighter trade embargo the Security Council is expected to approve next Monday. The vote comes after Bosnian Serbs rejected the international plan for ending the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina last week. 
 Such an exclusion zone, which diplomats say could be enforced by NATO warships, means civilian cargo vessels would be banned from Yugoslavia's 12-mile-wide territorial waters in order to strengthen the economic embargo imposed last spring. This embargo has proved decidedly leaky so far, though the European Community and the United States are both now helping neighboring countries police it more effectively.
The United States has also suggested eliminating a proposed 15-day grace period before the new sanctions take effect so that they would come into force as soon as the Security Council approves them. It also wants to extend a proposed freeze on all of Yugoslavia's overseas financial assets to include buildings and land.
The Security Council agreed on Monday to postpone until next Monday a vote on a resolution tightening the economic embargo on Yugoslavia. The embargo was imposed last year to prevent the Serbian Government of President Slobodan Milosevic from assisting Bosnian Serbs in their fight against Croats and Muslims. The decision to delay the vote was apparently taken as a result of the Vancouver summit meeting last weekend between President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. But the United States also said it needed more time to seek ways of tightening the proposed new sanctions even further.
After the Serbian parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina voted last Friday to reject the peace plan drawn up by the international mediators, Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen, and accepted by Muslims and Croats, the Security Council started discussing moves to reinforce its existing blockade against the Yugoslav federation. Earlier, the Council had voted to authorize NATO warplanes to enforce its ban on all flights over Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although the move has little military significance, it is resented by the Serbs as a sign of the Council's determination to press them harder to make peace.
The existing draft resolution, prepared before the United States offered its latest proposals, bans all shipments of goods across Yugoslavia to other destinations, tightens restrictions on the movement of ships along the Danube River, freezes Yugoslav financial assets overseas, impounds Yugoslav ships, planes, trucks and rolling stock outside the country, and reduces the number of border crossing points into Yugoslavia.
The aim is to sharply increase economic pressure on Yugoslavia, where inflation is running at hundreds of percentage points a month, and thereby force President Milosevic to use his influence with Bosnian Serbs to make them sign the Vance-Owen peace initiative.
In Washington today, Mr. Clinton called the war in the Balkans "the most difficult, most frustrating problem in the world." But he ruled out any unilateral action by the United States, saying that, in coordination with the United Nations, there are "lots of other things we can do to make life more uncomfortable for the Serbs and I wouldn't rule those out."
However, the prospect of an even tighter blockade of Yugoslavia is causing growing political and economic difficulties for several countries, including some that are members of the Security Council. It is embarrassing for President Yeltsin at a time when he is locked in a domestic power struggle with hard-line nationalists who are sympathetic to the Serbs. The parliament has already adopted one nonbinding resolution asking the Government not to impose new sanctions on Yugoslavia.

HEADLINE: Administration Calls the Principal Medicare Trust Fund Troubled

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration warned today that the principal trust fund for Medicare, which finances hospital care for 35 million elderly and disabled people, would run out of money in 1999 if Congress does not act.
The report by the Medicare trustees underlines a problem facing the Administration. President Clinton is drafting an ambitious proposal to overhaul the nation's health-care system and guarantee coverage for all Americans, at an estimated cost of $30 billion to $90 billion a year. Administration officials have said they want to expand coverage of long-term care and begin covering the costs of prescription drugs. 
 But, as the trustees reported today, the Government does not have the means to pay for the health-care commitments it has already made.
The financial condition of Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund has deteriorated since April of last year, when Government actuaries predicted that it would be exhausted in the year 2002.
 
Fund Is Called 'Unsustainable'Troubled
 The trustees said today that the Medicare hospital program was "unsustainable in its present form." They did not say how the Government could control Medicare costs or increase revenues to keep the program in operation.
In the past, Congress has invariably taken action to prevent depletion of the Medicare trust fund, by raising taxes or limiting payments to hospitals and other health-care providers. Lawmakers made clear today that they would not let the program go broke.
To worry that the trust fund will run out of money is "like worrying that Mexico is going to invade us," said Representative Pete Stark, chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. "It's a possibility, but they've shown no indication."
But one trustee, Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said: "These new estimates show a significant worsening in the economic health of the Medicare program. They reflect many of the problems that we see across the board in our health-care system today, and they are another demonstration of the need for systemwide change."
A major goal of Mr. Clinton's overall health-care plan is to control medical costs. In the last decade, Medicare has adopted fee schedules for hospitals and doctors to slow the growth of Medicare spending, and by most accounts these measures have been effective. But Medicare outlays continue to rise for many reasons, including an increase in the number of beneficiaries, a general increase in the amount of care each beneficiary receives and greater use of costly technology.
 
Action Urged Now
 Three of the five trustees are Cabinet officers. The others are not Government employees and are supposed to represent the public interest. The public trustees urged Congress to "address the need for fundamental reform" of Medicare as part of its effort to revamp the health-care system. But they did not make detailed proposals.
In an interview, Stanford G. Ross, one of the public trustees, said: "We want Medicare considered as part of President Clinton's health-care reform initiative. We don't want it postponed to a later stage."
In a separate report, the Administration said that one of the Social Security trust funds, which pays retirement and survivor benefits, would be in sound financial condition for about 50 years. But it said that another Social Security trust fund, which pays disability benefits, would run out of money in two years.
To deal with this problem, the Administration suggested reallocating payroll taxes so that some of the money earmarked for retirement benefits would be deposited in the disability trust fund. Congress would need to pass legislation to make such a change. But there is no need to increase the overall Social Security tax rate, and the reallocation of money would not cause immediate damage to the retirees' trust fund, the trustees said.
Under current law, the employer and the employee each pay a payroll tax of 5.6 percent for old-age and survivors insurance and 0.6 percent for disability insurance. The tax is applied to the first $57,600 of earnings. The trustees' proposal would change the tax rates to 5.325 percent and 0.875 percent, respectively. With this change, the trustees said, the retirement fund would run out of money in the year 2037, seven years earlier than expected under current law.
Analyzing the future of Medicare, the trustees observed that there are now four workers for each Medicare beneficiary. By the middle of the next century, they said, the ratio will be 2 to 1. But, they warned, Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund will run out of money "even before the major demographic shift begins to occur."
 
Studies Say Payments Dropped
 Part B of Medicare, which pays for doctors' services, has its own trust fund. Beneficiaries pay premiums that cover about one-fourth of the cost. The Federal Government pays for the remainder each year with general revenues.
The trustees observed that outlays for this part of Medicare increased 60 percent in the last five years, to $50.8 billion last year, from $31.7 billion in 1987, and they said the growth "shows little sign of abating."
The trustees, besides Dr. Shalala and Mr. Ross, are Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and David M. Walker, an accountant.
Despite the growth in Medicare payments to doctors, two recent studies conclude that doctors actually got less in 1992 than they were entitled to receive under the new Medicare fee schedule.
The Physician Payment Review Commission, which advises Congress on payment of doctors under Medicare, said the Bush Administration miscalculated several factors used in paying doctors. The Government assumed that doctors who got lower Medicare payments would perform more services, partially offsetting the loss of income, and it assumed that doctors who got higher payments would perform the same number of services. In fact, the commission said, doctors getting higher payments performed fewer services, so the Government paid them less than it had expected.
Another study, by William C. Hsiao of Harvard University, concluded that "the current Medicare fee schedule yields too little net income to most physicians," in part because it does not adequately account for the doctors' expenses. Dr. Hsiao's study, published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine, was noteworthy because he was an architect of the Medicare fee schedule.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IS SEEKING JOBS PLAN ACCORD

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 6

 BODY:
Bruised by a battering from Congressional Republicans, President Clinton cast about today for a face-saving compromise to rescue his job-creating spending plan while trying to shame his opponents into retreat.
As Senators and Representatives on spring recess tested their constituents' reaction to the Republican filibuster that blocked passage of the $19.5 billion economic stimulus package, Mr. Clinton conceded he must now "address some of the legitimate expressed objections" to his plan. But the President also stepped up his efforts to paint Republicans as politicians who prize partisan victory more than the national interest. 
 "You know, we have a system in this country where people, all of whom have jobs, the minority of the senators who all have jobs, can literally thwart majority rule," Mr. Clinton said today at a news conference with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
But there seemed to be little evidence that the filibuster that has stymied the President is abating, even as Mr. Clinton continued his tough talk about the motives of the Republicans.
 
Democrats Are Worrying
 And some Democrats are worried that the President could sustain lasting political damage if the opposition party continues to prove that it can block his plans so early in his term.
White House advisers insisted that the Republicans have now overplayed their hand and will soon be overwhelmed by the communications skills of a President who can now turn his attention to selling his economic plan after weeks of focusing on foreign policy. They reject the notion accepted by Republicans, some Congressional Democrats and Ross Perot, the intractable independent commentator, that Americans are more concerned about the deficit than about jobs or Washington gridlock.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, did not leave the field of political counterattack to Mr. Clinton today. He issued a sharply worded statement while campaigning on behalf of Republican candidates in Ohio that accused the President of hiding behind accusations of gridlock.
"When the President talks about 'compromise,' " the statement read, "I hope he means we'll start paying for his spending programs, just as the American people are demanding."
 
Compromises in the Works
 Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, is assembling a compromise proposal that both sides expect will be a shrunken version of the President's package of public works projects and Federal programs, aides to both sides said. And Senator Dole is preparing his own version of a Republican alternative, which includes less spending as well as corresponding budget cuts.
Mr. Mitchell, who was traveling in Maine, said that whatever happened to the stimulus package should not be considered an omen about Mr. Clinton's future legislative initiatives.
"It is a total fiction by the so-called analysts and pundits in the press that how this is resolved will determine the actions of the Republicans to the President's program." he said in a telephone interview. "They're against the President's program."
But no one on either side of the continuing dispute would predict which effort could or would win enough votes to break off the filibuster when Congress returns.
"Everybody's banking on the notion that Republicans care as much as Democrats about breaking this gridlock," said Susan Brophy, a legislative affairs assistant to the President.
Some White House advisers conceded that Mr. Clinton's economic plan, which would also increase some taxes and cut some programs to reduce the deficit, had lost ground with the public. That view was supported by a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted last week. In that survey, 45 percent of the 1,368 people polled said the plan would help the nation, down from the 53 percent who said the same thing one month earlier.
In the same poll, the number of people who said they found the economic plan to be "fair to people like you" dropped from 59 percent last month to 48 percent this month.
"When they come back, we'll see whether they really care about putting people to work or whether this is all just political posturing to prove that a minority can paralyze the Federal Government," Mr. Clinton said of the Republicans. "It's just more gridlock, and I think that people will rebel against it."
The cost of the package is also a matter of semantic dispute. Democrats say, accurately, that it approves $16.3 billion in new spending. Republicans add, also correctly, that it allocates $3.2 billion more in road and airport spending previously authorized, but never taken out of special accounts fed by gasoline and air-travel taxes.
 
Recriminations in Senate
 One measure of the political anxiety now gripping the White House is that Senate Democrats have already begun muttering recriminations over the Administration's handling of the Republican offensive.
While the Senate Democrats lead the charge for a compromise, many have begun accusing the White House of a victor's arrogance as well as a misunderstanding of Senate politics.
"This is ominous for a lot of other things," said an aide to a prominent Senate Democrat. "If the Republicans are in a position this early in his term to take on a guy who's just been elected, after their own guy had been resoundingly rejected, that's not a good sign for when the tough votes come."

HEADLINE: Rising Yen Rings Alarms in Tokyo

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 6

 BODY:
For most of the last two months, the Japanese yen has been edging up in value to its strongest level of the postwar era, sending waves of anxiety through the Government and the business world.
The dollar fell to 113.40 yen at one point here on Friday, closing at 114. Some experts say it could plummet soon to 100 yen, less than half its value a decade ago. 
 On Monday, the dollar slipped to 113.70 in New York, its third consecutive postwar low. Today, the dollar recovered a bit, rising to 113.85 yen in New York. [Page D18.]
 
 
Fragile Recovery
 The dollar's steep drop has set off alarms here, with some experts arguing that the rising yen threatens the Japanese economy's fragile recovery and could undermine markets from Tokyo to Wall Street. But after a month of fretting, others are concluding that the stronger yen could ultimately prove an economic boon, giving Japanese consumers price breaks from cheaper imports they have long been denied.
Japan's soaring trade surplus and a sharp decline in the country's overseas investments are believed to be among the reasons for the yen's strength. The dollar has lost around 8 percent of its value against the yen this year, and that decline is already having a big impact on corporate policies.
The Toyota Motor Corporation is said to be preparing to slice some $700 million from its production costs in the next few months; the Sharp Corporation has said it will move all its personal computer production out of Japan to lower costs, and the Daiei Corporation, a leading retailer, has said that for the first time it will substitute less expensive imported suits from China for some Japanese-made suits.
The yen's rise comes as a harsh blow to Japanese exporters in particular, because Japanese goods are becoming more expensive for Americans and other foreigners. But it helps American companies, which is why the Clinton Administration has largely supported the movement.
 Less demand for Japanese goods is expected to force manufacturers to take stern measures to reduce their costs and to improve their efficiency, difficult steps at a time when profits have been battered by an economic slowdown. The Industrial Bank of Japan has estimated that the stronger yen could reduce economic growth as much as half a percentage point this year.
The uncertainty over exchange-rate movements also disrupts Japanese investment plans overseas. Some experts worry that the unease could encourage a flight of Japanese capital from America back to Japan. The value of American securities has already dropped sharply in terms of the yen, in many instances below what the investors paid for them.
 
'One Big Risk'
 "The one big risk is a chain reaction of fear if Japanese investors decide they have to get out of dollar assets," Richard Koo, a senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute, said. "At these exchange rates, all the dollar-denominated paper they own is under water, and there is already some inclination to sell now before the exchange rate gets worse. That could become scary."
Japanese Government officials had clearly supported the yen's appreciation at first for political reasons: the currency's rise is expected, over time, to reduce Japanese exports and increase imports, thus reducing the huge trade surplus, helping American exporters and improving relations with the trade hawks in the Clinton Administration, including President Clinton. But the speed of the yen's recent rise has been unnerving.
"The pace of the Japanese currency's rise is a little too fast," Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said last week.
Yoshiro Hayashi, the Finance Minister, said, "This is contrary to my basic belief that exchange rates should be stable and reflect economic fundamentals."
But among economists and business leaders, some anticipation is mixed with the anxiety. Initially, most of them believe, the yen will remain strong, causing pain for exporters. But in the longer term, the surging currency will strengthen Japanese industries, some economists argue.
"The exporters are definitely going to be hurting," said Robert Alan Feldman, an economist here with Salomon Brothers Asia. "But the effect on inflation is very positive. That will have a number of benefits."
For instance, the strong yen will help produce lower interest rates in Japan, along with lower inflation, Mr. Feldman said. It will also spur quicker action by the Government to stimulate the economy with a big public works program, he suggested. Mr. Miyazawa said last week that he was planning a supplemental spending package of more than $90 billion this year to jump-start the economy.
"The real impact is on the Government," Mr. Koo said. "It is going to have to act with some heavy stimulus. That's why this is generally very good."
 
Long-Term Assessment
 Masaru Hayami, the chairman of the Nissho Iwai Corporation, one of Japan's largest trading companies, and the head of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, argued in a recent essay that the pain among big exporters would largely be salutary.
Consumers will enjoy lower costs, and manufacturers will be forced to streamline their operations, Mr. Hayami said. At the same time, the costs to industry of imported goods, like raw materials, energy and parts, will decline.
"Though the strong yen may be painful for industry in the short term, this period will further strengthen industry and prove beneficial in the long term," he argued. "The stronger yen will enhance the quality of life."

Health-Care Takeover A Test For Deal Makers

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
In a takeover battle reminiscent of the 1980's, two veteran merger and acquisition gunslingers are squaring off for a showdown.
The Lifetime Corporation, a Boston-based nursing concern, said yesterday that Gleacher & Company, the boutique headed by Eric J. Gleacher, a former merger and acquisitions chief at the Morgan Stanley Group, would be its financial adviser in weighing a takeover offer by Abbey Healthcare Group Inc. 
 Abbey, a Costa Mesa, Calif., home-health-care company that is much smaller than Lifetime, is being advised by Frederick McCarthy, a one-time deal maker at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
Lifetime said yesterday that it would "explore alternatives" to Abbey's latest offer of $261.3 million, or $27.50 a share in cash and stock, raised from an initial $23.50 last month. Lifetime's board said the possibilities included selling the company or other unspecified "value enhancing" moves.
 
 
A More Reasonable Bid
 "Abbey can get in line," along with other would-be buyers, said Anthony H. Reeves, Lifetime's chairman. It was not clear who the others might be, but Mr. Reeves reiterated that keeping his company independent would benefit shareholders.
Mr. Reeves suggested two weeks ago that $30 a share might be a more reasonable opening bid.
Lifetime shares reached a 52-week high of $25.875 yesterday before closing at $25.25, up $1.75, on the New York Stock Exchange. Abbey shares rose 25 cents to close at $17.75 in over-the-counter trading.
Lifetime reported $885.6 million in 1992 sales and net income of $5.2 million after restructuring charges in what one analyst called "a tough year" for the company.
 
 
British Deal Failed
 Analysts said Lifetime might try to sell several noncore businesses to add luster to its stock. They include Office Angels, a British office-temporary agency; ASB Meditest, which tests insurance and job applicants, and a temporary nurse register for hospitals.
Michael J. Sinclair, a co-founder of Lifetime, who left in 1991 with $6.3 million in severance pay, was part of a group that negotiated to buy Office Angels. When the deal foundered in a British economy that was dogged by double-digit unemployment, Lifetime took a $43 million write-off in 1991.
Mr. Reeves of Lifetime said yesterday that Office Angels was now profitable and growing, with about $4 million in 1992 pretax operating profit. "If we restated it today, it would bring $40 million back on the balance sheet," he said.
Abbey reported net income of $10.4 million on sales of $249 million in 1992, up from $227 million the year before.
 
 
One-Stop Shopping
 Timothy M. Aitken, Abbey's president, "did a good job of turning the company around after it went public at $12.50 a share early last year," said Tom Schreuer, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company.
Helen T. O'Donnell, at Paine Webber Inc., said that Abbey's main lines are home respiratory care, medical equipment like wheelchairs, and a small home infusion business that supplies drugs and nutrition intravenously. If combined with Lifetime's vast home nursing network, she said, Abbey could offer "one-stop shopping" to large insurers and other health-care buyers.
Mr. Aitken has criticized "lucrative" executive pay packages at Lifetime. Mr. Reeves said the compensation was justified because the company had exceeded five-year financial targets set after he joined it in 1986.
But Carl Sherman, a health-care analyst at Dillon, Read & Company, said Lifetime was just "a big rent-a-nurse company."
Robert M. Mains, at the First Albany Companies, said Lifetime had staggered through several public relations "disasters." They include the failed Office Angels deal that involved Mr. Sinclair and a $5.7 million write-off for a slow-growing home infusion business.

HEADLINE: German Bank's Chief Stresses Go-Slow Policy

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 6

 BODY:
Despite the recession that has gripped Germany and most of Europe, the German central bank will continue a policy of lowering key interest rates only when it is convinced that such action will not set off inflation or jeopardize the strong position of the mark, the bank's president said today.
In an interview in his 12th-floor office at the Bundesbank's headquarters here, the official, Helmut Schlesinger, made clear that the bank would move cautiously in its policy of reducing short-term interest rates gradually.
 
A Matter of Credibility
 "We have to be careful that we do not endanger the credibility of the Bundesbank's anti-inflationary policy," he said. 
 "As we see maneuvering room opening up, we will use it," Mr. Schlesinger said, indicating that the bank did see reasons for loosening credit. "There are some indications that we'll have such maneuvering room," he said -- "for example, less rapid growth in the money supply, and a certain moderation in wage settlements."
Germany's money supply grew last year by 9.4 percent, well above the Bundesbank's targets of 3.5 to 5.5 percent, and inflation is currently at a 4.3 percent annual rate, high by German standards.
"We have moved cautiously," Mr. Schlesinger added, "but we have been able to bring rates down in small increments, using the maneuvering room we have without negative consequences for the capital markets or for the exchange rate."
His remarks were in line with a steady stream of recent pronouncements from the German bank, which, under pressure from France, Britain and the United States, has lowered the discount rate -- the rate it charges commercial banks for loans -- from 8.25 percent last September to 7.5 percent in mid-March.
 
Cross-Border Effect
 France, where the newly elected conservative Government has pledged to continue tying the franc closely to the mark in anticipation of an eventual European currency union, has had to keep its own rates higher. French money market rates now exceed 10.5 percent, compared with a range in Germany of 6.9 percent to 8.2 percent.
The new French Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, announced after his appointment last week that the Government would make the French central bank independent of political authority, like the Bundesbank is. Mr. Schlesinger welcomed that decision.
"The most important thing the French Government said concerns its own policy, not the policy of the Bundesbank," he said. "I think now, after the election and the formation of the new Government and its statement of policy, that the chances are much better than before that France can lower the interest-rate differential against the mark."
 
A Decision Not to Act
 He conceded that rate reductions in the short term would be easier for France if Germany also kept cutting its benchmark rates. "We've done it to some extent," he said. But at its most recent meeting last Thursday, the Bundesbank's central bank council, which includes the seven governors and the governors of the nine German regional banks, left key rates unchanged.
The second major German interest indicator, the Lombard rate, which acts as a ceiling on money-market rates, has remained at 9 percent since February.
Over the years, the German central bank's principal preoccupation has been with inflation, which reached such catastrophic levels in the 1920's that it destroyed the currency of the Weimar Republic, impoverishing and embittering many Germans, and contributing to Hitler's rise to power.
Such memories do not disappear. In 1990, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government borrowed heavily to pay for the costs of German reunification rather than raise taxes. This set off a degree of inflation, and the Bundesbank acted to brake it by raising short-term interest rates.
All indications are that the bank will continue its cautious approach after Mr. Schlesinger retires on his 69th birthday in September. He is expected to be succeeded then by his deputy, Hans Tietmeyer, who is 61.
In addition, the Government and the Social Democratic opposition recently agreed to impose a 7.5 percent surcharge on all taxes starting in 1995, and to make billions of marks in budget cuts to reduce a swollen deficit.
 
Too Large a Deficit
 The deficit, in German terms, is now so high -- about 4 percent of the gross national product -- that, Mr. Schlesinger said, the nation could not join in a common European currency under terms of the monetary-union treaty agreed to by leaders of European Community nations at Maastricht in December 1991.
"We haven't fulfilled the criteria now," Mr. Schlesinger said, "but the first qualifying test comes in 1996. So we have a chance to meet the criteria by then, or in 1998, which would be the next pass."
The expectation, he said, was that the Government deficit would be reduced to about 2.5 percent of the gross national product after 1995.

HEADLINE: As No. 2, an Ebullient Point Person for Education

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2

 BODY:
Madeleine M. Kunin is wasting no time mourning what could have been.
A transition team adviser who is widely believed to have narrowly lost the top spot at the Environmental Protection Agency, Ms. Kunin is now Deputy Secretary of Education, talking with confidence and conviction about her new tasks. 
 "If there was ever a time when the Federal Government can play a better role, this is it," she said recently over crepes and apple cobbler in the Department of Education's dining room. "We're almost at a second stage now. The first stage, rallying people to the cause, the previous administration did succeed in doing that. Now we have to get down to the hard work of making it happen."
Ms. Kunin's share of that work already seems formidable. She is the Education Department liaison with the White House and other agencies on many of the new Administration's major initiatives: national service, youth apprenticeship programs and welfare reform.
She talks familiarly about the elements of the department's upcoming big education bill and its general goals: to set high standards of excellence, make sure good schools are the rule and not the exception and insure that all students have an equal chance to learn.
 
Not Chafing as No. 2
 If it is hard for the 59-year-old former Governor of Vermont to be No. 2, she is not letting on. "He's a very unusual politician," she said of Richard W. Riley, the Education Secretary. "The usual sense of who gets credit for what is totally absent. I feel I'm very much part of the agenda and engaged in it."
She chooses her words with the care of a seasoned politician, but she does not seem studied or slick. Correct and measured as she is, an unmistakable passion creeps in when she talks about education. "Very often in government we fix things that have gone wrong," she said. "But the most effective across-the-board strategy for improving lives is still education, an old-fashioned idea upon which this government was founded."
Like so many immigrants of her generation, Ms. Kunin (pronounced KYOO-nin) draws her belief in the power of education from her own experience. "Education did open up all those possibilities in my life," she said. "I have to feel very strongly -- we have to do the same things for young people."
 
Fled the Holocaust
 Born in Switzerland in 1933, she, her brother and their widowed mother fled for the United States in June 1940, when Hitler's conquest of France brought him too close to their country for comfort. In Italy, she and her family fought for a place on the last ship carrying Jews that was allowed to leave Genoa, squeezing with 3,000 other passengers into 900 berths.
Relatives met them in New York, and the family settled in Forest Hills, Queens, later moving to Pittsfield, Mass.
Her mother supplemented a small inheritance from her late husband by taking in boarders and working as a seamstress and French tutor. The young Madeleine started out speaking no English, but became the first member of her family to graduate from college, with a degree in history from the University of Massachusetts.
She deftly avoided a question about whether her experience made her skeptical about the merits of bilingual education or multiculturalism. "One has to be careful not to draw parallels too quickly," she said. "As a child, I wanted to shed my immigrant past as quickly as possible. As an adult, I'm now fully appreciating its richness.
"There is a lot to be said for validating the immigrant experience. We haven't figured out in this country how to get the right balance. The challenge is to become part of the mainstream while continuing to respect the original culture. We have to be careful in protecting people's interests we don't shortchange them in the long run."
After college in Massachusetts, Ms. Kunin got a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University, but in the late 1950's, few newspapers would hire women. She said her interviewer at The New York Times, hearing she had worked as a waitress, offered her a job in the cafeteria. She finally landed a job as a reporter at The Burlington (Vt.) Free Press. A year later, she married Arthur Kunin, a doctor, and left work to raise a family. The couple have four children.
In 1970, when her husband was on sabbatical, they went to Switzerland, where she watched Swiss women fight for the right to vote. That experience with injustice, coupled with her early memories of Nazi-dominated Europe, pushed her toward politics.
"What I gleaned from that is that inaction or silence is also a decision," she said. In 1972, she was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives. Ms. Kunin was elected lieutenant governor in 1978, and after losing a bitter race for governor in 1982, she won the governorship in 1984. With the recession eroding her popularity, she decided not to seek a fourth two-year term in 1990.
As the first woman to serve as Vermont's Governor, she was often pressed to define how women govern differently, if they do. At first, she faced criticism for a style of leadership and decision-making that she thought consensual and others mistook for weak. But now, she believes, there are so many more women in government that women and men can be less self-conscious.
"As more women are there, it is more difficult to stereotype women," she said. "A lot of stereotypes don't hold, but having said that, you can still make some observations. Most definitely, we are still newcomers very often to the establishment we're entering and that does give you a greater perspective. You bring different life experiences to the process."
She is writing a political memoir that includes reflections on women and governing, to be published this year by Knopf.
 
Agenda Cost Her Support
 As Governor, she was best known for environmental measures that required land-use planning, established hazardous-waste programs and toughened standards for air and water pollution. These cost her some support in her home state when the economy turned sour, but also won her prominence as an environmentalist and put her in the running to head the environmental agency.
She also concentrated on education, including providing kindergarten for all children, raising teacher salaries, creating early childhood programs and revising state aid formulas to direct more money to poor school districts.
Because she and Mr. Riley are both former governors, she said she believes they are prepared for Federal jobs in a field in which states have the most influence because they pay most for education.
"I think I bring experience of having dealt with issues from a state perspective, a real sense of what works and what doesn't," she said. And she suggests that the Federal Government, despite its relatively limited role in education, can focus national attention on education, showcase those programs that work, offer technical assistance and help narrow the gap between rich and poor schools.
"The true exception should be the school that's in trouble," she said. "Sometimes we have accepted mediocrity. I sense that people are impatient with that and disturbed by it. We are beginning to measure ourselves against global standards, enabling the American people to accept higher standards, higher demands, and to ask that of our children."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bonds Make Up Losses From Friday Plunge

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The price of Treasury bonds jumped three-quarters of point yesterday and the yield dropped back below 7 percent. Traders said the market was proving resilient after Friday's sharp selloff on inflationary fears, but they suspected that Treasury yields were still locked in a trading range and not headed to new lows.
"We're still squarely in a trading range, in a very confined trading range," said Michael Moran, a managing director at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. 
 He said that the jump over 7 percent Friday, which came with a drop in the price of more than a point, had made the 30-year bond attractive again. But he also suggested that buying interest would probably dry up if the yield moved down several basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
The yield on the 30-year bond ended at 6.96 percent yesterday, down from 7.02 percent Monday. The price was up 25/32 , to 1021/32 . With yesterday's price rise, the 30-year bond had made up all that it lost in Friday's plunge and then some. Treasury notes were up only moderately in comparison.
Traders said that prices were moved by rumors about a major speculator buying 30-year bonds, shifts in trading strategies and talk, which seems to arise regularly, that the Treasury will issue a smaller amount of 30-year bonds in the next quarterly auction in May.
But the focus was still on the reports on producer and consumer prices that are to be issued tomorrow and Friday. Traders and investors want to see if these two reports confirm their fears that the rate of inflation will not decline this year below 1992's 3 percent rate and may, in fact, increase a little. Friday, which is Good Friday, is a bond market holiday.
Last Friday's employment report for March accentuated these concerns because it showed that the economy, while growing slower than the near 5 percent pace at the end of last year, was still moving ahead at a speed that could make it difficult for the inflation rate to fall this year.
Mr. Moran said that some people might have been feeling a little less worried about inflation yesterday. This was reflected in the fall of the yield on the 30-year bond and also on the 10-year Treasury note, which dropped to 6.07 percent from 6.11 percent on Monday. And the feeling may have been helped by a fall of a point and a half in the Commodity Research Bureau index of commodity prices, another barometer of inflaltion.
But Mr. Moran also said that in light trading during a four-day week ahead of an important economic report, it does not take much to move the market. And he said that inflationary fears "can be rekindled in a hurry with a bad number" on Thursday or Friday.
 
Report on Bond Auctions
 One of the reasons it was difficult to read too much significance into yesterday's market move was that part of it seemed to be based on a report early in the morning that the Treasury then sought to deflect.
Stone & McCarthy Research Associates reported that a Treasury staff study was going to recommend a 50 percent cut in the size of the auction of the 30-year bond, which was $9.25 billion in February, and elimination of the seven-year note auction. The details the firm reported were similar to those in a proposal made by the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee as a way to cut borrowing costs and reduce the deficit.
Ward McCarthy, a managing director of the firm, noted that his firm's report included all kinds of caveats, including the firm's opinion that the proposal was not a good idea. But it still seemed to move the market, where many traders believe ardently that a cut in available supply of a bonds or notes would result in an increase in value and price of the securities outstanding.
Prices still rose after the Treasury reiterated the comments of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who has said there would be no radical change in the mix of the Treasury borrowing and that the seven-year note would not be eliminated.
 
Debt Ceiling Rise
 On another front, there was a little sigh of relief now that Congress has approved a temporary increase in the Government debt ceiling to $4.37 trillion. While traders expected Congress to take action before today's deadline, it allowed the market to get back to its normal routine as the Treasury resumed its regular auctions.
The approval of the increase in the borrowing limit is expected to accommodate Government borrowing through Sept. 30, the end of fiscal year 1993. The delay forced the cancellation of the one-year bill auction last week and the regular weekly three-month and six-month Treasury bill auction Monday.
With the ceiling raised, the Treasury held the one-year bill auction yesterday, where the average discount rate came in at 3.24 percent, the highest since February, and scheduled the three-month and six-month bill auction for today. The Treasury also sold $17.1 billion in a 15-day cash management bills. The average discount rate was 3.07 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of one-year bills and 15-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: In an Urban Version of Horse-Trading, Owner of Daily News Stands to Gain

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
New York City is trying to persuade Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the owner of The Daily News, to build a new printing plant in the Bronx, while at the same time Mr. Zuckerman is pressing the city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for changes in his plans to develop the Coliseum site at Columbus Circle.
While Mr. Zuckerman and city officials say the printing plant and the Coliseum development are not connected, Dinkins administration officials are trying hard to persuade Mr. Zuckerman to build his plant in the city. Mr. Zuckerman has said he would be interested in building in the Harlem River Rail Yards project in the South Bronx if he can get loan guarantees and other incentives from the city. 
 The city's eagerness for The News plant presumably strengthens Mr. Zuckerman's hand in negotiations over what had been planned as an apartment, office and retail complex on the site of the Coliseum complex at Columbus Circle. Mr. Zuckerman is reported to be trying to scale back and delay the troubled project.
The two sets of talks with Mr. Zuckerman over his newspaper's planned printing plant and his planned development are made even more delicate by their timing, in advance of the mayoral campaign, and by the potential for a clash of interests between the city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the Columbus Circle site. The negotiations were reported in The New York Observer last week.
 
Link Is Denied
 City officials confirmed that they were talking with Mr. Zuckerman. But Jennifer Kimball, a spokeswoman for Barry F. Sullivan, the Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, said there is no official link between the printing plant and the Coliseum.
Mr. Zuckerman, when asked about the Coliseum and the printing plant, said, "There's really nothing yet to talk about."
Mr. Zuckerman, through Boston Properties, is under contract to buy the 3.4 acres on Columbus Circle for $338.6 million. He announced his plans for a 2.1-million-square-foot project in 1985, but in 1987, Salomon Brothers, which was to have been the main office occupant, pulled out. After widespread criticism and court challenges, Mr. Zuckerman scaled the development back twice and the price of the land went down each time; the last legal challenge to the plan ended in June 1992.
Since then, Mr. Zuckerman has been free to build, but the 16 percent vacancy rate in midtown office space has made it clear that if the project were built at the designed size now, it might not be profitable. The M.T.A. has also had the right either to schedule a final closing of the sale of the property or to collect a letter of credit worth $33.8 million, or 10 percent of the purchase price, if Mr. Zuckerman does not close on that date. Meanwhile, the Coliseum can be used only for short-term activities, and it pulls in little revenue for the M.T.A.
Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, who represents the area, said Mr. Zuckerman "not only wants to not deliver the letter of credit, but he also wants to have an extension of at least two years, retain the exclusive right to develop the plan and at the same time to change the project and make it smaller, which incidentally is what we want, but will mean less revenue for the M.T.A. and for the city.
"He also wants not to have any long-term lease arrangements for the use of the Coliseum, and to receive a financial-benefits package for the plant in the Bronx," she said. "So I think he's asking for a lot, and I think it's too much."
John Cunningham, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said talks with Mr. Zuckerman over reorganizing the Columbus Circle plan are "intensive" and added, "We expect them to conclude fairly soon."
While the M.T.A. would like to get revenue out of the Coliseum site -- either through the sale of the property or at least for temporary rentals -- its interests may be subordinated to the city's desire to keep Daily News jobs.
After The New York Times closed its printing plant in Carlstadt, N.J., earlier this year, a spokeswoman for Mr. Zuckerman said he was considering seeking to acquire the plant. But yesterday Morri Berman, a spokesman for Mr. Zuckerman, said: "The Carlstadt site is no longer under consideration."
In November, The New York Times announced that it would build a $280 million printing plant on city-owned land in College Point, Queens. The city and state granted a package of tax incentives, low-cost energy and other benefits worth a total of $29 million over the course of a 35-year lease.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
American to Be Head of Economist's Parent

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
Directors of the Economist Newspaper Ltd. will today promote Marjorie M. Scardino, currently the president of its North American operations, to chief executive of the parent company in London, the publication said yesterday.
Mrs. Scardino, 46, is the first American, as well as the first woman, to head the company that publishes the 150-year old Economist. 
 She will replace David S. Gordon, who announced his resignation on March 31 to become chief executive of Independent Television News.
A week ago, The Economist named Bill Emmott, its business affairs editor, as its 15th editor. Mr. Emmott replaces Rupert Pennant-Rea, who is leaving to become deputy governor of the Bank of England.
 
Circulation Has Jumped
 Since 1985, when Mrs. Scardino joined The Economist as head of the North American publication, circulation of the New York-based North American edition has risen to 225,000, an increase of 110 percent.
Advertising revenue for the North American edition has also risen sharply despite the industrywide slump. In 1992, the magazine ran 2,743 advertising pages, surpassing the three American news weeklies, Time, Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report.
The North American edition, which is printed in Virginia, includes the same material as other editions of The Economist distributed around the world. The only difference is the arrangement of material and, occasionally, different covers.
Mrs. Scardino is also deputy chairman of the Economist Intelligence Unit, the company's business information subsidiary, which publishes newsletters and reports about a wide range of business activity around the world. She will join the company's board when she assumes her responsibilities in London on May 4.
The Economist, which was founded in 1843, calls itself a newspaper and not a magazine because in 19th-century England many newspapers had the look of magazines. The Economist Ltd. is partly owned by the Financial Times Ltd., which in turn is owned by Pearson P.L.C.
Beth Maher, vice president of circulation and marketing for The Economist in New York, said Mrs. Scardino was among three candidates considered for the top job. The others were the worldwide advertising director, David Hanger, and the company's marketing director, Helen Alexander.
Before joining The Economist, Mrs. Scardino was a partner in a law firm in Savannah, Ga. Before that, she was publisher and founder of The Georgia Gazette, along with her husband, Albert Scardino.
Mrs. Scardino was on her way from London to New York yesterday and could not be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on Speculation About a German Rate Cut

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar bounced off recent lows in light trading yesterday as a steeper-than-expected increase in German unemployment stirred speculation that Germany was ready to cut interest rates again.
Meanwhile, the Japanese yen fell from its newest postwar high against the dollar. Market participants cited an unconfirmed rumor that the Bank of Japan intervened further to support the United States currency. They also pointed to position-squaring ahead of the Good Friday holiday. 
 Gold retreated for the second consecutive day. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.60 an ounce to close at $337.90. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $337.50 an ounce, also off $1.60.
 
 
Western German Jobless
 The German Government reported that the number of jobless in western Germany jumped by 56,000 in March, higher than market expectations. Other figures showed western German industrial output falling a worse-than-expected 2.2 percent in February.
The data reignited talk that Germany's central bank was preparing to cut interest rates from current high levels as a way to stimulate the economy. Also stirring speculation was a meeting this week between Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Prime Minister John Major of Britain.
"Any time the two get together you have to think about German rate cuts," Jack Stapleton, senior corporate dealer at Standard Chartered Bank, said.
The American currency would benefit from lower German rates because they would make dollar-denominated investments seem more attractive.
 
 
Gain in Tokyo
 The dollar closed in Tokyo at 114.28 yen, up 0.45 yen from Monday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 113.95 yen. By 4 P.M. in New York, the dollar was quoted at 113.85 yen, up from its postwar low of 113.70 reached late Monday.
The dollar also rose against the British pound. In London, sterling fell to $1.5140, from $1.5310 late Monday. By afternoon in New York, the pound fetched $1.5150, less than late Monday's 1.5210.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, were: 1.6110 German marks, up from 1.5950; 1.4875 Swiss francs, up from 1.4770; 5.4580 French francs, up from 5.4125; 1,591.00 Italian lire, up from 1,586.00, and $1.2585 (Canadian), down from $1.2623 (Canadian).

HEADLINE: The Yields at Banks Show a Slight Decline

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Average yields at banks across the nation on money market accounts and certificates of deposit for the week beginning today are down slightly from the previous reporting period and a little lower than those offered in the New York market.
Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, said deposit yields were down despite inflationary pressures indicated in the most recent economic numbers. 
 "Even as we enter into April, traditonally a heavy rollover month for certificates of deposit, we see little evidence that banks are doing much to stem any outflow of deposits or much promoting to capture I.R.A. money," he said. "They will likely lose some depositors to stocks and bonds."
The Treasury's three- and six-month bill auction was postponed this week from its usual Monday and was rescheduled for today. The auction is often regarded as a harbinger of rate changes at banks. Yesterday, the Government auctioned a one-year bill whose sale had been postponed on Thursday because Congress had failed to pass legislation to increase the Federal debt ceiling.
Yesterday's 52-week bill auction produced an average rate of 3.24 percent, up sharply from last month. But the rate at today's three- and six-month auction is expected to slip, since most of the upward movement in interest rates recently has been in the longer maturities.
In the latest survey by The Bank Rate Monitor, weaknesses in yields were evident in commercial bank money market accounts, where the average yield slipped a basis point, to 2.36 percent, and in the savings banks' six-month certificates of deposit, which dropped 3 basis points, to 3.05 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The Chase Manhattan Bank, again among the banks making the sharpest adjustment in deposit yields, raised the yield on its three-month certificate of deposit by 10 basis points, to 2.38 percent. Home Savings of America dropped the average yield on its money market account by 5 basis points, to 2.63 percent, while Anchor Savings lowered its six-month certificate by a large 35 basis points, to 3.05 percent.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Buying Sallie Mae is a bet that Congress won't dismantle it

BYLINE: By Leslie Wayne

 BODY:
It's hardly a stock for the faint of heart, but several analysts are, oh-so-tentatively, looking favorably at the shares of the Student Loan Marketing Association, better known as Sallie Mae.
Sallie Mae's shares have been on a roller-coaster ride of late -- mostly down. "I've aged two years in the last two months," said Gary Gordon, an analyst at Paine Webber. Added David Hochstim, an analyst at Bear, Stearns, "This is the stock that gave me the flu." 
 No wonder. On Feb. 1, Sallie Mae was at $74 a share. Yesterday, it closed at $46.75, up 62.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.
Such free falls aside, some analysts say Sallie Mae may be a stock for hardy investors willing to take a chance on the whims of Washington and on future interest rates.
What's behind the drop in Sallie Mae is a concern that the Government may phase out Sallie Mae entirely. Founded in 1972 to help finance higher education, Sallie Mae is a Government-sponsored enterprise that buys student loans from banks. Currently, it has about $24 billion in its loan portfolio. In 1992, Sallie Mae earned $393.9 million, an increase of 14 percent. The company has also gained a reputation for spending and fancy offices. Its chief executive, Lawrence A. Hough, earns $1.1 million, along with stock options and retirement perks. These extras were estimated to add up to $1 million in 1991.
Sallie Mae has come under fire, especially from the Clinton Administration, which has proposed phasing it out by 1997. The Administration bases this view on a study by the General Accounting Office that $1.3 billion a year could be saved by replacing Sallie Mae with a program of direct Government loans from colleges to students. But other studies have questioned the saving and raised doubts about the ability of the Government to run the loan program more efficiently than the private sector.
Analysts have said buying Sallie Mae is like buying an option -- taking a chance Congress will retain the program. They estimate the "phase-out" value of Sallie Mae at around $50 a share. And if the program is kept -- Sallie Mae does have powerful allies on Capitol Hill -- the potential is significant. Low interest rates have contributed to Sallie Mae's strong financial performance of late, making its cost of funds significantly lower than what student borrowers pay to retire loans. If low rates continue, so may Sallie Mae's profit growth.
Analysts believe that Congress, once it examines the numbers and issues involved, will decide to retain Sallie Mae. "I'm sticking with buy," Mr. Hochstim of Bear, Stearns said. "I'm optimistically and naively believing that Congress and the Administration will behave rationally and not phase in direct loans."
The Sallie Mae bulls are encouraged by a recent Congressional Research Office report saying that no money would be saved by eliminating Sallie Mae and that administrative costs would be high under Government management. Although universities have not weighed in on the subject yet, analysts feel they may look dimly at anything that could stick them with potential student loan losses and high administrative costs.
Peter Treadway of Smith Barney believes the stock is fairly priced at current levels. "Obviously it's not for widows and orphans," he said, adding that even if direct lending were passed, Sallie Mae might remain as a loan servicer.
The proposed phase-out of Sallie Mae has already been taken up in the House, but there will be much more politicking before the final Clinton budget package -- with or without the Sallie Mae phase-out -- emerges this summer. For Sallie Mae shareholders, that means the roller-coaster ride will continue.

HEADLINE: Albany Allocates Funds For Historical Society

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
The New York State Legislature has approved a $6.3 million appropriation for the New-York Historical Society, the first step in a plan to rescue that beleaguered institution.
The money, part of the state budget package approved by the Legislature on Monday, is contingent on several factors, one of which is an equal contribution from New York City. 
 "It's do-able," said Barbara J. Fife, New York City's Deputy Mayor for Planning and Development, when asked if the city would match the sum. "It's a question of how we spend our money, but I would think the city will recognize this as a new need."
The legislation also makes the state's contribution dependent on the historical society's submitting an acceptable "financial stabilization and development plan describing the steps it will take to achieve financial self-sufficiency, protection of its libraries and collections and expansion of its services to the public."
Of the state's $6.3 million appropriation, $5 million is for capital improvements, chiefly repairs to the roof of the society's landmark building at Central Park West and 77th Street. An additional $1.3 million is for operating expenses through the end of fiscal 1994.
The plan to save the financially troubled society, drawn up last month by a special advisory committee and lobbied for in both Albany and New York City by officers of the society, includes the development of real estate and the selling of enough artworks and other materials to build a $40 million endowment for the institution.
Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat and a member of the Standing Committee on Tourism, Arts and Sports Development, said he would use a public hearing on Thursday to question the society's plan to sell items from its collecton. The hearing is scheduled for 10:30 A.M. in the Assembly Hearing Room of the New York State Office Building at 270 Broadway, in lower Manhattan.
The society has narrowly survived two close brushes with bankruptcy over the past four years. As a result of the most recent financial crisis, numerous staff members have been dismissed, the art galleries have been closed and the library -- given a temporary reprieve when the trustees reached into their own pockets last month -- remains open only from Wednesdays to Fridays.
Wilbur L. Ross, the chairman of the society's advisory committee, called the State Legislature's appropriation "wonderful."
"We are extremely grateful," he said.

HEADLINE: Quiet Revolution in Canadian Wine

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE, Ontario

 BODY:
CANADIAN wine was almost an oxymoron until a few years back.
A wine industry had been active since the mid-19th century but was best known for something called Baby Duck, a sweet, fizzy concoction that tasted like ginger ale with a kick and made the rounds surreptitiously at high school proms. 
 Some other products were of the "block and tackle" variety, so named after a member of the Ontario Legislature described their effects: "You drink a bottle, walk a block, and you can tackle just about anyone."
Now, after a quiet viticultural revolution in which lesser quality grapes more suitable for juice and jam have been displaced by great thoroughbreds like chardonnay, riesling and pinot noir, Canadian wine is suddenly winning international prizes, is being reviewed in the wine press and is being sold in restaurants in New York, Paris and Tokyo.
Taking a leaf from France and its Appelation d'Origine Controlee, producers here have established their own strict guidelines. A Vintners Quality Alliance sticker on a bottle guarantees that all of the grapes are from a specific area and that a panel of wine makers and sommeliers have attested to the wine's quality.
Although less than 10 percent of the country's production merits the V.Q.A. label, at some wineries the figure is as high as 40 percent, and the influence of the system is growing. Sales of V.Q.A. wines nearly doubled last year, despite the recession and increased competition from freer trade with the United States and the rest of the world.
Peter Gamble, the executive director of the Vintners Quality Alliance and a former wine maker himself, said that to enforce the new quality standards, lesser-quality grapes were actually outlawed for wine making five years ago. "It's been an astounding transition," he said.
The Wine Spectator, one of the most influential trade journals, published a special report last June entitled "Ontario Wines Come In From the Cold." Thomas Matthews, The Spectator's New York bureau chief, wrote that Ontario's wine makers, who account for 90 percent of Canada's production, were taking advantage of a favorable climactic niche to produce "racy wines that can achieve elegance and breed."
"As an emerging wine area, Ontario is quite promising," he said in an interview earlier this year.
The largest part of Ontario's wines come from the Niagara peninsula, which at 43 degrees north latitude is more southerly than all the wine regions of France, but roughly the same latitude as Northern California and the Chianti region of Italy.
The Niagara peninsula, which stretches between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, has two features that grapes seem to like: an escarpment or ridge to the south that is a barrier against disruptive continental winds, and Lake Ontario to the north, which moderates temperatures.
Among the viticultural revolutionaries are people like Donald Ziraldo, 44, a agriculture graduate of the University of Guelph in Ontario, and Karl Kaiser, 51, who started learning his wine making at age 13 in the vineyards of a Cistercian monastery in his native Austria.
They teamed up to buy a small vineyard in the early 1970's and, ignoring expert advice, replaced the lesser-quality native labrusca grapes with pinot noirs, rieslings and chardonnays.
"We were determined to show that Ontario had the proper climate and soil to become a credible wine region," Mr. Ziraldo said earlier this year.
In 1975, their newly formed Inniskillin winery -- its name is derived from the Inniskilling Fusiliers, a famous Irish regiment in the Niagara region during the War of 1812 -- received the first Ontario Wine License granted since 1929.
Now Inniskillin owns 60 acres of vineyards, produces 120,000 cases a year and plans $1.7 million in general improvements. Its wines are available across Canada as well as in the United States, Britain, France, Denmark, Japan and Hong Kong.
Ice wine, a sweet dessert wine made of grapes left to freeze on the vine, is a specialty of Inniskillin and most other Niagara wineries. Inniskillin's ice wine won the Grand Prix d'Honneur in the June 1991 Vin Expo competition in Bordeaux, a feat for any winery, let alone one from Canada.

HEADLINE: Sex and Consequences

 BODY:
A country with one of the world's highest standards of living is not a country in which one expects to find a remarkable number of people afflicted with sexually transmitted diseases. But according to a study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, 56 million Americans are infected with them, and at least one of every four can expect to be.
Such age-old scourges as gonorrhea and syphilis do significant damage, but the widest impact comes from incurable viral diseases, which get far less public health attention. Some 31 million Americans are believed to have genital herpes, while 24 to 40 million are infected with the virus that causes genital warts. 
 Poverty, ignorance and the attendant lack of medical care are partly responsible for the rising rates of sexually transmitted disease; so is the tragic trade of sex for drugs. But a major reason so many Americans are prey to S.T.D.'s, as they are called, is that they are Americans. Which is to say: They initiate sexual intercourse early, marry late and divorce often. During the periods when they're not married, and sometimes when they are, many will have several sexual partners (adult Americans average seven over a lifetime) and will be inconsistent in their use of condoms.
Although public health programs concentrate on adult males, women and teen-agers are hardest hit. Two-thirds of those who contract S.T.D.'s are under 25; a fourth of them are teen-agers. Women are more susceptible to infection and thus more apt to suffer the consequences -- chronic infection, infertility, spontaneous abortions, damaged babies -- for life. Condom carelessness is particularly risky for women, to whom these diseases are easy to transmit and in whom they're difficult to diagnose. Just one act of unprotected intercourse with an infected partner, and a woman has a 50 percent likelihood of contracting gonorrhea.
The classic venereal diseases, syphilis and gonorrhea, are most prevalent among the poor, but chlamydia, which infects far more Americans each year, cuts across the economic spectrum. Often it causes pelvic inflammatory disease, which in turn can lead to ectopic pregnancy, infertility and chronic pelvic pain. And if the emotional cost of a venereal disease is high, so is the price of a cure or semi-cure. In 1990 the costs of treating pelvic inflammatory disease and related ectopic pregnancies and infertility added up to $4.2 billion.
Perhaps it is the focus on AIDS that has made Americans forget about their vulnerability to other venereal diseases. But lack of information played a part, too. Because medical emphasis has been on treatment rather than prevention, people may not realize that some of the ailments are literally incurable.
Public health programs need to be redirected -- to help women and teen-agers and to target diseases that are currently neglected but afflict millions of Americans. Even more important, the nation needs more prevention and education programs to persuade people to avoid risky sexual encounters and use condoms. To reduce the risk is the most cost-effective way to cut the disease rate. For incurable viral diseases, prevention is the only approach that can work.
Americans, as this country learned too late to prevent many deaths, can't afford to be ignorant about AIDS. They can't afford to be ignorant about other S.T.D.'s either.
